You can use it to cook food, purify water and to sterilize bandages. It can scare away dangerous animals and its smoke can keep flying insects at bay. It is also an important way to signal for help.\n\n\nFireplace\n\nBefore you can begin to build your fire, select your fire location. Select it with care, a good fire location is important. First choose a site that is sheltered and protected from the wind and has a supply of wood or other fuel available. \n\nThere should be nothing nearby that could catch fire, such as dry vegetation. Make sure your fire doesn''t get out of control. Safety is an essential consideration. Clear any debris away and start the fire on solid ground or on a layer of stones or on a flat shale rock. This will eliminate the possibility of a ground fire and leave no trace of the fire on the ground, except soot stones. \n\n\nFire material\n\nTo make a fire, you need to build it up gradually, beginning with small pieces of wood, then progressing to larger pieces as the fire gets going. You can grade your fire material intotinder, kindling, and fuel.\n\n\nTinder\n\nYou will need some material that ignites very easily to start a fire. Good tinder is dry material that takes only a spark to ignite. The tinder must be absolutely dry. There are a number of things you can use for tinder, paper, leaves, grass, bark and resin. You will find resin in spruce and pine trees. Resin will burn even if it is wet.\n\nUse your knife to turn dry sticks and pieces of bark into powdery tinder. Tinder is the most important part of your fire, so prepare it well. If you have found resin, rub it on small twigs and sticks. Have plenty of tinder on hand so your fire will not go out. Collect tinder before you need it. Put tinder in your pocket or backpack, so you always have it handy.\n\nLearn how to light a fire with matches, or to be more precise, light your tinder. Alternatively, why not learn how to make a fire with a flint striker.\n\n\nKindling\n\nKindling is readily combustible material that you add to the burning tinder. Small dry twigs and sticks are best. They should easily light when placed on a small flame. The dead branches on the undersides of trees provide excellent kindling, and they are usually dry, even if it has rained for weeks.\n\n\nFuel\n\nOnce your fire is established, you can add larger pieces offirewood. Make sure your firewood is as dry as possible. Look for dead trees, they are usually a good source of dry firewood.\n\n\nRemember\n\nNever leave a campfire unattended. Make sure your fire is completely out before leaving camp. Check it at least twice.\n\n[url=http://www.postimage.org/][img]http://img6.imageshack.us/img6/6743/36840059.jpg[/img][/url]\n\n\n\n\n\n[url=http://www.postimage.org/image.php?v=PqbqYrJ][img]http://img13.imageshack.us/img13/8521/10102308.th.jpg[/img][/url]\n\n[url=http://www.postimage.org/image.php?v=Pqbr4W9][img]http://img6.imageshack.us/img6/8889/57559142.th.jpg[/img][/url]\n\n[url=http://www.postimage.org/image.php?v=aV16_tO0][img]http://img13.imageshack.us/img13/7196/99660933.th.jpg[/img][/url]\n\n[url=http://www.postimage.org/image.php?v=Pqbr9Vr][img]http://img43.imageshack.us/img43/1290/20513452.th.jpg[/img][/url]', 0, 1, '203.82.55.18', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 1858, 49227),

This results in a quicker hit by 7.62x25 and greater range.\n\nThirdly, 7.62x25 has a greater panitration as compared to 9mm due to sleaker, faster and harder projectile. 7.62x25 has a projectile from 85 to 90 grains on the other hand 9mm has projectiles ranging from 115 to 147 grains.\n\nFinally, the overall killing capability.

A good shelter must protect you from the elements and be comfortable enough for resting and sleeping. Most people cannot survive unprotected from rough weather for more than a few hours. \n\n[b]Shelter site[/b]\n\nIf possible choose ground:\n\n- that is dry, well drained and reasonably flat.\n\n- that is a comfortable distance to water and has a supply of firewood.\n\n- that has building materials for your shelter.\n\n- that provides protection against strong winds.\n\nIf you are lost and people are looking for you, make sure your shelter site is easy to be seen and found by search and rescue teams.\n\n[u][b]Unsuitable shelter sites:[/b][/u]\n\n- A site too close to water may lead you to be troubled by insects.\n\n- Rivers presents a constant threat to safety. Heavy rainfall in nearby hills can easily create flash floods. Avoid dry riverbeds.\n\n- Avoid loose rocks, dead trees or other natural growth that could fall on your shelter.\n\n- Low ground, such as ravines and narrow valleys, couldbe damp and collect the heavy cold air at night and are therefore be colder than the surrounding high ground. On the other hand, the tops of mountains are exposed to higher winds. The best area to seek shelter is somewhere in between.\n\n[b]Survival shelters[/b]\n\nIf you have added a shelter tarp, an emergency blanket or an extra poncho to your gear, you are almost done with your shelter building. However, if you lack equipment, local conditions and materials will determine the type of wilderness shelter you build.\n\n[b]Natural cover[/b]\n\nLook for natural formations that could provide shelter. Examples include caves, rocky crevices and large trees with low-hanging limbs. If no natural formation is available to provide shelter, you will need to build your own.\n\n[b]Shelters made of natural materials[/b]\n\nMake your shelter just large enough to accommodate you, especially in cold climates, because you are going to have to heat it. One of the best wilderness shelters is called the "debris hut".

Boar fell in my feet & was dead. I was sweat even in chilling weather of December.\nMy uncle Col.Ikram, My Nephew Faizan, Raja Saqib & other team members rushed towards the scene as they hear 3 consecutive pistol shots.

Length of barrel - the longest = the furthest, which is why rifles are capable of greater range with same caliber loads.\n\n2. Load Type - .22 loads are available in a variety of loads viz a viz., High Velocity, Hollow Points, Sub-sonic, Super-sonic, Lead and Copper-plated. All these have a bearing on the muzzle velocity you achieve as well as the energy on impact. There is a trade-off between velocity and energy on impact ofcourse. Explanation: Hollow-points have higher energy on impact i.e., stopping power i.e., the bullet expands on impact whereas, the round-points simply go through. Which in other words means, that there is direct correlation between velocity and range.\n\nThe load type is also very important from another aspect. A High velocity bullet experiences breaking sound barrier two times - firstly soon after it leaves the muzzle and another when it decelerates below 1000 fps and at both these times, the bullet changes its course. That is why, if your target is around 100 yards away, it is suggested that to get accuracy, you do not use High-Velocity or Super-sonic rounds. Standard, copper-plated loads would do fine. \n\n.22 caliber is known to have reached over 800 yards easily, but if you are asking of LETHAL range, then it is generally believed that depending on your placement, a .22 caliber can be lethal till 130-150 yards if shot from a rifle, 100 yards if from carbine and 50 yards if from a pistol.\n\n\n\nThis article below written by someone who has significantly more knowledge about Effective Range of .22 Caliber will explain further. This guy achieved 300 yards using a rifle:\n\n[url]http://www.snipershide.com/forum/ubbthreads.php?ubb=showflat&Number=504301&fpart=1[/url]\n\n\nTherefore, it depends on which GSG 5 you are going for. The GSG 5 comes in three variants - Rifle, Pistol and Compact Pistol. Mind you, the Pistol version has a barrel length longer than most pistols, so the lethal range would be near to carbine i.e., 100 yards or 300 feet.\n\n\nSenior members are requested to correct me where necessary.\n\n\nFOR PRICES: I would myself like to know the rates of following .22 loads:\n\n1. CCI Minimags HV\n\n2. Aguila Interceptor 40 grain\n\n3. Remington Viper\n\n4. Winchester HV SuperX\n\n5. CCI Segmented HP HV\n\n6.

Firstly, 50 metres is usually extreme range for most spring powered (low and medium powered airguns). I would not attempt shooting birds at 50 metres with a Chinese or local airgun, as the pellet would not have enough power to kill humanely at that range. \n\nPlease keep in mind that to shoot accurately and kill cleanly, and to do both with consistency, at ranges beyond 30 metres, you need a powerful gun (at least 16lbfts at the muzzle), and you need a relatively mid-weight to heavy weight pellet. Light weight pellets decelarate quite quickly and do not retain enough energy to make a clean kill. Furthermore,they are also more prone to wind deflection than their heavier cousins.\n\nHaving said that, I would also likem to emphasise, that in airguns, the gun itself, and not the pellet is the powerplant, so be very careful, when you read velocity and energy tables for pellets.

(whole scheme is quiet similar to Baikal of Russia, since China to some extent still operates as the old communist USSR).\n\nNorinco used to buy CF98 from this company under the designation Norinco NP42 and Norinco CF98 (two versions for export diversification, otherwise absolutely same thing), stamp their logo on it and export it (similar to Baikal, its just an export name). however after the imposition of export embargo on Norinco (its name popped up in an illegal arms deal), many export oriented companies were created (on similar setup such as norinco and baikal) to work around the embargo and Entercon was one of them. just like norinco, its just an export name. the company (CHANG-FENG MACHINE MANUFACTURING) that designed the CF98 is still the only company engaged in its production.\n\nRegards', 0, 1, '58.65.188.215', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 288, 50375),

These cartridges consisted of a paper cylinder or cone containing the bullet, gunpowder, and, in some cases, a primer or a lubricating and anti-fouling agent. The term combustible cartridges is applied to those paper cartridges that use paper treated with oxidizers to allow them to burn completely upon ignition.\nPaper cartridges were often coated in beeswax, lard, or tallow, which served a number of purposes. It provided some degree of water resistance, it lubricated the paper-wrapped bullet as it was pushed down the bore, and it melted upon firing to mix with the powder residue and make the resulting fouling easier to remove. Since the standard procedure for loading a musket or rifled musket involved biting open the cartridge, this can cause problems for those with strict dietary restrictions. The Sepoy soldiers in the employ of the British in India, for example, were largely Hindu, who were forbidden to eat beef, or Muslim, who were forbidden to eat pork.

Saw it happen in front of me.. a handsome young man in his early 20s.. lying in a pool of blood.. I have never resisted armed assailants myself.[/quote]\n\nLet us not forget that the Texans actually lost at the Alamo.  They may have fought to the death, but they all died.\n\nConcerning the seriousness of the subject; death is a very real, very possible result when we choose to act in a robbery, kidnapping, or murder.  We should start, if we do start, with the expectation that we will win; envisioning the best possible outcome.  Positive thinking tends to lead to positive results.  However, we would be mentally ill if we did not recognize that things can go bad very quickly.\n\nNot all men are equipped to physically resist an attacker.  It may be that the attacker is simply too much larger, stronger and younger than the victim.  It could be the result of age or infirmary.  This the very reason some carry guns- to give themselves the means to defend themselves against young helathy thugs.\n\n@KageFox:  I understand what the quote is alluding to, but I prefer, "the only way to stop a killer is to be a better killer."  Personally I don''t want to adopt the moniker, "monster." (I know you didn''t attempt to label anyone that way, it was intelletual discussion)  \n\nI maintain my humanity when I act "inhumanely" (killing, even viciously killing another) in the pursuit or saving an innocent, even if that innocent is me.  I am willing to be a better killer than the amateur killer before me.  Once I am done destroying him, I will continue to be the non-monster I am.  I will remain law-abiding, home-providing, loving-husband, parenting-father that I am.  \n\nI think that your quote correctly identifies the need to be more vicious than the robber.  It reminds me of a line from "The Untouchables," with Sean Connery and Kevin Costner, "If he pulls a knife, you pull a gun.  If he sends one of yours to the hospital, you send one of his to the morgue."  \n\nWhat I observed in the videos were robbers who threatened but appeared unwilling to harm.  I can''t say for sure, there may be cultural differences at play, but when some flashes a gun and then tucks it away I do not believe they are as committed to doing me harm as the thug who keeps the gun pointed at me.  I believe that universal.  The person who is unwilling to do harm at the drop of hat is at a disadvantage to the person who is.  \n\nLikewise, the person who is willing to be more vicious (gouge out an ear, bite off a nose, slam a head into the wall with both hands), has the advantage over the man who will not.\n\nI read a thread elsewhere which referenced, "your gun is not a talisman, it does not ward off evil.  Nor is like a cross to vampires- just because you display it doesn''t mean they will flee back into the night.  It is a tool, it only works if you know how to use, are willing to use it, and finally- use it well."  That author was correct.\n\nWe had a scrappy little martial artists on the Sheriff''s department where I was a deputy.  He was a bad-ass jujitsuist.  If you fought his fight, you lost.  One day we were sparring and when he went for my legs I struck him down to the ground with blows to the upper back and mimicked a kick to his head.  It would have ended the bout.  He may not have truly gone for my legs in a real LE encounter, but maybe he would have.  The lesson was understood by all including him.  He may have had great trainging and skill, but simply, "I ain''t playing this game," shove to the ground followed by a vicious kick to the head with steel toed boots and all that skill did not matter.  \n\nWill matters.', 0, 1, '70.249.40.98', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 311, 50640),

If it is possible and feasible, I''ll shoot at the BGs when they are making an exit from the crime scene.

I''ll make sure the guy sitting at 15 hears a few shots that I''m firing. I''ll continue firing till the time police get to the scene. This is precisely what was done by me last year.

A more sporting shoot is to give the bird a chance...it should be flying shots. Hunting off a jeep with a shot gun for birds (say sand grouse, partridges etc) is kind of un sportsmanlike--in local parlance they call it jeeping.\n\nYou should try getting sand grouse early morning or late evening when they are flying into their water hole---you strategically place the morchas around the water hole--wait for the birds to come in and get your shot. they come in at amzing speeds making the shoot tougher.

Frankly speaking, we as sport loving people are naturally inclined to be worried about the game''s future, and genuine shotgunning on gamebirds does very minimal damage as compared to major hazards mentioned above.\r\n\r\nBut, these updates on Wildlife Act come every year; the amendment in THE ACT was only made in 2007 October which I pasted; after that every year different updates vide notifications about hares, pigeons, doves etc have come from time to time, and changed yearly as per ground figures of wildlife (if I am not wrong). IT WOULD BE A NICE IDEA IF THIS THREAD IS USED TO INFO ABOUT LATEST UPDATES (OR AMENDMENTS IF ANY) FROM TIME TO TIME TO KEEP ALL MEMBERS INFORMED.\r\n\r\nYou see, there is a much different trend in the last few years. Local people have started poaching excessively with baits/nets/lures for meat or illegal trade. And the onus of that has fallen on shikaris which is definitely not just. That gets reflected in these wildlife act amendments and updates too. I think the whole system needs re-thinking. Pls correct me if I am wrong.[/quote]', 1, 0, '182.177.118.137', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

However, the bikes situation I described can only be implemented when the bike (or bikes) stop in front of you, completely blocks your path and the rider dismounts. Since this situation will most probably be happening in an open, low-population area, I think it''s safe to assume that you''re facing a BG. In this particular scenario (bike blocks my path in an empty area, rider dismounts and starts to walk towards me), I''ll immediately gun the engine, and if I run the bastard over then all the better.\n\nAs for your comments on the HD situation, yes I agree that the logical step would be to bunker down and call for back up. The reason I advocate a more pro-active approach is simply because it''s usually the last thing a BG expects, and that element of surprise goes a long way in evening the odds. About 10 years back 3 men sneaked into our house in the middle of the night. My father heard a slight noise, pulled out his weapon (an old Webley .38 revolver) and proceeded to shoot them.

Yes, it''s a [B]VERY[/B] dangerous tactic and things could have gotten [B]VERY[/B] hairy, but I strongly believe that no man has the right violate the sanctity of my home or threaten to harm my loved ones.

An adult can survive only a few days without water, but many weeks without food.\n\n[b]Dehydration[/b]\n\nAbout 3/4 of the human body is water. Your body loses 0.5-1 gallon (2-3 liters) of water each day through sweating and urination, more if you are hot, exerting a lot of energy or are at high altitudes. This water must be replaced. Therefore, drink often.\n\nFinding water is critical, if not, dehydration will inevitably occur. The symptoms you will face are thirst, weakness, decreased mental capacity, nausea, no appetite and dark colored urine. \n\nTo prevent water loss, rest, keep cool, stay in the shade, and seek shelter. Do not wait until you run out of water before you look for more. Your body doesn''t only get water from drinking water. Lots of foods contain water, good examples are fruit and vegetables, and any non-water fluid. However, avoid fatty foods, caffeinated beverages and alcohol as they trigger digestion to use up the fluids.\n\n[u][b]Waterborne contaminants[/b][/u]\n\nIn most parts of the world, surface water is seldom pure. There are five basic waterborne contaminants: turbidity, toxic chemicals, bacteria, viruses and parasitic worms.\n\nTurbidity is a measure of the cloudiness of the water. Dangerous and toxic chemicals include, among others, pesticides, herbicides and fertilizers from agricultural land. Bacteria and viruses can cause very serious illnesses, such as diarrhea and dysentery.\n\nA common parasite is Giardia lamblia. It is found worldwide and within every region of the United States and has become recognized as one of the most common causes of waterborne diseases. Giardia lamblia causes diarrhea, which leads to dehydration.\n\n[b]Water purification[/b]\n\nThere are three ways to treat suspected water: filtration, boiling and chemical waterpurification. \n\n· Filtering water doesn''t purify it, but it reduces particles and sediment and makes the water taste better. Learn how to make a water filter.\n\n· Boiling is the most certain way of killing all microorganisms. However, boiling will NOT neutralize chemical pollutants. \n\n· To purify water with chemicals, use water purification tablets that should be included in your survival kit.\n\n\nPurification filters\n\nThere are microbial purification filters available that not only removes parasites as Giardia, but also kill waterborne bacteria and viruses. This type of water purifier filter makes your water even safer.', 0, 1, '203.82.55.18', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 1858, 50891),

(2) he has a gun, or knife, or any thing at all which may harm a human being if used voilently. (3) he has any tool which may be helpful to break a lock, rope to climb a wall, even pins which they use to open windows or door locks. anything at all which may help a person to get him in a house thru various techniques. see? 3 main things which will help you out thru investigations, intruder''s presence in your house, any thing which may be used as a weapon, any tool which may be used for night breaking.  any point from those 3 will help you out thru investigation,   one more thing i must mention here, its always good to give a warning and still if danger is felt, we have to do what we have to do. let me clarify please, we are not talking about definitely killing or injuring anyone, we are talking about defending our lives or property, our pride. giving a warning by screaming , firing off couple of shots in air or shooting straight to the intruder, everying thing comes in defence.

Of course you can go on shooting with no damage apparently to the barrel from out side but the bore of the rifle barrel experiences erosion in the chamber throat ruining the accuracy of an otherwise fine rifle.\nIn the Military type ARs or  AKs you  do not have to worry much as the bores are chrome lined and resist erosion better than steel, also these are not in the accuracy category to lose much. One can go on blazing but should not be without any purpose. If one shoots deliberately and with a purpose  one can not over heat even an auto rifle barrel.\n\nOf course Machine guns used to have water cooling on both sides but with improved metallurgy and reduced dependence  on Machine gun fire and change ability of barrels the water cooling was done away with .\nAll Light  Machine Guns and Medium Machine Guns have spare barrels with them and being a crew served weapon it is the duty of the No 2 to change barrels with thick gloves to avoid burning hands, as the LMG and the MG barrels actually glow red at night. The barrels are changed as they get so hot the range and accuracy gets seriously effected. this occurs during a fire fight in operations not during training.  I want to add that in case of a fine hunting rifle it should not be fired repeatedly that is if you fire only three to four rounds of a 7mm Mag or a 300 mag   in one minute you must allow it to cool for about three minutes. These are precision weapons not meant for declaring a war, their accuracy will be ruined if these are fired more than ten times in two minutes. From minute of angle rifles these will turn into 3 0r 4 minute of  angle rifles even if mistreated like this once only.\n\nThe .308 or a 7x57 are slightly less sensitive the 270 is more sensitive due to smaller bore and bigger case volume.\n\nThe Machine guns are considered good if these can group inside 12 inches at a 100yds when fired single shot. \n\nIt is the ACCURACY which is ruined nothing else Please. In competition shooting the 308 win and 6mm are used  with bull barrels and heavier actions. Sometimes heavier cals are also used but the matches are slow fire, even the rapid events one fires 5 rds in 3 minutes and then a break for scoring which means the rifles  cool in between. \n\nA sniper will seldom fire more than two rds in a minute  unless in operations,  just to save his accuracy, even when fired in this slow manner the accuracy life of a sniper rifle barrel is just about 2500 rds, the 7mm Mag about 1000 rds the weatherby 270 under 500 rds. The 270 winchester 1200 to 1500 rds ( all depends on several factors like cleaning and breaking in and the ammo used). We are talking accuracy, otherwise these will keep shooting but loss of accuracy will increase rapidly.\n    \nIn case of shot guns while shooting quail sometimes the barrels do get  hot but there is no damage except discomfort on touching.In the trap event two rds are fired in half a second but then you wait for the other five shooters to take their turn before you shoot again.  A shotgun barrel cannot be damaged in any manner by continous shooting due to a very small amount of powder used and the pressure being six times less than that of a rifle , no rifling and little bore friction .\n\nThe rate or fire of anti aircraft guns and aircraft canon is  so high that even though they fire very short bursts  the barrels have to be changed  frequently  < these are changed for good>  The rate of fire is, by the way between 2000 to 6000 rds per minute these guns eat the barrels', 0, 1, '119.154.52.250', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 1734, 50960),

However, he confirmed that all those licences which had been issued on the basis of fake bank receipts, forged signatures and fictitious stamps would be quashed forthwith after due investigations. \n\nAsked about the alleged involvement of three sections officers in the scam, Mr Mazari said since the NA committee was investigating the issue, he was not in position to give any official comment. \n\nSources close to investigations told Dawn that relentless efforts were being made to save the skin of some big players involved in the scam at the cost of ministry officials.', 0, 1, '202.147.38.96', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 536, 51172),

Now i can go on and on about Glock being better or Beretta being better. People who are giving opinion above, actually which brand do they own. Which brand have they tortured enough to know about its reliability. Which brand fits their hand and makes them feel like it was built for their hand only.\nGuys please stop talking about theory and lets for once start a practical discussion. I am bored of all the theories. I know both brands are owned by members on this forum so lets get some practical experience from them.\nI have used Beretta 92FS and shot abour 100 rounds from it in one go. I have also used Glock 26 and never could fire more than 20 rounds in one go. I get tired with Glock. I have yet to use my Glock 19 and dont know what the results will be.

I remember almost 10 years back, there was a break in at our home when we were out of the city, a lot of valuables were stolen. My father decided to get my grandfather''s old Webley .38 out of storage and to start using it as a HD weapon. Sure enough, hardly a week after the first burglary, the bloody thieves decided to try their luck again. This time, however, my father emptied the gun straight at them, all 6 rounds. Of the 3 thieves who had broken in, one was tapped in the shoulder (but managed to get away) and another one shot in leg (was caught and handed over to the police). Needless to say, that was the least time we had any unwanted nocturnal visitors! :-)\n\nOn a side note, up until that point I had a relatively low opinion of revolvers (especially those more than 40 years old).

However, in August one runs the risk of shooting females that are either on eggs, or then are rearing young. I have seen a female on eggs as late as mid-September. She refused to fly away, and then when we were about five yards away she flew off a short distance and sat down, and then I got off from the Jeep to go see the spot where she was sitting in the grass, and discovered her nest there.\n\nShooting on water holes is also unsporting I feel. It is certainly un-Islamic, ( you can read that in any book of fiqh). \n\nUltimately, how one hunts is largely dictated by one''s own beliefs, and in turn, also reflects one''s beliefs. Frankly, not all the laws in the world can have any meaningful impact, unless one''s own ethics are in agreement with them.

However, in August one runs the risk of shooting females that are either on eggs, or then are rearing young. I have seen a female on eggs as late as mid-September. She refused to fly away, and then when we were about five yards away she flew off a short distance and sat down, and then I got off from the Jeep to go see the spot where she was sitting in the grass, and discovered her nest there.\n\nShooting on water holes is also unsporting I feel. It is certainly un-Islamic, ( you can read that in any book of fiqh). \n\nUltimately, how one hunts is largely dictated by one''s own beliefs, and in turn, also reflects one''s beliefs. Frankly, not all the laws in the world can have any meaningful impact, unless one''s own ethics are in agreement with them. This is not to say that one should bow to discriminatory laws, but that one should heed his conscience.[/quote]\n\n\nImu, you are the key and leading persons in our Pak guns in all the key matters, who can stop you  from hunting, (after all i would be looking  for few of your hunts once your deep freezers becomes overloaded.................. :)  and didn''t meant any offense , salman has made a valid point in the messages, as you have got a very good nishana  so no sand grouse,batair, partridge,taloor and ducks even at long range will have chance of survival when you are in action.', 0, 1, '202.69.56.194', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 2024, 51538),

General In Pakistan For Talks On Equipment[/b]\n\nISLAMABAD, Aug 19 (Reuters) - U.S. General David Petraeus and Pakistan military leaders would discuss on Wednesday expediting delivery of U.S. equipment to Pakistan so it can expand its offensive against Taliban militants, U.S. officials said.\n\nWith U.S. troop strength growing in Afghanistan, the United States wants Pakistan to eradicate Islamist militant enclaves on its side of the border and prevent Taliban fighters from crossing into Afghanistan.\n\nThe Pakistani army has been battling militants in parts of the northwest for months but a commander said on Tuesday the army was short of equipment,[b] including Cobra attack helicopters, needed for a large-scale ground operation.[/b]\n\n"It is part of a substantial effort to strengthen U.S.-Pakistani military cooperation," U.S. envoy to Afghanistan and Pakistan, Richard Holbrooke, told Reuters, referring to the Patraeus visit.\n\nHolbrooke said on Tuesday that Washington was trying to expedite delivery of [b]equipment requested by the Pakistani army, including helicopters and parts.[/b]\n\nPakistan''s request for equipment would "come up for sure" in talks between Petraeus and senior Pakistani military officials, Holbrooke said.\n\nHe said Pakistani army chiefs would also provide Petraeus with their assessment of the battle in the Swat valley, northwest of Islamabad, after a three-month offensive in which Pakistani forces have pushed back militants.\n\nPakistan forces have also stepped up attacks on Pakistani Taliban fighters led by Baitullah Mehsud in the South Waziristan region on the Afghan border.\n\nMehsud is widely believed to have been killed this month in a missile strike by a U.S. pilotless drone aircraft.\n\nOTHER FACTIONS\n\nThe United States also wants Pakistan to move against other militant factions, based in various areas including North Waziristan, which focus on battling Western forces in Afghanistan.\n\nBut a senior Pakistani commander, Lieutenant-General Nadeem Ahmed, said on Tuesday Pakistan would need months to prepare for a ground offensive against the Taliban in South Waziristan.\n\nSome U.S. officials have expressed concern Pakistan will lose momentum if it puts off the offensive for too long.\n\n"The United States continues to encourage Pakistan to apply pressure on militants in the wake of Mehsud''s death," a U.S. defence official said.\n\nAhmed said the army was attacking militants with aircraft and artillery with the goal of "wearing them out" before ground forces go in.\n\nBut he added the army was short of "the right kind of equipment" and urged Holbrooke to help Pakistan obtain Cobra attack helicopters.\n\nIn addition to Cobras, Ahmed cited shortfalls of protective gear, intelligence-gathering and night-vision equipment, and precision weapons.\n\n"If we can really get these shortfalls addressed promptly, the operation will be that much more effective," he said. \n\n[url]http://www.reuters.com/article/asiaCrisis/idUSISL487557[/url]', 0, 1, '115.42.68.199', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 489, 51598),

Pellets differ from bullets used in firearms because of the pressures encountered; firearms operate at pressures of thousands of atmospheres, while airguns operate at pressures as low as 50 atmospheres. Firearms have sufficient pressure to force a slightly over-sized bullet to fit the bore in order to form a tight seal, while airguns generally use a slightly undersized projectile that is designed to obdurate upon shooting so as to seal the bore, and engage the rifling. Since pellets may be shot through a smoothbore barrel, they are often designed to be inherently stable.\n\n[url=http://www.postimage.org/][img]http://img29.imageshack.us/img29/3847/98684236.jpg[/img]\n[/url]\n\nFrom left to right, flat, round nose, hollow point and pointed pellets.

Exhibition shooting tends to stress both speed and accuracy, often with elements of danger added.\n\n[b][u]1) Annie Oakley[/u][/b]\n\n[url=http://www.postimage.org/][img]http://img36.imageshack.us/img36/3664/77410779.jpg[/img][/url]\n\nWith the advent rifling came accurate firearms, and many exhibition shooters turned to these, forming the beginnings of western exhibition shooting. The most famous exhibition shooter is Annie Oakley, who toured with Buffalo Bill''s Wild West show. While she could shoot well with handguns, rifles, and shotguns, Oakley''s preferred firearm was a .22 caliber rifle. Standard tricks of Oakley''s included:\nCutting a playing card in half with a rifle bullet at long ranges \nShooting cigarettes in half while they were held by volunteers \nShooting a dime tossed in the air, at range of 90 feet \nShooting long strings of targets tossed in the air; in one instance she hit 4472 out of 5000 in a single day.\n\n[b][u]2) Fabulous Topperweins[/u][/b]\nThe "Fabulous Topperweins," a husband and wife pair, were exhibition shooters in the early to mid-20th century. Adolf, or "Ad", began shooting as a boy, and held many positions as a professional exhibition shooter. When he married his wife, Elizabeth, later known as "Plinky", she began to shoot, and soon eclipsed her husband''s not inconsiderable skills. Together, they worked as professional shooters for Winchester for over 40 years. Common tricks were Plinky shooting cigarettes out of Ad''s mouth, or shooting buttons off of his vest. Ad''s closing act was to draw an Indian''s head on a board with bullet holes.\n\n[b][u]3)Ed McGivern[/u][/b]\nEd McGivern was an exhibition shooter and firearms trainer who specialized in the revolver. He still holds a number of speed shooting records (a number of which have been challenged, and some broken, by modern IPSC champion Jerry Miculek) and was known for shooting aerial targets. Common tricks included:\nThrowing a tin can in the air, and firing six shots through it before it hit the ground \nThrowing a dime into the air and shooting it \nThrowing a playing card into the air, and splitting it with a bullet.\n\n[b][u]4)Tom Frye[/u][/b]\nIn 1959, champion Tom Frye of Remington Arms Company broke Ad Topperwein''s aerial shooting record for shooting 2 1/4 inch cubes of wood thrown in the air. Over a period of 13 9 hour long days, using several Remington Nylon 66 semi-automatic .22 Long Rifle rifles, he hit 100,004 of the 100,010 blocks thrown in the air. Frye''s record is disputed because his thrower tossed the blocks in line with the rifle barrel, while Topperwein''s thrower tossed the blocks perpendicular to the rifle barrel, thus making Topperwein''s shots much more difficult.Also among Frye''s accomplishments was a run of 800 straight singles in trap, set in 1963.\n\n[b][u]5)John Huffer[/u][/b]\nIn 1987, at the age of 50, John "Chief AJ" Huffer shot 40,060 consecutive 2 1/2 inch square pine blocks over a period of 8 days without a single miss, shooting blocks he himself tossed into the air, for 14 hours a day. Huffer accomplished this using 18 .22 Long Rifle Ruger 10/22 rifles, which he cycled through as assistants loaded them for him. Huffer also markets a special "Chief AJ" branded Daisy BB gun, based on a modified model Huffer uses for daily practice, and an instruction manual and video for his style of point shooting.\n\n[b][u]6)Herb Parsons[/u][/b]\nHerb Parsons (1908-1959) of Somerville, Tennessee, was Winchester''s SHOWMAN SHOOTER for 30 years and was Adolph Topperwein''s protégé and successor. His impressive list of honors includes: All-American Trap and Skeet Shooter; twice National and twice International Duck Calling Champion; and inductee to Trapshooting Hall of Fame, Cody Firearms Museum and Tennessee Sports Hall of Fame. Parsons is considered by many to be the greatest exhibition shooter of shotguns and rifles in history. His signature feat was throwing by hand and individually breaking seven clay targets with a Winchester Model 12, 12 gauge pump shotgun.', 0, 1, '116.71.222.87', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 2084, 51906),

YOU will be facing PPC 324. \n\n        302 more mess - 324 little mess. \n\n   this is not the point, point is whether guy is dead or injured. you will have to  xplain, and trust me, you will have to xplain it real good so court of law becomes convinced, while on solid grounds, mentioning strong reason, if you control you senses after matter is done, court will give you some + points like presence of that guy in your house, any weapon existance or any night-breaking tools existance.  \n\n\n please let me clarify this again, shooting directly is the last option, consider the  restrictions of law mentioned in PPC 99 ( if there is time to contact authorities, or if there is no clear threat of life/injury etc)\n                                i say and i recommend it also, warnings, screaming alarms, firing in the air, getting neighbours help etc or calling police, usually and most oftenly helps. in very rare cases threat exists even after doing all this. good for everyone if we keep this killing/injuring ( in defence ) option as a BOTTOM LINE.[/quote]\nXERGA thanks for the info.\nBut when someone has no respect for the LAW, MY FAMILY, MY SENSE OF SECURITY, then its better to shoot first and worry about it later.

It is said to be capable of eating up whatever you feed it. Comes with a thumb-safety and decocker, though the decocker only lowers the hammer to quarter-cock (or half-cock) position, unlike other decockers, which fully lower the hammer. The PT92 is a pretty big, heavy pistol; Do not expect it to serve conceal carry duty. However, it is perfect for home defense, as far as handguns are concerned. The PT99 is the adjustable sight version, some problems with the rear sight have been reported.\n\nIf I wanted something for range work, or HD, this would be my pistol of choice. I feel the thumb safety feature is very important for those who want their guns that way. And don''t discount the PT92 simply because it is a clone of the earlier Beretta 92.

Its like the equivalent of the Pakistan Military Academy. The officers enetering the Police Service actually attend this academy after doing their initial induction at the CSS Academy in Lahore. The national police academy also includes more advanced Police training such as Criminology, Forensics etc.\n\nThe next tier of Police Training Schools are provincial specific. Say like the training school in lahore (the one that was attacked). Thats where the recruits for constables and asi''s etc are given asic training. (These would be like the Regimental Centres for the army where Other Ranks are given basic training). I think all the olice ranges have their own schools. Like in Sindh there is one in KHI. (i am not that familiar with the Police Training School locations but they are Saeedabad and Shahdadpur)\n\nThe next level of training is speciaised. This would be for professional trades: Wireless operators, ATF etc(am familiar with ATF set-up though). The ATF training school in Punjab is located near Simli) It is commanded by a serving SSG officer at the rank of a Major who is seconded from the SSG-Army. The instructors are a mix of SSG NCO''s and Police ATF personnel. (This training is different from the Elite Force Training) The school trains personnel from all Police Forces (such as Sindh Police, Punjab Police, NWFP Police and that from Balochistan and even Pak Rangers, FC etc). The teams based in Simli are also actually supposed to be on call to respond to Terror threats.  Typically the personnel trained here are personnel who have aleady gotten Elite Force training in their provinces and are then selected or volunteer for ATF. The training is tough and includes Sniper, Hostage Rescue, Killing House, Rapelling etc. Like a SSG Zarrar trained person without airborne capability. This school was set up under the aegis of the Army SSG in the 80''s. The idea was that these would become like the SWAT teams for the Polce but has not actually materialised that way since the trained personnel donot usually form an elite force within the police and are actually returned to the "Thaana" or the Elite Force.\n\nI missed out the Elite Force Training and that is done at provincial level again. The one in KHI is in Razakkabd and was set up by an ex SSG officer who was tasked to run and train the first batch. The current SSP for the Elite Force in KHI is an officer who was amongst the first candidates in Simli. Now the school is run by Police personnel as there are enough Elite Force insructors and training schools out there.

However, I do need to point out that silencers are illegal for civilians.\n\nSecondly, DAAD has the collapsible stock for your gun, but he''s asking around 8k for it. PARA in Lahore is giving it for 6k. He''s more reasonable.\n\nMoreover, don''t get carried away with pimping your gun with too many accessories and modifications. Enjoy it as it is for at least three months. By then, you''ll clearly figure out what exactly you need and what you simply do not require.\n\n[b]LASTLY, MANY CONGRATULATIONS.

Got mugged twice and a couple of months ago had a big robbery at my place. was shattered!. I am a total newbie and have never used a handgun in my life. I have relatively SMALL HANDS and my budget for a handgun is Rs.25,000/ max. Pls guide me on what handgun to buy. Pls also guide me as I have a couple of more queries to ask all experts as I am very inexperienced .\n\n1) Should I buy a used REVOLVER, ARMINIUS OR TAURUS, used for 12-20K. I have heard that they are easy to operate, maintain and have few malfunctions. Or should I purchase a 30 bore pistol, 9 MM or what. I dont mind a Pakistani one which should not be too heavy. Pls advise.\n\n2) If I do purchase one (if I get a licence) where do I practice. Where do the experts practice and fire their rounds. I read from this forum that it is very dangerous to fire in the air and someone could get hurt. Now, the Karsaz range is also closed. Any suggestions. I know this is a naive question, buy guys pls help.\n\n3) How do u guys clean and maintain yr pistols. Is it hard?. Can I try it myself or give it to dealer to service/clean. How much do u think the dealers will charge for cleaning/servicing.\n\n4) As I am a total newbie, I was wondering if u all can let me know if there is a place/club or person who can teach me or aquaint me in how to load/unload, insert and eject a magazine, use safety features etc before I buy a pistol. I don''t mind paying for the instructions. Or if any of u members might be interested, i would love to familiarize myself with the working knowledge of pistols or revolvers. Thanks and again sorry for a silly question\n\n5) what is the procedure for selling a licenced firearm. If I sell my handgun to a dealear, will he endorse it on my licence?. Do I have to inform the DCO for the sale?. What about the PS?. Do I have to inform them also that I have sold my weapon so that they can update their records as well?\n\nSorry for all these questions, but if u all experts can provide some brief answers It would go a long way for me to make an informed decision reg purchase and handling.\n\nAwaiting yr quick reply guys\nthanks\nSD 26', 0, 1, '110.37.21.180', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 172, 52232),

NOT semi automatics (other then .22) soo any ak-47 style weapon ohter then a .22 would automaticaly be pb.\n\nIf U want a 7mm or any other bolt action. just check out tahir brothers.. or Ammar and Co or the shop a little further from Tahir Bros. it they had a 7mm brno for 45k  \n\nU can check out the disscusions here \n\n[url]http://www.pakguns.com/forum/viewtopic.php?id=2094[/url]\n\n& \n\n[url]http://www.pakguns.com/forum/viewtopic.php?id=1897[/url]', 0, 1, '119.73.70.233', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 2075, 52373),

I was just referring to the effectiveness & application part of .22lr bolt-action & semi-autos. As for the availability & laws are concerned, you very well know that they vary from city to city.\n\nFor the scope, as I mention earlier & dealer suggested the same that, 3-9x40 is good for medium sized game. It sure works for .22lr but not an ideal. I understand from your concern that .22lr should have less powerful scope as its a less powerful caliber with limited range. \nIt sounds right, but lets take an example. There is a soft drink can placed @100 meters and a deer is standing next to it. Looking thu a 3-9x40 scope, the deer will fill your eye-piece whereas u''ll be able to see about 1mm sized can. Even if we take the deer to 300 meters it will still appear larger than the can placed @100 meters. Thats where we need higher magnification. So the higher magnification scope will assist in placing a bullet on the ''i'' dot of pepsi rather than just the whole can.\n\nSo, in other words, the scope should be selected according to the size of the targets and its distance from the shooter rather than just power or range of the caliber fired.

Now this is passion guys. Trigger Happy is all business people.\n\n[url=http://www.postimage.org/][img]http://img12.imageshack.us/img12/1682/91954538.jpg[/img][/url]\n\nSecondly the tools which were supposed to be used for the mentioned session.

Weapons are a Erma .22 Rifle, Webley Scott 12 Gauge Side By Side, Winchester Defender Pump Action, Ruger Mark II, Taurus 609, Glock 26, Taurus 24/7 and Walther G22.\n\n[url=http://www.postimage.org/][img]http://img35.imageshack.us/img35/1233/32351153.jpg[/img][/url]\n\nPlease dont be surprised after looking at this picture as we had no other ideas except for using it in Target Terms. Now why the other side was not used is beyond me. I know we keep forgetting our Targets so maybe next time we will take a proper Target :)\n\n[url=http://www.postimage.org/][img]http://img33.imageshack.us/img33/5812/47196124.jpg[/img][/url]\n\nThe wait is killing everyone especially Trigger Happy.

I am in the process of ordering Pearce Plus 0 Extensions from Glock Meister as those dont add any Bulk to the Magazine.\nYou can also see tissue used as ear plug by Imran :)\n\n[url=http://www.postimage.org/][img]http://img38.imageshack.us/img38/1293/72597249.jpg[/img][/url]\n\nNow after looking at this scene, everyone would think that Ahmad Bhai is not a god shot. You are wrong as this is the doing of Taurus 24/7 and we all know who owns that.

That day it worked flawlessly and only one issue.\nI would like to mention here that Mian (His real name is Mian Muhammad Mehlael Assawir Qureshi so we call him Mian for Short :) ) has always been there in hosting all GTG''s which have been carried out and hosted by me. We have done 5 and 1 was hosted by Trigger Happy. All the rest have been executed on Mian Farms.\n\n[url=http://www.postimage.org/][img]http://img32.imageshack.us/img32/2093/58869567.jpg[/img][/url]\n\nFinally i decided that i had enough pictures for the Topic and thought of giving G26 a go. Recently purchased Sellior and Ballet Bullets worked very well :)\n\n[url=http://www.postimage.org/][img]http://img195.imageshack.us/img195/8891/86460365.jpg[/img][/url]\n\nI never think of myself to be good target person but the above thing looks fine as the middle ones belong to me and secodly i only had ladies and their dresses to look at, no circles :lol:\n\n[url=http://www.postimage.org/][img]http://img13.imageshack.us/img13/3005/44973962.jpg[/img][/url]\n\nHere Ahamd Bhai was so kind to take my picture with G22 :) No shot was fired and it''s just a pose :)\n\n[url=http://www.postimage.org/][img]http://img197.imageshack.us/img197/7610/65523968.jpg[/img][/url]\n\nGot some bashing by Ahmad Bhai so had to fire one shot this time around. From the last time i would like to mention that this time my Bicep is more prominent.\n\n[url=http://www.postimage.org/][img]http://img29.imageshack.us/img29/1237/32010941.jpg[/img][/url]\n\nNow i was standing there and thinking what target i should use for G22 and suddenly Bang Bang Bang, looked up and saw Trigger Happy sitting and going at it without any reason :(\n\n[url=http://www.postimage.org/][img]http://img13.imageshack.us/img13/248/21089099.jpg[/img][/url]\n\nFinally thought of using spent cartridges and again Trigger Happy took the lead in that by shooting a cartridge on third attempt using rest from 12 yards and then telling everyone that he just aimed and fired without even using scope. Yeah we would believe that wont we. I managed to hit it on second attempy using scope and at 30 yards. No rest.\n\n[url=http://www.postimage.org/][img]http://img35.imageshack.us/img35/3228/36033360.jpg[/img][/url]\n\nThen i had to convince Trigger Happy for a competition from 50 yards using scope and no rest. Both of us tried but failed because we were really tired and soaking wet by that time. Ahmad Bhai shot all three with his Ruger Mark II from 12 to 15 yards.\n\n[url=http://www.postimage.org/][img]http://img196.imageshack.us/img196/46/89302424.jpg[/img][/url]\n\nI also fired two shots from Ahmad Bhai''s Winchester and it does pack a punch.\nI would like to mention here that Imran was new to this whole experience so not much is said about him this time :)\nStay tuned guys as more is coming.

As I started to train, I actually became impressed with what could be achieved with the 22LR in short and medium distances and wondered about the actual lethality of the round, so I decided to do some research in that area.\n\nI mean, I know that the 22LR has been a good hunting round for small critters/varmints such as rabbits and squirrels but occasionally you hear it is used as well for killing deers, coyotes and bigger animals – heck, on the internet, you can even find a story about the elephant being killed with a 22LR on the internet, LOL!\n\nDuring my research, I came upon several instances whereby the 22 LR has also been used by the military and law enforcement as well. There were several stories of Chechen snipers using the 22LR in urban setting or Israeli snipers using it in “crowd control”\n\nI started talking to several many people through bulletin boards to find more information about the lethality of that round, specifically from a tactical viewpoint – I.E. How effective and lethal is it? Any information about its lethality should also of interest to the average target shooters or even plinkers, being that it is one of most available/cheap round. Having the correct information could make people more aware of the possible consequences of not treating the 22LR with respect - I think we’ve all heard “ It’s just a 22! It’s not that powerful, etc…”\n\nTo get back to the subject, talking to hunters on various message boards and filtering out the “I heard that or someone told me”, here are some of the typical feedback/information I received from people who actually did it:\n\nLots of varmint kills up to 150 yards (This distance came up the most).\nLarger animals kills at shorter distance – Deer/Coyotes at 100 yards and some even 150 yards\nMention of a larger animal kill at 200 yards\nMention of actual rabbit kills at 175, 225 and 330 yards\n\nOverall the distance of 100 to 150 yards came up in 50% of the responses.\n\n\nTo go back to the “tactical” aspect and the actual effectiveness/lethality of the round in military/law enforcement settings – no real information was actually available. There were lots of stories and hearsay of people getting shot with 22s and how effective it was (or wasn’t) but no ACTUAL and PROVEN information – the main feedback was that shot placement was the most important in a military/law enforcement setting but there were no answers as to what would happen if someone was shot with a 22LR at medium distance (200 to 300 yards). When would the round stop penetrating several layers of clothing/skin and become completely ineffective and useless from a tactical point of view.\n\nGathering all the information from hunters, target shooters, etc… I personally came up with the conclusion that the 22LR “may be” effective up to 200 yards and possibly penetrate several layers of clothing which are usually something like a “t-shirt, a shirt and a jacket” and frankly I would not have been surprised if it didn’t penetrate at all.\n\nActual information not being available, I decided to conduct a test myself to see how far would a 22LR round penetrate 3 layers of clothing and penetrate skin as well. I looked at several options such as using ballistic gel, wet newspaper, etc… but finally ended up with the cheapest option and, what I thought the somewhat most realistic as well: purchasing a frozen turkey, thaw it and wrap it in 3 layers of clothing. This would be a good test to see how far the 22LR would penetrate.\n\nHere is an account of my “experiment” and Boy! Was I in for a surprise in many levels!!!!!!!\n\nThe test took place in the California desert at my usual shooting place for long distance shooting – far away from civilization and very safe. As it happens sometimes, nature has its own mind and does not always follow your plans. The weekend I chose and got ready for (including thawing the meat) ended up being quite windy.\n\nHow windy? Here is a look at my tent during the trip – yep, that’s the wind pushing the side of the tent nearly flat. Wind was an average of 25 MPH with gusts up to 30 MPH and lowest at 18MPH. \n\n\n[url=http://www.postimage.org/][img]http://img32.imageshack.us/img32/844/93142032.jpg[/img][/url]\n\n\nThis was a nightmare for any rimfire shooter and frankly I was extremely close to just pack it up and go home after doing some shooting with my 308. I thought shooting the 22LR in these conditions (the wind was quite violent and shifting constantly between 18 and 30MPH) would be absolutely impossible.\n\nThe main goal of the trip was this research and I already purchased the turkey so I decided to at least “Try it” with much reservation as to being able to actually hit the target. Having participated in many tactical long distances matches over the years, I decided to follow my own hard learned lesson: “When in doubt, follow what the book says” or, simply, trust your ballistic information, instruments and basic field craft. Because I use the 22LR for training, I pretty much replicated my setup and had at hand all I needed such as ballistic data card for elevation and windage, wind meter and range finder. \n\n\n[url=http://www.postimage.org/][img]http://img24.imageshack.us/img24/7475/45515980.jpg[/img][/url]\n\n\nThe setup for the turkey was as follow: 3 layers of clothing wrapped around it and taped in the back (although care was given to not make the clothing too tight either) and a white paper on top so we could see the impacts at long distance. \n\n\n[url=http://www.postimage.org/][img]http://img31.imageshack.us/img31/5862/45682910.jpg[/img][/url]\n\n\n\nThe test was done at the maximum distance of 300 yards because honestly, I thought that penetration would probably not occur at that distance and because, above 300 yards, using my elevation knob and even mildots was pretty much useless.\n\nA 400 yards shot is basically an 80 MOAs drop. Even shooting at 300 yards requires me to place my elevation for 200 yards (27.5 MOAs) and use 6.6 MILS (actually already off the mildots reticle so there is somewhat of a guess).\n\n[b](continued below)[/b]', 0, 1, '110.37.1.4', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 2126, 52974),

The Ballistic coefficients of the .30 180gr and 7mm 140gr are virtually identical, so all rounds will lose velocity at a similar rate. The 7mm starts off with more velocity, so flight time will be shorter. A shorter flight time reduces the effects of wind and target movement.\n\n        Out to at least 300yds the 7mm Rem Mag performs slightly better than the .300 Win Mag while producing only the recoil forces of a .308. I don''t have any figures for performance beyond this range, but during the Boer war 7x57mm Mausers were effective at more than 800yds. The 7mm Rem Mag fires an identical round at a higher velocity.\n\n        Since I wrote the above section, I''ve discovered the ballistics calculator at [url=http://www.realguns.com]www.realguns.com[/url] that is linked to below. The differences in velocity and ballistic coefficient of the 180gr .300 Win Mag and 140gr 7mm Rem Mag do not seem to be significant. Out to 1000yds flight time is the same for both rounds. At 1000yds the .300 has more energy, while the 7mm has dropped less. Both still have more than enough energy to be lethal.\n\n        There is no reason why Police forces should be restricted to Military or NATO standard ammo. In fact they are neglecting their primary job of public safety by using such rounds if more effective alternatives are available.\n\n        It could be argued that the 7mm Rem Mag has too much range for certain police operations. In such cases the round can be down loaded to produce velocities similar to the 7mm-08. Even such a reduced power round will still shoot better than a .308 :-\n\n7mm-08 140gr at 2860 fps has a MPBR of 285yds\n7mm-08 120gr at 3000fps has a MPBR 291yds.\n\n        For certain situations heavier, shorter ranged bullets may be needed:-\n\n        The 200gr round is the heaviest loading for the .300 commonly available. It will be noted that the 175gr 7mm rounds compares very favorably with both this round and the 250gr .338 Lapua Magnum.\n\n        I''ve used the 7mm Rem Mag. For purposes of illustration.

Safety was definitely an issue but also, in order to have any chance to hit the target with winds that strong we had to shoot within the wind.

So instead of 300 yards, we actually started at 250 yards which allowed me to use my elevation knob zeroed at 200 yards and my mildots reticle and thus “less guessing”.\n\nAs you can see the package is quite small at 250 yards!!!!!!

I calculated the wind cycle to range from around 18 to 30 MPH. It was a quick wind cycle with periods of 18 MPH lasting only a 4-5 seconds at best. I decided to shoot at the lowest point of the wind cycle and simply use 0 windage as I was shooting in the wind.\n\nMy first round went slightly to the left missing the target by a couple of inches, my second round did the same on the right side and my third one actually hit the small turkey dead center. I was actually amazed!!!!!!\nI was ready to shoot 50 rounds in those windy conditions to have some “Hope” to hit the target because, from what I was told, the 22LR is so unstable in the wind at long distance. Yet despite the atrocious conditions – using elementary ballistic information and field craft, shooting it in 18 to 30 MPH was factually quite easy. From a tactical viewpoint, every single shot would have hit a center mass target.\n\nInspecting the 250 yards target was quite revealing…the bullet had gone through the 3 layers as if it was nothing.\n\nEncouraged by the results and the fact that we could hit the target, we placed the turkey at 300 yards. I spotted for my son and he took the shots. Again we were amazed that despite the wind we had 4 hits out of 10 rounds!!!

(46328, 1601, 0, 'Taurus', 24, '', 1251132624, 'Myths and errors regarding the path of a bullet generally come from a lack of understanding of the forces acting on the bullet before, during, and after its path through the barrel. This article will deal with the primary forces on a bullet''s trajectory, and it will mention a few of the secondary forces. The approach is directed toward the average reader. There is no attempt to address concerns of the mathematician or physicist, who should either know this material or should read a more technical and comprehensive treatise.\n\nOne of the more pervasive myths associated with bullet trajectory is that "bullets always rise right after they leave the barrel." In general, bullets do rise after leaving the barrel, and they immediately begin to drop. This is not a contradiction, and the explanation is not difficult to understand.\n\nBullets are affected by gravity whether in flight or not, and, when they leave the barrel, they no longer have any physical support, such as the brass, the box, your pocket, the magazine, the chamber, or the barrel, so they begin to fall. In addition, they are traveling through air, so air resistance progressively slows their flight. On most occasions the barrel is slanted upward slightly to compensate for this immediate drop; thus, for all but extreme shots, since the barrel is aimed slightly upward, the bullet does, indeed, rise slightly after it leaves the barrel, but it bullet never rises above the axis of the barrel. (Just like a football generally rises above the player when they throw a pass. The longer the pass, the greater the starting angle, and the higher the "rise" before the ball begins to fall.)\n\nIn scientific terms, "thrown" objects, whether by hand, explosion, springs, compressed air, or other forces, are called "projectiles," their path in space is called their "trajectory," and the study of their trajectories is called "ballistics." Those who fail to understand the elementary physics of ballistics often misinterpret the configuration of barrel and the line of sight and assume that something "special" happens to the bullet during its flight. Many things happen, but nothing "special;" bullets fly just like any other projectile and are subject to the same laws of physics.\n\nThe following drawings, though not to exact scale, show the typical paths of bullets and the relationship of these paths to the line of sight, whether determined by open sights or optical sights.\n\nHorizontal Shot. If the barrel is horizontal to the surface of the earth when fired, the bullet never rises above the barrel, and gravity causes an immediate descent.\n\n[img]http://www.chuckhawks.com/bullet_trajectory1.jpg[/img]\n\nTypical Alignment. Generally, for what we consider a "horizontal" shot, the sight alignment places the barrel in a slightly upward tilt, and the bullet starts its arc, rises slightly above the level of the muzzle, but never above the axis of the barrel, reaches a peak, then descends. Figure 2 is the graph of a centerfire rifle cartridge that stays within a 6 inch circle for a distance of about 210 yards. Sighted in at approximately 170 yards, this round is approximately 3 inches high at 100 yards and three inches low at approximately 210 yards. You must, of course, always check trajectory data for your particular rifle and cartridge combination.\n\nVelocity. The velocity is a factor in determining energy on impact and the horizontal velocity determines how far the bullet travels before it hits the ground. The above illustrations apply to all ballistic projectiles whether bullets, rocks, or ping pong balls.\n\nLow Velocity Bullets. Bullets at nominally 800 fps to perhaps 1600 fps, such as 22 LR, most pistols, and older rifle cartridges, must follow a rather high arc in order to reach a target 100 yards away. In fact, most of these slower cartridges are only useful to about 50 yards, perhaps 75 yards for some in the upper end of this range.\n\nHigh Velocity Bullets. Bullets at 2600 fps and up, such as the .223, 22-250, .243/6mm, .270, .308, 30-06, follow a much lower arc to reach a target, and their useful range can be upward of 200 yards. These are often referred to as "flatter" trajectories. With higher velocities, these bullets go much further before gravity and air resistance cause them to fall below the initial line of sight.\n\nSince the barrel is generally directed at an angle to the line of sight, sighting directly upward or directly downward results in a trajectory that deviates even more from the line of sight than the typical, relatively level shot. Still, the effects of gravity and air resistance are the same as far as the bullet is concerned, it is just that the trajectory at such a steep angle is more divergent from the line of sight.\n\nSecondary Ballistics Phenomena. In general, bullets follow a parabolic arc. In reality, that arc is modified significantly by air resistance, which slows the bullet during flight and effects a shortening of the arc down range. That is why the highest point of the usable portion of the trajectory is not the midpoint of that trajectory. Bullet shape and the spin from rifling also influence the trajectory slightly by reducing air resistance and stabilizing bullet orientation. That is why a 500 grain rifle bullet, for example, has a much better trajectory than a 500 grain ball from a smooth bore, all other things being equal.\n\nFact or Myth. So, does a bullet rise after it leaves the muzzle? One says, "yes." Another says, "no." Who is correct? Both could be correct because of different meanings associated with the word, "rise." They might argue incessantly, but their argument will not change the physical aspects of the path of the bullet. If they would concentrate on discussing the physical events, they would eventually conclude that they were each using the word, "rise," differently or that one of them did not understand elementary ballistics.\n\nThought Question. When sighted in for a typical hunting or target situation, what is the path of the bullet in relation to the sight picture if the rifle is aimed directly up or down?', 0, 1, '110.37.2.134', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 2128, 52978),

The probability is that the bullet hit some of the sage brush that was moving around wildly in the wind because no other impacts showed signs of keyholing and we were somewhat shooting through the moving brushes.\n\nNow the huge surprise was the following. After taking the shot at 250 yards I was quite happy to see that the bullet had penetrated the 3 layers of clothing but I would have never thought of actually checking the BACK OF THE TARGET.\n\nAfter shooting the 300 yards and taking back the target to the Jeep, we realized that one round had gone through the whole turkey, the clothing layers in the front AND the layers in the back as well!!!!!!!!!! And this had to occur between 250 yards and 300 yards. This was MUCH MORE than I ever had anticipated for the standard velocity 22LR round!!!!!!!!!!\n\nNot only that but because the clothing was wrapped around and folded/taped in the back, it was the equivalent of shooting through 3 layers of clothing in the front and 6 LAYERS of clothing in the back plus on layer of duck tape! \n\n[url=http://www.postimage.org/][img]http://img39.imageshack.us/img39/258/84841610.jpg[/img][/url]\n\nWe did one more shot at 100 yards and the round went through easily.

The bullet that expanded consistently i.e., CCI Stinger 32gr managed only 6.9 inches of penetration. Likewise Quick Shok 32gr expanded considerably but managed only 6.4 inches of penetration.\n\nThis shows that for close range (less than 50 hards), one should choose the bullets with maximum expansion capability while for ranges beyond 50 yards, the standard rounds are preferable, both from penetration as well as cost point of view.\n\nAnother thing to note in the table given is that 22LR ammo of 30 grains to 40 grains are more than enough to reach maximum possible penetration.

I personally have no experience with it so can''t say much. Now a days 7.62x51 Nato has the highest demand and is getting very scarce but still no body is buying POF and Indian stuff which is still available at reasonably low price.

Water and ammonia based mixture neutralizes the corrosive salts for 8-10 hours and delays its chemical reaction bringing salt to the surface.\n\nI shoot lots of 7.62x54 and 7.62x 25 surplus ammo, which happens to be mostly corrosive. My weapons have suffered no ill due to this preventive measure.[/quote]\n\nDear Sir\nI have never seen a POF Rifle round misfire in my 32 years of military service,  I have served at Siachin and other glaciers at temperatures hovering around  minus 50 degrees and never even saw a single misfire.\nYes the POF 7.62 x 51 ammo  leaves a bit of black soot in the barrel, it is because graphite and other chemicals are used to reduce  Flash on firing this being a military round.\nThe commercial non military rounds burn cleaner, but the POF ammo is extremely good on barrels and the barrel shines with just a couple of draws of the cleaning rod or cord.

There is practically no loss of velocity /energy in an auto .22 when compared with a bolt.\nWhen an auto .22 is fired the gas pressure seals or obturates the chamber \nand as the bullet leaves the barrel \nthe gass pressure starts to drop and the force of obturation is lesser than the remaining gas pressure in the barrel thus the bolt moves back and ejects the case. \nThe process of re chambering is accomplished by the recoil spring.\nWhen you fire and extract a case from a bolt action it is cool, a case ejected after firing an auto is very hot to touch due to the friction caused by the remaining gas pressure and the case sticking to the chamber walls due to obturation.\nI have chronographed a berretta .22 rifle which can be made to fire single shot or semi and in both cases the average velocity of ten shots   is the same \n. I used an Oehler 35 P chronograph.\nThe same thing can be confirmed by consulting the net or other sources, it is a popular question.\nI want to add there are different type of actions to operate an autu weapon these are as follows;\n\nBlow back\n\n      For .22, 9mm Makarov , .32 & 25 pistols .380 pistols all  low pressure rds and less gas volume\n\nDelayed Blow back\n\nRifle G3, H&K Pistol P7 and  H&K M13  9mm\n\nRecoil operated \n\nThese are weapons where the Barrel actually moves back to unlock, Glock, Browning 9mm, TT, Walther P99 and all 9mm pistols except the ( Steyer GB now out of production, it was gas operated), MG 1A 3 machine gun, Browning A5 Auto shotgun etc a variant, inertial in the Bennelli\n\nGas Operated\n\nIn these the Barrel is fixed but there is a gas port and piston which move the carrier to unlock the bolt after the bullet has gone out the barrel, like .30 Browning machine gun, Berretta Auto shotguns, and several other shotguns and auto weapons  like the Ak and  M16  (with a slight variation these work without a piston but direct gas impingement,) the Ruger and some other variants are now available with the piston as well.\n\nAll these actions are designed to save the weapon and shooter from damage/injury. I f the bolt opens when the round is still in the barrel the weapon will blow up and   God help the shooter. Only in the case of the Gas operation a very tiny bit of gas is bled into the gas cylinder to move the piston back. The moving parts are several times heavier than the bullet and a very minute amount of gas moves the parts back;  the bullet moving much faster is several feet out of the barrel when remaining gas pressure moves the parts back.\n\nIn all cases the bullet is well clear of the barrel and gas pressure rapidly falling when the process of un locking and extraction begins.\nI pray I have been able to explain in as simple terms as possible. There will be several doubts and questions  lurking in the minds of some brothers , please shoot.\nThe operating cycle of an auto weapon other than Blow back is as under;\nFeeding,  Chambering, Locking , Firing , Un locking , Extraction , Cocking , Ejection and again Feeding.\nIn case of Blow Back it is Feeding , Chambering ,Firing , Extraction (after bullet clears barrel) cocking and ejection and then refeeding', 0, 1, '119.154.50.140', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 2126, 53493),

I am neither to win an argument nor to score a point, its just to put a question to the audience and more learned people and in the process learn more. Before making my point I would like to elaborate few terms for better understanding.\n 	 a.	Caliber. Commonly it is the measurement of the diameter of the barrel of the gun  either in inches or in mm. The measurement is done from groove to groove or land to land.\n	b.	Land and Grooves. Projectiles are provided stability through fins or spin. Fins like that of mortor bombs, RPG 7 rockets etc and spin for all rifles. The barrels are rifled and the raised portion is called land while the cut one is called groove.\n	c.	Obturation. Obturation refers to seal or block and in fire arms the phenomenon happens because of expanding of cartridge case (because of heat) and it stops the rearward escape of gases while once the shoulders of bullets / projectiles are engaged with the grooves (the metal expands as well to ensure optimum obturation) they act as a seal to stop the forwrd escape of gasses. Now once the bullet is firmly in contact with lands as well, any push from the rear, because of burning charges and consequent production of gases / pressure, will cause the bullet to rotate as per the rifles of barrel thus providing stability to the projectile or bullet. In larger calibers the frontal seal is provided through driving bands so that the body of shall does not come in contact with the rifles of barrel and no damage is caused to body containing TNT. It is understood that the diameter of bullet is slightly more than the caliber if measurement of caliber is done from land to land else obturation will not occur or the weapon will have obturation failure. In case of caseless cartridges the obturation is provided through the breach block system / chamber like that of 155 Howitzer\n	d.	Peak Pressure. As the charge in the cartridge is ignited it burns producing gases which exert pressure both ways. The rearward movement is stopped due to bolt locking system while the forward pressure makes the projectile mov. As the pressure increases the projectile moves farther down the barrel creating more space for gases allowing the pressure to drop but the rate of pressure development is more than the space being created so it keeps increasing. Finally a stage comes once the charge has been burnt and the pressure is optimum tharafter it will drop. This point is called peak pressure. Though pressure drops thereafter but the projectile keeps accelerating and then it leaves the muzzle. More time a projectile spends in barrel more range will it achieve. It is theoretically said that if the pressure behind the projectile is exactly same as that of atmospheric pressure once it leaves the muzzle then the range will be very long. But doing so involves building miles long barrel-Non practicable.\n2. Now once the bullet leaves the muzzle and there is no stopper in the barrel why should gases still exert pressure rearward and not escape from the muzzle. This is exactly what happens once you fire a blank cartridge. It does not reload the rifle. You have to put up a recoil booster on muzzle to allow enough pressure to build up in the barrel to push the bolt and carrier group backwards for an ejection and subsequent loading through the spring. That proves the point that some gases are required to push the bolt and carrier group backwards for subsequent actions. If x are the total gases and y is the total pressure they generate and z is the pressure / gases required to push the bolt back so the pressure / gasses behind the projectile are supposed to be y-z or x -z in a semi auto as compared to bolt action where there is no going back.\n\n3. There are many sniper rifles rather most of the sniper rifles in world are bolt actions. Most of the hunting rifles are bolt action. If they were not more stable, achieved lesser or equal ranges as that of auto rifles and are not accurate why should they exist. Semi auto sniper rifles are good for relative close ranges where accuracy is less important and rate of fire is more important.  However, what has been mentioned by the honourable member is also worth considering especially once he supports his arguments with a practical. I also subscribe to the fact that bolt actions kick a lot. These are a few sites which gives varied point of views with different logics. There must be many more.

The National Assembly’s Standing Committee on Interior had on Wednesday expressed dissatisfaction over the outcome of an initial inquiry after which three section offices were arrested. \n\nThe committee recommended a wide-ranging inquiry to uncover every official involved in the scam.\n\n“The committee has sought complete details of licences so far issued by the ministry and it is looking at the inquiry from various angles,” the committee’s chairman, Abdul Qadir Patel, said. \n\nHe said the scam appeared to be much bigger than initially perceived and the committee wanted a comprehensive probe. \n\n“The ban will remain imposed until the committee completes its own inquiry into the scandal,” The Dawn quoted Patel, as saying. \n\nOn receiving complaints of use of illegal means to get licences for banned arms, Gilani had banned issuance of permits and directed the NA committee to probe the matter.\n\nIn its initial inquiry, the FIA had confirmed use of fake bank receipts and stamps and forged signatures by middle-ranking officials of the ministry on receiving gratification from applicants. \n\nInvestigations also revealed that part of the record in the arms branch of the ministry was missing, strengthening fears that the number of licences issued could have been higher than what is known.\n\nAccording to a report placed before the NA committee, 28,527 licences of prohibited weapons were issued from March 28, 2008, to June 25 this year.

Both 22LR and 22WMR (magnum) are different calibers.\n\n\nMORE INFO:\n\nBullet diameter for the Magnum is .224", the same as for the .22 WRF and most centerfire .22''s. Its case is slightly fatter than a Long Rifle case and, as loaded by Winchester-Western, the Magnum''s original 40 grain bullet came with a real jacket, not just copper plating. Bullet styles include full metal jacket (non-expanding) and jacketed hollow-point (expanding) types. The SD of the 40 grain bullets is .114. As originally loaded a MV of 2000 fps was claimed from a 22" rifle barrel, and 1550 fps from a 6.5" handgun barrel.\n\nAvailable bullet weights have expanded to include 30 grain and 50 grain bullets (SD .142) in addition to the original 40 grain bullets. CCI, Federal, Remington, and Winchester all load .22 WMR ammunition. There is also a .22 WMR shot cartridge, loaded with #11 shot.\n\nThe standard 40 grain bullet is now advertised to have a muzzle velocity of 1,910 fps in a 22" rifle barrel and carries 324 ft. lbs. of energy. From the 6.5" barrel of a revolver the velocity is 1400 fps with an energy of 174 ft. lbs.\n\nThe .22 Magnum is a much more powerful cartridge than the .22 LR. At 100 yards its 40 grain bullet is still carrying 156 ft. lbs. of energy, more than the .22 LR develops at the muzzle (compared in 22" barrels). The flat shooting WMR can be zeroed to hit +0.6" at 100 yards when fired from a scoped rifle, and will give a point-blank range (+/- 1.5") of about 124 yards.\n\nThe power of the Magnum, coupled with the violent expansion provided by its JHP bullet, makes it too much cartridge for shooting cottontail rabbits and squirrels at close range unless only head shot are taken. Body shots tend to literally blow these small animals apart.\n\nUsed for self defence in a revolver, the .22 WMR has compiled a 42% one shot stop rate according to Marshall and Sanow. This is far superior to the .22 LR and .25 ACP, and makes the .22 WMR the best of the small bore handgun cartridges.\n\nWithin its trajectory limitation of about 125 yards, the extra destructive power of the .22 Magnum''s JHP bullet moves it into the varmint rifle cartridge class. Its low report makes it one of the best varmint cartridges for shooting on the small ranches and farms typical of semi-populated areas and in the country outside of small to medium sized towns.\n\nFor years there were lever, pump, and bolt action rifles chambered for the .22 Magnum, but very few autoloaders. This is because the Magnum operates at pressures above those deemed safe for simple blowback actions (the type of action used for all autoloading .22 LR rifles). The rifle manufacturers seemed to have licked the problem in recent years, however, as there is now a selection of autoloading sporting rifles chambered for the .22 WMR. For the serious small game and varmint hunter there are a number of accurate, high grade .22 Magnum bolt action rifles.\n\n\n3) My recommendation on 22WMR : Depends on your requirement. 22LR is almost half the price of 22WMR but in return for going for WMR you get 40% - 50% more velocity. 22LR guns are more common and more reasonably priced than guns which use 22WMR.\n\nSENIOR MEMBERS PLZ CORRECT ME WHERE I WENT WRONG.', 0, 1, '61.5.135.53', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 2126, 53829),

Every bullet crosses line of sight twice, once when it crosses it going up and second when it crosses it coming down, and this second crossing is called zero range, this is what every one aims for. If a bullet will not cross the line of sight it will NEVER hit the target.

Since sights are mounted above the bore''s centerline and since the bullet begins to drop when it leaves the muzzle the bore must be angled upwards in relation to the line of sight so that the bullet will strike where the sights point.\n\nBullet Trajectory - This is the bullet''s path as it travels down range. It is parabolic in shape and because the line of the bore is below the line of sight at the muzzle and angled upward, the bullet''s path crosses the line of sight at two locations.\n\nCritical Zone - This is the area of the bullet''s path where it neither rises nor falls greater than the dimension specified. Most shooters set this as ± 3" to 4" from the line of sight, although other dimensions are sometimes used. The measurement is usually based on one-half of the vital zone of the usual target. Typical vital zones diameters are often given as: 3" to 4" for small game, and 6" to 8" for big game and (Gasp!) anti-personnel use.\n\nInitial Point - The range at which the bullet''s trajectory first crosses the line of sight. This is normally occurs at a range of about 25 yards.\n\nLine of Sight - This is the visual line of the aligned sight path. Since sights are mounted above the bore''s centerline and since the bullet begins to drop when it leaves the muzzle the bore must be angled upwards in relation to the line of sight so that the bullet will strike where the sights point.\n\nMaximum Ordinate - This is the maximum height of the projectile''s path above the line of sight for a given point of impact and occurs somewhat past the halfway point to the zero range and it is determined by your zeroing range. \n\nMaximum Point Blank Range - This is the farthest distance at which the bullet''s path stays within the critical zone. In other words the maximum range at which you don''t have to adjust your point of aim to hit the target''s vital zone. Unless there is some over riding reason to the contrary shots should not generally be attempted much past this distance. In the words of the Guru, "It is unethical to attempt to take game beyond 300 meters." If you do, you should write yourself a letter explaining why it was necessary to do so. An approximate rule of thumb says that the maximum point blank range is approximately your zero range plus 40 yards.\n\nMid-range Trajectory - This is the height of the bullets path above the line of sight at half way to the zero range. It does not occur at the same range as the maximum ordinate height which can be greater.\n\nMinute of Angle (MOA) - A "minute" of angle is 1/60 of a degree which for all practical purposes equates to 1 inch per 100 yards of range.

I came across a spray can.. but everything on it was in german or something.. so I wasnt sure what it actually is and what it does? what is it?[/quote]\nMalik i have been using it from my first weapon purchase and i am extremely satisfied with it. Never needed anything else. Kindly refer to following information about Brunox;\n\nBRUNOX® Turbo-Spray® is a long-term lubricant based on a balanced mixture of hydrocarbons with the additive TURBOLINE.\n\nCreep oil / Rust loosener\n\nBRUNOX® Turbo-Spray® is a multi-component lubricant which has an excellent penetration effect. Therefore it is capable of penetrating into finest hair-chaps and spaces and, for example, loosens tightened screws in a very short time. It loosens rust and frees sticky mechanisms.\n\nAnti-corrosion\n\nBRUNOX® Turbo-Spray® guarantees complete corrosion protection and also conservation of hollow spaces. The hydrocarbon mixture which is responsible for this guarantees both a compact protection film and also the necessary film thickness which displaces any humidity. It forms a clear, invisible, non-hardening film which does not need to be removed in most cases. (Exception: painting). This film provides temporary protection against corrosion (approx. 6 months) and has a dirt repelling effect.\n\nCleaning agent\n\nBRUNOX® Turbo-Spray® penetrates and removes mineral and organic dirt so that spots of (almost) all kinds (e.g. tar, brake dust, adhesive residues etc.) can be easily wiped off. It neutralises hand sweat and also protects aluminium, copper, brass, chromium plated and galvanised sheet metal and stainless steel.\n\nContact spray\n\nBRUNOX® Turbo-Spray® has a very low surface tension and a corresponding adhesion to metals so that leak currents will be prevented and humidity which has penetrated will immediately be displaced. The very high dielectric strength (UD = 45 KV/cm) also allows the application in connection with very sensitive (high-impedance) circuits. This property is particularly useful with electrical contacts and short circuits can be eliminated and prevented.\n\nBRUNOX® Turbo-Spray® contains no silicone, no teflon, no graphite\n\nBRUNOX® Turbo-Spray® behaves neutral against varnish, leather, wood, rubber, plastic and fabric\n\nBRUNOX® Turbo-Spray® contains just 3% propellant (CO2), i.e. 97% active substance\n\nBRUNOX® Turbo-Spray® has a flash point of 78°C\n\nHopefully this will help many people to understand what it actually is. I get it for 450 to 500 and one bottle lasts for quite a while so not that expensive at the end.', 0, 1, '116.71.170.11', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 2115, 53886),

Should I go personally at DCO office or can the dealer do this for me. Once I do this, my licence book will no show NO WEAPON\n\n3) Now, my licence book is empty (FIREARM SOLD). Will my licence still be valid?.\n\n4) Do I also have to inform my local P.S. that I have sold my weapon so that they update their records and remove the initial entry which was there when I first registered it with them.?\n\n5) What if I did not purchase any weapon for almost 5 yrs and the licence book is empty, and when the time comes for RENEWAL of MOI licence will it be RENEWED.?Can MOI licence which is empty (firearm first purchased and then eventually SOLD) BE RENEWED?\n\nIs the NBP (National Bank of Pakistan) the bank where we will pay our RENEWAL fee only concerned about paying the renewal fee and getting the licence renewed or do they check entries on the licence to see if you have some sort of weapon entry on it.', 0, 1, '110.37.18.106', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 536, 53889),

It is rather measrement of a BULLET !\nMilitary is very straightforward when it comes down to application of a round to intended target, their terms of caliber includes the dia of projectile + the length of case and barrels. A military personal can make it more clear.\n\nCaliber and Bore are more of same thing less technically and for all of us :lol:\n\nand however Technically:\nBore is(measurement) related to a Barrel OR a Weapon which is bearing that specific BORE barrel.\nBore measurements are taken from (see rifling Lands/Grooves) a Land to a Land inside a barrel. It is something related to a barrel/weapon but not bullets.\nCaliber measurements are taken from Groove to Groove inside a barrel, which is refered as groove diameter, and which is equal to the Caliber of Bullet used in that barrel.\n\nnow for an EXAMPLE please consider the following: \na 30 caliber rifle uses a .308" dia bullet. Each groove of the rifling is .004" deep. The two opposing grooves measure .008" and the distance across the lands is .300". It all adds up to .308. \n\nCaliber of a weapon? :-\nWhen we talk of Caliber of a weapon, it means the land to land diameter or BORE of weapon actually sometimes like incase of a 30-06 weapon, where BORE is .300 or .30 and Bullet itself is .308 inch.\n\nIncase of AK47, known as a 7.62 or .30cal weapon, where the BORE of weapon is 7.62mm and bullet diameter itself is 7.92mm\n\nWeapon calibers are based on their BORES i.e. land to land mesurements which is always less than CALIBER of bullet used in it. Also sometimes a weapon caliber is same as that of bullet used in it, e.g .308 commercial rifle :) and also 7.62*51mm NATO, here the actual bullet is 7.62mm, BORE must be less that this. But unlike Springfiled we still call the weapon by its ACTUAL BULLET DIA or Groove DIA! \nNOW THIS CONFUSION IS CAUSED BY BULLET NOMENCLATURE!\nI like metric systems, like all jarheads... :)\n\nMoreover, Caliber representation is done with respect to INCHES ! more specifically\nthough Metrics system (mm) is another way to measure the BORE/Caliber of Weapon(loand to land measurements) or Caliber of a Bullet(bullet diameter represented in INCHES).', 0, 1, '119.152.56.148', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 309, 54047),

It is small rod of extremely solid material like tungsten or depleted uranium, which is fired at extremly high velocities and penetrates through the armor using kinetic energy.

It is a given  in the net and I am just simply repeating. Two bullets of different calibers and weight can have the same BC..[/quote]\n\nSir I,m adding to what you said above, in Chuck Hawks own words taken from fol site\n\n[url]http://www.chuckhawks.com/bc.htm[/url]\n\nBC is what determines trajectory and wind drift, other factors (velocity among them) being equal. BC changes with the shape of the bullet and the speed at which the bullet is traveling, while sectional density does not. Spitzer, which means pointed, is a more efficient shape than a round nose or a flat point. At the other end of the bullet, a boat tail (or tapered heel) reduces drag compared to a flat base. Both increase the BC of a bullet.\n\nFor example, a Hornady 100 grain round nose 6mm bullet has a BC of .216; a Hornady 100 grain spire point 6mm bullet has a BC of .357, and a Hornady 100 grain boat tail spire point 6mm bullet has a BC of .400. All three of these bullets have a sectional density (which is the ratio of a bullet''s diameter to its weight) of .242, because they are all .243" in diameter and weigh 100 grains. But the more streamlined bullets have a higher ballistic coefficient. They are the ones to choose for long range shooting where a flatter trajectory is important.\n\nTo illustrate the practical difference between these three styles of bullets, let''s use Hornady''s trajectory figures for the 100 grain 6mm bullets above. Starting all three bullets at a muzzle velocity of 3100 fps from a scoped 6mm rifle zeroed at 300 yards, the trajectories are as follows.\n\n.243" 100 grain Round Nose (BC .216): -1.5" @ muzzle, +4.8" @ 100 yards, +6" @ 200 yards, 0 at 300 yards, -15.9" @ 400 yards, -46" @ 500 yards.\n\n.243" 100 grain Spire Point (BC .357): -1.5" @ muzzle, +3.8" @ 100 yards, +4.7" @ 200 yards, 0 @ 300 yards, -11.1" @ 400 yards, -30.5" @ 500 yards.\n\n.243" 100 grain Spire Point BT (BC .400): -1.5" @ muzzle, +3.6" @ 100 yards, +4.4" @ 200 yards, 0 @ 300 yards, -10.4" @ 400 yards, -28.6" @ 500 yards.\n\nThere is a pretty big difference in trajectory between the round nose bullet and the two pointed bullets, making it obvious why it is folly to choose a round nose bullet for long range shooting with a high velocity rifle like a 6mm Remington or .243 Winchester. Also notice the big difference in BC between the round nose bullet (.216) and the spire point bullet (.357).\n \nSo what I want to add is that as mentioned by the honorable member Skeeter60 about different bullets having same BC, it is also true that same bullets (calibers) may also have different BC', 0, 1, '121.52.144.194', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 2183, 54998),

(48373, 236, 3691, 'Malik1', 78, '', 1251616518, 'Gents, I,m quoting excerpts from Mike Nelson article on Bullet Trajectory - Fact and Myths. It will further reinforce what the honorable Skeeter60 and probably other worthy members said above \n\nMyths and errors regarding the path of a bullet generally come from a lack of understanding of the forces acting on the bullet before, during, and after its path through the barrel.\n\nOne of the more pervasive myths associated with bullet trajectory is that "bullets always rise right after they leave the barrel." In general, bullets do rise after leaving the barrel, and they immediately begin to drop. This is not a contradiction, and the explanation is not difficult to understand.\n\nBullets are affected by gravity whether in flight or not, and, when they leave the barrel, they no longer have any physical support, such as the brass, the box, your pocket, the magazine, the chamber, or the barrel, so they begin to fall. In addition, they are traveling through air, so air resistance progressively slows their flight. On most occasions the barrel is slanted upward slightly to compensate for this immediate drop; thus, for all but extreme shots, since the barrel is aimed slightly upward, the bullet does, indeed, rise slightly after it leaves the barrel, but it bullet never rises above the axis of the barrel. (Just like a football generally rises above the player when they throw a pass. The longer the pass, the greater the starting angle, and the higher the "rise" before the ball begins to fall.)\n\nIn scientific terms, "thrown" objects, whether by hand, explosion, springs, compressed air, or other forces, are called "projectiles," their path in space is called their "trajectory," and the study of their trajectories is called "ballistics." Those who fail to understand the elementary physics of ballistics often misinterpret the configuration of barrel and the line of sight and assume that something "special" happens to the bullet during its flight. Many things happen, but nothing "special;" bullets fly just like any other projectile and are subject to the same laws of physics.\n\n\nHorizontal Shot. If the barrel is horizontal to the surface of the earth when fired, the bullet never rises above the barrel, and gravity causes an immediate descent.\n\n\nTypical Alignment. Generally, for what we consider a "horizontal" shot, the sight alignment places the barrel in a slightly upward tilt, and the bullet starts its arc, rises slightly above the level of the muzzle, but never above the axis of the barrel, reaches a peak, then descends.\n\n\nVelocity. The velocity is a factor in determining energy on impact and the horizontal velocity determines how far the bullet travels before it hits the ground. The above illustrations apply to all ballistic projectiles whether bullets, rocks, or ping pong balls.\n\nLow Velocity Bullets. Bullets at nominally 800 fps to perhaps 1600 fps, such as 22 LR, most pistols, and older rifle cartridges, must follow a rather high arc in order to reach a target 100 yards away. In fact, most of these slower cartridges are only useful to about 50 yards, perhaps 75 yards for some in the upper end of this range.\n\nHigh Velocity Bullets. Bullets at 2600 fps and up, such as the .223, 22-250, .243/6mm, .270, .308, 30-06, follow a much lower arc to reach a target, and their useful range can be upward of 200 yards. These are often referred to as "flatter" trajectories. With higher velocities, these bullets go much further before gravity and air resistance cause them to fall below the initial line of sight.\n\nSince the barrel is generally directed at an angle to the line of sight, sighting directly upward or directly downward results in a trajectory that deviates even more from the line of sight than the typical, relatively level shot. Still, the effects of gravity and air resistance are the same as far as the bullet is concerned, it is just that the trajectory at such a steep angle is more divergent from the line of sight.\n\nFact or Myth. So, does a bullet rise after it leaves the muzzle? One says, "yes." Another says, "no." Who is correct? Both could be correct because of different meanings associated with the word, "rise." They might argue incessantly, but their argument will not change the physical aspects of the path of the bullet. If they would concentrate on discussing the physical events, they would eventually conclude that they were each using the word, "rise," differently.', 0, 1, '121.52.144.194', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 316, 55152),

While I,m not saying .22 is useless, it might have advantages like size, conceal carry etc,  it is certainly not the first choice for the purpose of Self Defense (SD) or Home Defense (HD). A weapon is selected for a purpose which it must fulfill, else the weapon choice is wrong. I would not like to go for deer hunting equipped with a 9mm (how good it may be) and would not prefer using a .270 or 30-06 or similar rifle for SD / HD. In my humble opinion following merits consideration:-\n a. A HD gun does not normally need to be carried on the person hence size is not really an important factor or an issue (Strength of .22)\nb. It puts your life and life of family members in danger if your shot does not stop the intruder on his heels. The stopping power of any handgun bullet turns out to be a function of its ability to disrupt vital bodily functions, not the diameter or weight or initial shape of the bullet that strikes the victim. For example, the difference in the size of the entrance hole made by a .451" bullet compared to that made by a .355" bullet in an elastic (semi-self sealing) material like skin turns out to be largely irrelevant to stopping power. The principle method of both stopping and killing with any firearm, whether rifle or pistol or shotgun, is the disruption of vital bodily functions. Fatally damage any animal''s heart, liver, lungs, or central nervous system and it is not going to live long enough to bleed out. Fail to put your bullet in a vital spot and you are very likely to have a problem with a man or an animal. That is not to say that some bullet placements might not eventually cause death by loss of blood, or infection, or some other mechanism, but that is never the goal of SD once you want an "Immediate One Shot Stop". 22 does not qualify this also. A well placed shot may do so but not a loose one. A bigger caliber with even less well placed shot possesses the potential to temporarily incapacitate the target and at least buy you time for a second shot.\nc. Another important factor in stopping power is of ammunition which you use. Well designed bullets (which includes most of the JHP pistol bullets now on the market) expand very reliably at their intended impact velocity. The famous 125 grain .357 JHP bullet, the most effective one shot stopper of all handgun loads, penetrates 13.25" in ordinance gelatin and produces a football shaped stretch cavity. This is how the very best bullets perform.\nd. One can keep a revolver loaded for months and months with out doing any damage to the springs etc. This is an advantage of revolvers over pistols.\ne. One does not go for a pitched battle in HD, and there is not a platoon size force attacking you. Hence the element of capacity is a matter of like or dislike therefore pistols'' edge of quick loading / reloading and high capacity magazines is not really relevant.\n\n2. Now it would be fair to conclude that an ordinary citizen like me who wants to keep a hand gun for HD would prefer a caliber capable of delivering sufficient power to the intruder, even if the shot is not well placed, capable of firing JHPs and is likely to be free of jams / problems like cartridge case stuck up etc. My choice is .357 Magnum Revolver. .22 to me is out :)\n3. But please remember a handgun can potentially save your life and the lives of your family. But it isn''t the weapon per-se that gets the job done, it is the person behind it. Skill and determination, reinforced by regular practice, will carry the day. Remember that, as Bill Jordan pointed out, there is no second place winner in a gunfight.\n4.

There will be no issue of cycling and failure to feed or ejection. You can buy a DA revolver capable of firing both .22lr and more powerful .22wmr. Everything will be fine including carrying chambered.\nNow, if you still want to buy a pistol i would recomend to go for Browning Buckmark or Ruger Mkiii . These are better guns and havent heard anything scary about their performance. Just try to use right kind  of ammo if there is any recomendation by the manufecturer(High velocity, Hyper velocity etc.). Try to find a brand and type of ammo by trial and error method that works flawlessly, there is always one even the gun is ammo sensitive. Never keep your mags loaded to the capacity for days. Give your mags some breathing period by rotating them. Always rotate your ammo too that you load in the mags. This will save soft .22lr shells from deforming that can result by remaining in continous compression.

Got mugged twice and a couple of months ago had a big robbery at my place. was shattered!. I am a total newbie and have never used a handgun in my life. I have relatively SMALL HANDS and my budget for a handgun is Rs.25,000/ max. Pls guide me on what handgun to buy. Pls also guide me as I have a couple of more queries to ask all experts as I am very inexperienced .\n\n1) Should I buy a used REVOLVER, ARMINIUS OR TAURUS, used for 12-20K. I have heard that they are easy to operate, maintain and have few malfunctions. Or should I purchase a 30 bore pistol, 9 MM or what. I dont mind a Pakistani one which should not be too heavy. Pls advise.\n\n2) If I do purchase one (if I get a licence) where do I practice. Where do the experts practice and fire their rounds. I read from this forum that it is very dangerous to fire in the air and someone could get hurt. Now, the Karsaz range is also closed. Any suggestions. I know this is a naive question, buy guys pls help.\n\n3) How do u guys clean and maintain yr pistols. Is it hard?. Can I try it myself or give it to dealer to service/clean. How much do u think the dealers will charge for cleaning/servicing.\n\n4) As I am a total newbie, I was wondering if u all can let me know if there is a place/club or person who can teach me or aquaint me in how to load/unload, insert and eject a magazine, use safety features etc before I buy a pistol. I don''t mind paying for the instructions. Or if any of u members might be interested, i would love to familiarize myself with the working knowledge of pistols or revolvers. Thanks and again sorry for a silly question\n\n5) what is the procedure for selling a licenced firearm. If I sell my handgun to a dealear, will he endorse it on my licence?. Do I have to inform the DCO for the sale?. What about the PS?. Do I have to inform them also that I have sold my weapon so that they can update their records as well?\n\nSorry for all these questions, but if u all experts can provide some brief answers It would go a long way for me to make an informed decision reg purchase and handling.\n\nAwaiting yr quick reply guys\nthanks\nSD 26[/quote]\n1) Well if it is your first firearm and your range is limited to 25k, i would recommend you to buy a Chinese .30 tt. It is very easy to operate it and also very easy to maintain, it does not however have manual safeties on it.\n\n3) If you buy a .30 tt, it is very easy to clean and maintain it. You can learn dis-assembling your gun through watching tutorial videos over the net or you can also refer to the dealer to teach you to dis-assemble the weapon, for cleaning it is very easy because there is a variety of gun cleaner and lubricants available in the market to do the job, there are also certain 2 in 1 sprays that clean and at the same time lubricate the weapon also. And if you want the dealer to get it serviced, they charge a minimal of 100rs. to get the weapon oiled and cleaned. \n\n4) Well the basic rules of firearm handling are a must to be familiarize with, they are available at this forum and also over the net. Usually when you buy firearms from dealers you can explain them that it is your first firearm and they can help you in giving the basic knowledge that you need about the firearm, because if someone briefs you about his weapon and it is not the same one you are going to buy then, it would not be of any use because some pistols do not have safeties like the tt and the ones which have safeties, also differ from pistol to pistol.\n\n5) The procedure for selling your firearm is also very simple. If you are selling your firearm to a dealer or any other person, it is better that you go through a dealer. He will take the firearm from you and mention it on your license that, the particular dealer has bought the gun from you. Then you have to get a purchase period from the Dco, which will make the Dco aware that you have sold your weapon and now you need a time period to purchase a firearm. It is not important to inform the PS, the entry in the PS is only for the sake of records, to bring into their attention that a particular person holds a firearm.\n\nI hope this will answer most of your queries.', 0, 1, '203.81.202.113', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 172, 55337),

Got mugged twice and a couple of months ago had a big robbery at my place. was shattered!. I am a total newbie and have never used a handgun in my life. I have relatively SMALL HANDS and my budget for a handgun is Rs.25,000/ max. Pls guide me on what handgun to buy. Pls also guide me as I have a couple of more queries to ask all experts as I am very inexperienced .\n\n1) Should I buy a used REVOLVER, ARMINIUS OR TAURUS, used for 12-20K. I have heard that they are easy to operate, maintain and have few malfunctions. Or should I purchase a 30 bore pistol, 9 MM or what. I dont mind a Pakistani one which should not be too heavy. Pls advise.\n\n2) If I do purchase one (if I get a licence) where do I practice. Where do the experts practice and fire their rounds. I read from this forum that it is very dangerous to fire in the air and someone could get hurt. Now, the Karsaz range is also closed. Any suggestions. I know this is a naive question, buy guys pls help.\n\n3) How do u guys clean and maintain yr pistols. Is it hard?. Can I try it myself or give it to dealer to service/clean. How much do u think the dealers will charge for cleaning/servicing.\n\n4) As I am a total newbie, I was wondering if u all can let me know if there is a place/club or person who can teach me or aquaint me in how to load/unload, insert and eject a magazine, use safety features etc before I buy a pistol. I don''t mind paying for the instructions. Or if any of u members might be interested, i would love to familiarize myself with the working knowledge of pistols or revolvers. Thanks and again sorry for a silly question\n\n5) what is the procedure for selling a licenced firearm. If I sell my handgun to a dealear, will he endorse it on my licence?. Do I have to inform the DCO for the sale?. What about the PS?. Do I have to inform them also that I have sold my weapon so that they can update their records as well?\n\nSorry for all these questions, but if u all experts can provide some brief answers It would go a long way for me to make an informed decision reg purchase and handling.\n\nAwaiting yr quick reply guys\nthanks\nSD 26[/quote]\n1) Well if it is your first firearm and your range is limited to 25k, i would recommend you to buy a Chinese .30 tt. It is very easy to operate it and also very easy to maintain, it does not however have manual safeties on it.\n\n3) If you buy a .30 tt, it is very easy to clean and maintain it. You can learn dis-assembling your gun through watching tutorial videos over the net or you can also refer to the dealer to teach you to dis-assemble the weapon, for cleaning it is very easy because there is a variety of gun cleaner and lubricants available in the market to do the job, there are also certain 2 in 1 sprays that clean and at the same time lubricate the weapon also. And if you want the dealer to get it serviced, they charge a minimal of 100rs. to get the weapon oiled and cleaned. \n\n4) Well the basic rules of firearm handling are a must to be familiarize with, they are available at this forum and also over the net. Usually when you buy firearms from dealers you can explain them that it is your first firearm and they can help you in giving the basic knowledge that you need about the firearm, because if someone briefs you about his weapon and it is not the same one you are going to buy then, it would not be of any use because some pistols do not have safeties like the tt and the ones which have safeties, also differ from pistol to pistol.\n\n5) The procedure for selling your firearm is also very simple. If you are selling your firearm to a dealer or any other person, it is better that you go through a dealer. He will take the firearm from you and mention it on your license that, the particular dealer has bought the gun from you. Then you have to get a purchase period from the Dco, which will make the Dco aware that you have sold your weapon and now you need a time period to purchase a firearm. It is not important to inform the PS, the entry in the PS is only for the sake of records, to bring into their attention that a particular person holds a firearm.\n\nI hope this will answer most of your queries.[/quote]\n\nThanks Osam for replying to my queries. I appreciate it. You mentioned to me that for the first time it is better to buy TT30 Chinese make. Is this a reliable weapon compared to the Beretta 92FS clone?. What if I buy ther Beretta clone. will it be too heavy for me or too complicated to handle for a person who is handling a firearm for the very first time?. Also, I heard it weighs close to  1 kilo. Will the weight be a detterent in shooting accurately, and would it have MORE recoil than a Chinese TT?.\n\nIs it better to BUY A GUN WITH SAFETIES rather than buy a pistol without one like the TT30 Chinese?. How will a handgun (pistol) with safety help me?.\n\nWhat is yr opinion for a very first timer for buying a gun like CF98 or NP 22 ny Norinco.Would it be easier to handle, or same like the Chinese TT 30?.\n\nLast question. I know it may sound stupid. Where do I practice my shooting?. What place would u recommend, if I do not have access to a Firing Range like Karsaz?. Pls yr views.\n\nAppreciate yr quick and valuable views.\nthanks,\nrgds,\nSD 26', 0, 1, '110.37.24.159', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 172, 55415),

Thats a million dollar question. My all hunter colleagues practice exactly the same what  you mentioned. Takbeer and shoot. Collect the prey and slaughter even if dead. Slaughtering is more of a ritual. Somehow I believe that unless a bird or an animal is slaughtered in ALLAH''s name with blood (even a single drop) coming out of its neck it is MAKRUH, else halal. But I think it is more to do with your belief than hunting etiquette. Saying more than this may hurt somebody,s feeling. The lighter part is that many years ago as a young boy once I went with my father for Urial hunt near Kallar Kahar. I asked our village''s Imam Masjid about it. He very confidently said yes it is HALAL but if you miss the shot "to tumhara nikah toot jai ga". On my querry that I am unmarried (then) he got puzzled and then said "phir bhee toot jai ga". Upon this my father gave me a cold stare and I nodded and left the masjid.

But if the hound eats of it, then you should not eat thereof, for the hound has caught it for itself. And if along with your hound, join other hounds, and Allah''s Name was not mentioned at the time of their sending, and they catch an animal and kill it, you should not ea: of it, for you will not know which of them has killed it. And if you have thrown an arrow at the game and then find it (dead) two or three days later and, it bears no mark other than the wound inflicted by your arrow, then you can eat of it. But if the game is found (dead) in water, then do not eat of it." And it has also been narrated by ''Adi bin Hatim that he asked the Prophet "If a hunter throws an arrow at the game and after tracing it for two or three days he finds it dead but still bearing his arrow, (can he eat of it)?" The Prophet replied, "He can eat if he wishes."\n******************************************\n\nnow to answer ur question allow me quote this section of the above hadith\n\n"If a hunter throws an arrow at the game and after tracing it for two or three days he finds it dead but still bearing his arrow, (can he eat of it)?" The Prophet replied, "He can eat if he wishes."\n\nExplaination (to my understanding):\n\nif the hunter has taken Allah''s Name before launching his arrow towards a game animal but found the animal dead after two or three days, he can eat it provided the cause of death of the animal is determined to be the very arrow shot by the hunter.\n\n[b]A humble request:[/b]\n\n[b]please dont take my word for it. take this Hadith to a qualified person and have him explain its meaning to you.[/b]\n\n\n\nRegards.', 0, 1, '58.65.190.126', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 2210, 55628),

I think if once I''m in the situation to buy the weapon, I will insist on paying somewhere around 25k. And I think they are also giving a reasonable rate on Shaheen ammo. 800/box for ....

If you catch up with it when it is still alive, it is essential that you slaughter it properly. \n\n[b]Question\n[/b]\n\n"Are the birds that we shoot with rifles and they died halaal or not? We find that some birds that we shoot have died before we can say the name of Allaah over them."\n\nAnswer\n\nYes, if you shoot a rifle when hunting birds or rabbits or deer, and you say the name of Allaah when pulling the trigger, then it will be halaal, even if you find it already dead, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Whatever causes the blood to flow and the name of Allaah has been mentioned over it, then eat.” And he said: “If you release your (hunting) dog and mention the name of Allaah over it, then eat.” But if it is still alive and able to move then you must slaughter it properly and mention the name of Allaah over it when slaughtering it. If you do not do that and it dies, then it becomes haraam for you. But attention must be paid to mentioning the name of Allaah when pulling the trigger, because if you do not mention the name of Allaah then it is haraam to eat it, even if you forget, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Whatever causes the blood to flow and the name of Allaah has been mentioned over it, then eat.” And he said: “Do not eat of that over which the name of Allaah has not been mentioned.” End quote from Fataawa Noor ‘ala al-Darb. \n\n\n[b]Question\n[/b]\n"Is it sufficient for me to say Bismillaah wa Allaahu akbar when inserting bullets into the rifle when hunting, or must I mention the name of Allaah when pulling the trigger of the rifle?"\n\n[b]Answer\n[/b]\n\n What you must do is mention the name of Allaah when shooting, and it is not sufficient to mention the name of Allaah when putting the bullets into the rifle, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “When you shoot your arrow, then mention the name of Allaah” (saheeh – agreed upon, from the hadeeth of ‘Adiyy ibn Haatim (may Allaah be pleased with him); this version was narrated by Muslim).

(49553, 1680, 0, 'Taurus', 24, '', 1251926226, 'Handgun shooting tips \n[b]\nAlways warm up[/b]\nIt is amazing how many pistol shooters begin a competition shoot without ‘getting their eye in’. Try to do some shooting just before competing, as the body needs time and practice in order to tune in to the task.\n[b]\nGo back to the basics[/b]\nIt is important to always be mindful of the basic principles that underpin good shooting technique, namely grip, stance, breathing, sight alignment, trigger release and follow through. Bad habits are like weeds - they begin unnoticed, but will gradually get a stranglehold on the elements of good technique if not kept in check. This is why it is so important - particularly to shooters who are not coached - to regularly self assess by checking their basic technical skills.\n[b]\nPractise dry firing[/b]\nNothing hides a technical fault better than a loud bang, a flash and a jumping muzzle. The accuracy of your shot will always be determined by the position of the gun at the exact moment of firing. The things that will generally destroy this are poor trigger technique and flinch. Regrettably, many shooters fail to improve their scores because of critical moment gun movement. The most effective way to cure and control this issue is, firstly, to practise dry firing as part of your training regime. As a guide, I would recommend that you actually do more dry firing than live firing at a practice session.\n[b]\nCheck for flinch[/b]\nRegularly check for flinch by having a partner load your gun for you - so that you do not know whether you will be pulling the trigger on a live round or a dummy. This is a tried and proven technique that is under-employed in many training schedules.\n\n[b]Select a pistol that fits your hand properly[/b]\nUnfortunately, many shooters will fall into the trap of getting a gun that they like the look of, but which is a poor fit in their hand. Regrettably, not all gun styles fit all hands so it is important to prioritise one’s shooting needs before making a purchase. The stock of the gun will need to nestle into the hand so that the grip is comfortable and has no pressure points. It is very important that the index finger be positioned to allow an accurate and controlled movement when actuating the trigger.\n[b]\nCorrect grip[/b]\nThe gun must be held so that its long axis lines up pretty well with the axis of the forearm, but will still allow sufficient extension of the finger to allow a straight trigger pull. If the wrist needs to be bent around the gun to allow the index finger to access the trigger, this generally means that the gun is too big for the hand. This follows on from the previous tip, in that some gun/hand combinations will simply not allow correct grip to be established and, in such cases, the combination will be less than optimum for good shooting.\n[b]\nHold the gun tight[/b]\nHold the gun tight but not so much as to affect circulation. A correctly fitting grip will make it very easy to hold the gun tight and control recoil.\n[b]\nTrigger control[/b]\nThis is one of the most important aspects of shooting technique. The trigger should be eased back in a gentle, continuous motion. It should never be snapped or jerked. A shooter who is familiar with his or her gun will, from experience, be aware of the exact force needed to release the mechanism. In preparation for the shot, about 50 to 70 per cent of this force should already be on the trigger. When the mechanism lets go, the finger should be as close as possible to 90 degrees to the surface of the trigger.\n[b]\nFollow through[/b]\nThere is always a small amount of time between the trigger mechanism letting go and the bullet exiting the barrel. The hammer must fall upon the firing pin, which must depress the primer and then ignite the powder, which will burn and create the expanding gas that drives the bullet. Any movement during this period must be kept to a minimum (ideally zero). This is why it is so important to discipline yourself not to move a muscle until the bullet has passed through the target. This is commonly known as follow through.\n[b]\nLet the trigger move[/b]\nfully forward at the same speed as you pressed it. After you have fired the shot and paused for the follow through, allow the trigger to slowly return to its unfired position. Do this at the same speed as you originally pressed it. Performing this task will further assist you to hold the gun still before firing.\n[b]\nBe consistent in your shooting[/b]\nAccuracy walks hand-in-hand with consistency. Try to be as consistent as possible with things such as how you raise the gun to the target, how you establish your sight picture and how long it takes to settle and discharge the shot. Also try to keep the physical conditions constant, such as barrel temperature (this is controlled to some extent by the time between shots) and type of ammunition.\n\n[b]Correct breathing[/b]\nThis is traditionally one of the hardest skills to master. Normal breathing will cause enough movement to disturb the sight picture. The trick is not to think too much about breathing, because, quite often, the more we think about something, the more we allow it to disturb our concentration. Try to establish a cycle where the breath is momentarily held just before and just after the shot. This will in no way disturb the natural balance between oxygen and carbon dioxide in our bloodstream.', 0, 1, '110.37.2.147', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 2237, 56428),

Identifying errors are crucial in order that these lessons be learned. The following chart can help pinpoint such basic flaws in a shooter''s technique by analyzing group locations. As printed, it is for a right-handed shooter. (A left-hander''s chart would be mirrored horizontally.)\n\n[b]Top Eleven Bad Habits of Shooters[/b]\n1. Not Looking at the Sights. This quite frequently is listed as "looking at the target." A shooter may be focusing his eye on neither the sights nor the target, but since he does not see the target in clear focus he assumes he is looking at the sights. You must concentrate on sight alignment.\n2. Holding Too Long. Any adverse conditions that interrupt a shooter''s ability to "hold" will cause him to delay his squeeze, waiting for conditions to better. The disturbing factor about this is that you will do it unconsciously; therefore, you must continuously ask yourself, am I being too particular?\n3. Improper Grip or Position. Suffice to say that you cannot fire a decent score with any gun at any range if you continually change your grip or position.\n4. Jerk or Heel. The application of pressure either with the trigger finger alone or in case of the heel, pushing with the heel of the hand at the same time. Apply pressure to the trigger straight to the rear and wait for the shot to break.\n5. Anticipation. Anticipation can cause muscular reflexes of an instant nature that so closely coincide with recoil that extreme difficulty is experienced in making an accurate call. Anticipation is also the sire to flinching.\n6. Loss of Concentration. If the shooter fails in his determination to apply positive pressure on the trigger while concentrating on the front sight his prior determination needs renewal and he should rest and start over.\n7. Anxiety. You work and work on a shot, meanwhile building up in your mind doubt about the shot being good. Finally you shoot just to get rid of that particular round so you may work on the others.\n8. Vacillation (Plain Laziness). This is a mental fault more than a physical one, which results in your accepting minor imperfections in your performance which you could correct if you worked a little harder. The end result being you hope you get a good shot. Just like you hope you will get a gratis tax refund, and you will get one just about as frequently as you get the other.\n9. Lack of Follow Through. Follow through is the subconscious attempt to keep everything just as it was at the time the shot broke. In other words you are continuing to fire the shot even after it is gone. Follow through is not to be confused with recovery. Merely recovering and holding on the target after the shot is no indication that you are following through.\n10. Lack of Rhythm. Hesitancy on the first shot or any subsequent shot in timed or rapid fire. Develop a good rhythm and then have the fortitude to employ it every case. Frequently many shooters will have fine rhythm until the last shot of a string and then hesitate, doctoring up that last shot.\n11. Match Pressure. If there are 200 competitors in a match, rest assured that there are 200 shooters suffering from match pressure. So what makes you think you are so different? If you are exerting all your mental energy toward executing the correct fundamentals rather than the arithmetic evaluation, your shooting match pressure will be what you feel when people congratulate you on a fine performance.', 0, 1, '110.37.2.147', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 2237, 56429),

This will prevent involuntary movement of some muscle throwing the shot off. The surprise break will be without induced errors. This should be irrespective of alignment with the target, the triggering error is the major culprit.Little mis alignment with the target causes very small errors.\n\nHold your breath before firing. Proper breathing technique for target shooting should be followed.\n\nIn  deliberate aimed  shooting try to release the shot within 5 seconds or a max of 7 seconds. The longer you take the more your concentration, breath control and  stability of hands deteriorates.\n\nMake a position with feet as wide as your shoulders and in case of single hand shooting anchor your free hand don''t let it dangle like a pendolum. Put it in your pocket or hook the thumb in the belt or trouser. \nYou should face the target at an angle which suits your body type, in case of two hand shooting face the target squarely lightly push out with your gun hand and pull in with your non shooting hand.\n\nIn target shooting inhale and exhale deeply and then take a comfortable breath and hold it before firing the shot and release after shooting.\n\nFollow Through\nAfter firing a shot do not rush to see where your shot went, stay frozen, for a second or two and then gradually recover into shooting stance. Follow through is extremely important, in case of a cricket bat , a tennis racket, a hockey if you change the angle of swing after hitting the ball the trajectory follows it as some muscles guide the ball prior to hitting. Similarly a bullet will be effected if you do not freeze for a little while after shooting, the bullet is still in the barrel or about to be fired when your relaxing the grip or lack of follow through effects it.\nA typist first develops accurate typing and then speed, similarly first learn the basics and then build speed. The above are for deliberate Target Shooting which can later be developed for combat/ speed shooting', 0, 1, '119.154.67.35', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 2237, 56546),

Next, smooth the steamed spot with fine sandpaper (0 size). Follow that by rubbing the dent lightly with steel wool and, if necessary, refinish it to match the color of the stock.\n\nREDUCE SUN GLARE\nParticularly in very early morning and late evening when the sun is low, deep shadow movments are missed because of glare on the eyes or on the binoculars or scope front. \nFor the eyes, a cap pulled down low helps. It is best if the underside of the cap''s bill is black or dark green. Most blaze orange caps have this same bright color on the underside.

Seperate the wood and metal as much as possible and seal them well.\nThe most common use of cosmoline is the storage and preservation of firearms. Objects the size of entire vehicles could be preserved for future use with cosmoline.\nChemically, cosmoline is a homogeneous mixture of oily and waxy long-chain, non-polar hydrocarbons. It is always brown in color, and can differ in viscosity and shear strength. Cosmoline melts at 130-150 °F (45–52 °C) and has a flashpoint of 365 °F (185 °C).\nDuring World War II, US Coast Artillerymen (serving the huge coastal artillery batteries) were known as "Cosmoliners" because they were tasked with the near constant cosmoline application ("greasing down") of the guns.During Pacific island campaigns in World War II, the United States Marines sang a song about Cosmoline. Adapting the popular big-band tune "Tangerine," they would sing "Cosmoline...keeps my rifle clean."\nAn someone told me that Pakistan Army also use casmoline to clean or preserve their firearms. But he told that the drawback of casmoline is due to its gelatinous nature cosmoline can  difficult to remove completely from firearms and some other chemical is used to remove it.[/quote]\n\n\nyes! brother, cosmoline was one option that we discussed but with cosmoline preservation we run into three problems.\n\n1. not available in the market\n2. application is very difficult as the military dips the firearms in a tub of melted cosmoline\n3. removal is very difficult and usually a full time job requiring hot water or some kind of solvent in large quanitities.\n\nRegards.', 0, 1, '58.65.191.210', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 2255, 56806),

I will dig out a very fine formula of making  your own  Rifle oil in a day or two[/quote]\n\nSir, CLPs are designed to provide protection against rust for short term only. any CLP (including breakfree) is designed to do three functions at the same time, clean, lubricate and protect. any CLP will eventually evaporate and oxidize over time leaving the firearm without any kind of protection against rust. as far as the effectiveness of breakfree CLP is concerned, Pakguns Lube (my concotion, gained valuable experience in lubrication in the process) out performs it by atleast 3:1 (lubrication data, tests conducted at Scientific Engineering Services-Islamabad, is available against Hoppes and militec and we all know militec is the most respected brand of lubricants). trust me, there is nothing in CLP thats extraordinary. my oil (Pakguns lube) performs much better. it doesnt gum up, it doenst have any solvents in it as well and is full of oxygen inhibitors which we need for extended storage periods.\n\nas far as the moisture migrating to metal surface in a plastic bag is concerned, here you are absolutely right. but i''m thinking we use HDPE polyethylene bags with minimum single side wall thickness of 100 microns (to provide maximum barrier againt outside moisture). the bags will be vaccum sealed (all the air sucked out to remove any inside moisture). the bags will also contain Silica based dessicants to absorb any remaining moisture. i''m betting that such a concotion should guarentee a moisture free environment for the firearms. the firearms will be lubricated as normal. when the storage period expires the bags will be torn open, firearms retrieved, ready to use. no mandatory cleaning, lubing required.\n\nRegards.\n\np.s. when contacted an HDPE manufacturer in Karachi, he agreed that certain organization inorder to preserve ferrous products (even governemnt when concerned with firearms) do order such bags in open tender. he said I was spot on the with 100 micron film thickness.', 0, 1, '58.65.189.200', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 2255, 57000),

As for British shotguns you are right they are very delicate,stylish and from the brands you have mentioned above very expensive. But you can find brands that are less well known and not patronised by the super wealthy a lot cheaper.Recently i saw a winchester Platinum for about $1,700 dollars which received a very good review and is an up and under.i dont know if this is available in Pakistan but this also seem very good for the price. Also webley and scott 12g are good. It depends what is available in the Pakistan markets and it seems that the Beretta/Browning seems a good compromise.

We travel by sea and we do not carry much fresh water with us so if we do wudu with it we go thirsty. Can we do wudu with seawater?"

But the Prophet(s.a.w)  mentioned about sea food too because as there is scarcity of water sometime there is scarcity of food too.

Even it doesn''t resemble a fish in shape but a dog or a pig.\nAccording to Imam Abu Hanifa (r.a) in this Hadith the wording [b]"dead creatures"[/b] means fish only and not other sea animals. But there is no authentic argument to this statement and this is  [b]Hadith mutlaq[/b].\n Imam Zarqani says that this hadith lays down a big principle of Islam.

There is no doubt about the fact that for competitions subsonic ammo is used and is considered the most accurate. Subsonic bullets do not cross the sound barrier during their flight so are not prone to the shock waves of sound barier. At the same time we must not forget that it is not just the velocity of a bullet that determines the accuracy but BC(Ballistic Coeffecient),weight, spin, shape all are very important. Has accuracy been the inversely related function of velocity, the .17Mach2 would have been very inaccurate as compared to .22LR, but the fact is  not so. \n\nA bullet is needed to be accurate and effective too. So, we need accuracy, range and hitting power(energy which is function of mass and velocity). To harness more range and energy(hitting or killing power) we need heavier or faster, or both, bullets that are good fliers(high BC). At the same time recoil of the gun is also a function of mass and velocity. You increase weight of the bullet by 10%, the recoil will increase by 20% same is the case with velocity.

So here a 22 becomes more powerful than a 357 :)\n\nNOTE: In firearms world, power of a weapon is usually explained in Foot-Pounds rather than Joules which is more of a traditional energy meter. \n\nEnergy once calculated in joules can be converted to Foot-Pounds by a special multiple: \ni.e. 1 Foot-Pound is 1.355 joules approx.\n\nLittle about Foot Pound in layman terms can be explained as it is a function of force in MOTION. i.e IF 1 pound of force is in a motion, and yet it moves to 1 foot distance, then the work done is 1 Foot-Pound.', 0, 1, '119.152.38.168', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 2265, 57231),

Long as the ducks are coming in, forget calling.\n2    When the ducks start an erratic wing beat, hit them with a comeback call immediately to bring them back on line.\n3.   If they look as if they may drift off-line, use single quacks and feed calls to bring them back online.\n4.   Try calling at birds as they circle when they quarter into the wind. This will make it easier for them to set up for a landing zone into the wind.  (Anticipate their swing).\n5.   Remember your whistle and mix these sounds in with your mallard call. Youngsters can blow these with ease and feel partly r      esponsible   for bringing the ducks in! The mallard drake sound should not be discounted either, especially on windless days!\n6.   Always start high and come down the scale smoothly with no "start-up note."\n7.   If possible use a call that applies to the species you''re trying to call. Speak their language ( blue-wing teal, use a blue-wing call).\n8.   When team calling, one person should be the leader while the others just fill in. Don''t compete against yourselves.\n9.   Realize that not all ducks are callable and that even real ducks do not call in all the ducks all the time.\n10. Be different! If what you are doing isn''t working…CHANGE. Don''t get stuck in a rut!\n\nDon''t wait, put these points into practice today and be ready to enjoy the current game season.\n\nVery best regards for my all hunters of Pakistan.\n\nSyed Ali Farzoq.\n[url=http://www.huntingmasters.com]www.huntingmasters.com[/url]', 0, 1, '119.152.30.49', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 2290, 57377),

I am trying define best calling in very an easy way. These all tims are in my practice since long time, I prepared for my clients first and now I am publishing here only for the benefits of my domestic hunters belongs to Pakistan.\n\n\nThere are eight calls every serious duck hunter should have in his or her repertoire. Learn these, and you will be able to bring ducks closer in nearly every hunting situation. \n\nKnow Your Calls\n\nBasic Quack\nAs easy as it sounds, some callers never master a basic quack, and then wonder why the ducks don''t come into their spread. The importance of learning to end the quack. "One of the first thing. People use ''qua qua qua'' when there needs to be a clean, crisp, ''quacK'' instead. Stick to the basics and end your quacks, and everything else is second.\n\nGreeting Call\n"I use the greeting call when I first see ducks at a distance. It''s a series of 5 to 7 notes in descending order at a steady even rhythm, Kanc, Kanc, Kanc, Kanc, Kanc," \n\nFeed Call \nFor a basic feeding call, say "tikkitukkatikka," into the call raising and lowering the volume slightly. "I don''t feed call a lot," says three-time World Champion caller and call maker Mike McLemore. "Callers should learn to use it to add variety, but it sounds better to the caller than it does to the ducks.  Most mallards I hear feed calling in the typical ''kitty, kitty, kitty'' fashion are flying, while ducks feeding are more broken up and erratic sounding, like ''da-dit da-dit dit dit, da-dit dit.''" \n\nHail Call\nThe hail or highball call is an overused call in the minds of the pros. "Don''t use a highball within 100 yards of the ducks. But when you do use it, blow high, hard, and loud. Try to sound as natural as you can." If you decide to try your hail call, start with a long, strong, Aaaaaaink...Aaaaaink.., aaaaink, aaainkaink and taper off as it progresses. But remember to use the hail call sparingly, "If the ducks are coming in, forget calling."\n\nComeback Call\n"The comeback call is used when ducks don''t respond to your greeting or you want an immediate response, such as in timber. It''s more urgent sounding and faster, like Kanckanc, Kanc, Kanc, Kanc,". Also, I have found live ducks only call to others after they have flown over the pond or passed their location. Usually she''ll give them only one comeback call." Just remember that a comeback call is fast and hard, with about 5 to 7 notes. Don''t overcomplicate it.\n\nThe duck(hen) is an often overlooked call that can be very effective, especially when ducks are call-shy. The call is nothing more than widely spaced, irregular, nasal, drawn-out Quaaaaink quacks. \n\nSome callers have used it to pull birds sitting on the water for long distances. "You can derive your lonesome hen call from your basic quack. Learn to quack correctly and the rest will come from that, Your call should be spaced out, and quick, with several seconds between. If the quacks are too close together it scares the ducks. And keep in mind that the hen is somewhat low and throaty."\n\nPleading Call\n"The pleading or begging hail call is used to get the attention of ducks flying 75 to 200 yards above you. This call is a series of 5 t o 6 quacks that are really dragged out to sound like you are begging the ducks to land. A pleading call is a Kaaanc, Kanc, Kanc, Kanc sound, and its first note is usually held a little longer. The pleading call is a drawn-out, slightly faster variation of the comeback. Many callers save the pleading call for stubborn ducks that refuse to come in. It''s the caller''s way of literally pleading with the ducks to come into or return to the spread.\n\nWhistling (Mallard, Pintail and Wigeon)\nWhistling works!  swears by a whistle. "Most of our most successful hunts last year were late in the season using whistles in conjunction with our mallard calls. We try to identify the ducks before we call to them so that we can speak their language," he says. "Whistles are also a great way to get youngsters involved in hunting, because there''s no way they can mess it up."\n\nI hope that all my Pakguns.co. fellows will enjoy these calling methods for good duck shooting result.\n\nBest regards.\n\nSyed Ali Farzoq\n[url=http://www.huntingmasters.com]www.huntingmasters.com[/url]', 0, 1, '119.152.30.49', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 2292, 57394),

In flight, the long wings show large areas of black and brown on the flight feathers. It is slightly smaller and darker than Macqueen''s Bustard. The sexes are similar, but the female is smaller and greyer above.\n\nThe Houbara Bustard is facing increasing threat of extinction due to excessive hunting, poaching and encroachments on its habitat, experts said.This migratory bird arrives every year in Pakistan in November and December from Mongolia, Siberia and central Asian republics. According to a study, its population is rapidly declining in Afghanistan, Pakistan, Iran, India, UAE and Middle East countries.\n\nThe Asian Houbara could be extinct within 15 to 25 years if unchecked hunting, illegal trapping and trading of the bird continued at the existing scale, said the study conducted by the Environment Research and Wild life Development Agency (ERWDA). ERWDA estimated that the natural death rate of the bird was 3.28 percent while death due to hunting accounted for more than 73 percent. The rate of hunting has reached nearly 20.8 percent, dangerously exceeding the acceptable 7.2 percent.\n\nBecause of the increased hunting of the bird, especially in its winter habitats, the Convention on the International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) has classified it as an endangered migratory bird. The Houbara Bustard is also listed in the Convention on Migratory Species of Wild Animals, which is known as the Bonn Convention. The World Conservation Union has put it in the ‘Near Threatened’ category.\n\n“If the present situation continues, the number of these birds will be reduced by 50 percent by 2015 and they could be extinct by 2027,” the study said. “There is a gradual decrease in the number of Houbara birds coming to Pakistan each year,” Dr Mumtaz Malik, the chief conservator Wildlife, NWFP, said.\n\nRivalry between the Houbara’s newborns is also one of the factors in their decrease, he said. “The Houbara gives birth to only two offspring a year but the elder one kills the younger sibling due to the fear of having to share food,” Dr Mumtaz said. According to Dr Mumtaz, the enthusiasm of NGOs interested in preserving the endangered species has been on the decline.\n\nLt Col Shams Ernest, spokesman of the Houbara Bustard International Foundation (HBIF), Lahore, said that all arid areas in Punjab, Sindh and Balochistan were the Houbara’s winter habitat.\n\n“The bird is being artificial bred in the UAE, Saudi Arabia and Morocco. But it has to be done under extremely controlled conditions and is very expensive,” he said. This desert bird migrates to Pakistan in winter and leaves in April and May, said Yar Muhammad Khan, a former official of NWFP Wildlife, Fisheries and Forests Department. Covering a distance of about 4,500 to 5,000 kilometres, the Houbara journeys from central Asia and Siberia at altitudes of 300 to 500 feet and lands in Bahawalpur, Rahimyar Khan and the arid areas of Sindh and Balochistan, Khan said. The bird eats flora, insects and earthworms. “The Houbara is very sensitive and does not use the same route again if it senses any danger on its way during the first journey. If the Houbara looses its mate, it takes three to five years to find a new one,” Khan said. The bird travels in groups with one chief. If they loose their chief, the deputy guides the group to its destination. “Approximately 500 to 2,000 Houbara are trapped each year with the help of falcons, nets and other means in the arid areas of Sindh, Punjab and Balochistan. If the hunting continued, the Houbara population will vanish in a decade or so,” Khan said.\n\n\n\n\n[url=http://www.postimage.org/][img]http://img268.imageshack.us/img268/3368/86135872.jpg[/img][/url]', 0, 1, '119.153.52.173', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 2296, 57454),

The discussion and the atmosphere was excellent. Hats off to Omer & Slayer for the amazing arrangement, everything was just right. Omer played the role of host to perfection, the food was fantastic, coffee and timing even better. The part of the GTG that I enjoyed the most apart from the discussion was the Magrib prayer that we all offered together. \n\nIt was great meeting Skeeter60 and Munir Sahib specially, I would just like to say again that people like these should be treasured and knowledge learned from their immense databases of lifetime experiences. I feel embarrassed when people say I know anything about firearms or shooting in comparison to these gentlemen, the fact is, they are in a league of their own. Another important credit to them is that while a lot of people know about firearms and shooting almost all of them are selfish and not willing to impart any of their knowledge. These gentlemen have freely offered to teach any who are willing to learn, I suggest all firearms enthusiasts to not miss this golden opportunity. InshAllah since I will be in town more or less constantly for the next couple of months I hope to learn a lot from them. \n\nIt is always a pleasure to meet JamshedHassan, through gentleman and as obsessed with weapons as I.\n\n@Slayer You are fast becoming an indispensable part of PakGuns, the way you coordinated with people and followed up was great. \n\n@ChAtif It was great meeting you, always is a pleasure to meet people that bring fresh ideas into the box.

The designated habitat which is 100 sq miles (also covering Cholistan) has been leased to UAE for 100 years so we may rest assured this pretty bird will be preserved by sheikhs for at least 100 years. \nAs regards the bag they take home, most of the people think they do indiscreet hunting but that is totally wrong. They greatly apprise this bird and their bag of 200 birds is reasonably appropriate, whereas, the huge price they pay to the Govt & people of Pakistan, especially, what they have done for the locals is worth this bag. \nMy elder brother was in UAE air force and used to escort one of their seven C130s which they used to bring to Pakistan full of hunting and camping gear ..etc other than four Boing 747s which used to bring their families to Pakistan.\nAfter the hunt, Sheikh Zaid used to send his hunted bustards in beautiful decorated silver plates to various heads of the states (mostly Arabs), royal dignitaries and his family members and with each plate he used to send a royal escort headed by one of his ambassadors or some high ranking official.\nThe reason this bird is so greatly apprised ... it''s considered to be an "aphrodisiac" .. or in simple words for my friends, it''s like our "Salajeet" which enhances man''s sexual potency ...! [b](which is a myth and totally a wrong concept)[/b] so unfortunately, in the Arab world, this bird is more precious than a diamond and eating its meat is considered to be a great honor, obviously, since it is far too rare & expensive to hunt. \nSo after having read this ... I would suggest my friends at PG that they should NOT hunt this endangered specie (or they may get hunted by the Sheikh''s guards.... lol) .. and better do a good "GUZARA"  with "SALAJEET" which is not so expensive and can be found easily all over Pakistan ....lolz\n\nPS : I have photos of various other species of Hubara bustard but I''ll have to find them in my PC and upload them to Photo Bucket before I paste them here.', 0, 1, '119.153.68.173', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 2296, 57607),

Method of hunting doesn’t matter, but first scout the area and try to found their fresh digging fields and trails. \n\nAnd at the same day or evening drop  3 to 5 litters of diesel on the trail of fresh hooves prints, time dropping the diesel before your hunting approach estimate while scouting  and guess the hide / bedding area distances from the selected hunting field.\n\nIMPORTANT IS WHEN YOUR ARE GOING TO DROP THE DIESL , MUST STUDY THE WIND DIRECTION, also when you should approach for hunting at that time also consider the wind direction. And always approach to the field from the opposite direction of wind towards hunting field.\n\nThe smell of diesel will attract to the big trophies of Wild Boars settled in that area. This tip you can practice for any kind of hunting method.\nI am posting this tip only and only for my dear hunters, but its also beneficial for outfitters those who are not having much practice or field knowledge of Jungle lore.\n\nWith best wishes for all Pakguns.com hunters. Soon, I am going to propose a Wild Boar hunt for Pakguns.com members purely according to world class professional hunting of Wild Boars. And members will found its not a luxury as many are thinking.\n\nBecause, HUNTING MASTERS aim is motivation towards well plan and guided hunts, and without fear of heavy budget. For, your knowledge updates. \nAlready, Hog Dear, Blue Buck, Black Buck, Himalayan Ibex, Sind Ibex and Pheasant shoots are legal and affordable just against few thousand rupees fee of government, but in fact outfitters interest is always for foreigners not in the favour of domestics.\n\nIn fact Pakistan is and practically can be big market also for Pakistani hunters, government can collect big amount in the sham of trophy hunting revenue. \nHope that shortly it should be possible, Hunting Masters is working for this projects already.\n\nWith, best wishes.\n\nSyed Ali Farzoq.\n[url=http://www.huntingmasters.com]www.huntingmasters.com[/url]', 0, 1, '119.152.25.76', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 2305, 57653),

This piracy was dificult before internet was invented. \nIt''s a pity that most of the European and American agencies who claim to be the leaders of copy rights are actually involved in stealing photos of people from Asia, Africa and other third world countries because they know we cant go to the courts in their countries and claim our rights but they are very careful in pirating photos of their own people because they know they can face the consequences so damn easily when the victim brings them to the court.\nAnyway, I''m so very thankful to all my friends at PG for appreciating my photos and encouraging me to share my experience with them and it was a great opportunity to learn a lot, I mean it, "A LOT" from all of young and power packed boys of PG ... may God bless you all !\nMeanwhile, during this course if I''ve said anything which may have hurt someone''s feelings, (especially, anthrax, omer751, hasnain, denovo, choctalpur .. & others  who disliked my recent comments) ..

It is this behaviour that is part of the cause of the decline of their numbers as they are poached during their migration to be used as training birds for falcons, or for food. \n\n   The houbara bustards are well adapted to arid environments and are able to survive for long periods without food or water. They rarely drink in the wild as they gain most of the liquid they require form the dew on plants as well as from the animals that they eat. They are opportunistic herbivores with prey that includes small mammals, reptiles and snakes as well as invertebrates (locusts, beetles, ants, snails, caterpillars, termites and even scorpions) and plant material such as seeds, shoots, leaves and flowers. \nTheir mottled feathers give them good camouflage and they are secretive and cautious birds. Although they are strong fliers, they prefer to run or to avoid detection by taking cover under a bush or crouching flat on the ground. On the ground they can reach speeds of up to 40 km per hour while in flight they can go 65 km per hour. Once airborne the houbara tries to avoid being caught by a falcon by twisting and turning at great speed and ejecting a sticky jet of foul-smelling green liquid towards the purser.\n\n[url=http://www.postimage.org/][img]http://www.postimage.org/aV1KV9M0.jpg[/img][/url]\n[url=http://www.postimage.org/][img]http://img30.imageshack.us/img30/350/92741283.jpg[/img][/url]\n\n[url=http://www.postimage.org/][img]http://img34.imageshack.us/img34/3372/40276527.jpg[/img][/url]\n\nSource:[url]http://houbara.com/english/conservation-programs/[/url]', 0, 1, '116.71.217.50', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 2296, 57730),

All sports loads are very light like 1Oz (28 grm) or less upto 7/8 Oz (24 grm) so have a negligible recoil. After some time you will not even feel it. At the same time felt recoil is a relative term if you have a gun that fits you and you have a proper shooting stance along some shooting experience even heavier loads are not a big deal. Semiauots, sometime can''t cycle properly while shooting very light sporting loads, although this is less likely in the present scenario of much better semiautos, but can not overlook completely.\n\nSecondly, maintenance of a semiauto requires too much time as compared to an O/U. In the bigning one dosen''t take this seriously, but, after sometime when one becomes regular in sports and get used to the fascination of firearms, cleaning the gun becomes a burdon. Imagine the two minutes cleaning of an O/U without going through any opening and closing of bolts and screws.\n\nFinally the most important part. Have you seen a guy wearing joggers under the Shalwar Kamiz. We always laugh by looking at such person, sincerely why does we do that? Isn''t that guy wearing comfortable shoos? Why we prefer Shalwar Kamiz for Eid and Jumma Prayer? Why we prefer suits for business meetings and dinners? Basically, we have developed some customes, traditions and fashion. Such is the case with Skeet, Trap and Sporting clays. So, O/U is the gun that is used in Sports shooting, you will identify yourself much closer to the sporting community and the sports while following the tradition.\n\nI am also a great fan of traditional doubles, but i prefer classic music over rock or jazz too. :)', 0, 1, '119.152.139.112', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 2315, 57964),

Is there any harm in buying a Sami-Auto for my purpose as everyone is saying I should buy O/U.\nI will highly appreciate all your expert advices...[/quote]\n\ni''m gonna make it quick cause Hassan Jamshad Bhai has pretty much summed up ur options and i doubt it that i can add anything else.\n\nan O/U is the best option u got, recoil is non issue cause target loads do not generate that much recoil and for hunting where only a few shots are involved, one can compromise. similarly on a skeet/trap field where shots fired can go in hundreds, an o/u would last a long time compared to a semi auto. one more thing: cleaning an o/u is alot easier than a semi auto. if u plan to hunt only ocassionally, focusing more on skeet/trap, I can not suggest u any gun other an o/u.\n\ncontinuing Hassan Bhai''s example of joggers, think of ur o/u as a jogging shoes and a skeet field as a jogging track, similarly think of u''r semi auto as formal shoes and a hunting as a business meeting.\n\nwith that in mind, imagine this scenario:\n\nif u plan to jog more and attend less meetings, which type of shoes u would prefer? i''m sure joggers, cause ofcourse u''ll be jogging regularly and u can use the same joggers in a meeting if the need ever arises (i''m assuming that the meeting is a rare event).\n\nRegards.\n\np.s. u''ll find o/u totally dominating the international sport shooting matches. there must be a reason to it, right?', 0, 1, '58.65.191.152', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 2315, 57971),

Face your target squarely, with feet parallel and pointed at the target.\n- Extend both arms out in front of you and lock the elbows. Cup your gun hand with your other hand. Keep your back straight.\n- Lean your upper body toward your target. Your shoulders are squared to the target, head is leaned down to line up the gunsight to your target.\n\n\nWeaver Stance of Shooting:\n- Body is BLADED to the target (at an angle) unlike Isoscles \n- Your dominant leg(mostly right) is a little backwards, and the less dominant leg stays bit forward\n- Legs a little bent at angles to provide cushioning and stability to the gesture, also legs are your shoulder width apart to provide stability against recoiling weapon, body weight is a little leaned forward\n- You hold the weapon with your dominant hand(mostly right) with a firm grip, usually with a bit straightened arm(with elbow relaxed in weaver stance/ IF elbow locked it comes to modified weaver), and let the weaker hand cup over the finger''s of dominant hand while giving support to the frame of the weapon. Weaker arm is bent and elbow points towards ground\n- while your dominant arm stretches forward, it pushes the gun forward, on the same time, weaker hand pulls it back on the instance of firing.. this gives a hydraulic cushion to your shooting stance and is for better stability under repeated shots.\n\nNOTE: These are the two most favored pistol/revolver shooting stances. \n@Hassan Jamshad :) Sir I dont believe in Modified versions of weaver or Isosceles as proper STANCES! They are well customized according to ones own requirements or group of people''s requirements. \nCurrently many of the competitor shooters are preferring Isosceles, but that doesn''t mean they are not in favor of Weaver.

However, the jawans using it in counter-insurgency operations find it ineffective.\n\n[img]http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_htvjsmtPrmc/SqUZAXdPXoI/AAAAAAAACuQ/7BQxTiL3q70/s400/DSC00072.JPG[/img]\n\nAs part of the new Army doctrine, the gun is meant to incapacitate the enemy, rather than kill. Insas has a smaller calibre, which means it has less power. This is because — and it’s the official view — injuring an enemy can lead to enemy soldiers getting engaged in tending the wounded, thus yielding a tactical battlefield advantage.\n\nThe technocrats who interacted with soldiers in the forward areas were told that this theory does not work with terrorists who, apart from attacking in small numbers, are never bothered about evacuating their injured. Hence, the soldiers say, they want to shoot to kill, rather than maim.\n\nThe soldiers also spoke about practical difficulties in using [b]Insas. It’s accurate but not as rugged as the AK-47 [/b]used by terrorists, they say. Also, its sling often snaps while firing, making it fall during manoeuvres. The sling also obstructs the rifle’s sight. But most of all, the size of the sling never took into account the bullet proof jacket worn by jawans. As a result, it falls short and is uncomfortable to hold. This hampers quick reaction. [b]Insas also does not have a rapid fire feature; it shoots only three rounds in a single burst.[/b]\n\n[b]‘‘The barrel overheats with continuous firing. The magazine cracks even on falling, which is common during action. Oil spillage while firing is also major trouble,’’ [/b]said a source quoting soldiers. ‘‘Zeroing (adjusting the sight for aim) has to be done each time the rifle is opened to clean or for any other reason. Lack of proper zeroing hampers the working of night vision device,’’ said the same source.\n\nThe total additional weight — around 40 kg with bulletproof jacket and signalling equipment — that a soldier carries is also a matter of concern, as is the colour of the rifle: they want it in brown which offers better camouflaging. On the positive side, Insas’s transparent magazine helps soldiers keep a count of bullets.\n\nFormer director general of infantry, Lt General Shanker Prasad, said Insas is antiquated and the Infantry needs a modern rifle. The Army has repeatedly asked for new assault weapons, but nothing has moved. It’s learnt that forces are now expecting [b]new indigenously developed AK-47 rifle[/b] said to be an improvement on the original.\n\nsource\nasiandefence', 0, 1, '118.103.229.142', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 489, 58093),

Take that concept of benchrest shooting and apply it to handguns, and you automatically throw in a few other factors that affect each shot, in ways different than shooting a rifle. Whereas a benchrest rifle shooter supports the gun on a rest and uses elbows, cheek, and shoulder to maintain the rifle position, a handgun shooter has only the rest and grip to support and maintain the gun position. \n[url=http://www.postimage.org/][img]http://img3.imageshack.us/img3/4716/81553951.jpg[/img][/url]\n\n[b][u]Modern Isosceles Stance[/u][/b]\n\n\nThis two-handed shooting stance is a natural progression from the bench. The Modern Isosceles Stance begins with foot placement: stand with your feet shoulder-width apart and with the body weight distributed evenly. Do not lock your knees. Straighten your back and roll your hips slightly to flatten out the curve of your lower back. This position varies from its predecessor, the Isosceles, because you tilt your upper body forward slightly. Your head is erect and your arms are fully extended, creating an isosceles triangle. Bring the pistol to eye level. Lean forward slightly and make sure the pistol points naturally to the center of the target.\n[url=http://www.postimage.org/][img]http://img3.imageshack.us/img3/4248/22985429.jpg[/img][/url]\n\n[b][u]Weaver Stance[/u][/b]\n\n Named for L.A. county deputy sheriff Jack Weaver who developed the Weaver Stance in the 1950s, the Weaver Stance turns the body in relation to the target and creates a push-pull tension between the shooting and supporting arms and hands. \n\nStand with the shoulder of your strong (gun) hand back in relation to the shoulder of your supporting (weak) hand. Place your strong foot back, too. Hold the gun toward the target and keep your body at a 45-degree angle in relation to the target with your elbows tucked in. Grip the gun and push forward with your strong hand. Bend that elbow slightly. Pull back on the grip with your weak hand and bend that elbow slightly. This type of grip creates a push-pull stress that causes the gun to return downward in recoil after being fired. \n[url=http://www.postimage.org/][img]http://img3.imageshack.us/img3/8701/30392345.jpg[/img][/url]\n\n\n[b][u]The Modified Weaver Stance[/u][/b]\n A stance developed by world champion shooter Ray Chapman, uses the push-pull of the Weaver with an adjustment to the elbows. Instead of both elbows being flexed, the strong side elbow is straight and locked and the weak elbow is bent slightly and turned toward the ground. The Modified Weaver gets support from not only muscle, but also skeletal support. It is an excellent stance for women.\n\n[url=http://www.postimage.org/][img]http://img3.imageshack.us/img3/9050/69300045.jpg[/img][/url]', 0, 1, '116.71.213.7', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 2323, 58096),

AS we all know none of the dealers even give proper invoices mentioning the tax amounts on the sales they make.  What do my friends fell about this issue?\n\n\n\nFBR unearths massive ST evasion by arms, ammunition sector \n[url]http://www.brecorder.com/index.php?id=958725&currPageNo=1&query=&search=&term=&supDate=[/url]\n\nRECORDER REPORT \nISLAMABAD (September 08 2009): The Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) has unearthed massive evasion of sales tax by the registered manufacturers, importers and dealers of the arms and ammunition during the last two financial years. Sources told Business Recorder on Monday that the arms and ammunition dealers, importers and manufactures had shown low turnover for suppression of sales despite exceptional increase in prices of such commodity.\n\nAt the same time, importers of arms/ammunition have been involved in under-invoicing to evade duties and taxes. Thirty big sales tax registered taxpayers in the category of arms and ammunition had shown poor sales tax collection during 2008-09, which prompted the officials to investigate the whole sector. All units have obtained the National Tax Numbers (NTNs), but are paying meagre amount of sales tax into the national kitty.\n\nAccording to FBR analysis, the tax offices had totally ignored this potential sector for collection of accurate amount of sales tax by checking tax evasion. The data analysis further showed that no dealer, importer or manufacturer of arms/ammunition had claimed sales tax refund.\n\nData showed that 30 leading manufacturers, importers, retailers/dealers of arms/ammunition made net payment of Rs 18.180 million as sales tax during first eleven months of 2008-09. There is a gross difference of Rs 22.751 million in sales tax payment in view of input/output of this sector.\n\nThe tax profiles of sales tax payment by the arms and ammunition sector for the year 2007-08 vis-à-vis 2008-09 was taken for the purpose of comparative analysis. The profile for the aforesaid period reflects that all the registered persons in the arms and ammunition sector are paying negligible amount of sales tax despite the fact that all imports/sales and manufactures have to be fully documented.\n\nIt is pertinent to mention here that the prices of arms and ammunition of various bores have gone very high in the open market whereas the annual sales of the arms and ammunition sector portray a dismal picture of the annual turnover which apparently seems to have been suppressed.\n\nIt is interesting to mention that the values of these items at the time of import are being grossly under-invoiced which need to be investigated and compared vis-a-vis the values of arms and ammunition supplied locally. The collection from this source/sector appears to have been ignored all along by the concerned RTOs/ LTUs. Therefore, to tap the potential revenue from this source there is a need to initiate an in-depth investigative audit by the LTUs and RTOs.\n\nThe investigative report would help in plugging the leakage of revenue in this sector. FBR data showed that a registered unit of Large Taxpayer Unit (LTU), Islamabad had shown gross difference of Rs 16.968 million in sales tax payment in view of input/output analysis during first 11 months of 2008-09. The unit had made net payment of Rs 6.230 million during this period.\n\nSimilar trend in sales tax collection has been observed in cases of registered units at Regional Tax Office (RTO), Peshawar. A registered manufacturer within the jurisdiction of RTO, Karachi has made net payment of Rs 1.501 million during this period. A registered manufacturer within the jurisdiction of RTO, Faisalabad made net payment of Rs 1.114 million.\n\nOther units relating to the arms and ammunition within the jurisdiction of RTO Peshawar has shown downward trend in sales tax payment during this period. For example, a manufacturer within the RTO Peshawar has paid Rs 1.928 million as net sales tax.\n\nSome importers of arms and ammunition within the jurisdiction of RTO, Karachi and Lahore had made sales tax payment of Rs 0.002 million each. An importer and arms dealer of this item within the jurisdiction of RTO, Sialkot has made net sales tax payment of Rs 0.012 million during this period. Another importer of RTO Karachi has made the same payment of Rs 0.012 million.\n\nThe same kind of sales tax payment trend has been observed by the arms manufacturers falling within the jurisdiction of RTO, Rawalpindi. For example, two manufacturers of RTO Rawalpindi paid Rs 0.87 million and Rs 0.105 million as net sales tax. A retailer registered with the RTO Karachi has paid Rs 0.155 million as sales tax during first 11 months of 2008-09.', 0, 1, '119.160.9.178', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 2327, 58145),

We shot 2 medium size Wild boar in between jeep track and Elephant grass belt . \n\nAfter track drive when we returned to the same point we heard snoozed voices of Wild boars at the same dead shot point. \n\nWhen I switched on my spot light, I found that 2-Wild Boars were eating to one injured (injured were crying & other 2-were snoozing while bite). Both Wild Boars completely ignored To The Spot light and to the jeep’s engine sound.\n\nThat was very amazing for us, but one of our senior hunter said he also found once same at Narowal bela area also.\n\nI observed & absorbed lot of while scouting and meetings with locals country wide on my feet from plains to peaks.\nI am luck my seniors and bosses all are very loving and open hearted, with lot of practical knowledge. \nNow days bad luck is hunters are ignoring domestic filed requirements and practical, but talking about internet surfing knowledge. Remember, always every published material on website is not really and little bit is matching to our traditional methods and practical.\n\nSo, for hunters especially scouting is necessary by all means.

Nothing as exhilirating as watching a falcon trained by yourself, match the bustard turn for turn, wingbeat for wingbeat. Although the houbara looks slow, it is not. It  can out fly a falcon in a head wind,  deliver some real nasty crap on it''s face in mid air and also give it a good beating in a ground battle. \n\nUnfortunately, the houbara is under persecution everywhere. It''s breeding grounds in Central Asia have been ploughed up for cotton farming. It''s ruthlessly chased in its wintering grounds. In Pakistan, it is either hunted by the Arabs or it is trapped by the people working for them and then smuggled abroad to the Gulf States. The remaining houbara are shot, out of spite, Pakistani hunters.\n\nThe biggest culprit behind the decline of the houbara in Pakistan is the government itself.  It prohibits Pakistanis from hunting but invites Arabs to do to the same. This is is apartheid, and a travesty of the law. Pakistanis have the first right to natural resources of this country.

Cut four two-inch diameter wooden poles six to four feet long; sharpen one end to fix in the ground.\n2.	Purchase common chicken wire net and cut two pieces.\n3.	Staple each piece to two poles, one pole on each end of the chicken wire net.\n4.	Wave brush, weeds and camo cloth into the wire.\n5.	Roll up each section for easy transport.\nWhen you get to your hunting ground spot, push the poles into the ground forming a shape similar to a football. Then take brush limbs, etc….and make a little cover for the top.\nThis blind can be an easily place and move as frequently as needed. \nThis blind costs very little, it will provide excellent camouflage. \n\nBest wishes for current hunting season.\n\nSyed Ali Farzoq.\n[url=http://www.huntingmasters.com]www.huntingmasters.com[/url]', 0, 1, '119.152.34.3', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 2335, 58340),

No range stuff here.\n\nWeaver differs from Isosceles by the method of hold of the weapon basically.\n\nWeaver includes ‘push and pull’ technique using both arms on the weapon, while Isosceles involves constant alignment (balanced) and straightening out of both arms.\n\nWeaver: your arms cushion the recoiling energy from the weapon\nIsosceles: your arms being relatively rigid transfer recoil to body.\n\nWeaver stance is great for holding the gun in controlled environment. Only the correct amount of tension applied to both arms, tends to absorb recoil efficiently. Otherwise it can imbalance you between shot to shot. If you are in a real life situation, who knows how’s it going to be like? It’s hard for you to maintain that super correct and refined posture every time, varying shot to shot. Either the push and pull thingy goes SUPER RELAXED or OVERDONE leading to, not up to the mark shot placement.  \n\nIsosceles on the other hand is natural body position. Arms are both triangled to the shoulders. Weapon’s recoiling force moves right through middle of your body every time and is being absorbed by both arms equally. Arms are held as high as shoulders most of the time and its again naturally done posture.\n\nAbrupt un-holstering of the weapon and fired shots on target/s **clearly an SD situation**, in here we see Isosceles as a leader in the stances. You can’t be faster and more accurate on targets than Isosceles. \n\nSame quick shots on delivered to different targets, using Weaver stance with accuracy and speed requires ACCURATE tension build up in your Push (strong arm) and Pull (weak arm) strategy.\n\nI am convinced that, Isosceles allows shooter to concentrate on shooting without worrying about maintaining active tension in the stance. Both halves of the body are doing the same thing and the resulting symmetry is easier to resume, especially under stress.\n\nIt is very much believed that, Weaver gives you superior control over ‘shooting on the go’. Being said that, I would say Isosceles also gives you the best pivoting effect. You can move to left or to right in a flick, as compared to Weaver. \n\nAnd don’t forget not to carry out a stance unless you are about to shoot. Very simple logic behind this. Ofcourse one should not run to take cover or strafe while maintaining a proper stance. No body does that. But when you are about to shoot, resuming an Isosceles stance is quicker, and yet naturally build up, provoking more efficient shooting over all.\n\nIsosceles also tends to be the favorite amongst SD shooters and experts who manage to deliver surgical shots within least time. So to get the maximum out of something concept, I’ll advocate Isosceles. Weaver does cover all aspects well enough though.\n\nSo which ever you like, do practice it because without practice it is just crap that will slow down your response in the RED times… :)', 0, 1, '119.152.84.119', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 2323, 58369),

I thought this could be very interesting for our shotgun enthusiasts. This article is taken from [b]Sporting Shooter[/b] by Diggory Hadoke:\n\n                                                                    [b]Classic Guns[/b]\n                                                                     \n                                                                   Holland & Holland\n\nAfter WW1, Holland & Holland sold guns bought from Webley & Scott as ''H&H Shot and Regulated''. They were taken to the H&H shooting grounds and were there shot and regulated before being sold with the seal of approval of Holland''s. The guns were of plain finish and medium quality. The actions are engraved ‘H&H''. The top rib is engraved ‘Shot and Regulated by Holland & Holland''.\n\n \n\nIn the 1950s Holland & Holland sold a boxlock called the ‘Northwood'' (after their shooting ground). It was made in Birmingham by the firms of S. Wright & Son and A Brown & Son on a Webley 700 action. Holland & Holland claimed that the guns were finished in the London factory and shot and regulated at the Badminton Shooting Ground but they acknowledged the origins of the gun in their advertising: ‘This new model is not manufactured entirely at our gun works in London but the final finishing is carried out there...'' \n\n \n\nThe Northwood model was available as a game gun, or as a wildfowl and pigeon gun. It has a colour-hardened action with border engraving and a mildly ‘fancy back''. Wood tends to be straight grained and relatively plain. Bore sizes available for the Northwood were 12, 16, 20 and 28. The Northwood was available until the mid-1980s.\n\n \n\nThe standard specifications indicated a 12-bore with 2 ½" chambers and English steel barrels of any length chosen by the customer. Weight for a game gun was typically 6lb 8oz. The wildfowling version could be had with 2 ¾" chambers weighing 7lb 6oz or with 3" chambers weighing 7lb 12oz. \n\n \n\nSmall bore 2 ½" chambered ‘Northwood'' models were available: A 16-bore game gun weighed 6lb, a 20-bore 5lb 9oz and a 28-bore was 5lb. The pigeon gun had 2 ¾" chambers, whether in 12-bore, 16-bore or 20-bore and these guns were correspondingly heavier, typically 3-4 oz more then equivalent game guns.\n\n \n\nIn 1985 Holland & Holland purchased W&C Scott, who had a long history of making guns for Holland''s. With the purchase came the plan to build a new ‘London boxlock'', starting off in Birmingham in the old Scott factory in Witton and being stocked, engraved and finished in Holland & Holland''s Harrow Road factory. It was sold as the ''Cavalier''.\n\n \n\nProduction of this new model leaned heavily on the CNC machinery acquired with the Scott purchase (production machinery was moved to London in 1989). The basic design stemmed from the Webley 700 but was carefully re-worked with a ''Royal'' type hinge pin and best quality barrels. The ‘Cavalier'' in basic and ‘de-luxe'' forms and was in production from 1986 until the mid 1990s, numbering around 200 guns in total, both in 12-bore and 20-bore. Apparently one 28-bore was built on a 20-bore action. The old Webley 700 was a robust and decent handling gun. It may have head a weakness in the rather slender hook, which is prone to loosening up after afew years use. The retaining pins in the sides of the action, which hold the cocking levers also strip their very fine threads, which is annoying.\n\nHolland and Holland added a removable hinge pin to the design, which may have been a technical improvement. However, thet also dispensed with the hand pin, which was not. I had a pair of Cavaliers in for re-stocking in 2008. The wrist of one had cracked. In order to stop the problem recurring, we had to re-design the whole section, adding a hand-pin to prevent excessive flexing and movement from breaking the new stocks. The quality of the two guns is disappointing: the gold -inlaid ''Holland & Holland'' name on each action does not even match in size.', 0, 1, '119.152.137.220', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 2338, 58372),

There are no computers involved that work is done earlier by ballisticians.\nI am aware that in the Civil sector there are no ranges longer than 50m excep private arrangements and no long range matches.\nThe Army of course is busy training round the clock and being an infantry man this was my bread and butter and one of my specialisations.\nThe ranges are calculated by Laser Range Finders and the range is then applied to the sniper scope elevation dial, the  judgment of wind is a very vast subject and you will have to spend a lot of time on the ranges and shoot to see what does the wind do to the bullet\nWind tables are available for each caliber/MV and BC and these can be applied. Wind speed gauges are available which are as big as a cigarette  lighter   and tell you the wind speed.\nThe problem is you need a hell of a lot of experience to read wind. The speed varies at the firing point and again at the target end and in between.\nExperienced LR shooters know a simple rule of thumb.\nLight wind (speed about 12 Km/hr) RxR x 1/2   here R is range in hundreds of yards\nMedium wind (speed about 20 km/hr) RxR  example 400 (4x4) 16 inches deflection\nStrong Wind   (speed about 35 Km/hr)  RxRx 2 \nNow judging wind speed and direction and angel are the crux of the problem. In case of Diagonal wind you again halve the correction for wind.\nOne way old hunters and snipers use to read wind direction is to put your little finger in your mouth wetting it and then raise your hand and you will know the exact direction of wind.\nActually nothing can replace practical experience. Sniper training is not allowed for our dear civilian brothers it is strictly only for the Army and Navy. \nI have only given you the information which is otherwise available on the net, and some of our experienced hunters are already masters of the art and craft. \nMy sincere appologies to those friends who are masters at this game this information is for our younger brothers keen to learn', 0, 1, '119.154.60.49', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 2322, 58404),

This is an old story. \n\n2- All High end Purdey, Boss and Holland and Holland(currently these manufecturers make only High end guns) guns are made with hand by the top craftsmen, absolutely no use of machines.\n\n3-This article is strictly about the boxlock guns those were sold under the names of NORTHWOOD and CAVALIER. First model was made in Birmingham from W&C Scot facilites and was sold under the umbrella of Holland & Holland.

The committee is headed by Abdul Qadir Patel of the PPP. \n\nAccording to a report, the prime minister largely focussed on a future mechanism which the interior ministry should adopt to curb illegal issuance of arms licences. \n\nSince the government came to power, the interior ministry has issued 28,527 such licences between March 28, 2008 and June 26, 2009, including 6,000 licences which were approved by the State Minister for Interior Tasneem Qureshi over a two-month (May-June) period this year. \n\nIt was learnt that instead of conducting an independent inquiry, the committee relied on information provided by the Federal Investigation Agency. \n\nThe committee asked names of 150 people who were issued arms licences without lawmakers’ recommendations. \n\nThe committee also sought justification for awarding contract of smart card to Mr Shahzad, a private vendor, which showed the committee had taken no special initiative to unearth real players behind the scam. \n\nThe FIA’s initial inquiry had found that three section officers of the ministry were involved in the scam.', 0, 1, '119.152.94.65', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 536, 58535),

Colt stopped producing them more than a decade ago.  Finally I was lucky enough to come across one and made sure I got it. \n\nIt is in *Mint* condition, in stainless steel finish with a 4 inch barrel. (I would not have bought anything above 4''). The revolver itself it simply amazing, a treat to fire. The action is very smooth, the trigger crisp, sights excellent, accuracy excellent and the recoil is very manageable due to the slightly heavy weight. The grips are rubber, Houge like making it comfortable to hold and fire. \n\nThe revolver fires both .357 magnums and .38 specials.

We must not forget following:\n\n1- All big names Purdey, Boss and Holland & Holland got some of their guns made from Birmingham when they couldn''t match the ever increasing demand of these finest guns. This is an old story. \n\n2- All High end Purdey, Boss and Holland and Holland(currently these manufecturers make only High end guns) guns are made with hand by the top craftsmen, absolutely no use of machines.\n\n3-This article is strictly about the boxlock guns those were sold under the names of NORTHWOOD and CAVALIER. First model was made in Birmingham from W&C Scot facilites and was sold under the umbrella of Holland & Holland. The other was made on the machines acquired through the purchase of W&C Scot in early eighties. Only these guns were made on CNC machines. Neither these guns were premium nor company claimed anything fancy about them. \n\nNow 12Gauge sir i can''t comment on your choice of Baikal but one thing is for sure whenever i am going to buy a new shotgun it will be a Baikal, and this is going to happen very soon.

In Pakistan mostly available are 3inch chamber lengths and its absolutely useless to buy a 3.5inch shotgun as 1. cartridges are not available and 2. 3.5 inch semi autos are not that reliable with lighter loads.\n\nhope it helps.\n\nRegards.', 0, 1, '58.65.189.180', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 2222, 58744),

It is ruined by two things if improperly done. CHORD WEAR and ROD WEAR.\nNever pull, a pull through from the Muzzle, always insert from the muzzle and pull from the breach/chamber side\n\nAlways remove the bolt and insert the rod from the chamber side. If you do reverse of this you can destroy the accuracy potential of a rifle in few careless cleanings. The chord and rod both cause wear on a particular place allowing gas to escape pushing the base  of the bullet and causing further erosion of the muzzle . When a hard surface is rubbed on a soft surface it is the hard surface which gets eroded if there are unburnt powder particles which are abrasive.  Look at sand paper it wears out steel when rubbed against it as abrasive material sticks to soft material.\n\nPolygonal Rifling\n\nThe first ever rifling was polygonal. The German H&K uses it for rifles so does Glock. For Sniper Rifles this is not the preferred type of rifling as though it helps in getting higher velocities from pistol and rifle barrels it causes more mutilation of the bullet surface and is not good for extreme accuracy. The H&K PSG1 uses it but it is not as accurate at longer ranges as other modern comparable rifles.\nI hope I did justice to your question.

The main advantage is that the claw extractor will never slip over the rim of the cartridge. It happens when there is dirt in the chamber, the round is over pressure or the chamber or the cartridge case have a defect being out of round, all these things happen in real life,if the fired case  does not extract and eject  you have the mother of all double feeds. When an angry buffaloe is looking at you as if you owe him money and charging at you the Murphies laws take over.\nIf any thing can go wrong; it will. At a time it hurts most.\n\nBrother you do not want Mr. Murphy''s Law to hold true when confronted with a buffaloe, an elephant, a lion, a Rhino or leopard. May be most of these will change their minds but never a Buffaloe .\nThe controlled feed is also extremely reliable at extraction and ejection.

In routine, we send our packages to just one outfitter or a group leader (foreign or Pakistani) for any hunting, trekking or climbing expedition/safari and negotiate all aspects of the trip with one person (middle man) and that agency/person corresponds with all other group members/clients and forwards us the bookings with payments when everything is finalized, meanwhile, all inquiries from our clients/group members are sent to the agency/leader who gets answers from us and forwards them to the concerned members accordingly. This is how we work in routine. \n\nHowever, since this is the first time I''m dealing with a community like PG and posting my packages on a forum I''m a little concerned about any unforeseen complications and may cause any problems at either end. So I''ll make the final  decision after consulting my partners.\n\nAs regards my prices, you may rest assured I''ll not be quoting our standard packages to pak gunners because they are quite expensive, rather, I''ve worked out subsidized prices based on almost breakeven or negligible profits and if I ever make any profit at all at the end of the safari I''ll donate some of it to Pak Guns for promotion of it''s great job it''s doing to educate the youth of Pakistan to understand and adopt the peaceful and responsible gun culture and in this regard I would also like to put in my small fiscal contribution in addition to my support of words.\n\nMy other deep concern is  about the safety of our group members and the people who live in & around the wild boar habitats ... ! Please note, this won''t be a picnic party, rather, a serious hunt done with "REAL GUNS" and God Forbid any mishandling or breach of discipline may cause fatal mishaps whose ultimate responsibility will fall on the outfitter so we must meet, discuss, decide and then draw a firm code of conduct and strict rules to prevent any unforeseen mishaps or accidents.\n\nIt may not be out of place to mention here that since trophy hunting involves a single hunter & he has to shoot just one big game in remote (uninhabited areas) the hunt is literally risk free but since the wild boars are usually shot near inhabited areas and there are many gunners in a group and any careless move, miscommunication or lack of coordination may cause serious accidents, we''ll  have to impose strict code of conduct, discipline and precautions to prevent any accidents.\n\nI hope my comment won''t be reckoned rude when I say that since our esteemed PG members are composed of all age groups (young & mature) and many of us are new hunters with little gun experience, I''ll be most reluctant to take new comers or inexperienced gunners on this trip to prevent any mishaps. \nIn this regard, I would request for the help of our expert and senior PG members to first draw a selection and safety criteria and then proceed to select the qualified gunners who want to go on such safaris. \n\nI know this will be a sensitive and cumbersome job but once we have done it, this will become a standard policy (like as asset) of PG for any such activity in future and all members will enjoy such hunts without fear of causing accidents. \nI hope my esteemed member will understand my concerns over the safety issue ... because it means saving lives so we should take it seriously !\n\nWith my best regards, I''ll revert after I finish my aitekaaf.\n\nUntil ...

Hand checkering in a conventional point pattern is standard, but stock carving and other checkering patterns are available by special order.

Like 2-5 meters?***\n- You don’t have time to make a proper gesture with Arms, Torso and legs...\n- Don’t have time to align pistol sights or to make a Flash Sight picture...\n- Don’t have enough space to carry out these moves...\n- You are clearing a building/house type of scenario…\n\nI came across a new stance suitable for above conditions:\n(BUT DON’T TRY THIS AT HOME)  :lol:\n\n~~~ C.A.R  -  Center Axis Relock ~~~\n- Invented by Paul Castle of SabreTactical Security Systems.\n- Invented for close quarter encounters and low light conditions.\n- Better recoil absorption mechanism.\n- Natural instinctive stance as per natural stress response in humans.\n- Tends to provide you a better position to retain your weapon.\n- The need for speed.\n- Optimum use of cover.\n\nNOTE: The development of CAR was based on the requirements of close-range combat with a handgun. But it can be usefully deployed on long guns as well.\n\n* CAR shooting system works in harmony with the body when under stress and is particularly reliable in close quarter situations. The system was developed to improve marksmanship by focusing on natural visual focal points and gross motor movements. The stability of the shooter is improved by creating a lower center of gravity and a secure base.\n\n*Please Watch Paul Castle demonstrating CAR with Pistols, SMG and a Pump-action Shotgun:\n[url]http://www.sabretactical.com/CAR/car.html[/url]\n\nThe Center Axis Relock Method of Gunfighting utilizes two main positions or stances as bases for action...\n \nThe High Position: \nThe first position is called the High position. It is used for working within confined spaces, from cover, and while moving. \nIt is a very strong and flexible base for using both short and long weapons such as a handgun, shotgun, sub-machine gun, and other weapons. \nIn the High position, the operator is in a semi-bladed stance, with the weapon held or cradled next to the chest. \n[url=http://www.postimage.org/][img]http://img30.imageshack.us/img30/2049/27643616.jpg[/img][/url]  \n- The position is achieved by blading towards the threat while also drawing and bringing the gun up to the chest. When the gun is drawn, it should be directed to the threat for firing if needed. Also, as the gun is being brought up, the other hand should be moving to grasp and support it. \n- This base position reduces the Operator''s silhouette, employs a balanced and stable, yet flexible body stance, and works in harmony with gross muscle movements, gross motor skills, and our natural reactions to extreme stress, one of which, is to bring the arms and hands back to the body, not away from it. \n- The stance with elbows extended, makes up a natural cradle from which the gun can be fired with both hands or with just the gun hand. \nIts framework sets up a circle of control and defense that makes it very difficult for an Aggressor to grab or take possession of the Operators handgun\n- The circle of control and defense is maintained by rotating towards a threat. In a contact situation, strikes with the elbows and the gun can be made, or the gun can be fired.\n- The stability and ease of movement gained by using a bladed stance, along with keeping the gun at the operator''s natural focal point, allows for fast acquisition of multiple targets. \nAlso, the weak hand is up and ready for use in opening doors, clearing the way, and other tasks. \n- The thumbs can be placed anywhere, as long as their placement does not interfere with the workings of the gun. \n[url=http://www.postimage.org/][img]http://img5.imageshack.us/img5/8508/52890087.jpg[/img][/url]\n\n\nThe Extended Position: \n-The second CAR position is called the extended position. It is used for entry, combat, and assault. It also can be used effectively when seated inside a vehicle. \n- The Extended position or stance, allows for high levels of accuracy, as well as very rapid shooting while moving. \n- The gun is held naturally and close to the Operators true focus point (normal reading distance). \n- That is an enhancement over stances that employ full arm extension, as doing that takes the sights out of the Operator''s natural focus point. \n[url=http://www.postimage.org/][img]http://img43.imageshack.us/img43/6439/34262385.jpg[/img][/url]', 0, 1, '119.152.54.135', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 2323, 59429),

(I absolutely suck at skeet by the way).\n\n5. yes that guy in the video did say that, but if u look closely, he is comparing a longer barrel shotgun with an HD barrel (21inches or less) shotgun. remmy is with long barrel and ofcourse its a fine hunting barrel length, whereas mossy590 is with HD barrel. same case with short barrel DSA. u can hunt with it at close range but cannot take long range shots due to the reasons i''ve mentioned above.\n\nhope it helps.\n\nRegards.', 0, 1, '58.65.189.39', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 2380, 59450),

One, that Taurus makes the 92/99 in both rail- and rail-less configurations. Two, the rail-less version was the older version and the one with the rail is now the one being manufactured. From pictures in older gun magazines from the 1990s, I am certain that the older model 92/99s [b]did not[/b] have a rail. In either case, it seems pretty clear that you have the rail-less version.\n\nAbout fitting a laser without a rail: I''m not sure if that''s feasible or even possible.

Dont gimme me recoil reducing pads and stock mounted recoil (murcury/spring) reducers crap. cause thats nothing more than a marketing gimmick and i''m not interested in perceived recoil either.\n\n2. reliability: bro, if u judge the measure of a shotgun by drowning it in water for 30 hours (from the video u''ve posted) durability, then u''ve got alot to learn. thats not durability, thats just being a show-off, any dime-a-dozen type shotgun can do this. I had a 10K pak made semi auto shotgun (by Majeed sons, Peshawar) and I can say "been there done that".\n\n3. Durability: bro, again, i''m having difficulty choosing the right words. but durability isnt something that can be expressed by shooting 10 clay targets. durability is measured/calculated after firing thousands and thousand of rounds. u have to cross the line of FATIGUE FAILURE before u can tell where it is. in other words you''ll have to go beyond the breaking point to know the true potential of a shotgun.\n\n4. hand thrown clay targets: the videos that u''ve posted mainly show a guy breaking hand thrown clay targets. excluding the talent/skill of the operator, this is not a test of reliablity, this is not a test of low recoil, this is basically a test of cycling speed and feed reliability of the shotgun. any working gun can demonstrate feed reliability as long as it is a working semi auto, however cycling speed is a totally different matter altogether.\n\nso allow me ask that question again: do u want a gun just because it cycles fast?\n\nRegards.', 0, 1, '58.65.189.15', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 2386, 59596),

Capture a Picture with your digital camera of the soil pattern/landscape/bushes pattern at high resolution.\n2.	Draw a canvas at Adobe Photoshop for the size of 4x10 feet.(divide it into pixels or in inches if you required), with minimum 300.dpi resolution.\n3.	 Drag your already captured digital picture at this canvas.\n4.	Save it as PSD File on CD/USB.\n5.	Visit to your nearest Pena Flex  printer, and ask for  the 4x10  feet print size. (Price should be from 20 to 35 rupees per square foot) REMEMBER : ask for 600.dpi print output.\n6.	Take 4-sticks of half inch diameter PVC pipe, each with length of 5’-6’’.(You can also use wooden sticks) NOTE: PVC pipes only can be use for soft ground like sand beds. \n7.	Draw a 4-line at equal distance to make sleeves for the pipes. \n8.	Keep each stick at drawn line & cut a piece of  Pena Flex for the same length.\n9.	Past a Pena Flex strip on the both side of the stick with Elfy Or with any kind of same pasting glue comical. \n10.	Make small cut hole , holes will work as view finder for game area, as well as for wind crossing and for better mounting of blind on the ground.\n11.	Now your blind is ready to use according to your hunting area and situations.\n12.	This blind is very light weight and water proof plus long life, its also a good shield against cold winds.\n[u][b]NOTE:[/b][/u]\nIf you are not in practice with,  Adobe Photoshop tools  than you can visit only with your captured desired digital picture to you Pena Flex printer. They will design your print as you need. And designing price is in between 200 to 400. rupees. \n\nI hope that this tip will help to the all hunters and also its best for Wildlife observers and photographers.\n\n\nBest wishes for the current game season.\n\nSyed Ali Farzoq.\n[url=http://www.huntingmasters.com]www.huntingmasters.com[/url]', 0, 1, '119.152.23.162', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 2394, 59619),

I was immediate approached by a man who was having problems with his AMT chambered in .22 magnum.  I could not get it to function reliably.  But I narrowed the problem down to a severly beat up hammer. \n\nGun 1: AMT .22 AutoMag\n[img]http://guns4u.info/wp-content/uploads/2007/11/automag_3.jpg[/img]\nThis particular AMT was all beat up and mistreated and needed lots or repairs.  \n\nAfter I shot a bit I ran the range (I am a part time employee and I fill in as Range Officer when there and needed)\n\nA couple new to shooting showed up with new Glock G19s.  She was very new and needed to be talked through loading, grip, sight picture and allignment, and trigger control.  Part of instructing her I demonstrated that most guns all more accurate than the shooter, myself included.  I asked to use 3 rounds of her 9mm ammo.  She consented and I fired 3 into the bulleye all touching.  Now she has confidence that the gun shoots very well, I know what I am talking about and should listen to my instruction.\n\nGun 2: Glock 19 9mm\n[img]http://www.ssgtactical.com/glock19p.jpg[/img]\nI owned a Glock 19 for awhile and really enjoyed shooting it.  I regret selling it.  I enjoyed shooting one again.\n\nA little further down was a man who about 60 with two much younger men, one I presumed to be his grandson.  He was looking a bit nervous and the grandson was giving him some grief because he was outshooting the elder.  Well, I wasn''t having none of that.  Youngsters got to respect their elders.  So I counselled the elder man a bit and demonstrated the Springfield XD chambered in .45 was a very good gun.\n\nGun 3: Springfield XD 45\n[img]http://www.christiangunowner.com/images/xd45compside.jpg[/img]\nI''ve always enjoyed the Springfield feel but not the long trigger.  I shot well and the grip safety on essentially a Glock design with the loaded chamber indicator and cocked striker indicators are brilliant.\n\nThe two younger men were shooting a Smith & Wesson model 910 and a Ruger SR9.  I chatted with them since I carried a related model S&W on the Sheriff''s department and demonstrated the magazine disconnect on the S&W.  \n\nThe Ruger is becoming popular in Production division of USPSA/IPSC.  I traded shots out of my Kimber for shots out of the S&W 910 and Ruger SR9, both 9mm.\n\nGun 4: S&W model 910\n[img]http://www.gunshopfinder.com/smithandwesson/model910.jpg[/img]\nThe S&W was just as I remembered with a long trigger and odd grip angle.\n\nGun 5: Suger SR 9mm\n[img]http://world.guns.ru/handguns/ruger_sr9_1.jpg[/img]\nI think Ruger has a winner with the SR9.  It was accurate and has a nice trigger.\n\nDown to the other end was a man shooting a Glock 22 in .40 S&W.  He was shooting better than most but was high and to the left.  I talked with him about the chance he was pushing with the heel of his hand a bit in anticipation of the shot.  He picked a new place to aim and printed a 4" group but not as high or left.  I also coached him on trigger control and his next set of shots were almost touching. \n\nGun 6: Glock 22 in .40 S&W.\n[img]http://kevinkurz.files.wordpress.com/2009/05/glock-22.jpg[/img]\nThe Glock 22 and 23 are one of the most popular guns in American law enforcement.  The Bexar County Sheriff''s Department, the San Antonio Police Department, the Constable''s Office and School Police in San Antonio all carry Glock 22 or 23.  They are a nice gun with a chambered for a nice round.\n\nI also chatted with a man shooting a revolver he carried in a wooden box.  One imagines that a gun transported in a wooden box in the U.S. is probably somebody''s baby, a prized possession.\n\nIt was a Smith and Wesson revolver chambered in .357 magnum.  I was crome with gold toned hammer and trigger with Ivory grips.  Very fancy.  The owner offered to let me shoot it... who was I to turn him down? :lol:\n\nGun 7: Smith & Wesson (didn''t get a chance to read the model, looked like a 27)\n[img]http://bushnell.smugmug.com/photos/177717576-L.jpg[/img]\nThe owner reported th gun was carried by his father when he was a Bexar County Deputy Sheriff.  I''v enever really enjoyed shooting a revolver.  But I respect that the owner let me shoot his father''s duty gun.\n\nI returned to the range the following day to check some reloads and met a couple shooting. He had a Desert Eagle .50 Automag and she was shooting a Heckler and Kock USP Tactical.  He asked If I had a Kimber which I confirmed.  He complimented my gun and I expressed envy for the H&K she was shooting.  He offered to let me shoot it... :D\n\nI shot it at 15 yard and I was very, very impressed.  I have never shot a n H&K before, and the trigger was nice.  It was very accurate.  Though I expected the recoil to be a bit snappy since the bore axis was high, it really wasn''t bad.  I can say now that those who are H&K fanatics have some justification for their loyalty.\n\nGun 8: H&K USP Tactical in .45 ACP.\n[img]http://www.ssgtactical.com/hkusptacblk.jpg[/img]\n\n\nAnd that''s how you get to shoot 8 different guns in one weekend... well, 9 different guns if you count my Kimber Supermatch II. :cool:\n[img]http://www.gunshopfinder.com/Kimber/supermatch2.jpg[/img]', 0, 1, '69.148.197.108', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 2397, 59700),

And I am extremely sorry from dealers if they feel this tip can be reducing some numbers of their clients. \n\nBut, please remember that my posts are only in the favour of hunters. I don’t like and will never do Insha Allah  any act or post against any one, my aim is benefits for all hunters but never loss for any one.\n\n[u][b]PROCEEDURE TO MAKE DECOYS OF ANY KIND GAME SPECIE[/b][/u]\n1.	Scan or download & save the pictures of your required species in different poses at high resolution Minimum with 400.dpi. \n2.	Draw a canvas at Adobe Photoshop for the size of 4x4 feet. (divide it into pixels or in inches if you required), with minimum 200.dpi resolution. \n3.	 Drag your already scanned picture at this canvas; crop the additional base colour scheme.\n4.	Repeat this practice for your each scanned picture at the same canvas; adjust the pictures closely to each other. (Remember you need to be a reflected pose for the same picture at the same canvas, means left and right pose directions).\n5.	Save it as PSD File on CD/USB.\n6.	Visit to your nearest Pena Flex  printer, and ask for  the 4x4 print size. (Price should be from 20 to 35 rupees per square foot) REMEMBER: ask for 600.dpi print output.\n7.	Cut the each printed bird shape with scissor; make a pair of each print of the same species (with left & right directional poses).\n8.	Buy  few thermo poll  sheets (Thickness one inch)\n9.	Paste your one printed pose at reasonable space on the thermo pole sheet; practice this method for all your prints at same side of the sheet.\n10.	Take sharp edge long blade of steel or any kitchen knife, warm it on fire flam and carefully cut to the thermo pole sheet with the border line of the pasted species prints.\n11.	Now, your decoy’s one side is ready, paste another print of the same species at other side of the sheet.\n12.	According to number of decoys sheets, take slides of flat Iron bars length up to 6-inches for each, warm to each slid and insert it into the thermo pole sheet at the point of bird foot print. (It will work as decoy stand; you can push it into ground for display of decoys).\n\n[u][b]NOTE[/b][/u]\n•	You can take size of the required adult bird from any URL, when you are going to drag the picture at canvas, you can adjust your required size as you found (birds size should be in centimetres) \n•	If you don’t know, how to adjust the sizes or unaware about Adobe Photoshop;than you can take help of the designers of Pena flex  printers or photographer’s.  They will charge 200 t0 300 for each sheet of 4x4 size of canvas.\n•	Samad Bond is good pasting material for this job. Don’t use Elfy or any chemical like Ely.\n•	Iron slid you can fix in the thermo pole sheet with glue or with Samad Band Also. (after making hole with warm slide)\n•	The decoys made by this method, are 100% near to the original colours and in original size of the bird. These are the best decoys,\nthan the local made decoys are available at shops like Dracula Decoys of ducks. \n\nThis method of decoys making is very good for URIAL,IBEX, HOG DEER, WILD BOAR trophy hunting also, but the technich to display for the concerning hunt is different, which I will mention soon in my next posts.\n\nTry the best decoys and enjoy the current duck shooting season.\n\nRegards.\n\nSyed Ali Farzoq.\n[url=http://www.huntingmasters.com]www.huntingmasters.com[/url]', 0, 1, '119.152.30.13', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 2392, 59806),

I do not know why you initiated this mail and in response to what but I beg to differ with you on a couple of issues. While one may have lot of practical as well as theoretical experience, the importance of further knowledge can not be over emphasized. I have been a hunter since my young age. I inherited it from my father who also had it in his genes. But having said that and having hunted for more than 30 years in various capacities from dove to Ibex and antelopes in Africa (Congo) I still learnt a lot from internet and let me say very openly I learnt a lot from this very forum. From the young lads like KageFox who is younger to my eldest child to the very senior members like Skeeter60 whom I have known personally since decades. And from the newest member to the oldest member like Abbas Sahib, whom I respect a lot. I have learnt a lot. This all has been made possible because of net and surfing. So the net has a sound place in learning.\n\n      Buying a jeep and a gun and going hunting..........I do not see anything wrong in it :) . Unless one shoots indiscriminately and illegally, which I do not think is the case with most of us or for that matter with any of us \n\n     And lastly as far as hunting ethics are concerned, one learns and develops them over a period of time. I have not come across a book like "Highway Code" on this issue. One would commit mistake and would then be corrected by the senior hunter or if he is accompanied by a senior hunter he will not commit a mistake right from beginning. But people learn over a period of time. Few are more privileged in the sense that they have it in their families and they learn from their childhood while the remaining learn over a time span.

Not good to publish pictures like that at this forum, or at any other forum. \n\nI think now my opinion should be clear to many members; why I focused to promote the legal hunts for locals. Secondly, prices are too high as peoples are thinking especially for Hog Deer, Blue Bull or Gazzal. Yes, you can say its expensive if will look always for any host for hunt, but if we will be focus for guided and legal hunts than it’s not an expensive, comparatively foreigners tag prices for Pakistan trophy packages.\n\nIts good step doesn’t publish illegal hunts here.

(52990, 1739, 51022, 'Malik1', 78, '', 1253031001, 'Now another opinion as to why Spanish Shotguns are not famous or have not made their place in elite shotguns of the world and about the increasing price of Spanish Shotguns. The manufacturers to which I am referring are Aguirre y Aranzabal (AyA), Arrieta y Cia, Pedro Arrizabalaga, Armas Garbi, and Grulla Armas. None of these are major arms producers and none have a particularly long history in their present form. As already highlighted by a member that they are all small specialty shops with few employees (maybe a dozen on average) that make mostly bespoke shotguns essentially by hand. Grulla, for example, is 19 craftsmen that produce around 300 guns per year (Says Chuck Hawks). Theses are not the only shotgun makers in Spain, but they are the firms that turned the reputation of Spanish shotguns completely around. In post WW II days Spanish guns were regarded with suspicion. And that is because in the 1950''s there was a niche market in the United States for cheap double guns. The mass market in those days was for repeating shotguns and what market there was for middle and high priced double guns was already overcrowded by American, British, Belgian, and Italian guns. The Spanish economy was still struggling to recover from the debilitating Spanish Civil War that preceded W.W. II.\n\nHowever, there was room at the bottom of the price structure and American distributors paid the large Spanish makers that existed in those days to produce economy doubles. The Spanish gun companies desperately needed cash flow and were in no position to turn down orders, so cheap guns is what they built. Unfortunately for the Spanish makers who mass-produced inexpensive shotguns, the manufacturers in South America, Eastern Europe and Turkey were able to undercut their prices, as the years went by.  Eventually the market for double guns turned around, quality became more important than price, and the large Basque gunmakers who had disastrously misjudged the market by committing to inexpensive guns went under. The few surviving tiny specialty shops began their ascent to international respectability. They tightened their lines, dropped their lower grade guns and concentrated on building fine side-by-side shotguns. That is how the price of Spanish Shotguns started increasing. There have also been a tendency in Spanish Shotgun manufacturers to copy the classic British side-by-side game gun as that had been the ultimate expression of the gunmakers'' art. It took years of hard work since the 1950''s and today Spain is a prosperous country. With increased prosperity has come higher labor costs and higher prices and so the price of guns. With this there came a change in strategy of manufacturer as well. The AYA says "As far as sales are going at the moment, we are chasing supply rather than demand, which is a good situation to be in. AYA and the other Spanish makers realised the only way to compete in the British market was to use the very finest materials. The British shooter demands a gun that will outlive him, as opposed to a car or washing machine that he accepts will eventually break down. Integrity is very important in the British gun market and AYA has made that part of its philosophy." \n \nAN AYA gun''s engraving \n\n[url=http://www.postimage.org/][img]http://img269.imageshack.us/img269/9717/64623009.jpg[/img][/url]', 0, 1, '121.52.144.203', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 2320, 60131),

Accuracy improves because of longer sight radius.\n\nConversely if the barrel is too long the the bullet will take even longer to travel down the length of the barrel, subjected to more friction which would slow down the bullet, the bolt may start to recycle before the bullet is out of the barrel thus releasing the pressure inside the barrel and further deteriorating the velocity and range of the bullet.\n\nAgin it is not as simple as it may sound, besides the length of the barrel the rifiling twist also plays major role in the velocity, stability, and range of the bullet. there are a lot of other factors involved too, but mentioning them would complicate the things.\n\nSimply a bullet fired from a 5"barrel would have longer range than the same bullet fired from a 4" barrel, which would have longer range than the same bullet fired from 3"barrel\n\n\n\n \n\n\n[quote=TT-33]Dear Friends, Can some body tell me How the Barell Lenth effcets fire range of a Gun, either it depends only on the ammo?[/quote]', 0, 1, '59.103.214.224', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 1925, 60142),

Mike Hudson has a totally different view. Which says \n\n"While energy calculations may be of value when comparing various loads in a single caliber or similar calibers, they can be worse than useless when comparing different calibers and different hunting situations. To illustrate the point, let''s examine a couple of rounds, one being a wildly popular high velocity round in wide use today and the other being an outmoded and forgotten dinosaur.\n\nThe .243 Winchester fires a 95 gr. spitzer bullet at 3100 fps in one popular hunting load, producing 2021 ft. lbs (The reader may like to calculate the result using the first site mentioned by me. The calculation is by and large correct for both the rifles) of muzzle energy in the process. Many thousands of hunters arm themselves with .243 rifles and kill an inordinate number of deer and antelope every year. (Thereby demonstrating its effectiveness for such use. The .243 is also quite popular in Africa for hunting game animals of similar size. -Ed.)\n\nOn paper, the .243 also stacks up great against an old cartridge like, say, the .303 Savage, which launches its flat nosed, 190 gr. slug at a MV of 1980 fps and achieves a paltry 1650 ft. lbs. of energy at the muzzle. The informed observer might further note that the old Savage round is obsolete, meaning it isn''t loaded by any of the major ammunition manufacturers anymore, and that rifles chambered for it haven''t been manufactured in many years.\n\nBased on this alone, it would be easy to conclude that the .243 is the far better game getter in most, if not all, hunting applications. As with most easy conclusions, however, this one depends entirely on the application and situation.\n\nA lot of factors may have played a role in the ascent of the .243 and the casting aside of the .303 Savage, but muzzle energy shouldn''t have been one of them. Experience has shown that, at ranges of less than 150 yards where trajectory isn''t much of a factor, a hit from a 190 gr. soft point slug is going to bag a lot of game. At those ranges and on game larger than pronghorn antelope and medium size deer, a well placed shot from the old .303 beats a well placed shot from the .243 every time.\n\nThink about it. While neither caliber would be appropriate for dangerous game, if you found yourself suddenly and uncomfortably up close and personal with a grizzly bear, would you feel better with a .303 or a .243 in your hands?\n\nOut past 200 yards, the .303''s rainbow trajectory comes into play and the less than aerodynamic shape of its bullet compounds the effects of gravity. It is only then that the flat shooting characteristics of the .243 come into play.\n\nSuch comparisons could be made all day, and are not meant to denigrate the many sportsmen around the world who have chosen the .243, or any other caliber, as suitable for their purposes. They are used merely to point out that fallacy of using muzzle energy, or any other purely theoretical consideration, as some kind of be all and end all when it comes to killing power.

A faster bullet will travel further.  This is true until all of the powder/propellent is burned.  If all powder is burned then the resistance of the lands of the rifling inside the barrel will begin to slow the bullet down.  \n\nDo not worry too much about this happening unless you have a very, very long barrel or a very light load, or both.  Most factory cartridges manufactured for a factory caliber gun will not burn up all the powder before the bullet leaves the barrel. \n\nThe flash at the end of the barrel confirms that not all of the powder (propellent) was burned before the bullet left the barrel.\n\n2) A longer barrel allows for a longer sight radius.

So at 2:45 a.m , we went out for a lookaround. Had one A-303 shotgun with sg and one Voere .22 lr. I was driving and my friend was in the passenger seat with the flash light. At the northern boundary of our land, my neighbour had planted Sesame. The plants were 2-3 feet high and flowering. My friend was bringing the flashlight around when i saw some golden brown colored animal at a distance. I thought it was a jackal and went for a look. When we reached the spot, the plants were high and we couldn''t see anything. Suddenly some plants moved at 11''o clock. The movement stopped at 2''o clock. We still couldn''t figure out what it was. Then to our utter disbelief we saw wild boars. AND A WHOLE DAAR. Dude, was I excited to see them so very close. I had the .22 which I handed over to my friend and took the shotgun from him. As I was driving so i placed the gun on my left shoulder, aimed and fired. The next thing I heard were frantic screams. In a couple of seconds, while I was trying to figure out as to which one I got, I saw The Mama boar coming at 1''o clock. Boy, was she big. Just a bit shorter than an adult donkey. First, i thought she was going to attack. Adult usually do when fired at. But, probably she was coming to check out on the screaming one. I tried to get an aim but it was difficult as the side view mirror and the windscreen''s frame was in my way. I fired a second shot just by pointing the gun towards her, without taking an aim. I missed and she turned around and ran away. Then, we turned our attention towards the screaming one and to my surprise i got two. TWO IN ONE SHOT. That is a first for me. The screaming one seemed young. He/she got hit in the hind legs and was trying to get up but couldn''t. I looked at the other one (at whom I aimed). He/she was bigger and was down as well, hit above his front leg. It was moving it''s front legs as if running, while lying on it''s side. I fired an sg shot in his head and he stopped moving. Now I handed the shotgun over to my friend and took the .22 . Fired a few rounds at the little fellow and he stopped moving as well. We went around but couldn''t find anything else. We turned around towards the Dera and got a Rabbit on the way. He was still alive when we got home and slaughtered it. We thought we might get lucky again and went to have a look at the dead one''s BUT no one came to eat them. \n\nWhat made this hunting episode so special and prompted me to share it with you guys was the fact that we had a kill within 5-7 min. And it was totally unplanned. Sometimes, on planned hunts with guides, I have had to spend the whole night without finding anything. Such is the nature of hunting.\n\nWell!! I have written an essay!

But if the hound eats of it, then you should not eat thereof, for the hound has caught it for itself. And if along with your hound, join other hounds, and Allah''s Name was not mentioned at the time of their sending, and they catch an animal and kill it, you should not ea: of it, for you will not know which of them has killed it. And if you have thrown an arrow at the game and then find it (dead) two or three days later and, it bears no mark other than the wound inflicted by your arrow, then you can eat of it. But if the game is found (dead) in water, then do not eat of it." And it has also been narrated by ''Adi bin Hatim that he asked the Prophet "If a hunter throws an arrow at the game and after tracing it for two or three days he finds it dead but still bearing his arrow, (can he eat of it)?" The Prophet replied, "He can eat if he wishes."\n******************************************\n\nnow to answer ur question allow me quote this section of the above hadith\n\n"If a hunter throws an arrow at the game and after tracing it for two or three days he finds it dead but still bearing his arrow, (can he eat of it)?" The Prophet replied, "He can eat if he wishes."\n\nExplaination (to my understanding):\n\nif the hunter has taken Allah''s Name before launching his arrow towards a game animal but found the animal dead after two or three days, he can eat it provided the cause of death of the animal is determined to be the very arrow shot by the hunter.\n\n[b]A humble request:[/b]\n\n[b]please dont take my word for it. take this Hadith to a qualified person and have him explain its meaning to you.[/b]\n\n\n\nRegards.[/quote]', 0, 1, '59.103.213.63', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 2210, 60668),

This handy device is easy to construct and has marked advantages over other types of camp fire constructs. Once you make a Dakota fire hole and try it out, you may choose to use this method on a regular basis.\nMaking a Dakota Fire Hole is initially more labor intensive than simply building a fire on the surface of the ground. However the outlay in energy required to make a Dakota fire hole is more than offset by its efficient consumption of fuel; it greatly reduces the amount of firewood required to cook meals, treat water to destroy pathogens, or warm your body.\nThe Dakota fire hole is a valuable wilderness survival aid because it burns fuel more efficiently, producing hotter fires with less wood. In many areas firewood is scarce or requires a large amount of time and expenditure of energy in foraging to obtain it. Once you build a fire, efforts are better spent attending to your other wilderness survival needs rather than in the constant gathering of firewood \nOther advantages of the Dakota fire hole are that it creates a kind of woodstove with a stable platform that is very convenient to cook over.\nShould you need to conceal your fire, the fire hole will limit the amount of visible smoke that rises from the fire, since the fuel wood is burning hotter and more efficiently. The pit will also help conceal the light emitted from your fire, especially at night when even a single candle flame can be seen from miles away.\n[u][b]Where to Build a Dakota Fire Hole[/b][/u]\nBefore you start to dig your Dakota fire hole you should scout out an area where soil conditions are conducive to its proper construction. You will want to avoid areas\n•	that are rocky and difficult to dig. \n•	with thick tree roots that require cutting. \n•	that are wet or where a dug hole will fill with water. \n•	With soil conditions such as dry loose sand that will not hold shape as it is dug into.\n•	The usual requirements related to general fire craft and care always apply. As always, treat the wilderness areas you enjoy and count on to survive with respect. Be sure you do not make a Dakota Fire Hole in conditions where out of control wild fires are a possibility and avoid ecologically sensitive areas. Try not to injure the roots of trees and plants.\n•	Follow local ordinances regarding the making of fires; these rules are in place for good reason\n\n[u][b]Making a Dakota Fire Hole[/b][/u]\nNow that we have the introduction taken care of, we can make a Dakota Fire Hole. As shown in the picture, I am using an army folding shovel to dig with. Many wilderness survivors carry a small hand trowel for the burying of human wastes and this also works well. A strong stick or part from your mess kit can also be utilized for digging holes in a pinch; survival experts are experts at innovation so use whatever means you have available.\n[u][b]Making the Fire Pit Chamber[/b][/u]\nHaving selected a likely area in which to dig the fire hole, first remove a plug of soil and plant roots in the form of a circle about 10 or 12 inches in diameter. Continue digging straight down to a depth of about one-foot being sure to save the plug and the soil you removed for replacement later on.\n\nThis part of the Dakota fire hole will serve as the main chamber that contains the fire. I prefer to extend the base of the fire chamber outward a couple of inches in all directions so that it can accommodate longer pieces of firewood. This saves time and energy in breaking up firewood into suitable lengths, and also has the effect of allowing larger and therefore hotter fires.\nThe effect is a jug-shaped hole at the base of which you place firewood. The neck of the jug will serve as a chimney of sorts the function of which is to increase the draft and concentrate the heat of the fire into the small opening.\n[u][b]Making the Fire Hole Airway[/b][/u]\nNow comes the key component of the Dakota hole that makes this fire making method so effective; the airway.\nBefore you start on the airway tunnel, determine the general direction of the wind. If the wind is too light to easily ascertain its direction you can often lick a finger and hold it up, being sure it is away from any obstructions. Evaporative cooling on one side or the other of your appendage will be felt from which direction the wind, however light, is blowing. That is the side of the fire hole on which to construct the airway.\nDig a 6-inch diameter airway tunnel starting about one foot away from the edge of the fire hole. Angle its construction so that the tunnel intersects with the base of the fire chamber as shown in the diagram and picture. As when you made the fire hole section, be sure to save the plug containing the vegetation and roots as well as the loose soil you remove.\n[u][b]Using the Dakota Fire Hole[/b][/u]\nNow that the Dakota Fire Hole is properly constructed, you can partially fill the fire pit chamber with dry combustible kindling materials and light the fire.\nTo start the fire I am using a FireSteel, the kind Survival Topics highly recommends to be included in every survival kit. These firesteels from FireSteel.com work even when wet and will literally light thousands of fires before wearing out – try doing that with matches or a lighter! We sell high quality Firesteels at the lowest prices in the Survival Supplies section of this website. Help support this website and buy them here - I guarantee a quality product.\nOnce the flame is going strong, drop it into the fire pit so that it catches the kindling on fire; gradually add sticks so that a strong hot fire is maintained.\n[u][b]How a Dakota Fire Hole Works[/b][/u]\nThe accompanying diagram shows the secret of what makes the Dakota Firehole so effective. As the fire burns, the hot air that is created goes up through the fire hole “chimney”. This creates a suction action that forcefully draws air down through the tunnel and into the base of the fire. The draft is increased even more by your having constructed the tunnel on the side from which the prevailing wind is coming.\nActing as a kind of bellows, the flames are continuously fanned and the fire burns hotter and more efficiently than a fire that is simply made on the surface to the ground. Hotter fires mean less smoke. In addition, the heat of the fire is concentrated into an upward direction where you can better capture it for use. This allows you to do more with less wood – an excellent survival fire by any measure.\n[u][b]Fire Hole Improvements[/b][/u]\nOnce you have made the Dakota fire hole you can easily set up a cooking surface for pots and pans by laying several parallel green sticks across the fire pit as show in the picture. Lacking camp cooking gear you can also find a flat rock that only partially covers the hole – and use it as a sort of hobo frying pan.\n[u][b]Campfire Cleanup[/b][/u]\nWhen it is time to leave the area, be a responsible wilderness survivor who values the land you need for survival. Fill in the Dakota fire hole with the dirt you removed and saved when you were constructing it. Then replace the cap of vegetation. Doing so serves the double purpose of extinguishing the fire and leaving as little trace of your visit as possible.\nIn summary, the main advantages of using a Dakota Fire Hole include:\n•	burns hotter \n•	with less fuel \n•	producing less smoke \n•	less light visible to those you do not want to find you \n•	providing a stable cooking surface \n•	easy extinguishing of the fire \n•	and removal of evidence you have been there when you are preparing to leave.\nThere can be no doubt, making the Dakota Fire Hole one of the best types of survival fires you can make when surviving in the wilderness.\n\nWill post the pics soon,as the Image Posting software is not working right now.\n[url=http://www.postimage.org/][img]http://img198.imageshack.us/img198/9633/75987733.jpg[/img][/url]\n\n[url=http://www.postimage.org/][img]http://img34.imageshack.us/img34/1810/12269177.jpg[/img][/url]\n[url=http://www.postimage.org/][img]http://img10.imageshack.us/img10/6929/64865163.gif[/img][/url]\n\n[url=http://www.postimage.org/][img]http://img34.imageshack.us/img34/6261/97043809.jpg[/img][/url]', 0, 1, '203.82.55.18', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 1858, 60791),

I had to sit with him, and was so scared cuz i had played one match and scored only 4 runs. I thought I was going to get a scolding. Imran Bhai turned me and said. "Yar!

Don''t you even know? What kinda fool are you that you don''t  know that already?! I''m awesome. That''s it. Simple. I have to work with  fools all the time so my awesomosity gets all the more vivid and  outstanding. Yeah, that. Go play with your toys, kid.\n\n[B]2. Please indicate your key work accomplishments and achievements from the past 12-18 months.[/B]\n\n    Whatever, fool! I have endured working in this crappy office and these  stupid people for the past 18 months or so. Ain''t that a major  accomplishment in itself? I mean ... really! An awesome, girl like  myself, working with fools I have all around me all the time. Darn! I  should get an immediate increment of 70% in my salary just for that one  thing. Are you in the account dept? Hey! If you are, we can get away  with a major "work" behind the curtain. You know what I''m saying? ;)  Here''s my personal cell number. Ring me some day. Maybe we can go on a  date or something.\n\n[B]3. What are your short term career goals (0-3 years)?[/B]\n\n    I want to learn how to smoke! God, I just lovvve smoking. Every night I  lay in my bed with the ciggy and the lighter and I keep trying smoking.  But I know I have to join a professional institution for that. An  amazing skill like that can''t be learnt at home :(\n\n   I want to  stab John (he''s my stupid boss). He keeps giving me work while I''m at  the office. He also never gives me proper "attention" no matter how hard  I try. Once I went to work in miniskirt and half sleeves in winter, but  the idiot just looked at me and offered to arrange a gas heater at my  desk. The douchebag has no idea how to treat a lady!\n\n   I also  want to stab Rosaline (that biatch is my boss'' personal secretary). No  matter how hard I try, she always looks and smells better than me. John  never even looks at me the second time after he''s seen that biatch. Oh I  want to stab her sooo hard! The cheap birch needs die in pain!\n\n    I want to shoot Fernando. He''s the head of the accounts department. I  tried to make a "deal" with him about some experimentation with the  company''s funds, but the idiot just refused and threatened to inform the  officials in case I didn''t stop. Damn! How much I have had to try to  convince him I was joking. He will learn the truth after I''m through  sending 6 bullets in his chest. That mofo son of a ...!\n\n[B]4. What are your long term career goals (3+ years)?[/B]\n\n    What the hell?! Do you want me to shoot you with Fernando, too? What do  you think I typed in the above field? Were you sleeping or something?\n\n[B]5. What development activities and/ or needs are required to help in achieving your career goals?[/B]\n\n    I need to learn smoking! Damn, didn''t I mention it already?! Hell,  every time I mention it, I can''t stop crying. Oh Goodness! When ... just  WHEN will I learn this awesome skill? Man, every time I see guys  exhaling smoke, the smoker inside me just ... ugh ... forget it!\n\n    I also need to learn how to use a gun. I mean ... I know how they use  in the movies and all, but I''ve never held a real gun in my hands. My ex  once bought a gun for home security but I was too terrified to touch  it. That was none of my fault, though. It was all black and he said IT  SHOOTS BULLETS! Like ... really! I hope the same institution which  teaches smoking will also teach me handling guns. If you know a joint  course for both these skills, drop me a text. My personal cell number is  given at the end.\n\n   Ummm ...

His only attacking and defending organ is the horns, specially so when he is got child. This is done by throwing his head whereby he causes the weapons to be paralleled to the ground of the earth and instantly proceed with great velocity forwards. He has got tails also,situated in the backyard, but not like similar animals. It has hairs on the other end of the other side.

In the previous 9 years I had heard of no accidents, then two in month at the same range (there are 5 in the San Antonio, TX area)\n\nSituation 1:  A man competing in a 3-gun match switched from carbine to handgun.  While drawing the handgun he placed his finger onto the trigger and fired a round through his calf.\n\nSituation 2: A man competing in a USPSA match drew his handgun while moving to the place where he wanted to be to shoot.  He also placed his finger on the trigger and fired a round through his knee.  He had "pinned" the grip safety.  He also had to have thumbed off the thumb safety.\n\nAs with most "problems" with guns, whether it be with inaccuracy or negligent discharges- it''s the jerk on the trigger.\n\nI tell my students that if you tell a gun to go bang, it will try to go bang.  Guns do not go bang by themselves.[/quote]\n\n\nTo me both incidents seem result of AFTER MARKET PERFORMANCE PARTS which competitors use to smoothen their trigger pull etc. And I am sure when changing the parts most of the shooters donot change their previous gun handling habit.[/quote]\n\nI humbly submit that if this where to be true then their previous gun handling habits were wrong.\n\nI understand that they were competitive shooters can distract and lead one to believe it was the "race" equipment, the "shoot faster" guns, but please consider:\n\nPeople too frequently wish to blame the machine or parts instead of the shooter.  These two experienced shooters did what they were not supposed to do:\n\nThey placed their finger on the trigger when they were not ready to shoot.\n\nWhen you place your finger on the trigger you are telling the gun to go bang.\n\nMy Kimber''s trigger has been worked on and requires only 2.5 lbs of pressure to fire it.  I''ve never Negligently Discharged the gun on the draw because I never put my finger on the trigger on the draw.  \n\nIf the two shooters hadn''t placed their finger on the trigger (the bad habit, the unsafe habit) when they weren''t ready to shoot, they wouldn''t have shot when they were unready.  It wouldn''t have mattered if it were a 2.5 lb trigger or 9.5 lb trigger.  No pressure on the trigger is no pressure on the trigger.\n\n\ncaveat: I think pinning the grip safety on a gun is stupid, mechanical malfunctions and poor gun-smithing could produce an accidental discahrge, but that wasn''t the case in the two shootings we had here.', 0, 1, '144.160.98.31', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 1797, 60964),

It has its own following in the US, as is generally known as a downright decent handgun. Which incidentally says a lot since its made in East Europe.\n\nFNP-45 is a new relatively newly designed handgun by FN. But I have not seen favorable reviews as regards their build quality. But this is not a first hand opinion. I have not seen one in Pakistan.\n\nThe Chinese handgun I believe is now their military standard issue. I think it uses a proprietary caliber (correct me if I am wrong here), which is why probably it has aroused less than significant interest in our corner of the world. \n\nFNs Five SeveN being on top is a bit of a surprise for me and now I am doubting the video authors expertise in handgun ratings (even though two of my fav handguns did pretty well in his ratings). It may sound as a great handgun, but in my opinion it is a bit flawed. \n\nReason I''m saying this is because, firstly, you cannot get the AP ammo (SS190 or something I cant remember numbers n stuff). So there goes penetration out of the window.\n\nSecondly, for these small calibers to work, they need adequate velocity in order to tumble and yaw when they change medium (from air to human). While that may be achieved through a rifle, the handgun barrel hardly accelerates the projectile to reach velocities than enable it to tumble upon impact. What you are left with is a fancy .22 magnum.\n\nSo basically, its not penetrating, and its not yawing, and its not fast enough. Add to that its expensive, and the bullets still more expensive. Unless you have a large supply of the military grade ammo, it has little use for the average person.\n\nOn the plus side though, It must be easier to take head shots due to lower recoil.

It was designed by Robert Hillberg, based on earlier work on the Hillberg Insurgency Weapon.\n\nManufactured by the now defunct COP Inc. of Torrance, California, the double action COP packed the power of 4 rounds of short-barreled .357 magnum in a package only slightly larger than the typical .25 ACP pistol, which made it a good choice for a defensive weapon or a police backup gun.\n\nCOP stood for Compact Off-Duty Police.\n\n[b][u]Specifications[/u][/b]\n\n* Caliber: .357 Magnum (Can fire .38 Special as well.)\n* Weight: 1.75 lb (0.8 kg) empty.\n* Height: 4.1 inches (10.4 cm).\n* Length: 5.6 inches (14.2 cm).\n* Width: 1.062 inches (2.7 cm).\n* Action: Break-open with extractors for reloading, double action trigger with rotating firing pin selector.\n\n[b][u]Construction and operation of the COP 357[/u][/b]\n\nThe C.O.P. 357 is quite robust in design and construction. It is made of solid stainless steel components. The pistol actually has a unique 4-into-1 barrel. Cartridges are loaded into the four separate chambers by sliding a latch that "pops-up" the barrel for loading purposes, similar to top-break shotguns. Each of the four chambers has its own dedicated firing pin. It uses an internal hammer, which is activated by depressing the trigger to hit a ratcheting/rotating striker that in turn strikes one firing pin at a time. Older "pepperboxes" also used multiple barrels, but the barrels were the part that rotated. The COP 357 is unique in that it uses the ratcheting/rotating striker, which is completely internal, to fire each chamber in sequence.\n\nTwo frequent complaints about the COP 357 are that it is too heavy to be used as a backup gun, and that the trigger pull is too heavy for rapid fire—even heavier than most modern revolvers.\n\n[u][b]User Manual[/b][/u]\n[url]http://technoace.net/cop.pdf[/url]\n\nVideo Links:\n[url]http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQM-wERs-VE[/url]\n\n[img]http://www.tucsonguns.com/pic/2007-7/00-7-20-07-112.jpg[/img]\n[img]http://www.tucsonguns.com/pic/2007-7/00-7-20-07-126.jpg[/img]\n[img]http://www.tucsonguns.com/pic/2007-7/00-7-20-07-117.jpg[/img]\n[img]http://www.tucsonguns.com/pic/2007-7/00-7-20-07-122.jpg[/img]\n\nSource: \n[url]http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COP_357_Derringer[/url]\n[url]http://www.gunwebsites.com/Articles.php?action=detail&g=content1185154434[/url]', 0, 1, '119.73.3.81', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 2464, 61157),
