I forced him to tell me who will way forthe repairs but he kept dogging the answer.[/quote]\n\nYou''re right, but that is mainly due to customs, etc. Weapons would have been far more expensive if warranty was included. The base price, that is before taxation, is pretty low, and if it is the same as international prices, it''s the importers who''re bagging the extra,[b] by accepting non-warranted goods at low prices, and selling at the price of warranted. [/b] :) \n\nFurthermore, may I add, in order to make warranty service effective, it would be required that all international brands/makers have a local service center, where the complaints could be dealt with. You cannot expect that a weapon would be sent back all the way to the country from where it was exported, to address the fault. That is one major issue.  :) \n\nTo be honest - and I mean no offence - giving warranties to Pak Market would bankrupt the makers!  ;)[/quote]\n\nIF thats the Case then there shud be serious Doubts abt the products that are being imported without warranties!!\nthats actually pretty alarming!\nRefurbed, used, defective pieces Might be coming in and the poor customer is getting Ripped off.\n\nAlso i honestly dont understand How one weapons Priced 500-600 USD is Sold at 300k and Another Priced 600-700K is Sold at 90k, and yet others priced 300-400 USD are Sold at 40-55k price ranges.....its all hanky panky if u ask me....and we as Customers shud ask For warranties.( its pretty unlikely well need t use them, but its a Right that we are being denied)\n\nRegards.', ''),

Well, as regards your first example of the $5-600 gun at $300, it only confirms my opinion above, that this is due to non-warranted items.\n\nAs regards the $700 gun at 90K, I feel, the price of the CZ''s in the USA has deliberately been kept high, as to give local US guns, a fairer chance, even though CZ has a US manufacturer/distributor base, whatsoever. \n\nA $500K Glock is for $3000K here, now this is quite a different scenario, where export restrictions come into the play.\n\nSo, as you can see, no matter how much we ponder on these  market variables, getting any wiser is literally impossible, only fact ascertainable being that just pay your way through to your desired item!!\n\nIndeed, the customer is the Bakra here, and I agree warranties should be included.

Also, they are not made with sophistication and lack in the use of modern equipment. Now, your gun (local or imported) may fire those rounds but with the passage of time they will destroy your gun. \nTake example of a car. If you fill up the tank of your car with good quality fuel (the one recommended by the manufacturer too) then it will not only give you good mileage but also keep your car trouble free. On the other hand, if you use lower grade fuel then although your car will run on it but it won''t give you good mileage and may create unexpected trouble in various components of your car.', ''),

The Slides are another story.\r\nIf all makers strive to make the pistols as best as they can and proudly display their own name instead of fake Chinese/Russian,Polish names etc I would be the first to buy one. There should be an organisation in Dara Adam Khel which my close friends lovingly call as Adam only on the basis of BSA which was formed in England as so many gun makers were making guns in a cottage industry in the 1920s to 40s; just like we are doing now.

(373717, ' Wswrwb\n\nDepends on your needs. I use it for plinking and against lizards. Power isn''t that great (lesser than local Rainbow airgun I have) and is acceptable for shorter distances... buts it''s comparatively easy to load than Rainbow hence lesser strain on your shoulders.\n\nThat being said, I read somewhere here that to roughly judge FPS of your gun, load and insert a palette, fire at floor from a short distance (1 inch or 1 feet I''m forgetting). Then look at the fired palette. If it is only deformed, then FPS is likely to be less, and if it is as flat as a sticker, then you''re talking 700+ FPS. \n\nFortunately, when done with this gun (1 inch distance approx), my palette (Iranian) was nearly as flat as a sticker.\n\nBoth statements being made, while not claiming for 100% accurate information! End decision is yours.\n\nAbout accuracy - its fairly accurate for the price with local brand palettes (sucks with imported), but I never tested it the proper way (i.e. placing my gun at stationary location). I mostly fired in standing position, and sometimes in sitting position.\n\nUsually when I fire, due to untrained arms I have, if my shots miss the target, they''re usually going little up or down, and not left or right - atleast not to very noticeable extent.\n\nBTW, what is the asking price where you saw it?', ''),

(162421, 'Baikal MP-153: 50K Rounds in 5 days, She May be Ugly But she is One Tough Ugly [B]AoA Everybody[/B]\r\n\r\nJust Found this article that I''ve been looking for quiet a long time and wanted to share with esteemed members but couldn''t do so earlier as I was unable to locate it. Anyways, This article taken from an Italian magazine testifies the "Built like a Tank" reputation of a shotgun that has won the prize of "The 100 Best Russia''s Products " at IHF International Fair (Cologne, Germany), recognized as gun of the year by two popular gun magazines in the United States "Sports Afield" and " Guns & Ammo" and sold in US under the banner of Remington (Spartan) and EAA, The Baikal MP153 Semiautomatic Shotgun.\r\n\r\n[B]"Article from the periodical “ARMI e TIRO”, August 2005, p. 67-75\r\n[I]Translated from the Italian to English[/I][/B]\r\n\r\n*******************************\r\nUs they told, “hunting gun is not created for this quantity of shots”. Us they told, “on no account not to have time in five days”. They told us, “not one province you to itself will release, yes even where you will find so many cartridges”. They told us, “you [rekhnulis] that into this they got involved in”. Us they told all this and much other, but we did not believe.\r\n\r\nAnd they decided then to conduct the firing test: to produce 50,000 shots from the semiautomatic gun Baikal MR-153, caliber 12 gauge, from which year ago it was possible to overcome threshold into ten thousand shots; however, this time in the modification “Of synthetic”, with the polymer fittings [lozhoy]. Briefly stated, from the plastic. Why “Baikal”? The call to preconception, which should have been dethroned. The call, which “the tonic By [armi]”, the importer of Russian guns, received without the fluctuations.\r\n\r\nIn the phase of preparation for the tests, we made two calculations and they stated: young hunter, let us say twenty-year old, the possessor of license, acquires gun “Baikal”, whose cost is low, and which at first behaves excellently. It detonates somewhere 100 cartridges per year, this pleases it and it continues to shoot at hundreds of cartridges of the following 50 years to the deserved pension (hunter, it is understood). Actually this composes 5,000 shots, plus minus several cartridges. Let us add that sometimes, in order to warm the stem before the opening, are produced several shots in the field, so to say “entrance”. At the end “the quarries” of gun this will hardly exceed 10,000 additional shots. For this reason, we began to think that in actuality hunting the gun is not projected in order to reach the specific limits. But we did not refuse from the idea: “to go” to fifty thousand.\r\n\r\nHowever, us there were only five, and if we calculate: ten thousand cartridges during the day, thousand an hour, about fifteen per minute. Plus two hours for the installation/dismantling and several cleanings, taking into account that speech goes about one semiautomatic gun with the selection of solid-reactant gases, in which the residual substances of combustion can cause the disturbance of the normal cycle of recharging. As a result, were obtained twelve hours during the day during five days. To overpower it is possible.\r\n\r\nPractically everything was preparedly, were not sufficient only gun, shooting-range and 50.000 cartridges. The gun of MR-153 arrived after several days, new, sparking, with the wishes “successful work” from “tonic By [armi]”. Concerning ammunition, we " took course” for the firm “[Fiokki]”: “you will isolate to us 50,000 cartridges for the testing”. They raised us for a joke. We insisted, and before face of this “folly”, everyone agreed to lengthen to us hand aids “good, take that which to you is necessary”. After securing gun and cartridges, it remained to find only the shooting-range, in which will sound the music of 50,000 shots. To us “approached” [Karisio]. Preference was returned to [pemontskomu] field - historical possession of the family Of [lukyari].\r\n\r\nIf it transports…\r\n\r\nIt is improbable: testing began on Monday in the morning at the end June, but when we reached field into [Karisio], came [paduanskaya] autumn, in no way summer breeze and rain, which went with the increasing force. I, [Massimo], Enrico and [Dzhankarlo], the first four selected for “the baptism” of Baikal, did not hide their disappointment, but the desire “to give motion” operation took precedence. Before us five long days and each uncertainty could tear away program. They approached the shooting: on the right hand from the central route the pan, to is boundary filled with day dose into ten thousand cartridges, from the other side - bath, high tide, for the forced cooling of stem. These special features are the basic difference from the testing for ten thousand shots, which passed year ago (cm July release “[Armi] e of shooting ranges” in 2004) whereas, when into the first day we turned themselves to the natural cooling, which occurred extremely slowly, before passing to the forced cooling with the aid of the compressor, to effective, but it is insufficient to rapid. After the first 200 - 300 shots (bad weather gave the advantage that the temperature of ambient air was below) in order not to lead the temperature of stem to the red heat, we conducted the first of sinking stem during fifteen seconds, after which stem could be extracted, without fearing to anneal hands. And this regime was repeated again and again.\r\n\r\n“Baikal” behaved excellently, furthermore, the experience of one year learned to the following: using such “calm” cartridges as “Top Of trap of black” of firm “[Fiokki]”, 28 grams of lead, are better to first produce running-in by the five-ten times intensive cartridges, for example [magnumom] with 42 grams of lead. After this, problems no longer it appeared, taking into account that MR-153 " shoots” cartridges from 28 to 56 grams of lead and that which with the aid of the simple operation of the adjustment of the valve, located inside the cylinder of gas bleed, gun was able to also " overcure” 24 grams.\r\n\r\nIs already past fourteen hours since we began to shoot - it impresses balance: on the table remained only several boxes on 25 cartridges from the day portion of 10,000 cartridges plus remainders from the first two days, only 13,000 cartridges minus some trifles. In other words, we completely made up that missed, and they entered “into the track”.\r\n\r\nThe fourth day entered “into the narrow gauge”: I and Alex profit in the field, when [Massimo] already he approached the shooting, but to us was three together not to the jokes. Around us heat, which makes even by more tiresome and which, even at the height of the morning, it seemed, melts the ears, protected by head sets. Let us regret about the rains of previous days. “Baikal” passed lustrously the middle of tests, we subject to its thorough control from the point of view of maximally loaded parts, and before, approaching the shooting, we control also the adjustable valve inside the gas chamber. The fact is that “Baikal” with its contented simple and rapid work, can be “disposed” to the most light 24 grams by action on the helical spring inside the threaded bushing. For decreasing the number of maintenance, it is important so that the valve would be correctly adjusted in order to facilitate the inflow of gas inside the cylinder and piston pressure, which sets in action twofold axis recharging.\r\n\r\nPour to us champagne.\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of the last day of tests, everything so early in the morning, not only in air, but also under the shed, the satisfaction was obvious - to the purpose by hand to give, whatever was eventual result. There was sensation, that from now on “Baikal” crossed critical limit. But meanwhile someone us still wanted to shoot, another, participating for the first time, wanted to leave its imprint in small or large enterprise. A little under the accretion of euphoria, almost we forget, which against the background entire other to us still remained to shoot out eight thousand cartridges “of [fiokka]”. But now this no longer seemed by this large matter. “After having a snack it fished” they approached the work, they reached “remainders from the box” for cleaning, tried “rough” to grease, injecting lubricant “Birchwood of casey” directly into the zone of the motion of components. MR-153, after reacting, snorted and sent the surplus of oil into the person of that shot. Better not to exaggerate, but to carry out cleaning as is fitting. More it was not long before noon of boxes on the stand, remained only cartridges scattering in the large plastic container. Three hours in the afternoon we approached the epilogue, exhausted, but contented as “[bambino]”, and they found time and desire in order to arrange special ceremony in the honor of cartridge number 50,000. The honor of this shot fell out on Giovanni. Immediately after this, they uncorked the bottle of champagne for all, who shot, and who with the interest looked on those, who were located on the field and shot with the frequency of machine gun. And there was, of course, toast for “Baikal”, which also worried and which was actually the main hero of these five days."\r\n*******************************\r\n\r\n[B]Videos of The Gruesome 50,000 Round Test:[/B]\r\n\r\n[url]http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwL_JEsJ1b4[/url]\r\n[url]http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFhK0ifNJ7g&feature=channel[/url]\r\n\r\n[B]Regards.[/B]', ''),

This is not an opinion but a documented/proven fact (since medieval times) that forging compresses the molecules therefore increasing the strength of the steel. if you watch movies based on medieval times you''ll see blacksmiths using large hammers and huge anvils to compress and fuse multiple layers of steel together to make swords and farming tools.

(162937, 'Zero Your Scope with One Shot or No Shot Fired Bench/Shooting Rest \r\n \r\nAnyone serious about testing the accuracy of rifles, and who doesn''t have nerves of steel, needs to use some sort of shooting rest. The same goes for anyone wanting to evaluate the accuracy of factory and hand loaded ammunition. Historically this was done with the ever popular coat-over-the-hood-of-your-pickup technique. Accuracy was hit or miss with this method, pun intended. Sandbags can be used, and they definitely improve accuracy, but it is a hassle to pack sandbags around. \r\nOne advantage of many of the shooting rests available today is reduction of felt recoil. The weight of the rest combines with the weight of the rifle, which helps to absorb the energy. The more the gun/rest weighs, the more felt recoil is reduced. It is simple physics. Bags of lead shot can be added to some rests, so even the hardest kicking calibers can be shot without getting a bruise on your shoulder. This also can prevent or mitigate flinching. The loud sound of a center fire rifle contributes to flinch, so always wear hearing protection when shooting to protect your ears.\r\nLike most shooting rests, the Bench is mostly for use at the range. However, the Bench is light and portable enough, at about 8 lbs that it could be taken into the field for varmint hunting. Simply set it up on a folding table or use the hood of a vehicle. Not ideal for that purpose, but a possibility that you might want to consider when comparing features.\r\nWith a weight of 8 lbs., the Bench does reduce felt recoil, but not as much as some of the heavier shooting rests. The Bench doesn''t have a tray to load for bags of lead shot but I have found that you can drape them over the front legs to help reduce recoil. In my experience the Bench, without additional weight, tames a .30-06 or a .270 so that you can comfortably shoot a couple boxes of cartridges and not be beat up by the experience. On Desert Mountain''s web site, one Bench Master user claims over 200 rounds of various .338 loads without pain or thought of recoil. I''m not sure I would go that far, but it does attenuate recoil.\r\nThe Bench does require some assembly, but it is as simple as threading some bolts with plastic knobs through the body of the device and the altitude adjustment mechanism. It couldn''t be much easier.\r\nAs seen in the illustration, the design of the Bench is in the shape of a T. There is an elevated part that comes up in the front that a bench bag fits into. This supports the forearm of the stock. On this is a level indicator. At the rear is a "Vee" shaped padded rest with a heavy-duty canvas strap across the back, which the butt of the rifle fits into. In the center is an adjustment knob that allows you to fine tune the elevation of the gun to align the sights with the target. At the end of each part of the T are adjustment feet that allow additional elevation and leveling adjustments. The entire rest hinges in the center for radical elevation adjustment. There are wing nuts on the feet and a knob on the side to lock everything into place.\r\nAfter you learn how the Bench needs to be adjusted for your gun, it is fairly easy to get set up. Going from one gun to another can take some time if the feet adjustments have to be tweaked, but usually the fine adjustment in the center accommodates differences in stock designs. The Bench works best on a flat level surface, but with the various adjustments, you can set it up in a less than perfect spot, such as the hood of a vehicle.\r\nFiring a rifle in the Bench is very natural. The butt of the rifle fits into the padded V rear rest and the stock rests on the front bench bag. The way the Bench is designed, no part of the rest gets in your way like some bulky rests do. Press the gun into the rear V rest and onto the bench bag and then tweak the adjustments until the sights line up on your target. There are no side to side adjustments, so you will have to move the rear foot around on the surface, which surprisingly enough works pretty well. Put your shoulder up firmly against the rear rest/butt of the rifle, and shot as you normally would. Even with very small calibers, the Bench will move a little from the recoil, so each time you may have to make some minor adjustments to realign the sights.\r\npictures of original rest and my local made rest are give below. i fires 7.62mm g3, 7mm, .243cal, 8mm, .22cal, and 6.5mm\r\n\r\ntighten the gun fire one shot now wd out moving gun even 1mm bring scope cross at that shot. ur done. else fix laser boresighter and wd out firing even 1 shot bring cross hair to dot ur done.', ''),

(163384, 'muzzle breaks......... Newton''s law says (to paraphrase) that for every action there must be an equal and opposite reaction. Recoil (kick) is the rifle''s reaction to the action of the bullet being accelerated down the rifle barrel. Recoil is caused by two factors. The first is the bullet itself, which cannot be interfered with. The second is the expanding powder gasses that are pushing the bullet and must also exit the barrel. Muzzle brakes reduce recoil by diverting part of these gasses to the side so that they do not add to the rearward recoil.\r\nA properly designed muzzle brake can significantly reduce recoil. The actual effectiveness depends to an extent on the cartridge for which the rifle is chambered. Ahlman''s claims a 50% recoil reduction when their Recoil Reducer muzzle brake is used on large magnum rifles. Mag-na-port International claims recoil reduction of up to 45% for their Mag-na-brake. Browning, whose BOSS (Ballistic Optimizing Shooting System) is both a muzzle brake and an accuracy tuning device, claims a recoil reduction of up to 30%. Weatherby, who claims that their Accubrake is the most effective on the market, claims recoil reduction of up to 53%.', ''),

Good enough to last for more than our average lifetimes. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the contrary, sporting barrels are made to last a long time. Shooting 50000 rounds with a competition gun is nothing abnormal whereas very few combat guns would ever shoot that much in their life time. That is why, all components in competition guns (including barrels) are of very high quality because they have to undergo lot of shooting activity on regular basis; much more than the combat guns. \r\n\r\nFor professional shooters, shooting 200 rounds per day is a routine thing.[/QUOTE]\r\n \r\nNoted.

(164535, 'The Good Old 30-06 Springfield The 30-06 was created after the bad experiences in Cuba in the battles of San Juan Hills. The US army hurriedly elongated the ,7X57 case by another 6mm to 63mm and increased the bullet dia from .284 (7mm) to .308 ins, the result was the 30 spring field. It was finally adopted in the year 1906 by the US Army and hence the name 30-06.\r\n\r\nThe 30-06 is the most successful battle and hunting cartridge the world has ever known. It gained popularity all over the world in a short time. It continued to rule the battle fields until the last few decades.\r\n\r\nIt is still within the most popular 5 or 10 cartridges by the sale count all over the world.\r\n\r\nIt has taken all types of game in all continents of the world, it may be under powered for use against the Brown Bears of North America or the Buffaloe, Rhino, Lion , Leopard and Elephant in the Africas, yet all animals have been taken successfully by experienced hunters using good bullets and knowing when and where too hit. How ever it is niether recommended nor allowed by law to be used against the biggest 4 of the Big Five.\r\n\r\nA 24 year old niece of the famous actress Ingrid Bergman , whose name is Astrid Bergman Sucksdorff of Sweden Killed a number of man eating Tigers and Leopards in India in the 1960s and she has given splendid matter of fact accounts in her book " Tiger in Sight ". The Rifle she used was a 30-06 Husqvarna made in Sweden. Her book contains large number of photographs and deflates the hair raising stories told by the shikaries of yester year.\r\nThe 30-06 is the un disputable king of rifle cartridges.\r\n\r\nSince rifles more than a 100 years old are still proudly used by great grand sons of original owners, the factory cartridges are not loaded to full potential to avoid consumer liability in the US.\r\n\r\nTherefore the true beneficiaries of this cartridge remain the hand loaders or those who can lay their hands on the Light Magnum 30-06 Ammo by Hornady or the German ammo by RWS, or Norma or Hirtenberger.\r\n\r\nThe excellent bullets are from 150, 165, 180, 190, 200, 220, and 250gr. The long range performers are the 165 and 180 grains.\r\n\r\nThe rifling twist of the O''6 is 1 turn in 10 inches, and it stabilises bullets heavier than 150 optimally.\r\n\r\nThe ammo is available world wide and old military ammo which is cheap is also available for target and fun shooting.\r\n\r\nThe bullets have high BC and high SD making these useful for big game.\r\n\r\nThe bullets have very good ranging qualities in the wind.\r\n\r\n165 gr bullets can be loaded upto 2900 fps and the 180 to 2800 fps which makes it a very powerful long range round.\r\n\r\nIt has 125, 130 and 140 grain bullets as well but these shed their velocities in the air due to poor BC and no good for big game hunters so I am not even mentioning these.\r\n\r\nThere was once a surge of Accelerator bullets ( 1980s) of only 55 grains which had a neoprene sabot around these which was discarded on firing and the bullets could be fired at velocities of up to 4000 Fps but these were accurate only in some rifles and not all, also every time you change the weight or shape or make of bullet you have to re zero your Rifle and this gradually precluded the use of these accelerator rounds as these could be a couple of feet off the point of aim of a rifle zeroed on other regular rounds. I personally like the Spitzer Boat Tailed bullets of 165 and 180 grs in this cal and use Nosler Ballistic tips, or Partitions and Speer 165 grs.\r\n\r\nTight Groups\r\nJU', ''),

Also bring any event-related medications like asthma inhalers in case of an attack, or epinephrine pens if you are allergic to bee stings or certain foods.\r\n\r\n2) A fully charged cell phone or 2-way radio in a waterproof container could be your ticket home.\r\n\r\n3) Wear appropriate clothing and outer wear. Skip the cotton in most conditions, unless you are trying to activate your life insurance policy.\r\n\r\n4) Lighters and other fire makers should be scattered throughout your equipment and clothing.\r\n\r\n5) A metal cup to boil water provides you a safe and unlimited water supply, providing you have water to begin with.\r\n\r\n6) Bring a rugged, waterproof light source, like a headlamp.\r\n\r\n7) Carry a whistle and other signaling equipment. \r\n\r\n8) Bring an emergency shelter like a space blanket or a Heat Sheets emergency bivy from Adventure Medical Kits. \r\n\r\n9) Carry a quality knife for dozens of obvious reasons.\r\n\r\n10) You''ll need a first aid kit to keep the red stuff in, and the bad stuff out.\r\n\r\n11) An emergency food supply can give you energy to keep going, and you''ll sleep warmer at night with a little food in your belly.\r\n\r\n12) Water purification tablets and a container for water should be on your list.  \r\n\r\n13) Bring a map and compass, or a GPS.', ''),

One has to get the technique of safe fast-draws wired into one''s muscle memory before moving on to actual shooting. As mentioned in a video shared by Faisji in another thread, the guy says he''s practiced the "tactical" draw a gazillion times and even then he shot himself. Imagine a new shooter trying this technique... Faisji is right too, in saying that one has to have experience in sight-shooting to learn the basics of safe shooting practice. Also, the bore-laser idea is also a very good one, for enhancing the benefits of dry-firing w.r.t. point-shooting.\n\nVery nice write-up sir TYR, no mistakes whatsoever :first:.

The 7 mm Rem Mag can do the same with a 175 grain bullet at 300 plus.\nNow the  calibers for elephant and Rhino. The minimum caliber allowed by law for these majestic animals is .375 H&H and in some countries it has to be at least .40\nThe popular calibers are .375 H&H, .404 Jeffery, 416 Rigby, 416 Remington, 416 Weatherby, 460 Weatherby, 450-400, 458 Win, 470 Nitro Express. The most popular remain the .375 H&H, the various .416s with Weatherby gaining more and more popularity.\nThe terminal ballistics of the big game bullets have been improved so much over the last 20 years and in the last 5 years major progress has enhanced the capability of the modern bullets.\nThe .375 is ideal for head shots on elephant, but for body shots the .416s or bigger are better like in case of the Rhino.\nJU', ''),

Sheikh Hamed Bin Zayed Al-Nahyan, Minister for Economic Affairs of the Emirate Abu-Dhabi, passionate hunter and owner of a series of miscellaneous R 93 models, gave the impulse for a new and very special Blaser rifle type. As in certain situations during the hunt, a rifle with two barrels can be advantageous, H.H. Sheikh Hamed Bin Zayed Al-Nahyan had the vision of this very precious rifle and wishing that dream could come true, he contacted Blaser Jagdwaffen GmbH in Germany.\r\nIn cooperation with the excellent technical expertise of the Blaser team, he finally succeeded in designing a classical bolt action rifle with the speed of a side-by-side rifle. The R 93 Duo "Model Hamed" is equipped with two side-by-side barrels and receivers, thus offering all well-known advantages of the R 93. With each bolt action, 2 cartridges are places into the barrels simultaneously, so that it is possible to use the R 93 Duo like a classic side-by-side double rifle. The magazine contains six cartridges and two additional cartridges are loaded in the barrels.\r\n\r\nH.H. Sheikh Hamed Bin Zayed Al-Nahyan had his own R 93 Duo "Model Hamed" designed in a very special way: English Rose and Scroll engraving with gold inlays on the receiver, bolt head, open sight and saddle mount. Gold-plated triggers, a precious Turkish walnut stock with lavish flower carvings and scale ornaments.\r\n\r\nThe extraordinary rifle R 93 Duo "Model Hamed" is currently only made to order.\r\n\r\n[url]http://blaser-usa.com/R-93-Duo-Hamed.750.0.html[/url]', ''),

The wind will be very strong in the mountains and the Himalayan Ibex and the Markhore need to be stopped before they climb a cliff or get into a cave to die undetected  as these are big and strong animals. So you need a flat trajectory, ability to deviate less from wind and enough bullet weight and energy to bring the animal down keep him anchored.\r\n243 loses energy beyond 200 yds and is very sensitive to wind, and is too small a caliber for markhore and Himalayan Ibex. The 308 is lethal but the trajectory does not make it an ideal long range HUNTING  caliber, unless one is equipped as a sniper and trained as one with a laser range finder, Compensating sniper scope and all; therefore withe normal hunting gear the following cailbers are ideal for the animals you mentioned and will not go wrong with any of these.\r\n\r\n7mm Magnum (Rem, and or Weatherby)\r\n270 win\r\n30-06\r\n280 Rem\r\n7 x 64 Brenneke\r\n300 Win Mag\r\n7 x 61 \r\n300 Weatherby Mag\r\nI have used all these to great effect and  I am a great lover of the 7mm Rem Magnum and the 30-06 (specially when hand loaded with 165 gr Nosler bullets )[/QUOTE]\r\n \r\n@Skeeter, sir very practical and useful info ... and @GG, bro nice humour with good recomm too.

(311912, ' For civilian shooters, the following National level events are available:\n1. National Games, held every two years. Sindh hosted these in 2007, but NWFP will be hosting these in Dec 2010.Next maybe Punjab&#8217;s turn in 2011 or 2012, as NWFP could not do so in 2009. I think there is prize money for medal winners.\n2. National Shooting Championships: held every year at either Karachi, Jhelum or Islamabad. No prize money\n3. Chief of Naval Staff Shooting Championship (CNSC). Held every year in Karachi. Not sure about the prize money.\n4. Selection trials: these are conducted to finalize the teams to represent Pakistan in International competitions. Basically top shooters are short listed from the above competitions and further screened and eliminated through these trials.\nAs far as provinces are concerned, NWFP is almost never represented, but this time around (Dec 2010) their team may show up. Some very enthusiastic shooters from Baluchistan do always turn up for 300 m event. As they are good, they do usually pick up medals. Shooters from Sindh always participate in events held at Karachi but owing probably to logistical problems; rarely participate in events held up country. Their shotgunners are definitely a breed apart and shoot in every event, wherever it is held and collect a lot of medals. Shooters from Punjab are quite enterprising and participate in both Olympic and non Olympic events wherever these are held.  Of course, Federal Rifle Association (FRA Islamabad) also participates, especially when the event is at Islamabad or Jhelum. WAPDA fields a strong team and gives everyone a run for their money. One of their shooter came first and represented the country in SAF shooting championship held at Islamabad this year. \nI have seen individual shooters in every event. I think all events which are declared &#8216;open&#8217; allow individuals to participate.\nGenerally, there are two types of &#8216;individual&#8217; shooters. Firstly, a shooter who couldn&#8217;t make it in the team selection trials but still wants to participate requests the team management to forward his name as an &#8216;individual&#8217;. Secondly, when the team is not being sent to an event but a shooter of good standing goes ahead and participates as an &#8216;individual&#8217;. Like Skeeter sb did at Jhelum and did a fine job of it. I think the &#8216;championships&#8217; are generally declared &#8216;open&#8217;.\nSince I have limited experience, my information may not be complete. Skeeter sb is in a far better position to shed light on the subject. Afterall I have written there is just one important thing left to say-  &#8221; there is no shortcut to the Gold medal.&#8221;\nBest of luck.', ''),

Can be changed subject to bore on payment of small fees.\n\nSecondly, last time I checked GSG was nearing 60k in mid August. So i`m guessing prices should drop rather than rise. However, when you wish to purchase any gun for that matter be sure to exhibit your full interest and commitment to dealer so they give you the best price. Price for window shoppers are always more than expected since the dealers seldom go through effort to take firearms out of the display to show people unless you know them personally or are on good talking terms.

Like bore obstruction, dangerous ammunition, wrong caliber cartridge etc but unfortunately our desi ones blow up on their own due to bad steel, which is neither forged, nor heat treated nor proper alloys are used.\nIn my humble opinion when our people will proudly display their own names on guns only and only then these would improve. As long as we try to make copies we will stay where we are for ever.\nIn a pistol the barrel uses different alloy of steel, the slide another, the extracter yet another the ejector, the sears and hammer all need different steels and different level of heat treatment/ case hardening . I wish some rich  guy gets into proper collaboration and starts the ball rolling. This will give us know how and we may then make better than most other countries.

In Lahore, last, I came across fresh ammo by [B]Prvi Partizan, Serbia, 185 grainers[/B], I think, at some 275/300 per round, yet my license wasn''t accompanied, so I let go. Don''t know of your experience with this ammo??\n\nAlso, got a few rounds left dating all the way back to WW1, 1940, to be exact, I think Danish made, which I tried a couple of last year and to my big surprise they fired excellently. May I say, the Pathan I bought them from @150 each had not taken special care like we do on conserving the rounds, they were just lying there in an open rust up can!!!

(312124, ' AoA Munir Bhai,\r\n\r\n If we look at Mr Sattar Satti''s last 3-rounds(24+22+23),I would rate him as "Very Impressive"\r\n as compared to Mr Khurram(An Olympian) and Mr Amin Karamat.\r\n\r\n I personally believe that NRA(Pakistan) should chalk out an extensive "TALENT HUNT" plan for\r\n the aspiring competitive shooters, who just shy away from SKEET,TRAP, DOUBLE TRAP being\r\n "TOO EXPENSIVE" to practice as compared to AIR RIFLE/PISTOL or standard RIFLE/PISTOL\r\n events.\r\n\r\n We should also think about raising our voice for arranging QUARTERLY "REGIONAL SHOOTING     COMPETITIONS" among the shooters from China,India,Pakistan,Kuwait,U.A.E,Qatar and some\r\n Independent Russian states.Our shooters need to attend more frequent international\r\n Competitive matches instead of waiting too long for SAF games or Asian games.', ''),
(312126, ' AoA Everybody\r\n\r\nFrom the pictures, I can see that Hatsan is no doubt a well built, a well finished and a well fitted gun. On the other hand, the utter simplicity of Baikal''s design (clearly depicted in the pictures) has a new profound respect in my eyes now. I guess now I know where Baikal drives its durability powers from. Its the simplicity in design.\r\n\r\nThe locking channel on Hatsan might look impressive at first glance but a deeper look reveals that its not continuous and though longer in length, is less wide when compared to Baikal''s wider channel. such a setup might offer a better bite at first but in the long-run it runs a risk of losing its bite faster as galling takes over. whereas Baikal offers a more continuous surface area to bite, more likely it will last longer as well. (IMHO)\r\n\r\nMoving on, the ejector mechanism on Baikal looks way more simple when compared to Hatsan and as they say, "when there is more than one solution to a problem, the simplest one (solution) is usually the best one (solution)". having said that, I am more comfortable with Baikal''s ejector mechanism. if it ever breaks, it can be easily replaced by any competent gunsmith. I''ve seen a Baikal with local made ejector mechanism.\r\n\r\nAbout the hinge, well, its hard to say, one offers a wider area, whereas other offers a more deep hinge engagement. so, only time will tell which one wears out quickly. however where this hinge pivot in case of a Baikal is replaceable if it ever wears out. so, you decide which is better?\r\n\r\nso having said all that, I would say Baikal has following attributes going in its favor:\r\n\r\n1. Simpler, tried and tested design (The Legendary Browning B-25)\r\n2. Strong (design wise) construction\r\n3. 35+ years of continuous/serial production (first marketed in 1973)\r\n4. 1.5 million shotguns produced over the years. (and counting)\r\n5. barrel strength and locking mechanism control in accordance with CIP standards (CIP proofed at the world''s largest proofing house)\r\n6. ejector mechanism can be switched off by turning off a simple screw\r\n7. ease in repairing (local gunsmith talent)\r\n\r\nwhereas Hatsan offers:\r\n\r\n1. new age design, possibly offering better performance\r\n2. slightly complicated design\r\n3. no track record/documented history\r\n4. way better features/accessories\r\n5. way better finish\r\n6. way better looks\r\n7. way better bells and whistles\r\n\r\nEven though I am a Baikal owner myself but if i were given a choice to pick between the two I would be hard pressed, no doubt about it. given each gun''s qualities/attributes, they are so evenly matched that the only the following thought that can make me decide: \r\n\r\n"if you want hardcore durability (with no compromises), long standing reputation and ease in repairing if the need ever arises, then Baikal is the way to go and if you can compromise a little on durability and in return gain a lot in looks, fit, finish and all the bells and whistles that make a fine shotgun then Hatsan is where I should be looking."\r\n\r\nRegards.', ''),

A cheap 5k rainbow model55 and I love that thing to this day, I used to clean my airgun each month, oil it, clean it, use only quality pellets, never point it at a living thing loaded or not. He decided I had proven myself good enough to get a real thing...dreams really do come true. He said I can have a rifle, but it needs to be cheap obviously.. So here''s where I need your help. I need you guys to suggest a good simple (bolt-action is love for me) rifle that uses preferably .22 but anything else as well just not PB. I just suffered a massive heartbreak when I realised that the lee enfield is a PB weapon.. \nThis will be my first real weapon, I am 18 years old at this time and if you have any doubts about my level of responsibility I can show you my airgun which still works on the same spring as 3 years back and is in great condition. I love that thing. \nUmm coming back to my request, you people are literally the BEST I need your help I know you understand my passion, the weapon needs to be:\n     - Cheap (at max 15k)\n     - Rifle only (once again bolt action preferred)\n     - it must be a NPB\nPS: Dad is an army officer so got any further ideas about that? \nThank you all in Advance I am unable to contain my excitement at this time.', ''),

Since I am around pistol and rifle ranges so my observations relate to these and not shotgun events. \n\n1. For the last two and a half years the faces have not changed. One always find the same shooters competing in the same\n    events. Civilian participation, in most of the events, is either nil or the performance does not merit mention.\n2. There is no improvement in the results. Air pistol Men 570-575/600, Rifle prone 585-590/600 and the list goes on.\n    There are never any pleasant surprises but ofcourse there are sob stories explaining why the score was not what it should\n    have been.\n3. The high point for most of the shooters is to make it to the international competitions, and thats it! Just as an example if\n    the best practice scores of a shooter are 590/600, how could one hope to score 598-600/600 in a major competition and\n    thats where the medals are.\n4. The shooters at the top for prolonged periods without anyone breathing down their necks tend to lose their passion and go\n    complacent.\n5. I find the top shooters with highly inflated egos thus blocking all possibilities of improvement. Just one look at international\n    level scores should be enough to deflate.\n\nOfcourse there are exceptions and my observations may not be correct but I put this point across to emphasize that there is a big, big scope for all of us to get into the main stream of shooters. I find many talented shooters at Lahore range. Shooters who can afford the time and money to pursue the sport. Why don''t they?\nThey must come out with their reasons and problems on this forum. I am sure that senior shooters on this forum will help them out. But ofcourse, like all ''ustads'' they would want to ascertain the talent and commitment.', ''),

This system ensures a sleek look and more locking/bite area prevents any play after years of beating.[/QUOTE]\r\n \r\nAwesome addition HJ Sb. however kindly allow me to add that the boss bifurcated lump design does not offer any significant (scientifically proven atleast) advantages over traditional locking mechanism. its nothing more than splitting hairs. In my humble opinion, it offers nothing more than slightly sleeker receivers.\r\n\r\nwhereas the maker who popularized the over-and-under was John Moses Browning who produced his &#8220;Superposed&#8221; design after World War I (1926).  It is a landmark in sporting gun design, manufactured and much copied to this day. Browning returned to the full width hinge pin, but managed to keep the overall action height reasonably low, and used a short self-contained action body without separate locks. This was a boxlock design that could be made by machine. It remains one of the greatest sporting shotgun designs of the past 100 years. Beretta, which made a copy of the Boss sidelock over-and-under in 1933, offered its first Superposed sidelock design in 1934.\r\n\r\nBrowning Superposed and Merkel Over/Under guns are built with lumps under the barrels and with the hook revolving around a traditional hinge pin. Though stronger, this results in a gun with a taller profile (but not by much) than the bifurcated lump design.\r\n\r\nRegards.', ''),

Same goes for most of the FORD sedans being sold in the US, where the police cruiser model is rather upgraded then an average car.\n\nPOF does not use cheap material for the civil market however you cannot consider it of international standards, a clear difference could be noticed soon, all you gotta do is to visit the IDEAS 2014 and check the weapons being displayed there, you will be shocked and surprised to see the visible difference, an example would be that during an international expo the russian delegation caused an uproar when they saw the POF produced Ak47s and unlike the typical media hypocrisy stating the incident as a copyright infringement, the russians caused a havoc because the POF produced AK47 was 3x superior to the one russia produces.\n\nPOF no doubt is a quality name however its a state owned organization that still relies on a technocratic  structure of old moustache pete''s, meaning for them to elope into a cutting edge serious civilian and sports oriented weapon producer will take alot of time, just look at the posters they produce, my 3 year old daughter could have done a better job, its cheesy loud and has "TERRORIST" written all over it. so again point being the quality of the material is good however its not HK standard and i have explained more then one reason to everyone why this particular weapon is of no use to a firearm aficionado.  the best review would have to be from abbas since he buys stuff to test it. so he would be the best judge\n\n\n[QUOTE=FA226;467665]I understand you point of view regarding its use but i dont understand that why would pof do all the effort to use cheap materials in this semi version.[/QUOTE]', ''),

It will give some idea.\r\n\r\nDear Reincarnated brother,\r\nInshallah you will get the license as you look in hot pursuit for that.To start any sport ,we have to decide wheather we are going to do it for RECREATION ONLY or COMPETATIVELY at national and International level.\r\nIn olympic skeet you need to have 114 kills out of 125 which is a(MQS-Minimum Qualification Score)\r\nor 23-kills out of 25-shots on a firing sequence laid down in ISSF rules,I mean No of shots fired on each shooting station.\r\nNow to achieve that score(Per round) we need to practice a lot,it depends, I will go for 125x4 times a week----500 cartridges per week,if I foresee any competition approaching within six months and increase it when there are roughly 3-months left even for national level.But the practice should be meaningfull and result oriented mixed with workouts and brisk walk or swimming.\r\nComing to your point of WHICH GUN TO BUY,honestly speaking I would go for borrowing some friends(from more than one) to try to have a feel of shotgun(ONLY O/Us and Semi Autos) simply leave aside (PUMPS AND SIDE BY SIDES).People do use semi autos for skeet but overall winner is always a nicely balanced well fitted O/U.You know what I mean to say for (WELL FITTED).\r\nA friend took me to a good shooting ground in Derbyshire-UK and I would have missed lot to my embarrassment,had I not been given the chance to choose from 9-shotguns(Mirokus and Brownings).So how do we select a shotgun when you have fellow shooters waiting behind you to pick up yours and let them have a chance to pick their''s.\r\nI believe you have good knowledge of (CONSISTENT GUN MOUNT) and you know how to choose a responsive Shotgun for SKEET.\r\nFor cartridges try to use No-9 but 24.5 grams,or in event of Non- availability try No 8 but 9 is always preferable.Now it''s up to you to work out your plan,I think you should take along your gun owner friends to the range who have decent o/u shotguns on their names and fire at least 50-shots with each shotgun.Start from station-1 with regular 3-shots till station-3 then start 5,6 and 7 stations only.Decent means Berettas and Brownings or much at higher ends.By doing this you will have a clear idea where to start from and much knowledgeable shooters at PAKGUNS are here to help you.Regards', ''),

(312571, ' Brother 12Gauge hearing from you is always a pleasure and informative. There is no doubt about the ingenuity of John Browning and definitely he could never chose a system on his guns that was not reliable. To my understanding earlier in the twentieth century when technology was not as advanced as is now(CNC machining/metallurgy), going for a design on a production gun that required more precision machining could be a costly affair. So, Browning rightly selected a simpler (under barrel locking lugs) design. Other top manufacturers kept producing guns with bifurcated lugs as cost was not their primary consideration. It was during and after the world wars when technology advanced by leaps and bounds other production manufacturers were able to produce better designs with not so much costs. Hence Beretta went for it.  \nNow coming to the superiority of the one over the other is a debatable affair. The only thing that bears some weight is that almost all top names(off-course except Browning and Merkel)  use bifurcated locking system on their guns. This should have some rationale in it as all more expensive shotguns are made with side lock system instead of a Boxlock. There must be something more than just the looks???', ''),

(312696, 'Birdshot Sizes and Selection Birdshot sizes are numbered similar to the shotgun gauges; the smaller the number, the larger the shot. Generally birdshot is just called "shot", such as "number 9 shot" or "BB shot". A useful method for remembering the diameter of numbered birdshot is simply to subtract the shot size from 17. The resulting answer is the diameter of the shot in hundredths of an inch. For example number 2 shot gives 17-2 = 15, meaning that the diameter of number 2 shot is 15/100 or 0.15". B shot is .170 inches, and sizes go up in .01 increments for BB and BBB or Pellets.\n \n[ATTACH=CONFIG]449[/ATTACH]\n \nFor hunting, shot size must be chosen not only for the range, but also for the [COLOR=black]game[/COLOR]. The shot must reach the target with enough energy to penetrate to a depth sufficient to kill the game. Lead[COLOR=black] shot is still the best performer for the money, but environmental restrictions on the use of lead, especially with waterfowl, require [/COLOR][COLOR=black]steel[/COLOR][COLOR=black], [/COLOR][COLOR=black]bismuth[/COLOR][COLOR=black], or [/COLOR][COLOR=black]tungsten[/COLOR][COLOR=black] compos[/COLOR]ites. Steel, being significantly less dense than lead, requires larger shot sizes, but is a good choice when cost is a consideration. Steel, however, cannot safely be used in some older shotguns without causing damage to either the bore or to the choke of the shotgun due to the hardness of steel shot. Since tungsten is a very hard metal, it must also be used with care in older guns. Tungsten shot is often alloyed with nickel and iron, softening the base metal. That alloy is approximately 1/3 denser than lead, but far more expensive. Bismuth shot falls in between steel and tungsten shot in both density and cost.\n \n[ATTACH=CONFIG]450[/ATTACH]', ''),

At night inside home the flash from ports can blind you. Also ported barrels make more noise than non ported ones. So you can go deaf too. If you happen to fire from inside your jacket pocket. The ports will put your jacket on fire, i mean comparatively more chances of this happening when compared to non ported barrel. Also the sound of .375 is too sharp for ears and thus the deaf factor. The .44 or .45 is more of a boom so comparitive less effect on ears.', ''),

(312800, 'Revenue Generation for PakGuns Salams guys,\n\nI intend to try and generate some revenue for/from PakGuns in the coming few months. Almost all of you have suggested over time that we either start a paid subscription to PakGuns or a Donation system but I have always resisted it. \n\nIn my mind the primary reason for PakGuns existence is to get good information to people who need it for absolutely free and to benefit the community as a whole.\n\nMy first target is to get enough revenue every month to offset our operating costs which are around 8 k per month. \n\nMy second target is to slowly start getting back the funds I have poured into PakGuns in the past two years. \n\nOnce both are achieved we can work on utilizing the steady stream we would have hopefully set up by then towards PakGuns promotion and events to further growth. \n\nAs a [U]Step 1[/U], I am offering two/three advertisement slots for sale to anyone interested. The banners will be pretty much like our previous ZONG ad. \n\nAs a [U]Step 2[/U], we will be approaching dealers from all cities and offering them to buy dealer threads in the dealer section. This way they can list their inventories online and approach customers directly.  I think this will be beneficial for us from many viewpoints:\n\n1). We earn revenue per thread\n\n2). More members will start to join to communicate with dealers\n\n3). Dealers will be more open toward promotion of PakGuns i.e they will proudly display our stickers in their shop.\n\n4). I have seen often dealers want to move some items quickly and since they will have access to 4000+ potential customers instantly they can give PakGunners good deals.\n \n[U]Pricing:\n[/U]\nAlthough Zong paid us Rs. 30,000 for the month that they advertised with us, I don''t think firearms companies and dealers understand spending such an amount every month on advertisement since till date they have never spent a dime. \n\nI plan to offer the top banner slot for 20 k instead and the bottom banner slot for 15 K. \n\nThe dealer thread must be sold much more cheaply to get more dealers on board. I plan to sell those at Rs. 7500 per month. \n\nIn return dealers will be allowed to advertise/discuss their products and their threads will be made sticky.\n\n[U]Getting Advertisers:\n[/U]\nWe already have our own PakGuns stationary available and lots of dealer addresses as well in our database. We will write them all letters and if they are interested they can contact us.\n\nThese things are just from the top of my head, if you guys have any input I would like to hear it.', ''),

However it is a very good weapon for SD (I should restrain myself for saying the same for HD and please read that it is[B] not recommended to be carried in Loaded condition[/B]).\r\n\r\nFor Canik, well that is a tricky one! cause there is a range of pistols that are made by Canik. You can visit their website for the reference. \r\n\r\nWell some of their models are smaller and can be a good option for Conceal Carry, however I have read on the forum somewhere, that our Admin, Abbas bhai said that its conceal carry pistol is not very good at recoil. As for the full frame weapon of Canik, i.e. Piranha, well you can read a lot about it on the forum, it is a good pistol and some people simply love it.\r\n\r\nSo if I conclude myself, then you have to personally get the feel of the two weapons, at least once held both in your hands and if possible then try them on range. It will give you better understanding about the weapons.

These should all be in the Rs. 60-70 segment.\n\nFor range and practice shooting, the Wolfs are ideal, being low pressured but accurate enough, problem is just to find the genuine ones. If you do look around for them, check to get the grey cased ones, not the green cased ones.\n\nAlso, another suggestion, quite economical and satisfactory, try to find the recent stocks of "Barnaul", Russian ammo, and at par with original Wolfs. It still hasn''t been tampered with and is a nice ammo at a nice price, some Rs.45/per round. Best of luck. Regards.', ''),

When i inquired then the agent said we cannot write your ID card''s address because the address must be in Lahore you cannot write a Faisalabad''s address(which is on ID) so i wrote a temporary address which doesn''t matter, all other information along with your pic is correct so dont worry, but i believe Arms license information must be correct in any way. So I gave him back the book and told him to issue another book with MY address. Now he''s saying give any of your address in Lahore but not in Faisalabad, so I gave him my Home address. Now the problem is the address i gave him is mine but that address is not written on my ID card. Does it matter? and why can''t they write my Faisalabad''s address?\nSecondly, the issuance date of license in 11-nov-2010 and expires on 31-dec-2010, Is it necessary to expire after one month and i''ve to renew it? why isn''t it made for 1 year?\nThirdly, I thought the color of provincial license in red, but its a blue color book.\nFourthly, He said your new book will be issued in 2 days with new address, I wonder he took 2 years to make that license, how will he issue another book with all stamps etc in 2 days? does it smell fake?', ''),

Or even lets compare the cartridge length to AK47''s 7.62x39mm which is 2.20" or 56mm. .460 uses a Large Rifle ''Magnum'' Primer due to chamber pressure it generates which is approx 60,000 PSI compared to a AK47 ammo producing 51,000 PSI or a 9mm producing 32,000 PSI. It equates by chamber pressure to small work horse cartridge 7.62x51mm G3.\n \nKing of all production handgun calibers is 500 S&W.

This crown of being The King was taken by forthcoming beasts .454 Casull, .475 Linebaugh and .480 Ruger hunting revolver cartridges with big margin of power and velocity.\n \nLater on we see S&W conquering the title once again with their 500 & 460 line up. Best thing about .460 revolver is it can fire 3 different cartridges i.e. .45 Long Colt, .454 Casull and .460 S&W Mag. This gives the .460 an upper hand in self defense, target shooting and hunting. All these 3 cartridges are inter related and have similar designs. 454 is based on 45LC and 460 is based on 454. This makes 460 a versatile handgun. Check below some ballistics of 460:\n \n335 grain at 2064 fps out of 8" barrel  with 3169 foot pounds \n300 grain at 2080 fps out of 8" barrel  with 2882 foot pounds \n395 grain at 1796 fps out of 8" barrel  with 2829 foot pounds\n360 grain at 1864 fps out of 8" barrel  with 2777 foot pounds\n \n.460 @ 200 yards generally carries 800''ish foot pounds of energy which is normally at muzzle of .44 mag.\n \nVs. .50 cal 500 S&W\n360 grain bullet at 1843 fps out of 8" barrel with 2715 foot pounds \n \nYou can check the ballistics of all above mentioned hunting cartridges and their comparison over the internet.

Rightly said, as TRAP is to deal with rising targets and TRAP GUNS are the most customized one. One needs a gun that shoots high and just aiming high is not the solution as one would be covering the sight of the target under the muzzle. Solution is high comb and higher ribs. Raising the comb too much from the wrist of the stock by adding shims would end up with a stock that will give you an uncontrolable recoil.

Therefore as per sight alignment techniques, he has done the right thing of increasing his DAC, effectively lowering his rear sight.\r\n\r\nHowever, I am a little confused as both of you guys are recommending that he do the exact opposite by taping a rubber patch on the comb, decreasing the DAC. wouldn''t this make his gun shoot high again? I know that for trap you need a gun with built in lead for the rising target and for that a gun needs to shoot high but if the shooter still wants a flat shooting gun, shouldn''t that be more important goal here?\r\n\r\nRegards.', ''),

I think we somehow got the expression that the modefication is sport specific that in reality was not as you mentioned and as brother Hamid lowered his comb.\r\nThank God it worked as brother Hamid was initially mounting his gun way high(more than 50% of the but above the shoulder) to compensate the lower comb and long neck to avoid the awkward bending of his neck. In that scenario further lowering the comb and mounting the gun at the right place would naturally require further bending the neck.\r\nAnyway, we wrongly proposed right modefications for a special purpose gun that was not actualy required. \r\n\r\nFinally, brother Hamid please don''t raise the comb what we proposed is actually for a special purpose.

We searched all the tracks and fields around the jungle and some inside it too, but couldn''t find a single animal! \r\n\r\nIn the morning all we saw were about 10 ducks just flying from here to there and with no chance of shooting at them. \r\n\r\nIs there a serious reduction in wildlife game numbers in Pakistan or what?\r\n\r\nI was expecting to atleast spot a few animals in the jungle if not hunt them no such luck?\r\n\r\nI was wondering if the same is happening with other members around the country?', ''),
(314042, ' The pistol vs. Revolver discussion i would like to add that shot placement is more important than capacity and if you cannot take care of business in 6 shots then you are already dead or a bad shooter. Please give respect to 2" snub nosed revolvers. They had been used by the usa police departments to protect their personel and even the U.S. presidents. They did a very good job at that in face of hi powered pistols like 1911 and thompson machine guns. Therefore a 2" 6 shot revolver is still useful nowadays to get one out of a situation when faced by a bad guy armed with a high capacity 9mm or AK-47. Remember the secret is in shot placement. Another thing the long barreled revolvers are better left alone for hunting or defending against wild animals. Thus a 2" revolver simple is operate and has no learning curve as even a child can point and shoot it in double action trigger pull mode. Good for quick draws when surprised by bad guy.', ''),

But that''s just the half of it. Their Escort Lineup follows the latest trends in shotgun industry. Equally reliable with hard hitting magnum roman candles and whimpy target loads, fast cycling, aesthetic appearance and truck load of accessories.\r\n\r\n[URL="http://www.hatsan.com.tr/escort_luxano.asp"]Hatsan Escort Luxano[/URL], a 12 gauge autoloader shotgun, The Company''s flagship autoloader offering, arrives in a large, colorful cardboard box that contains a shotgun, 5 choke tubes with wrench, magazine extender, shim kit and a manual.\r\n\r\n[B]General Specs:[/B]\r\n\r\n[LIST]\r\n[*]3&#8221;/76 mm magnum chamber\r\n[*]High class Turkish walnut stock and fore-end with oil polish and crisp checkering.\r\n[*]TRIOPAD butt system for maximum recoil absorption.\r\n[*]3 TRIOPAD stock spacers (each 5 mm width) to extend stock length of pull.\r\n[*]Black & white anodized air craft alloy receiver with relief engraving & 11mm dovetail for mounting of scope.\r\n[*]Gold plated trigger.\r\n[*]Nickel-chromium-molybdenum steel barrel. Outside black hard chrome finish & inside white hard chrome finish.\r\n[*]Barrel length: 28&#8221;/71 cm.\r\n[*]5 choke tubes: (F, IM, M, IC, Skeet)\r\n[*]Magazine capacity: 4+1 rounds.\r\n[*]Magazine extension tube to increase capacity to 7+1.\r\n[*]Accessory migratory plug decreasing capacity to 2+1.\r\n[*]Magazine cut-off system for single shot.\r\n[*]Comes with 4 stock shims to adjust stock drop and cast.\r\n[*]Manual cross-button trigger safety.\r\n[*]Sling swivels.\r\n[*]Rib Width: 7mm\r\n[*]Overall Weight: 7.7/3.5kg\r\n[*]Overall Length: 48&#8221;/122cm\r\n[/LIST]\r\n\r\n[B]Initial Impressions:[/B]\r\n\r\nThe moment you lay eyes on this shotgun, the first thing that hits you is that it does not look at all like a budget shotgun. It has all the bells and whistles that are associated with high end, high dollar autoloader shotguns that literally break your bank.\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i998.photobucket.com/albums/af103/12gauge-pakguns/Hatsan%20Escort/DSC00398.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\nAnd&#8230;.the moment you pick it up, Boy! It is one well finished, well made piece of firearm with marvelous looks and feel. It is feels light (when compared to Baikal MP-153) and totally out of Russian tank&#8217;s league as far as looks/finish/appearance is concerned. \r\n\r\n[B]The Receiver:[/B]\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i998.photobucket.com/albums/af103/12gauge-pakguns/Hatsan%20Escort/DSC00373.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\nThe black anodized receiver is CNC machined out of aircraft grade aluminum. It is well finished and shows absolutely no tooling marks. The side walls are partially covered with minimal but elegant relief engraving. The top of the receiver is machined with an 11mm dovetail for mounting of scopes. The Build quality is nothing short of superb.\r\n\r\n[B]The barrel:[/B]\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i998.photobucket.com/albums/af103/12gauge-pakguns/Hatsan%20Escort/DSC00364.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\nThe barrel is made out of Chrome-moly steel that is hard chromed on the inside and black chromed on the outside, a definite easy affair in cleaning and maintenance. It comes with 5 screw-in type flush fitting chokes that offer respectable patterns. On top of the barrel, sits a 7mm wide serrated rib with a big shiny brass bead at one end. Sighting-in this shotgun is an absolute pleasure.\r\n\r\n[B]The Furniture:[/B]\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i998.photobucket.com/albums/af103/12gauge-pakguns/Hatsan%20Escort/DSC00358.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\nThe wooden furniture is impeccable. The finish is great. The wood to metal fitting/mating is nothing short of first class. The wood has a warm feeling to it. It is light weight and displays an impressive grain.\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i998.photobucket.com/albums/af103/12gauge-pakguns/Hatsan%20Escort/DSC00369.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\nOn top of all that, the furniture is provided with beautiful checkering. I have never seen a finer checkering on any other shotgun. The checkered lines are crisp, deep and offer a superior grip.\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i998.photobucket.com/albums/af103/12gauge-pakguns/Hatsan%20Escort/DSC00424.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\n[B]The Action:[/B]\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i998.photobucket.com/albums/af103/12gauge-pakguns/Hatsan%20Escort/DSC00389.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\nThe gas operated action is as smooth as butter and respectably fast and noiseless. The bolt assembly is chromed and polished. The action bars are also polished but provided with a brown finish. The magazine tube is also chromed finished. The gas piston is stainless steel for increased corrosion resistance and easy in cleaning. The parts are so well made that this gun required no break-in of any kind before assuming full time range duty.\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i998.photobucket.com/albums/af103/12gauge-pakguns/Hatsan%20Escort/DSC00359.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\nThe gun successfully cycles everything from 3inch magnum loads to very light target loads. The ejection is excellent, throwing empty hulls almost 12-15 feet away. The cycling speed is also reasonably fast and does not concern/bother much a shooter more accustomed to over and under shotguns.\r\n\r\n*********End of Part-1*********', ''),

(314144, ' **********Part-2**********\r\n\r\n[B]The recoil:[/B]\r\n\r\nThe shotgun has low recoil, a typical feature of any autoloader. Some of the recoil forces are absorbed during the cycling action of the gas operated autoloader. Another plus is the new age design of the rubber buttpad. It sort of evenly spreads the recoil of the shoulder, effectively reducing the felt recoil. Plus the recoil buttpad is an absolute pleasure during mount. It comes in fast and sits securely. another interesting feature, this buttpad can be installed with spacers (provided with shotgun) to increase the length of pull.\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://www.hatsan.com.tr/images/escort_photo/luxano_triopad.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\n[B]Other Stuff:[/B]\r\n\r\nThe gold plated trigger is great, reasonably light, no creep, no post-travel, no pre-travel, breaks in cleanly. There is a trigger safety behind the trigger guard that is easy to engage and disengage. The shotgun has a magazine cut-off system effectively turning an autoloader into a single shot.\r\n\r\n[B]Now the Eye-Candy:[/B]\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i998.photobucket.com/albums/af103/12gauge-pakguns/Hatsan%20Escort/DSC00370.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i998.photobucket.com/albums/af103/12gauge-pakguns/Hatsan%20Escort/DSC00371.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i998.photobucket.com/albums/af103/12gauge-pakguns/Hatsan%20Escort/DSC00372.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i998.photobucket.com/albums/af103/12gauge-pakguns/Hatsan%20Escort/DSC00402.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i998.photobucket.com/albums/af103/12gauge-pakguns/Hatsan%20Escort/DSC00374.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i998.photobucket.com/albums/af103/12gauge-pakguns/Hatsan%20Escort/DSC00351.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\n**********End of Part-2**********', ''),

The moment the first round goes off... time freezes, the rush of adrenalin blocks all pain sensors (including those of your ears), and the mind and body goes into panic / survival mode. The last thing on your mind when it enters such a state is the well being of your ear drum. \r\n\r\nIts better to be deaf (partially) than be dead (completely). The 357 mag, as pointed out by bro Shaheen, is a tried and tested man stopper. \r\n\r\nI once read an article posted by a coroner, who also happened to be a retired cop, that whenever a dead body was brought in, and it had many gun shot wounds, the caliber would in most cases be 9mm (apart from other weak calibers like 25 or 22). But whenever the dead guy brought in had a single or a couple of bullet holes, the caliber would either be 357mag, 44 or 45. That pretty much sums it all up.', ''),

(314208, ' For a .357 mag a 4" barrel is recommended. In 2" you can use .38 spl or .38 spl +p. .357 mag in 2" barrel causes the muzzle blast since the bullet leaves barrel before all the powder is burnt. Therefore this causes the flame throw through barrel. Also the bullet velocity will be less than 4" barrel. Now the sad part .38 spl series is only made in usa. Therefore price would be sky high and availability an issue. .38 spl +p have not seen as yet. But again revolvers require minimal practice as you have been practicing point and shoot since childhood starting from upside down held from neck rubber ducky toy to water pistols to toy guns. So if you can get hold of some ammo use some to practice in double action mode and keep rest for sd situation. It is enough. Otherwise go with 9mm pistol that you can practice a lot. But then again how can one practice safely in residential area of a city. Again this situation leads us to revolver.', ''),

(314220, ' [QUOTE=junaid86;160442]I guess our esteemed wildlife department is unaware of something called magazine plug for repeaters... e.g in U.S. only 3 shot repeater is allowed for hunting.\r\n\r\np.s. Any 4+1, 5+1 repeater that we have can be made 2+1 by inserting magazine plug.[/QUOTE]\r\n\r\nOur ''esteemed'' wildlife deptt says that it is the step advised by the monitoring committees (task force) not them. They had proposed that ban and changed the recommendations by the deptt which had suggested no ban and other positive changes over last year''s notice. Secondly plug is a point which needs to be clarified with the deptt, bec if the idea is two fired shells, then a 2 shell plugged (1+1) repeater can easily be modified by a gunsmith. That is a point indeed needing clarifying from deptt. I heard that the deptt replied... Who will check the repeater plug in field. Watchers or inspectors are not that skilled. I am a bit confused over this reply. Because is this hunters'' responsibility or their staff''s. Many hunters only have one gun that is usually a repeater, or many including myself am much more acquainted with a repeater that a double barrel besides a big hurdle that a good double barrel costs above 3lacs. All these are factors which make it a very personal choice. Completely banning it is not adviseable ; the deptt should be asked for at least 2-shell-plugged repeaters, now that the notice has come out. Waiting for any replies on that ... or if anyone has already done that and clarified from deptt ...please do inform us too here. Regards.', ''),

You reply regarding these will add more Stars to your reveiw .[/QUOTE]\r\n\r\nBro, to be honest, this gun is quiet reasonably made with reasonable amount of durability. however over time and with extensive use, the wooden furniture of the gun rattles. the forend rattles and sometimes to a point where I not at all comfortable. the buttstock get loose that had to be tightened. the bolt assembly now rattles quiet a bit. its not tight and aggressive as it used to be.  \r\n\r\none thing I would like to mention here is that the wood though looks and feel beautiful leaves alot to be desired when it comes to durability. somehow the wood is alot softer when compared to other shotguns (Italian, English, American and Russian). the wood has a tendency to give way when constant force is applied to it. therefore I recommend synthetic furniture when buying a budget shotgun. even the famous Russian tank offers wooden furniture which is way harder than this one however it not nearly as beautiful.\r\n\r\nanother thing that needs attention is the rubber O-ring. even though they are easily available, but its an absolute pain the neck to replace every time to you end up with going through an extensive firing session.\r\n\r\nI would also like to mention is the barrel heating problem, somehow I''ve always found that this gun''s barrel heats up pretty quickly. for comparison, the Russian digests twice as many cartridges before heating up to the same level as this one.\r\n\r\nBut then again, Bro, this gun might not be as durable as the Russian tank but it offers a lot many things that the Russian shot spitting tank doesn''t even bother to consider. such as way more accessories, improved feel, better finishing, awesome looks and light load reliability.\r\n\r\nRegards.', ''),

That makes it very difficult to conceal and the extra mag adds to the weight. \n\nCarrying a gun is never very comfortable. The best place for me to CC any handgun is on your back with the holster on the inside of your trouser.[/QUOTE]\n \nThanks for the info. I''ll try that out.', ''),

(314578, ' Beautiful review of a decent looking shotgun. This review is evedent of many facts that Turkish arms industry has crossed quite a few milestones like:\r\n\r\n1- Using the best Materials (Chrome-Moly Steel, Aircraft Grade Aluminium, The best walnut is Turkish)\r\n2- CNC Machining.\r\n3- Access to the best designs.\r\n4- Trained work force.\r\n\r\nThey must be able to (and it is quite eveident from the great review above) produce good quality weapons in affordable prices. As their costs should remain low due to the following factors:\r\n1- Cheap labour.\r\n2- Minimum cost in R&D(Mostly they copy proven systems).\r\n3- No investments in brand development.\r\n4- Inability to cash brand premiums(this is a handicap in the favour of buyers).\r\n\r\nIt will take a few years when people will start realising the true value of these guns after seeing their performance in field. Reviews and opinion of more knowledgeable people(like brother 12gauge) who understand the business and people have trust in their opinion. This could make the process of trust building fast. At the same time these companies must ensure same quality piece after piece and any flaw in any piece should be found by the quality control before shipping. Otherwise, end users will find that faulty piece and these companies will remain in the list of low quality/unreliable manufectures. A proof testing from an objective body would also send better signals to the end users.\r\n\r\nFinally, few things, brother 12Gauge mentioned that barrel of this Escort gets hot fast. What could be a possible reason??? as company is using the best material and how its wood behaved softer??? Couldn''t the ratling of forend/bolt be cured in someway. Brother 12gauge must have done something i am sure.', ''),

(314584, ' I could not view the pics. But i would recommend not to use .38 spl bullets in your revolver as they are shorter than .357 mag so they can cause damage.

The worse that can happen is that lead deposit can build up in the cylinder barrel area and the cylinder stops rotating. Please upload pics again cant see them.', ''),
(314586, ' There are no photos drag bro... anyway if you noticed misaligned cylinder/barrel with hammer down & trigger pulled (as I understood from your post above) then it is a very tight lock up that doesnot lock cylinder exactly on the place where it would have been at the time of bullet leaving it to enter the barrel , correct lock up state is when hammer is locked back (ready to be dropped in single action) as that''s the condition where hammer will fall on firing pin to ignite the primer, please check the alignment in this condition and post pics if you still notice the misalignment.', ''),

For high volume shooting this may not be the gun of choice. however one must understand that this gun was never advertised by the manufacturer as a sporting gun. in fact it is advertised as a field/hunting gun and for that purpose I do not believe that any other gun in its price range can even think about competing with this one. if used strictly for field/hunting plus some occasional skeet/clays, I believe this gun would easily outlive its owner.\r\n \r\n[QUOTE=HasanJamshad;161964]few things, brother 12Gauge mentioned that barrel of this Escort gets hot fast.

Couldn''t the ratling of forend/bolt be cured in someway. Brother 12gauge must have done something i am sure.[/QUOTE]\r\n \r\nyes, the rattling of the wood can be fixed, I fixed it several times but that does not make it OK for it to rattle in the first place. about the softer wood, all i can say is that may be in a bid to save cost and labor, the company is using wood that it less dense. otherwise I simply cannot explain the soft and ultra light wooden furniture of this shotgun.

(314874, ' [QUOTE=12GAUGE;161976]Sir, using chrome-moly steel alone does not guarantee a strong/robust barrel. the quality of steel matters as well. secondly the manufacturing quality along with manufacturing processes/techniques involved effect the quality of the barrel as well.\r\n.[/QUOTE]\r\n\r\nNothing could be more correct than this. I am also of the same view sir. When these companies advertise in BLOCK LETTERS " Chrome-moly Steel, Air craft Grade Aluminum, CNC machining, High Grade Turkish walnut" one must not accept this all at the face value. These all phrases does not automatically ensure a top quality weapon.\r\n\r\nNow for quickly heating up of the barrel could also be due to:\r\n1- Thinner barrels.\r\n2- Comparatively tight bore dia(increased friction)\r\n3- Rough internal finish(higher friction)\r\n4- Property of the steel used. \r\n  \r\nFor the soft/light wood i usually check this.\r\n\r\n1- Any cracks specially on the weaker place that is the wrist of the stock. That is thinnest and bears the maximum recoil.\r\n\r\n2- Any wear of the wood around the joining area specially with the metal(soft wood could show signs of wear).\r\n\r\n3- Balance of the gun. A stock with low density light wood would need either light barrel or balancing weight to bring the center of gravity of the gun close to the receiver. \r\n\r\n\r\nFinally in my opinion a barrel drilled/reamed or hammer forged would have hardly any advantage over the other(we are talking about smooth bores) provided they are made with close tolerances by quality machine work.', ''),

They were pieces of art. In those days s&w was like taurus. Just see in a medium frame colt detective special colt could fit 6 bullets while in a similar sized revolver s&w could only manage 5 bullets. The introduction of pistols in law enforcement agencies made colt loose money and they had to discontinue many models. So now load up your revolver and from a fixed support in single action mode fire at a paper target. Note the marks made by the misaligned chamber bullets. Repeat this procedure again. If bullet marks are all similar repeat the procedure above but increase distance from paper target. See the results. You would have fired 4 loaded cylinders worth of bullets. If suspected bullets hit target same as other bullets, you are good to go. But if they are not uniform with other bullets you should check for lead deposit between barrel and cylinder. If you find deposit. Do not use these suspected chambers. Please use the best bullet you can afford esp. American brand to get correct result. I hope results come out good.', ''),

When these companies advertise in BLOCK LETTERS " Chrome-moly Steel, Air craft Grade Aluminum, CNC machining, High Grade Turkish walnut" one must not accept this all at the face value. These all phrases does not automatically ensure a top quality weapon.[/QUOTE]\r\n\r\nAbsolutely Agreed Sir.\r\n\r\n[QUOTE=HasanJamshad;162100]Now for quickly heating up of the barrel could also be due to:\r\n1- Thinner barrels.\r\n2- Comparatively tight bore dia(increased friction)\r\n3- Rough internal finish(higher friction)\r\n4- Property of the steel used. [/QUOTE]\r\n\r\nI would say, No. 1 and 4. are the most probable cases here. I have not checked the barrel bore dia but the choke dia suggest that the barrel dia most probebly is 0.730inch. which leaves out No.2 case. the barrel''s internal finish is quiet smooth and top of that its hard chromed plated so this eliminates the possibility of case No. 3\r\n  \r\n[QUOTE=HasanJamshad;162100]\r\nBalance of the gun. A stock with low density light wood would need either light barrel or balancing weight to bring the center of gravity of the gun close to the receiver. [/QUOTE]\r\n\r\nthe barrel is quiet thin and the center of gravity is close to the receiver. you are absolutely right sir.\r\n\r\n[QUOTE=HasanJamshad;162100]\r\nFinally in my opinion a barrel drilled/reamed or hammer forged would have hardly any advantage over the other(we are talking about smooth bores) provided they are made with close tolerances by quality machine work.[/QUOTE]\r\n\r\nHere I would unfortunately disagree. a hammer forged barrel, be it a smooth bore or rifled barrel will always be alot stronger and most certainly outlive a drilled/reamed barrel as hammer forging process compresses the steel molecules tightly. effectively increasing the hardness (rockwell) of steel.\r\n\r\nhammer forging is not without its fair share of disadvantages. for one, it requires a huge investment somewhere in the vicinity of millions of dollars. second, the hammer forging process introduces large amounts of stresses in steel which need to be relieved and stress relieving is also an expensive venture (cryogenic or slow heating and subsequent cooling).\r\n\r\nbut the biggest advantage is that once the machinery to do such a process has been acquired/setup, a manufacturer can churn out barrels that offer consistent quality, significantly more durability and longer life in far less cost per unit  and with significantly less time per unit.\r\n\r\nThere must be a reason why all top manufacturers (Winchester, Remington, HK, Sako, Ruger, Beretta, Benelli, Browning, Baikal, Zastava, CZ) of shotguns/rifles are using (cold/hot) hammer forging  their barrels, whether they are smooth bore shotgun barrels or rifle barrels.\r\n\r\nRegards.', ''),

(315203, 'Handgun shooting - Useful tips - Courtesy Ezine articles. Pistol shooting is among the most difficult shootings. This is not surprising - pistols have no buttstock like rifles and they have a short distance between the front sight and the rear sight. Each of these factors makes pistol shooting prone to human error and frustration. With a few simple techniques pistol shooting results can be improved dramatically.\r\nFirst, a good grip is necessaray. This is the foundation of any good pistol shooter. The pistol should be gripped with the shooter''s STRONG hand, with the web of the hand as HIGH ON THE BACKSTRAP as possible. This brings the hand close to the bore, therby making recoil control easier. A good grip will also line up the bore with the rest of the shooter''s arm, or possibly slightly inward. With the correct grip, when the shooter is holding the gun with arms at sides in a relaxed position, the sights should LINE UP with the shooter''s elbow. This makes it much easier to properly place the shooter''s finger on the trigger.\r\nStrong hand grip should be FAIRLY TIGHT. A weak grip will not adequately control recoil, and can also make jerking the trigger easier. Good tight grip will prevent the hand from moving when the TRIGGER IS PULLED.\r\nThe next step is to employ the the right grip of weak hand. The shooter should place the pad of their hand CLOSEST TO THE THUMB on the exposed part of the pistol grip. Then the weak hand should be wrapped around the strong hand over the KNUCKLES. By pressing the side of the grip TOGEATHER with the strong hand, a great, sturdy grip is achieved. To MAKE SURE the hands are lined up properly, the shooter can point BOTH THUMBS IN THE DIRECTION OF THE TARGET. Make sure not to place the weak hand on the but of the grip, on top of the magazine.\r\nNext step is to master in a PROPER TRIGGER PULL. The shooter should place the pad of his/her index finger on the trigger as opposed to placing the trigger in the knuckle of the index finger. Pad of the finger allows only the first two joints of the finger to pull the trigger, and PREVENTS THE REST OF THE HAND FROM MOVING, THEREBY MINIMIZING PISTOL MOVEMENT. Once the finger is on the pad of the trigger, it should be pulled back SLOWLY until the breaking of the sear SURPRISES the shooter. Consistant practice with this technique will allow any shooter to spped up their shooting oner time. It also allows shooters to appreciate the QUALITY OF GOOD TRIGGER-which ia a GREAT INVESTMENT.\r\nLastly, the shooter needs to use his/her sights to the maximum effectiveness to SEAL THE DEAL. To do this , place the front sight IN BETWEEN of the rear sights, AND FOCUS ON THE FRONT SIGHT ONLY. The front sight should be crystal clear, and everything else, including the target, should be SLIGHTLY FUZZY. The shooter should not aim the target generally, but pin point an EXACT SPOT, the size of the HEAD OF A PIN, on the target and aim for THAT SPOT. Than the shooter should find the EXACT MIDDLE OF THE FRONT SIGHT and line this up with the pinpoint target. This TRICK alone will revolutionized the shooting.\r\nThese tips are not only a good foundation for any pistol shooter, but are guaranted to get consistant accurate shooting. Now get out there and shoot.', ''),

(we are talking about smooth bore)\r\n3- Are hammer forged barrels chrome lined?\r\n4- As Beretta, Browning, Perazzi employ hammer forging for their barrels(these all produce production guns) do Purdey, H&H, Boss follow the same trend to give their valued customers a better berrel???[/QUOTE]\r\n\r\nAns1: No! its not about withstanding added pressure. its about friction caused by shot column inside a barrel. a barrel which is hammer forged is worked hardened therefore given its extra hardness it will wear out less when compared to conventionally drilled barrel.\r\n\r\nAns1-2: Yes! a hammer forged barrel does perform better given the performance parameters. if performance is solely measured in useful life (with number of shots fired) then ofcourse yes. however it will not be the same amount of steel, infact it would require more steel. i''m assuming by "amount" you mean "by weight" not thickness. if you mean thickness then given the same thickness of steel, a hammer forged barrel will definitely outlive a conventionally drilled barrel.\r\n\r\nAns3: Yes! hammer forged barrels are chromed line but kindly do refer to the hardness charts(Rc) of steel vs chromed lining and you''ll be surprised to know that there is no need to chrome line a hammer forged surface. In my humble opinion (opinion, not a fact) manufacturers are hard chroming their hammer forged barrels in a bid to make barrel cleaning easy.\r\n\r\nAns4: Sir, Boss (Barrels made by H&K of Germany) and James Purdey and Merkel employ rotary hammer forging (cold) process to make shotgun barrels. could not find anything about H&H. may be they are using some other special technique.\r\n\r\nRegards.', ''),

(315364, 'Review: CZ P-07 DUTY Salams,\n\nI recently bought a CZ P-07 DUTY. It''s a relatively new gun in the CZ lineup being introduced in  2009. It''s mainly targeted towards law enforcement and military use hence bearing the DUTY designation. \n\nThe DUTY is a polymer frame lightweight compact pistol holding 16+1 rounds. The barrel length is 3.8 inches, the trigger DA/SA and sights fixed. It comes with a firing pin block and weighs around 1.7 lb.\n\nHolding the gun for the first time, one notices just how slim the grip is, the polymer grip texture is not very aggressive and the gun retains a firm but comfortable grip. CZ really went to town on grip finger placement on the DUTY frame, the thumbs and fingers automatically find a resting place when holding the gun. \n\nThe DUTY comes with three controls on the gun. The dis assembly lug / slide release, an AMBI safety and the mag release button. The mag release works smoothly and the mags drop out quickly and fit snugly back in. I should also mention that the mags used for the DUTY are not compatible with any other CZ gun and are specially made for the DUTY.   \n\nThe sights instantly remind one of Glock and target acquisition is easy and natural. \n\nThe outer finish is good. Disassembling the gun, one finds it well machined, clean and sort of uncomplicated. The frame itself is very light and weighs next to nothing. The gun also comes with the option of installation of either a safety or a decocker. Mine was shipped with a safety installed but the decocker can be bought online cheaply and installed instead. I didn''t like the recoil spring which was sharpish and the guide rod was very plastiky. However as long as they work fine I don''t care. CZ really should have included a compressed recoil spring akin Glock rather than 1911 / TT style   \n\nThe best thing I like about this gun is the trigger. The DUTY sports the new Omega trigger system which has lesser assembly parts and a much better pull. And it reality it does! The double action pull is around 10 lb''s but smooth and the single action (around 5 lb) is simply match grade and precise. The SA pull is what makes this gun exceptional. \n\nSome pictures below. InshAllah range test will follow in a couple of days. \n\n[IMG]http://i262.photobucket.com/albums/ii99/AbbasMalik/Duty1.jpg[/IMG]\n\n[IMG]http://i262.photobucket.com/albums/ii99/AbbasMalik/Duty2.jpg[/IMG]\n\n[IMG]http://i262.photobucket.com/albums/ii99/AbbasMalik/Duty4.jpg[/IMG]\n\n[IMG]http://i262.photobucket.com/albums/ii99/AbbasMalik/Duty5.jpg[/IMG]\n\n[IMG]http://i262.photobucket.com/albums/ii99/AbbasMalik/Duty6.jpg[/IMG]\n\n[IMG]http://i262.photobucket.com/albums/ii99/AbbasMalik/Duty7.jpg[/IMG]\n\n[IMG]http://i262.photobucket.com/albums/ii99/AbbasMalik/Duty8.jpg[/IMG]', ''),

(315552, ' [QUOTE]actually this hammer forged barrel not being as accurate as a button rifled barrel is only an opinion and not a documented fact (not a single study that suggests it otherwise) as both methods induce similar level of stresses in steel that need to be relieved (heat or cryo). cut/hook rifling however is a different story. it is not to be confused with button rifling.[/QUOTE] \n\nThis will indeed help us understanding barrels more. As far as i know all top names use hammer forging for their mass produced guns because it is the only process that can ensure fairly good barrels produced in great numbers with not so high costs. That is all... for hunting purposes these barrels are exceptionally good. Interestingly, the people who look for an exceptionally accurate barrel+system are not the hunters but are the sporting people....they want to benefit even from the thousandth of an inch because that could be the only difference between THE BEST and the others. These people will not even stand close to a mass produced hammer forged barrel. \nNow the stress relieving part, definitely hammer forging exerts too much stress in the barrel while compressing it to the desired diameter and rifling it, similarly button rifling exerts stress from inside compressing the grove in it without removing any metal. A barrel cut riffled does not come under these kind of stress, but, experts...not me.....one of the top custom barrel makers Krieger (they cut rifle their barrels) stress relieve their barrels not once but twice. This does not include the stress relieving of the steel blanks before delivering to the shop.\n\nReference: Lilja Barrels(button rifled), Schneider barrels(button rifled), Kieger barrels(Cut rifled).\n\n[QUOTE]If you watch movies based on medieval times you''ll see blacksmiths using large hammers and huge anvils to compress and fuse multiple layers of steel together to make swords and farming tools. Even then it was known to increase the hardness of steel.[/QUOTE]\n\nYes you are right there are such processes but for following purposes:\n1- Adding layers to make it flexible and resilient. \n2- Using water to temper the surface to make it hard, for sharpness and hardness.\n\nIn modern time for desired strength certain metal is used like Chrome-moly steel 4130, 4140, 4150 or Stainless steel 416, 410. This process of adding layers for extra strength was used to make barrels more strong and that was called DAMASCUS Barrels in the early twentieth century. Now better metals have solved these problems and all care is used to save the original chemistry of the metal. \nTo make the surface extra hard either it is tempered or/and chrome lined. \n\nA barrel is required to withstand a certain amount of pressure, a certain amount of friction and a certain amount of heat. For these all i don''t think any barrel making process(just making a hole+rifling) has any advantage above the other. There are advantages like:\n1- Cost of production.\n2- Required time.\n3- Degree of man hours.\n4- Requirement of technology.\n5- Accuracy(straight from the shop, a hammer forged barrel with custom job could also be made to shoot exceptionally accurate as process itself does not make it less accurate but is implied in mass production)\n\nRegards:', ''),

This does not include the stress relieving of the steel blanks before delivering to the shop.[/QUOTE]\r\n\r\nAgreed 100%. however there is a good reason for it. steel tends to undergo stress not only during fabrication but also during machining of any sort and specially when it is being poured into billets from the foundry. the top (the very top) manufacturers leave no stone unturned therefore resort to stress relieving measures (at every stage of the fabrication process) in a bid to ensure the best in the quality and accuracy. I was once incharge of fabricating radial gateways (MS with minimum thickness 120mm and maximum 250mm) and we had to stress relieve the whole structure and I still remember it was a P-I-T-A but nevertheless it was carried out as the whole structure was critical and stress cracks were a major concern.\r\n\r\n\r\n[QUOTE=HasanJamshad;162393]\r\nYes you are right there are such processes but for following purposes:\r\n1- Adding layers to make it flexible and resilient. \r\n2- Using water to temper the surface to make it hard, for sharpness and hardness.[/QUOTE]\r\n\r\nSir, I''m afraid that I need to explain the forging process in detail for complete understanding. which unfortunately would make us stray quiet far from the topic. anyways, flexibility is introduced by forging two steel layers of different hardness and ductility/malleability and water is not used to anneal(surface hardening), it is used to "Quench" (metal working) which is another topic altogether. \r\n\r\n[QUOTE=HasanJamshad;162393]\r\nIn modern time for desired strength certain metal is used like Chrome-moly steel 4130, 4140, 4150 or Stainless steel 416, 410. This process of adding layers for extra strength was used to make barrels more strong and that was called DAMASCUS Barrels in the early twentieth century. [/QUOTE]\r\n\r\nSir, forging is not only about adding/fusing multiple layers of metal together but also compressing a metal into shape. and all the steels that you are mentioning above 41XX (i''m not sure about SS) can be compressed by as much as three times. effectively increasing its hardness many times.\r\n\r\n[QUOTE=HasanJamshad;162393]To make the surface extra hard either it is tempered or/and chrome lined. [/QUOTE]\r\n\r\nNow i''m confused big time, how do we temper 416 (SS) and how can we chrome it? not every metal can be tempered (HINT: nickel??, chromium content??) or chromed (i''m assuming we are talking about hard chrome only). besides tempering only increases the surface hardness (rockwell). nothing else, the remaining crystalline (austenitic/pearlitic) structure of the steel remains the same. there is a downside to tempering as well. it makes metal brittle and we do not want that in a barrel that has to withstand huge amount of pressure. manufacturers do not temper their steel (barrels) for the very same reason.\r\n\r\nRegards.', ''),

In hammer forging even metal is not heated to the point where it could melt or its basic structure could change in anyway.\n4- It would be nice to know that a cylinder made with 41xx steel let us say a thickness of 3mm, handles a certain pressure. if we just condense this thickness to 2mm how much more pressure would it be able to handle, and if we further compress this cylinder to a thickness of 1mm how will it effect the pressure handling capability of the same cylinder?????? \n5- Tempering/chrome lining/hard chrome are the processes implied when needed on appropriate metals, with appropriate mix of materials.\n\nRegards:', ''),

The study was conducted to establish whether Cut/Button rifling is superior to hammer forging in terms of accuracy. The Result: STATISTICALLY INSIGNIFICANT ADVANTAGE.\r\n\r\n[QUOTE=HasanJamshad;162455]\r\nMetal forging process that was implied in early times to get a certain type of metal takes place in steel mills and Arms factories doesn''t do any metal forging. In hammer forging even metal is not heated to the point where it could melt or its basic structure could change in anyway.[/QUOTE]\r\n\r\nCorrection! All major Arms factories do hammer forging. higher end manufacturers even hammer forge chambers and now even actions are being hammer forged to ensure even tougher and long life firearms. about the hammer forging and metal structure, well sir, in hammer forging metal (cold or hot) the metal''s ferrite (+400C, I could be seriously wrong here) and cementite (+900C) structure changes significantly. the molecules are compressed (compacted) into each other. sometimes as much as 300 percent. making it worked hardened (not surface hardening).\r\n\r\n[QUOTE=HasanJamshad;162455]\r\n4- It would be nice to know that a cylinder made with 41xx steel let us say a thickness of 3mm, handles a certain pressure. if we just condense this thickness to 2mm how much more pressure would it be able to handle, and if we further compress this cylinder to a thickness of 1mm how will it effect the pressure handling capability of the same cylinder?????? [/QUOTE]\r\n\r\nSir, your question though a very good one poses some serious questions for me to answer and as much as I would like to answer it, unfortunately I cannot. kindly allow me to explain:\r\n\r\nin your example, I can foresee that inorder to compact a 3mm steel sheet into a 2mm sheet we either have to employ rolling (forging may not be feasible). thing is forging and rolling being compression working method change the properties of steel such as ductility, malleability, hardness etc.\r\n\r\nTherefore for me to answer the question I would need to employ lames theorem through which we can compute the yield stress, the level where plastic deformation starts to occur. but for that we need module of elasticity, Young''s modulus, ultimate tensile strength, yield strength, toughness (not required as such because it is substitutable), infact complete material property data would make things alot easier for us.\r\n\r\nHowever me must understand that certain materials behave differently when compressed. take example of 316SS, it is harder than 304 but when compressed it will become brittle and would not be able to take much pressure. whereas 304 which is alot softer than 316 when compressed will behave favorably under pressure.\r\n\r\nONE MORE THING I would like to add is that the question that you have put forward does not reflect the true nature of hammer forging. because in hammer forging metal is compressed to the desired thickness, not compressed beyond the desired thickness as the example put forward by you shows. \r\n\r\nfor example if we need to make a cylinder out of a 3mm steel sheet. we can take a 5mm steel sheet and roll/press it into 3mm and make a cylinder out of it. this truly represents hammer forging. as this will increase the hardness many folds by compressing the molecules together and while keeping the over all 3mm fabrication constraint intact.\r\n\r\nNow converting the above example into hammer forging for barrels. one maker makes barrels by taking a 1inch (OD) steel barrel blank and cut/button rifling it into a 1inch (OD) barrel whereas other maker takes a 3 inch (OD) barrel blank and hammer forges it into 1inch barrel (OD). question is which one would be more durable/long life/robust/tough/hard? (HINT: work hardening)\r\n\r\n[QUOTE=HasanJamshad;162455]\r\n5- Tempering/chrome lining/hard chrome are the processes implied when needed on appropriate metals, with appropriate mix of materials.[/QUOTE]\r\n\r\nAbsolutely agreed sir.\r\n\r\nRegards.', ''),

I forgot to mention the cost of the TBU''s. My suggestion is to pay the carpenter a full "diar", say Rs. 800 and ask him to cut the lasani circles, and make the TBU''s as well from left overs in his workshop. Hence add some Rs. 500 to the already Rs. 300 for the carpenter, for 3 TBU''s to the cost of the full set up, which now would amount to some Rs. 5K''s, 3 targets stand. Best of luck.[/B]', ''),

Coming straight to the main business:\n I formulated my questions in previous post so that you will yourself advocate my point of view.\n[QUOTE]Ans1: No! its not about withstanding added pressure. its about friction caused by shot column inside a barrel. a barrel which is hammer forged is worked hardened therefore given its extra hardness it will wear out less when compared to conventionally drilled barrel.[/QUOTE]\n\nSir, it means work hardening just hardens the surface to avoid corrosion from the friction and gives more serviceable life.......by using more steel(you correctly understood i mentioned quantity not thickness). Granted sir.\n\nSir you didn''t answer my second question in quantitative terms to establish the life of a smooth-bore barrel(Cut/Hammer forged). This would have measured the gained extra life of a hammer forged barrel. Sir instead you gave an opinion based statement that a hammer forged barrel will outlive a barrel produced otherwise. In this case we will have to wait for another 100 years or so to get a qualified information from a user of a such barrel as any scientific data is missing. Fortunately, we can see some smooth bore barrels in service for 80+ years off-course drilled/reamed/lapped without using modern steel and not even hard chromed.\n[QUOTE]Ans3: Yes! hammer forged barrels are chromed line but kindly do refer to the hardness charts(Rc) of steel vs chromed lining and you''ll be surprised to know that there is no need to chrome line a hammer forged surface. In my humble opinion (opinion, not a fact) manufacturers are hard chroming their hammer forged barrels in a bid to make barrel cleaning easy.[/QUOTE]\n\nSir, if we accept that work hardening is capable enough to avoid the wear against high friction then there would have been no need to chrome line the barrels.\nSir, chrome lining do help in easy cleaning but this is an added advantage of the process not a primary motive. \n[QUOTE]Ans4: Sir, Boss (Barrels made by H&K of Germany) and James Purdey and Merkel employ rotary hammer forging (cold) process to make shotgun barrels. could not find anything about H&H. may be they are using some other special technique.[/QUOTE]\n\nSir, please do refer the websites of Purdey,  H&H they and Boss they clearly mentioned the process of barrel making that is drilled and hand filed. \n\nSo, sir i don''t see any added life in a smooth bore barrel through this hammer forging process, it does not make it inferior(smooth bore) either.\nAlmost, all big companies use this process due to its production speed/ cost effectiveness. Using more steel to do something that could be done by using less and employing extra processes to get a job done(chrome lining while surface is already hard enough) could be a well-wisher''s point of view couldn''t be a companies that has to deal with a growing competition/costs scenario. \n\n\nRegards:', ''),

Remember when I say a study, I meant a study with a suitable sized sample along with a control (control sample) to establish your point of view. not a reference to barrel maker''s website where the manufacturer feels that his barrels are more accurate/durable.\r\n\r\n[QUOTE=HasanJamshad;162585]\r\nSir, if we accept that work hardening is capable enough to avoid the wear against high friction then there would have been no need to chrome line the barrels.[/QUOTE]\r\n\r\nSir, how can we accept something which is totally against the principles of metal fabrication. as I''ve said earlier that work hardening and surface hardening are totally different things and surface hardening is only surface (or just a little sub surface) whereas work hardening is hardening of entire crystalline structure of steel by packing them together.\r\n\r\nalso you didn''t read my previous post where I''ve suggested that you kindly search for hardness (Rc only) data on chrome and hammer forged steel. after knowing the data you''ll know why I say hard chroming a hammer forged isn''t necessary. in fact some of the major manufacturers are not hard chroming their hammer forged barrels. tangfoglio and CZ to name a few.\r\n\r\n[QUOTE=HasanJamshad;162585]\r\nSir, chrome lining do help in easy cleaning but this is an added advantage of the process not a primary motive. [/QUOTE]\r\n\r\nyou are absolutely right sir. chroming is also done to reduce costs. it is not only difficult to polish a bore it is also expensive. the easy way is to chrome a barrel and leave the bore polishing aside which not only takes time but is a very painstaking job. some of the most accurate manufacturers of barrels do not hard chrome their barrels as it also reduces accuracy and as per their statement, a polished steel barrel is far better than hard chromed barrel. I guess the ease in cleaning a chrome lined barrel never crossed their minds.\r\n\r\n[QUOTE=HasanJamshad;162585]\r\nSir, please do refer the websites of Purdey,  H&H they and Boss they clearly mentioned the process of barrel making that is drilled and hand filed. [/QUOTE]\r\n\r\nIn fact I have sir, [url]http://www.bossguns.co.uk[/url] and [url]http://www.bossguns.co.uk/robertsonspecs.asp[/url]. kindly do look and you''ll find the Boss makes barrels that are hammer forged at H&K. similarly James purdey barrel are also hammer forged.\r\n\r\n\r\nRegards\r\n\r\np.s.

Prior to its introduction (in 1903) it was customary to produce two rifle type weapons, one a long rifle for infantry use and one a short carbine for cavalry and other mounted troops such as engineers and artillery. The ''Short'' Lee Enfield was shorter than a normal ''long'' rifle, and longer than a carbine, and thus it was possible to standardize on one weapon for all branches of the Army.', ''),

It was the standard British and Commonwealth military cartridge from 1889 until the 1950s when it was replaced by the 7.62x51mm NATO.\r\n\r\nThe measurement .303-inch (7.7 mm) is the nominal size of the bore measured between the lands which follows the older blackpowder nomenclature. Measured between the grooves, the nominal size of the bore is .311-inch (7.9 mm). Bores for many .303 military surplus rifles are often found ranging from around .309-inch (7.8 mm) up to .318-inch (8.1 mm).

This cartridge was originally adopted by Germany in 1888 as the M/88 8x57 I (I stands for Infanterie or "Infantry").\r\n\r\nGermany adopted a new version of the M/88 cartridge in 1905 as the 8x57mm IS (IS stands for ''Infanterie, Spitz(geschoß)'' or ''Infantry, Pointed (bullet)''). The 1905 pattern cartridge was the German service cartridge in both World Wars and is now known in Europe as the 8x57 IS or 8x57mm IS (C.I.P. designation) and in the USA as the 7.92x57mm IS or 8 mm Mauser (the widespread use in German military Mauser rifles caused the "Mauser" tag, though Mauser had nothing to do with the development of this cartridge).

I''ve fired 50 rounds through it. I couldn''t fire 10 rounds at a time without having a jam. Im new to this site and handguns, so I don''t know wether u call it guy ftf or fte problem. I think it''s not a Ftf cz it fire all, but it sometimes fails to insert next bullet in the chamber. The bullet get stuck between the chamber and mag and the slide gets stuck almost a inch or soo going all the way. When u take out that round it starts firing again and then same thing happens again. Need help to solve this matter. What should I do?', ''),

As i am all new to this ..\r\n  \r\n Thanks[/QUOTE]\r\n\r\n@Naveed_pk;\r\nPlease note the following details; this is  common winter visitor on Chenab. \r\n\r\nRUDDY SHELDUCK\r\n\r\n[U]Distribution[/U]\r\nThere are very small resident populations of this species in north west Africa and Ethiopia, but the main breeding area of this species is from south east Europe across central Asia to southeast China. These birds are mostly migratory, wintering in southern Asia.\r\nAlthough becoming quite rare in southeast Europe and southern Spain, the Ruddy Shelduck is still common across much of its Asian range. \r\nIt may be this population which gives rise to vagrants as far west as Iceland, Great Britain and Ireland. However, since the European population is declining, it is likely that most occurrences in Western Europe in recent decades are escapes or feral birds. Although this bird is observed in the wild from time to time in eastern North America, no evidence of a genuine vagrant has been found.\r\n\r\n[B][U][/U]Biological descriptions[/B]\r\nThis is a bird of open country, and it will breed on cliffs, in burrows, tree holes or crevices distant from water, laying 6-16 creamy-white eggs, incubated for 30 days. The Ruddy Shelduck is usually found in pairs or small groups and rarely forms large flocks. However, moulting and wintering gatherings on chosen lakes or slow rivers can be very large.\r\n\r\nThe Ruddy Shelduck is a distinctive species, 58&#8211;70 cm long with a 110&#8211;135 cm wingspan. It has orange-brown body plumage and a paler head. The wings are white with black flight feathers. It swims well, and in flight looks heavy, more like a goose than a duck. \r\nThe sexes of this striking species are similar, but the male has a black ring at the bottom of the neck in the breeding season summer, and the female often has a white face patch. The call is a loud wild honking.\r\nIn captivity this species is generally aggressive and antisocial and is best housed in pairs unless in a very large area. \r\nThen it may mix with other species, although it will still be feisty at breeding time.\r\nThe genus name Tadorna comes from Celtic roots and means "pied waterfowl", essentially the same as the English "shelduck".\r\n\r\nIt is identified with the Akkadian "i&#7779;&#7779;&#363;r &#7723;urri"In Tibet and Mongolia, Ruddy Shelduck is considered sacred by the Buddhists. It is also a sacred animal in Slavic mythology In Hindi and Urdu (India/Pakistan) it is called Surkhab.\r\n\r\n[B][U]Diet & Habitat[/U][/B]\r\nShelducks are omnivores and eat grass and small shore animals, such as crabs, mollusks, snails and winkles. In shallow water, they eat insects and water weeds. \r\nThe Ruddy Shelduck spend a bit more time away from water than most other ducks. They are adaptable and live near freshwater locations, mountains, grasslands and deserts.\r\n\r\nRegards.\r\n################################', '');

It takes a very good shooter to get birds with a bullet instead of a barrage of bullets, as is the case of a shotgun.\n \nBesides, it is easy to get judgmental about such things. Ask the birds ;-) and get their opinion as well:becky:. One sided opinions regarding what is ethical hunting and what is killing is really self serving....to satisfy our own egos....to give legitimacy to our acts. It is like a court where the accused is given a death sentence by hanging or firing squad without giving him a chance to defend himself. If you ask him, he will complain the unjustified act of death sentence and not the way it is to be carried out.

Mostly 1911''s are available in .45 and 0.40 but these calibers are not the only ones in which these guns are made. Some manufacturers offer/offered these in 0.38, 9mm, and .357 calibers.\n \nRegarding their availability in Pakistan, I don''t think any one imports them brand new US models. Some chinese, Turkish and Brazilian models may be available locally. \n \nUsed ones normally come from afghanistan which are stolen/snattched from coalition forces and are not in very good condition due to heavy battelfield usage.\n \nI personally like 1911 style made by Kimber, they are really cool guns but very expensive. another disadvantage is the ammo price in Pakistan. 9mm in my opinion is the most affordable ammo in Pakistan after 30 bore.', ''),

The Mini lived up to the mark and review.\r\n\r\n\r\n I tested it in my 15M range with the captain''s recommended CCI Stringer (hyper velocity HP) ammo today. For the sack of comparasion, I bought 50 rounds of Federal, ELEY, RSW high velocity and cheap AMSCORE. \r\n\r\n I fired 25 rounds, each, of CCI Stringer with one FTF, RSW with two FTF, Federal and ELY with three FTFs and three FTEs and AMSCORE with three FTFs and seven FTEs.\r\n\r\nThe gun was shooting at about four to five inches to right at 7M.\r\n\r\nAfter this session I was able to dissemble the gun with a trick (contrary to Captain''s observation) for cleaning. The dissembled Mini revealed the ACP 0.22 LR barrel, High quality metal parts and precise machining that is absent in local made Arms. The only thing that I could object was the the black coating procedure performed which could easily be scratched.  \r\n\r\nAfter cleaning I fired the remaining 25 CCI Stringer Bullets. To my surprise, the FTEs and FTFs were reduced to ZERO and the accuracy was increased to three inches to right at 7M.\r\n\r\nConclusion.\r\n\r\nIt is a good, cheap gun when CCI ammu is used and is cleaned properly.

When Taurus announced that it would be introducing it''s very own 1911 .45 ACP model and to top it up, they stated in their initial press release that ''their'' 1911 was &#8220;Destined to become the standard that all 1911 pistols are compared against&#8221;, this raised alot of furor and anticipation among 1911 fans across the globe. This was further hyped by discussion of various online forums even by people who probably had never shot a 1911, claiming either that Taurus 1911 is not upto the mark OR that it is a very good gun for the price.\n\nAll this changed within a few months of it''s release. 1911 fans across the world who have bought and used this model from Taurus now acknowledge that the Taurus 1911 is not only a very good gun for the price, but a very good gun for any price range.\n\nSimilar models (having similar quality and performance) from manufacturers such as Wilson Combat, Kimber, Springfield, and other 1911 makers sell their models for $2000. Taurus is offering the same thing for $600 !!! Naturally, the question arises, how can similar quality and performance be offered for less than 1/3rd the price. Well, that has been Taurus'' marketing strategy since the last many years and we''ve seen this also in their PT92/99 model. This is one of the reasons why they have grabbed such a huge market share in such short time, and Pakistan is no exception where the other high-end 1911s cost 3 to 4 times more and offer the same quality.

I ''ve found the trick to be very useful especially for the surface inspection to find traces of rust and looking for cracks in the frame.\r\n\r\nUse your digital camera to take high resolution clear close ups of total surface area of your firearm (8~10 pics at most). Now see them on your computer screen. I bet you''ll see what you can''t see with your naked eyes.\r\n\r\nSave these pics and use them as reference the next time you take pics.

(317391, ' @Faheem, Coolbox and Sparticus Thank you :)\n\nThe DUTY has been long over due for a range test. I had been meaning to fire it to my satisfaction but did not find the opportunity before. Today I took it to the range and fired seven different types of ammo to test for reliability.  Armscor, Wolf, Barnaul, POF 1Z and Red Box Chinese marked 311 as well as Armscor and Privi hollow points. \n\n[IMG]http://i262.photobucket.com/albums/ii99/AbbasMalik/CZDUTY.jpg[/IMG]\n\nLet me start off by saying that this gun is fun to shoot. It does not kick much, rests firmly in your hand, sights are easy to acquire, trigger (a little creepy) smooth and it does what it''s supposed to without much fuss. A workhorse in other words, which is exactly what is expected from a duty gun. A total of 200 rounds were fired today with all sorts of ammo without any kinds of misfires or jams. One round (POF) got stuck in the gun pretty bad and took us 20 minutes to clear but the round itself was faulty and not the handgun''s fault at all. All subsequent rounds (POF and otherwise) fired without a hitch. \n\nI normally post my own targets but it was my pleasure today to ask our Expert Panel member Munir Sahib to test the gun for us. His targets pretty much do the talking.\n\n[IMG]http://i262.photobucket.com/albums/ii99/AbbasMalik/MunirSB.jpg[/IMG]\n\nTarget at 15 M:\n\n[IMG]http://i262.photobucket.com/albums/ii99/AbbasMalik/MunirSB1.jpg[/IMG]\n\nTarget at 25 M:\n\n[IMG]http://i262.photobucket.com/albums/ii99/AbbasMalik/MunirSB2.jpg[/IMG]\n\nI think these targets are fantastic for an out of the box gun with a 3.7 inch barrel, specially considering that the shooter has fired a total of 20 shots from this pistol. What else can one ask from a duty / carry gun. It''s reliable, lightweight, accurate and compact. A real winner at 85 K and anytime comparable to the Glock 19.', ''),

Position ''2'' is for lighter loads . the gas valve would be fully open to allow for MORE gas to be utilized for cycling the weapon.\n\nIt is not recommended to use position ''2'' with magnum loads as the the weapon would cycle harder and the bolt MAY damage the rear of the weapon. \n\nI do not use magnum loads.\n\nTry using your light loads in ''position 1'' if the weapon cycles properly then you can keep it in position ''1'' forever and not have to worry about anything.\n\nTo summarize:\n\nposition ''1'' is recommended for use with heavy loads/ magnum type\nUsing light loads in position ''1''  is okay.  Using light loads in position''1'' would NOT damage the weapon. If the amount of gas is not enough (due to use of lighter loads) the weapon would simply not cycle properly.. that is ALL.

There is one thing that I have noticed that this is not a true CZ-75 design. the locking mechanism employs browning type shoulder locking mechanism whereas the rest is typical CZ-75 based. i.e., kidney shaped tilting barrel and slide-inside-the-frame mechanisms.\r\n\r\nNow, we all know slide-inside-the-frame is considered an inherently accurate design and browning type shoulder locking provides more tight/firm/rigid (hence accurate) slide to barrel lock up when compared to other designs.

It is based on Sig Platform i.e., a reliable one, accepted fact.\n\nBut one thing needs to be emphasized the metallargy of gun is NOT SAME I dont think it is even 50% of Original Sig. After all you are comparing a product "Made in China" to "Original Sig".\n\nEven then if Aquarius our senior & respected PG member and others are positive about it then my suggestion is AFTER Protective Measures ( even seriously use a helmet ) and give it a Torture Test of a 1000 Rounds/day for 7 days a week. Atleast fire more than 5000 rounds in a limited period of time and the pistol should be picked up randomly.\n\nIf it gets through the "Real Test" and not mere assumptions and also approved by Forum Seniors after the Torture Test then it is good to go. Otherwise atleast I am Paranoid about Kaboom and nothing else I also want a High Capacity 7.62X25 mm.\n\nRegards[/QUOTE]\nThank you brother for your welcome.I understand your concerns but i am not worried about it going kaboom the only thing i am worried about is px 3 magazine issue brought forward by syed.what verve bro said about chine,s metallurgy makes sense as well.there is no doubt about original sig p226 i love it and i own one since 1999.', ''),

It was the standard British and Commonwealth military cartridge from 1889 until the 1950s when it was replaced by the 7.62x51mm NATO.\n\nThe measurement .303-inch (7.7 mm) is the nominal size of the bore measured between the lands which follows the older blackpowder nomenclature. Measured between the grooves, the nominal size of the bore is .311-inch (7.9 mm). Bores for many .303 military surplus rifles are often found ranging from around .309-inch (7.8 mm) up to .318-inch (8.1 mm). Recommended bullet diameter for standard .303 cartridges is .312-inch (7.9 mm).[2]\n\n[B]After that the bullet  czechoslovakian 8mm mauser rifle [/B]\nThe 8x57mm I cartridge was designed by the German Gewehr-Prüfungskommission (G.P.K.) (Rifle Testing Commission) for the Gewehr 1888 and later used in Mauser bolt-action rifles, machine guns, and other ordinance weapons. This cartridge was originally adopted by Germany in 1888 as the M/88 8x57 I (I stands for Infanterie or "Infantry").\n\nGermany adopted a new version of the M/88 cartridge in 1905 as the 8x57mm IS (IS stands for ''Infanterie, Spitz(geschoß)'' or ''Infantry, Pointed (bullet)''). The 1905 pattern cartridge was the German service cartridge in both World Wars and is now known in Europe as the 8x57 IS or 8x57mm IS (C.I.P. designation) and in the USA as the 7.92x57mm IS or 8 mm Mauser (the widespread use in German military Mauser rifles caused the "Mauser" tag, though Mauser had nothing to do with the development of this cartridge).

(317769, ' [B]Beautiful letter written by a father to his son. This applies to daughters too. [/B]  \r\n\r\nDear Son,  \r\n  \r\nI am writing this to you because of 3 reasons \r\n\r\n1.   Life, fortune and mishaps are unpredictable, nobody knows how long he lives. Some words are better said early. \r\n2. I am your father, and if I don''t tell you these, no one else will.  \r\n3.  What is written is my own personal bitter experiences that perhaps could save you a lot of unnecessary heartaches. \r\n\r\nRemember the following as you go through life \r\n\r\n1. Do not bear grudge towards those who are not good to you. No one has the responsibility of treating you well, except your mother and I. To those who are good to you, you have to treasure it and be thankful, and ALSO you have to be cautious, because, everyone has a motive for every move. When a person is good to you, it does not mean he really likes you. You have to be careful, don''t hastily regard him as a real friend. \r\n\r\n2.  No one is indispensable, nothing in the world that you must possess.  Once you understand this idea, it would be easier for you to go through life when people around you don''t want you anymore, or when you lose what/who you love most. \r\n\r\n3. Life is short. When you waste your life today, tomorrow you would find that life is leaving you. The earlier you treasure your life, the better you enjoy life. \r\n\r\n4. Love is but a transient feeling, and this feeling would fade with time and with one''s mood. If your so called loved one leaves you, be patient, time will wash away your aches and sadness. Don''t over exaggerate the beauty and sweetness of love, and don''t over exaggerate the sadness of falling out of love. \r\n\r\n5. A lot of successful people did not receive a good education, that does not mean that you can be successful by not studying hard! Whatever knowledge you gain is your weapon in life. One can go from rags to riches, but one has to start from some rags! \r\n\r\n6. I do not expect you to financially support me when I am old, either would I financially support your whole life. My responsibility as a supporter ends when you are grown up. After that, you decide whether you want to travel in a public transport or in your limousine, whether rich or poor. \r\n\r\n7. You honour your words, but don''t expect others to be so. You can be good to people, but don''t expect people to be good to you. If you don''t understand this, you would end up with unnecessary troubles. \r\n\r\n8. I have bought lotteries for umpteen years, but I never strike any prize. That shows if you want to be rich, you have to work hard! There is no free lunch! \r\n\r\n9. No matter how much time I have with you, let''s treasure the time we have together. We do not know if we would meet again in our next life. \r\n   \r\n[B]Your Everloving Dad.[/B]', ''),

The gun is a  single-shot flintlock, made by Philadelphia gunsmith Henry Derringer.  It’s tiny – just six inches total in length with a 2 1/2&#8243; barrel – but  it’s powerful, firing a .44-caliber bullet. The gun was found on the  floor of the theater box where Lincoln sat. Also in the museum is the  knife with which Booth stabbed one of Lincoln’s companions, Major Henry  Rathbone, in the arm before Booth jumped from the box to escape.\n [IMG]http://static.neatorama.com/images/2007-06/bullet-lincoln.jpg[/IMG]\n[I]The bullet that killed Lincoln [/I]\n What about the bullet that killed one of the most revered figures in  American history? You can see that, too. It was removed during a  post-mortem autopsy and was kept by the U.S. War Department until 1940,  when it went to the Department of the Interior. It can be viewed today  at the National Museum of Health and Medicine in Washington, D.C.\n [B]\nTHE SARAJEVO PISTOL[/B]\n\n [B][IMG]http://static.neatorama.com/images/2007-06/browning-1910-princip.jpg[/IMG]\n[/B]Model 1910 Browning semiautomatic pistol like this one above  was used by Gavrilo Princip to assassinate Archduke Franz Ferdinand and  precipitate World War I. \n On June 28, 1914, [URL="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gavrilo_Princip"]Gavrilo Princip[/URL] shot and killed the heir to the Austro-Hungarian throne,  Archduke Franz Ferdinand, and his wife, Sophie, in Sarajevo, Bosnia. The  assassinations caused a chain reaction of events which, within less  than five weeks, led to the start of World War I. The gun was a Browning  semiautomatic pistol, model M1910, serial #19074.\n [IMG]http://static.neatorama.com/images/2007-06/gavrilo-princip-arrested.jpg[/IMG]\n[I]Gavrilo Princip, second right, arrested after he fired on Archduke Ferdinand.[/I]\n Princip, just 19, was a member of the Serbian nationalist group  called the Black Hand. He fired seven shots into the royal couple’s car  from five feet away, then attempted to shoot himself, but was stopped by  passerby and quickly arrested. Princip died in prison of tuberculosis  in 1918 (the disease was one reason he took the mission). After his  trial, the pistol was presented to Father Anton Puntigam, the Jesuit  priest who had given the archduke and duchess their last rites. He hoped  to place it in a museum, but then he died in 1926 the gun was lost …  for almost 80 years.\n In 2004 a Jesuit community house in Austria made a startling  announcement: they had found the gun (verified by its serial number).  They donated it to the Vienna Museum of Military History in time for the  90th anniversary of the assassination that started a war that would  eventually kill 8.5 million people. Also in the museum are the car in  which the couple were riding, the bloodied pillow cover on which the  archduke rested his head while dying, and petals from a rose that was  attached to Sophie’s belt.\n [B]THE MUSSOLINI MACHINE GUN[/B]\n\n [IMG]http://static.neatorama.com/images/2007-06/mussolini-machine-gun.jpg[/IMG]\n[I]Moikom Zeqo, Director of Albanian National Historic Museum showing the rifle used to execute Mussolini. [/I]\n\n On April 28, 1945, Italian dictator [URL="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benito_Mussolini"]Benito Mussolini[/URL]  [wiki] and his mistress, Claretta Petacci, were captured while trying  to flee into Switzerland. They were executed by an Italian communist  named Valter Audisio, who shot the pair with a French-made MAS  (Manufacture d’Armes de St. Etienne) 7.65mm submachine gun.\n The gun disappeared until 1973, when Audisio died. He’d kept it in  Italy until 1957, when, during a resurgence of Mussolini’s popularity,  he secretly gave it to the communist Albanian government for  safekeeping. With Audisio’s death, the Albanians proudly displayed the  gun “on behalf of the Italian people.” Its home is now Albania’s  National Historical Museum. Audisio once wrote that the only reason he  used the machine gun was that the two pistols he tried to use had  jammed. He also said that he had no orders to shoot Petacci – but she  wouldn’t let go of Il Duce.\n [B]\nLEE HARVEY OSWALD’S GUNS[/B]\n\n [IMG]http://static.neatorama.com/images/2007-06/lee-harvey-oswald-rifle.jpg[/IMG]\n[I]Lee Harvey Oswald’s Rifle\n[/I]\n [IMG]http://static.neatorama.com/images/2007-06/lee-harvey-oswald.jpg[/IMG]The gun that [URL="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lee_Harvey_Oswald"]Lee Harvey Oswald[/URL] allegedly used to assassinate President John F. Kennedy is a Mannlicher-Carcano .38 bolt-action rifle 6.5mm caliber Italian surplus military rifle, 40 inches long, and weighs eight pounds. He bought it through a mail-order company for $12.78.\n Something with as much historical significance as Oswald’s rifle  would become the property of the people of the United States, right?  Wrong. Murder weapons are normally returned to the families of their  owners, and Oswald’s gun was no exception – it was returned to Oswald’s  widow.\n The National Archives purchased the rifle from Marina Oswald. The  Archives also has the .38 Special Smith & Wesson Victory revolver  that Oswald had with him that day and used (allegedly) to kill Officer  J.D. Tippett before being arrested. Two days later, Oswald was shot and  killed by Jack Ruby.\n [B]\nJACK RUBY’S GUN[/B]\n[URL="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Ruby"]Ruby[/URL]  was a Dallas club owner and small-time mobster who killed  the alleged killer of the president. Just why he did it remains a  mystery. But on November 24, 1963, in the basement of the Dallas jail –  which at the time was crowded with police officers, reporters, and  cameramen – Ruby walked right up to Oswald and shot him once in the  side. The gun he used was a .38-caliber Colt Cobra revolver that he  bought at Ray’s Hardware and Sporting Goods (on the advice of Dallas  police detective Joe Cody).\n [IMG]http://static.neatorama.com/images/2007-06/jack-ruby-shoots-oswald.jpg[/IMG]\nJack Ruby shot Lee Harvey Oswald\n The  gun was returned to Ruby’s family, where it promptly became tangled in a  legal battle over Ruby’s estate between the lawyer who was appointed  executor and Ruby’s brother, Earl. It wouldn’t be resolved until 1991,  when a judge found for Earl Ruby, who immediately put the gun up for  auction and it sold to a collector named A.V. Pugliese. Price: $220,000.\n In 1992 a friend of Pugliese’s brought it to Washington, D.C., and  offered to show it to Speaker of the House Thomas Foley. The gun was  seized by police and almost destroyed, per D.C.’s strict gun-control  laws, but lawyers were able to get it back. On November 24, 1993, the  30th anniversary of the shooting, Pugliese had Earl Ruby fire 100 shots  with the gun and offered the spent shells for sale. Price: $2,500 each.  (They only sold a few.)\n [B]\nSADDAM HUSSEIN’S PISTOL[/B]\nWhen former Iraqi president [URL="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saddam_Hussein"]Saddam Hussein[/URL]  was captured in a “spider hole” in Iraq in December 2003, he had  several weapons with him. One was a pistol. Major General Raymond  Odierno reported that Hussein was holding the loaded pistol in his lap  when he was captured, but didn’t make a move to use it.\n The Army had the pistol mounted and, in a private meeting, the  Special Forces soldiers who took part in the capture presented it to  President George W. Bush.\n When news of the war souvenir broke in May 2004, reporters asked  President Bush if he planned to give the pistol to the next Iraqi  president. No, he said, it “is now the property of the American  government.” The gun is kept in a small study off the Oval Office, and  according to one White House visitor who late spoke to Time magazine,  the president “really liked showing it off. He was really proud of it.”', ''),

(317993, 'Barrel Life Would you ever buy a gun if the barrel will only work for less than 10 seconds?\n\nMost guns have barrels that last thousands of rounds without losing accuracy. But how much is a guns barrel life in terms of time actually used? The answer surprised me and it might surprise you too.\nAccording to this calculation the [B]average life (in actual usage) of a barrel is only 5-10 seconds!![/B]\n\n[URL]http://bulletin.accurateshooter.com/2010/11/gone-in-six-seconds-barrel-life/[/URL]\n"If a bullet flies at 3000 fps, it will pass through a 24" (two-foot) barrel in 1/1500th of a second. If you have a useful barrel life of 3000 rounds, that would translate to just two seconds of actual bullet-in-barrel operating time.\n\nBut it’s not that simple. Your bullet starts at zero velocity and then accelerates as it passes through the bore, so the projectile’s average velocity is not the same as the 3000 fps muzzle velocity. So how long does a centerfire bullet (with 3000 fps MV) typically stay in the bore? The answer is about .002 seconds. \n\nSo, if a bullet spends .002 seconds in the barrel during each shot, and you get 3000 rounds of accurate barrel life, how much actual firing time does the barrel deliver before it loses accuracy? That’s simple math: 3000 x .002 seconds = [B][COLOR=red]6 seconds[/COLOR][/B]."', ''),
(317995, 'Just bought the Diana 54 Airking Salaam Everyone,\r\n\r\nAfter much consideration and pondering I finally went ahead and purchased a brand new Diana 54 Airking for Dhs 1,850 (after negotiation). I bought it from Al Sayad earlier today and am having it delivered to me in Karachi via a "khepia". I did a little research on the subject and found out that we need to keep the receipt with us to show at the Dubai airport and check it into the luggage after informing the airline. \r\n\r\nI asked for a UTG scope mount base but they didn''t have it. I''ve been reading that some of the Dianas suffer from barrel droop which is corrected by the appropriate base. I suppose this will have to arrive later via a UK/Canada/US based friend. \r\n\r\nRegarding scopes...I have a Hawke 9x40 Sport HD. They didn''t have any Hawke scopes at Al Sayad otherwise I would have bought a similar scope with at least 16x50. I''ll be taking the 9x40 off my Theoben and putting it on this new weapon. For the Theoben, I''ll get some cheapo Tasco or something since it barely has any recoil and I doubt it will do any damage to even a mediocre scope. I am determined to get myself a 16x50 Hawke though so I''m waiting for any of my buddies in the UK, Canada or the US to visit so I can have them be my carriers. \r\n\r\nThey didn''t have any decent one piece scope mounts and suggested I buy the Gamo one piece scope mount..and because i''m not physically present there I decided to try it out and buy one. I doubt it will do much good but no harm in trying it out. The scope mount I have now is a two piece and I have a leapers scope mount base...so this combination is no good for the Diana 54 cause I''ll need the one piece configuration to withstand the double recoil. \r\n\r\nI found that the guys at Al Sayad didn''t have much knowledge of the product they''re selling at all. They were selling Barracuda pellets at Dhs 75 for 125 pellets....thats absolutely ridiculous! They didn''t have the Crossman Premiers but are selling Gamo Match for only Dhs 15. I''ve asked my friend in Dubai to pick up their catalogue and email it to me for future use....if I get it...I will share it with all of you.\r\n\r\nAny pointers or anything to share from the more experience guys here would be greatly appreciated.', ''),

Anyways, so I''ve turned to TNT Couriers, Emirates Cargo and a few other services. TNT will charge PKR 5,200 and will take 3 days to deliver it to my home. They''re going to bring a 10kg package, therefore I have space for more pellets and accessories, if TNT is the final choice. I will do a little more investigating and find out the best solution and share with all of you. One thing is clear though, Dhs 1,850 = PKR 42,180 + Pkr 5,200 for shipping = PKR 47,180...still a better price than in Pakistan where is costs around PKR 55,000. You get the extra space to order your scope mount, pellets, and whatever else you can fit into the coupla kg left in your limit.

(318413, ' Thanks everyone.\n@HammadArshad: Good question, I was wondering the same. I would say max 20 seconds by the formula given in the website (not sure its even right, our experts may please vet it).\nAssumptions:\nA 9mm pistol bullet would travel at say half the muzzle velocity of a rifle bullet, i.e. 3000 fps / 2 = 1500fps. So the time in the barrel would roughly double: 0.002 seconds * 2 = 0.004 seconds in a 24" barrel. \nIf it spends .004 seconds in a 24" barrel it would spend one-sixth the time in a 4" pistol barrel. So 0.004 / 6 = 0.0006667 seconds per shot.\nSay you shoot your pistol for 30,000 rounds before getting rid of it (very few of us would shoot that much with one gun). Your barrel life would be:\n30,000 *  0.0006667 = 20 seconds.\n[B]Enjoy it while it lasts![/B]\n...and think of it... 30,000 9mm rounds @ say Rs.35 each  = Rs. 1,050,000. So you get to spend [B]Rs. 52,500 per second just on ammo[/B]!! (1,050,000 / 20).\n\nAgain, the ''formula'' is off some website and is not vetted.

I understand Mitho''s feelings of disgust, I would have also felt the same had this happened to me. However, the reaction was a bit uncalled for and certainly did not warrant use of abusive language. Conversely, a photographic evidence was a must which I found missing from the review and despite repeated requests from various members, was not produced.  \n\n\nIMHO, a final verdict just can not be passed on experience of using only one gun. I have seen the slides of many Walthers getting cracked. Does it mean Walther is a crap company?? I have also seen many faulty Glocks, Smith & Wessons etc etc. No body says that Glock or S&W is a crap company. They are all labelled top companies because a large percentage of weapons from these companies satisfy the customer.  \n\nI have used many Turkish handguns from companies like Canik55, Sarsilmaz, Stoeger, Girsan Yavuz, Zigana etc and found them excellent value for money.

Finally my patience is rewarded, i have the gun :D usually all couriers r made to place before 2 pm so last i checked, the gun didnt arrive but guess Ashraf sahb was rite for the first tym. The gun was waiting for me wen i got bak home :).. \ni was barely able to shoot 35-40 pellets thru it, the first thing i noticed and liked about the gun was it shot pretty decent groups! rite out of the box first five shots at 15 feet, widout any adjustments (although missing the bullseye) landed withing 1.25 inches, i use the artillery hold which aids in achieving decent groups and consistency. 2nd thing i liked about the gun was its power, the pellets went thru half inch ply wood constantly at 15-20 feet; left several holes in a bank''s billboard at approx 90 feet ;) the quality and finish were ok, not something to brag about but not bad either. The weight is lighter than the chinese b3-1. The front sights needed to be unscrewed and adjusted as they were slightly tilted, the rear sight windage works fine, so does the elevation; but despite adjustment the shots are landing 2.5-3 inches above the bullseye, and the elevation has been screwed down to the maximum (any advice on how to fix this will be appreciated). So i decided to shoot a little below the target and achieved accuracy :p but there must be a solution, i dont wana continue to shoot like this ;) mayb a scope will help but i''ll mount it after 250-300 shots.. the gun vibrates in a wierd way but hopefully it will smoothen out after a 100 shots or so. The trigger is VERY hard, it should be softened n crisped a little, that shall add to the pleasure of shooting this rifle. all in all, satisfied by the purchase :D my rating for this gun (given the affordable price):\nPower: 8/10\nLooks/finish: 7/10\nFront/Rear Sights: 7.5/10\nGrouping/consistency: 9/10\nTrigger: 6.5/10', ''),

I mean the make and caliber etc...[/QUOTE]\n \nThe weapon, a 9mm Glock 18C, was discovered by Delta Force special troops when they dug Hussein out of his fox hole outside Tikrit on 13 December 2003. The legendary beast of Baghdad emerged from the 8ft-deep hole bewildered and disorientated; with his shaggy beard and unkempt mop of hair he looked closer to a dishevelled elf than one of the world''s great dictators.\n\nThe Iraq war at that point was still in its infancy, Bush was feeling buoyant. In his eyes the pistol represented a fundamental triumph of good over evil.\n\nAfter four Delta Force soldiers presented Bush with the pistol, mounted in a glass case, it became one of his most prized possessions. He would show it off in the Oval Office to visiting military dignitaries, with the boast "The Delta guys pulled it off Saddam".\n\nNow the New York Times has discovered that he intends to make it a centrepiece of his presidential library that is being built, at a cost of $200m (£123m), on the campus of Southern Methodist University in Dallas, Texas. Though the gun belongs to the US national archives, associates told the Times that he intends prominently to display it there. The library is to be organised thematically around 25 key decisions taken by Bush during his eight years in the White House.\n\nMark Langdale, the president of the foundation that is being set up in Bush''s name, told the paper that "the gun is an interesting artefact, and it tells you that the United States captured Saddam Huseein and disarmed him literally. How we fit that into the decision to go to war, we haven''t gotten to that point yet."\n\nOne can empathise with Langdale''s difficulty. How indeed does the pistol fit with the decision to go to war?\n\nWhich is where irony, or the former president''s lack of it, kicks in. Hussein was found with the pistol as he crouched on all fours in his cave. But he offered no resistance to the Delta Forces and when they came to confiscate his gun they found that it was unloaded. It is safe to assume that the Bush library will not labour that point when it opens in 2013.', ''),

These shotguns also works well for home defense and security applications, especially with availability of relatively short-barreled models with long magazines.\r\n\r\nType: Pump action shotgun\r\nGauge: 12;Chamber 76mm / 3&#8243;\r\nWeight: 3.06 kg / 6.7 lbs to 3.18 kg / 7 lbs\r\nLength: 1003 mm / 39.5&#8243; to 1245 mm / 49&#8243;\r\nBarrel length: 457 mm / 18&#8243; to 711 mm / 28&#8243;\r\nCapacity: 4, 5 or 7 rounds\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2.

It was introduced in the 1937, and was based on the design patented by John M. Browning in 1915 and improved by Harry Howland of Ithaca Gun Co. in 1931. Current production of model 37 &#8220;Homeland Security&#8221; is intended for civilian self-defense use, and also can be used as a police weapon. A more compact version was developed especially for police use and is known as Model 37 &#8220;Stakeout&#8221;. This gun features a shorter barrel and a pistol grip instead of more common butt. Model 37 was widely used by various police departments and security units in the USA, and still popular enough. Model 37 shotguns usually are equipped with simple bead sights and wooden furniture.\r\n\r\nType: manually operated, pump-action\r\nGauge: 12\r\nChamber: 76 mm (3 inch)\r\nLength: 1003 mm\r\nBarrel length: 470 mm (18 1/2 inch)\r\nWeight: 3.06 kg empty\r\nCapacity: 4 rounds in underbarrel tube magazine\r\n\r\n3.

Basic weapon was designed by TSNII TochMash (central Scientific Research Institute for Precision Machine Machine building, a key Soviet / Russian developer of special-purpose small arms) and produced in small batches at Tula Arms factory. It was adopted by Soviet Militia (Police) and other MVD troops by mid-1980s, along with a wide range of specialized ammunition. At the present time KS-23 is used by Russian law enforcement forces as anti-riot weapon. It also saw some use in certain ex-Soviet republics which are now independent states.

It has been developed in the late 1990s and incorporates the latest in firearms design. Nova tactical / Special Purpose shotgun is built to use most powerful 3 and 3 1/2 inch magnum shotshells yet to be reliable, light and comfortable to operate. The gun has a weather-resistant finish on all metallic parts, and the stock is already weather-resistant, Nova tactical is well suited as a carry / patrol gun for those who walks on their own feets. It also makes the Nova an excellent hunting gun with proper barrel installed.\r\n\r\nType: pump-action\r\n\r\nGauge: 12\r\n\r\nChamber: 3 1/2 inch (89 mm)\r\n\r\nLength: 1025 mm (with 470 mm barrel)\r\n\r\nBarrel length: 470 mm (18.5 inch) or 500 mm (20 inch)\r\n\r\nWeight: 3.05 kg empty, with 470mm barrel\r\n\r\nCapacity: 4 3-inch rounds in underbarrel tube magazine (6 3-inch rounds with extended magazine)\r\n\r\nSource:[url]http://gadgetophilia.com/10-best-pump-action-shotguns-in-2010/[/url]', ''),

(318995, ' United States\nMost security officers do not carry [URL="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weapon"]weapons[/URL] and have the same powers of arrest as a private [URL="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizen"]citizen[/URL], called a "private person" arrest, "any person" arrest, or "[URL="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizen%27s_arrest"]citizen''s arrest[/URL]."  If weapons are carried, additional permits and training are usually  required. Armed security personnel are generally used to protect  sensitive sites such as government and military installations, armored  money transports, casinos, banks (or other financial institutions),  nuclear power plants, etc. However, armed security is quickly becoming a  standard for vehicle patrol officers and on many other non-government  sites.\n\nCanada\nIn [URL="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada"]Canada[/URL],  private security falls under the jurisdiction of Canada''s ten provinces  and three territories. All ten of Canada''s provinces and one of its  territories (the Yukon) have legislation that regulates the contract  security industry. These eleven jurisdictions require that companies that provide security guard services and their employees be licensed.\n Most provinces in Canada regulate the use of handcuffs and weapons  (such as firearms and batons) by contract security companies and their  employees, either banning such use completely or permitting it only  under certain circumstances.\n Canada''s federal laws also restrict the ability of security guards to be armed. For example, section 17 of [I]Firearms Act[/I]  makes it an offence for any person, including a security guard, to  possess prohibited or restricted firearms (i.e. handguns) anywhere  outside of his or her home.\n There are two exceptions to this prohibition found in sections 18 and  19 of the Act. Section 18 deals with transportation of firearms while  Section 19 deals with allowing persons to carry such firearms on their  persons to protect their lives or the lives of other persons, or for the  performance of their occupation (Armour Car Guards, Licensed Trappers),  provided an Authorization to Carry (ATC) is first obtained.\n\n\nUK\nAs a requirement of the Private Security Industry Act 2001, the UK now requires all contract security guards to have a valid [URL="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_Industry_Authority"]Security Industry Authority[/URL] license.The licence must be displayed when on duty, although a dispensation may  be granted for store detectives, bodyguards and others who need to  operate without being identified as a security guard. This dispensation  is not available to Vehicle Immobilisers. Licenses are valid for three  years and require the holders to undergo formal training, and are also  to pass mandatory Criminal Records Bureau checks. Licences for Vehicle  Immobilisers are valid for one year. Armed guarding and guarding with a  weapon are illegal.\n\nIn [URL="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finland"]Finland[/URL], all contract security guards are required to have a valid license granted by [URL="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Police"]police[/URL].  Temporary license is valid for four months and normal license for five  years. License requires a minimum 40-hour course for temporary license  and 60 hours more for a normal license. Additionally a narrow security  vetting is required. The 40-hour course allows the carrying of a  fixed-length baton and handcuffs, separate training and license is  required for the security guard to carry [URL="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pepper_spray"]pepper spray[/URL],  extendable baton or a firearm. Rehearse of weapons usage is mandatory  every year and is regulated by the Ministry of The Interior, to ensure  the safe handling of pepper spray and such.\n  [B]\n[/B]Israel\nIn [URL="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel"]Israel[/URL],  almost all security guards carry a firearm, primarily to prevent terror  attacks.

Many locations with a high number of  visitors, such as the [URL="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Jerusalem_Bus_Station&action=edit&redlink=1"]Jerusalem Bus Station[/URL],  employ X-ray machines to check passenger''s bags; in other places, they  are opened and visually inspected.

(319061, ' AoA Everybody\r\n\r\nIts a very good topic and we need to understand a few things about shotguns before we can comment on their usefulness in securing a bank or any such facility where innocent bystanders is a big variable.\r\n\r\nFirst of all, shotguns do not have a cone of death. Its pellets do not fly away from their intended path like a guided missile and hit an innocent bystander. Under normal conditions and under typical bank/room type distances (upto 10 yards), shotgun patterns are no bigger than a melon/football and they only hit where they are aimed. yes, i''m talking careful aiming. However, since the pattern is almost the size of a football, it increases the hit probability and increases the chances of wounding a vital organ which eventually results in ending the assault.\r\n\r\nUnlike pistol and rifles, shotguns do not suffer from over penetration therefore in a court of law, you do not magically transform from a good guy into a bad guy (trigger happy, gun slinging maniac).\r\n\r\nand finally, why pump actions? well, they are reliable as hell and do not need much maintenance therefore are always preferred over autoloaders. under ideal situations an autoloader might be equally reliable but when we factor in total lack of periodical maintenance, lubrication, cleaning and upkeep, pump actions being simple mechanisms win by a huge margin.\r\n\r\nas far as conceal carry under such conditions (bank setting) is concerned, ever wonder (in nature) how an animal that has the ability to defend its self proudly displays that ability to defend. think for a second, a snake displays its fangs, make a weird noise when moving, some snakes rattle (ratting snake), some animals display long nails on their bodies, some animals flash warning colors, ever wonder why?\r\n\r\nbecause open display carry deters assailants. lets do a mathematical test here. lets say on any given day you are  being followed by 100 perspective assailants. out of those 100, 95 will immediately back off when they see that you are in a position to fight back and only remaining 5 will consider attacking you.\r\n\r\nwhereas if you are conceal carrying your weapon, 100 out of 100 will be in a position to attack and since you being a normal guy (not a guy who always has his one finger on the trigger and keeps his one eye closed all the time just to get a quick sight picture if the need ever arises) cannot be ready all the time. \r\n\r\nhere the interesting question is, would you rather have 100 fights and see which 5 fights you lose or you would rather avoid 95 fights (previous example) and lose in the remaining 5? ITS A SIMPLE PROBABILITY GAME GENTLEMEN :)\r\n\r\nRegards.', ''),

So TNT is out.\r\n\r\nI spoke to Emirates Airlines earlier today and after putting me on hold to speak to their "Special Handling Group", I was informed by customer service that airguns are not allowed. PIA on the other hand has been saying that they don''t even need to be informed in advance...just bring it along and drop it into your luggage. It makes sense because I spoke to my khepia today and he informed that he was ACTUALLY OFFLOADED FROM THE AIRPLANE after checking his luggage in and taking his seat in the airplane. He was travelling via Emirates who made him then sit in some waiting lounge for 4 hours, after which they returned some of his luggage and told him to return the airgun to my cousin and take whichever flight he''d like to take next. \r\n\r\nIt doesn''t make sense to me that they would allow him to walk through initial screening and then prevent him at this late stage but thats what he says happened.

(319500, ' [QUOTE=HasanJamshad;163890]As brother Denovo said it is a different way of narrating the fact that Accuracy of a certain barrel will last for 3000 rounds. "A Rose is a Rose" there is no need to be alarmed. \nThanks for sharing.[/QUOTE]\n Absolutely. It is the accuracy life of the barrel which is considered. A barrel is considered finished once it loses accuracy, other wise it can continue to shoot  indefinitely but in  ever enlarging groups.\nIn high velocity magnum rifles the throat of the barrel(the barrel just ahead of the chamber )   is the first to suffer as it is eroded due to large quantities of propellants  forced through it. Once it is elongated the bullet has a relatively longer distance to jump before getting lodged into the rifling and more often than not it yaws and this in bore yaw starts deterioration of accuracy.\nAnother problem that occurs in all High velocity rifles is the acumilation  of a mixture of propellant and lead/copper in the barrel in an area where the Peak Pressure occurs about 10 inches or so ahead of the breach, this swages the bullet as it passes through this constriction in the barrel deteriorating the accuracy. This can be cleaned but with a lot of effort, phosphor bronze brushes and good copper solvents.\nA properly cleaned barrel will help increase the life (accurate Life ) of a rifle.', ''),

(319504, 'Review: Tomahawk Compact Cruiser Salams! \r\n\r\nDiscussing with [B]12G bro[/B] over the phone few days back, we were both of the opinion that though the site did have full fledged reviews on autoloaders and hunting shotguns, we were missing, indeed, some reviews on tactical security model shotguns, etc, inclusive of pump-action types.\r\n\r\nWe intend to pursue this sector more intensively over the coming months or so, yet 12G bro insisted on, and suggested me to do, a full fledged review of my own pump-action security model first, the [B]Tomahawk Compact Cruiser SAC 2500[/B], since it was lying idle ever since purchase. \r\n\r\nA full fledged review is planned for the weekend, so I thought in an appetizing [I]pre-taste[/I], I should share some more details with you of this beautiful little wonder, before I pattern test it from some [B]50ft CQB[/B] firing on Sunday, along with some fun shooting. Stay tuned, therefore, it’s the shortest shotgun on the site, let’s see what it comes up with in the field, in terms of hitting accuracy. In the reliability sector, it already stands out a winner with some [B]80 shots[/B] so far, [B]nil[/B] issues.\r\n\r\nThe brief facts are as follows:\r\n\r\n[B]GAUGE	12[/B]\r\nCHAMBER	3"(76 mm)\r\n[B]MAGAZINE[/B] [B]CAPACITY[/B]	[B]4+1[/B]\r\n[B][B][B]BARREL[/B][/B][/B] LENGTH: [B]14"[/B](35cm)\r\nSAFETY	MANUAL\r\nSTOCK	SYNTHETIC PISTOL GRIP\r\n[B]WEIGHT	1950gr[/B]\r\nOPERATION SYSTEM	PUMP\r\n[B]OVERALL LENGTH	22"(61cm)[/B]\r\nPACKING	CARTOON BOX\r\n\r\nAs you can see, measuring barely [B]61 cms[/B] (24 inches) from top to toe and pistol grip to muzzle end, it''s one really handy and compact item, with a barrel of less than [B]14[/B] inches.\r\n\r\nWeight also standing at[I] below[/I] [B]2 KG''s.[/B]\r\n\r\nFiring it is one loud affair, as compared to traditional, longer barreled shotguns. Also, it requires a bit of control and handling, but not more, than what cannot be learnt in a session or two.\r\n\r\nCapacity of [B]4+1[/B] shells is still unique in my opinion, bearing in mind that tube is shorter, course, than the 14" barrel!\r\n\r\nAlso, it''s one very nice, easy, light and comfortable carry, especially in the car, very maneuverable, indeed, when you get in and out of your vehicle, no [I]getting in the way[/I], anywhere, with this.\r\n\r\nAt night, and during disturbing frequent checks here in Wah, I simply place it on my lap and cover it up with my shirt, no need to stop by every check to explain what you''re moving around with, it''s simply not visible at all, from any angle, whatsoever. \r\n\r\nAlso, I enjoy carrying it myself, it''s so compact that one doesn''t look[I] bad[/I] moving around with it, no need to have a guard around for it, it''s more of a "[I]personal[/I]" weapon, not the types that would look better in the hands of an accompanying guard. There''s a "[I]style[/I]" and "[I]statement[/I]" about it, and I can''t remember any day with this out in the blue, that it didn''t turn quite a number of heads around, lols!\r\n\r\nI must say, after[B] 80[/B] flawless shots so far, I am pretty satisfied to see, that there''s absolutely no "rattling" sound or anything loose, from anywhere in the gun. I mean, I''ve been firing mostly [B]36 grs[/B] loads and the "bulldog" is quite "petite", yet it''s small receiver seems robust enough to have taken the bashing of the relatively heavy 36 grs loads, [I]splendidly[/I]. In comparison, let me tell you, POF standard ammo, SG, LG, etc, is some 30-32 grs loaded.\r\n\r\nWith a shotgun like this along, and a handgun beneath the jacket, rest assured, you''re well loaded, for any kind of[I] rendezvous[/I]/conflict/issues. It has a "charisma" and "radiation" of danger for itself and I''ve fired it almost as fast that I could fire a semi-auto! \r\n\r\nClosest competitor, [I]in terms of size only[/I], is the [B]Mossberg 5901A Compact Cruiser[/B], which is literally non-available and stands at above [B]100-120K[/B] if available NIB.\r\n\r\nThat was also my source of inspiration, but I found it nowhere, and when looking around for a semi-auto last year in Lahore, I came across this "[I]love at first glance[/I]" and just couldn''t let her go.

(319512, ' Cleaning Rusty Barrels\nFirst of all if a barrel gets rust inside, permanent damage has been caused.\nRust is a compound formed between steel, and oxygen in the presence of moisture, once we remove rust we are removing a bit of the metal and pitting will be the result. Pitting will keep on increasing with firing due to the errosive action of propellant gases.\nPolishing a rifled barrel with compounds can shine and smoothen out the pitting and if the damage is minor the barrel will not be damaged, but if it is  visible it is significant.\nUsing a Drill machine can be dangerous in untrained hands, the barrel must be a shotgun only, any Rifle or Pistol barrel will be ruined with the use of a drill machine to polish. The shot gun barrel must be secured in a heavy vise and leather gloves be used, ensure the machine is started after inserting the rod into the barrel and that it is not pushed out or pulled out with the machine running.\nRifle barrels must be cleaned with rods having a bearing in the handle so that these move along with the rifling polishing both lands and grooves rather than damaging the lands.\nProper solvents are available and these clean the bores efficiently with chemical and  very mild abrasive action. Diesel is a solvent like kerosine and both help remove rust but also cause rust if the metal is not cleaned and then an oily patch not applied to the metal surface.', ''),

If it is in Karachi then it automatically filters out 95 % of the people who can''t make it. \n\nIslamabad just had a great gtg and two weeks ago there was another one in Abbottabad. \n\nI think late January will be good as the National Games are in December.

I think we can do it late Jan or early feb.\n\n@Vik Lol, I am sick of Lal Qila myself but the location is unbeatable. Karachi is huge and a central gathering place is essential. Last time the beach location and organization was fantastic but just due to the distance factor more than 65 % of the people dropped out. Look around for high quality places in the vicinity of Lal Qila. If the food is good we can consider it.  I personally like Arena very much, the bowling activity after dinner is also a good group activity. For selected members if possible we will also consider taking them to Karsaz for shooting.', ''),

Animals that are most active during the day should only be hunted during daylight hours. Some people use high intensity torches to temporarily stun game animals. this is unethical. this is not hunting. at best it is poaching.\r\n\r\nThe difference between a hunter a poacher is, a hunter respects the game and plays it fair and square as he/she is not a meat collector but only a sportsman, a poacher on the other hand is only interested in collecting meat (i.e., the size of the bag) and is willing to go to any length (even unethical) just to ensure a bigger bag.\r\n\r\nRegards.', ''),

(319952, ' My opinion on one hand shooting...\n\nIf you carry a gun for defense, or have a pistol at the house to protect your family you MUST be able to accurately engage a target one handed both strong side and weak side.  You never know when you''re going to get dinged up in either arm.  I make it a point when I train to spend a lot of time shooting one handed left and right.  You will notice it''s difficult at first but with time it gets better.  I noticed with my weak hand my trigger pull was pretty sloppy.  I worked on it and now can hold the black(bullseye) with either hand out to 15 meters.    It takes time but if you don''t anticipate the shot and pull your trigger correctly in time you will become very accurate shooting one handed.\n\nThe good thing with practicing this is it makes your two handed shooting that much better.', ''),

(319958, ' [QUOTE=sgthoskins;164215]How much does the pack weigh when it''s loaded up with everything?  \n\nI don''t see any food, are you going to live off the land completely?   I''ve hunted all my life and have been for the most part pretty  successful, however there are times when I don''t see anything.  You may  want to consider throwing in a few MRE main meals for emergency  substance if you run in to a dry spell with harvesting animals.\n\nA few suggestions.\n\nI would also add a secondary fire starter, I usually pack three different fire starters, I''m crazy like that.\nI don''t see a tarp or cover for sun or rain.  If the temp gets in the upper 30''s F and rains you will get hypothermia pretty quickly.  If the temp gets to over 100 in the day and you are waiting to move during the moon light shade is pretty important as well so slow down dehydration. \nAs I mentioned above I would add a food supplement to the pack just in case you are having a difficult time harvesting animals for food.[/QUOTE]\n \n\n\n\n\nFirstly, I shall thank you for being considerate enough to give your valuable suggestions.\nSecondly, let me break it down for you.\nI have hunted all my life and not on a single trip have I left home  without MRE. Back then we used to carry dried meat, beans and lentils  with spices. We still carry that along with canned food for emergency.  Remember the Golden Beautiful Rule of Allah....when you are faced with  hunger and dire necessity you CAN eat whatever you want and it is HALAL for you to do so! That is exactly how Professional Outdoormen and Commandos survive out in the wild.\n\nWe are equally crazy when it comes to fire! The fire starter you see in the pics is ONE of the THREE I carry alongwith a dozen wax treated waterproof matchboxes as they are best for lighting a fire. I posted a pic of only one as I thought it would be adequate but I forgot hardcore outdoormen would point it out like yourself.\n\nYou dont see any cover,blinds,apparel, tent or weapons because I havent posted pics of them as yet and which I will soon upload. I did however upload a pic of one of my Waterproof Emergency Breathable Fleece Blanket which stays in this bag. All my remaining equipment (4 Berth Coleman Tent, Sleeping Bags, Camp Blinds, 2P Inflatable Raft, Gas Cylinder, Cooking Utencils,20G Water Can, Fuel etc) stay in my 4x4 till needed.\n\nAs every terrain is different, so your kit should match your requirements. You CANNOT carry all you might need! Thats the rule I follow and pack my bags accordingly as I am not the strongest man on earth to carry all I have. \n\nI very much appreciate the time consuming task you undertook in order to write and suggest me what you thought was best and my dear You were spot on!\n\nI do recommend for you this outdoor manual as its one of the best and has given me tons of knowledge. \n\nKind Regards\n\n[IMG]http://i1200.photobucket.com/albums/bb340/Almuharib/Ultimate%20Survival%20Kit/SASSurvivalHandbook.jpg[/IMG]', ''),

I agree with you though that if a brand new still-packed airgun is available in Karachi at Pkr 55,000....thats reasonable considering all the costs, time and stress involved in buying it from abroad. I suspect if you go to the store here in Karachi, they''ll probably ask for much more than Pkr 55,000 and say, "aaj kal ki mengai..." I mean they''re asking PKR 25,000 those Gamo Shadow 1000s which, last time I checked, sold for Aed 750 in Dubai (Pkr 17,625)...that makes the asking price more than 40% above the price in Dubai. Last I checked on this forum from others, the best price currently available here is Pkr 23,500 which still makes it 33% above the Dubai price. Daad firearms on Zamzama is trying to sell Gamo Match pellets for Pkr 600+...and you can get these in Dubai for less than Pkr 300. It kinda makes you not want to give business to these guys when you can help it.....lets hope this import is successful so we can all have the option to skip the local market when they start making their rates unreasonable.', ''),

I guess by effective range I mean the maximum distance at which one could reasonably expect to take down a small creature, i.e. a bird/crow. I was corresponding with the guys who run StraightShooters.com and they were saying that 70m is the limit, although some claim 100m....that sounds quite unbelievable. Of course, the choice of pellets makes a big difference, but for the purpose of this question I am assuming that one would be using pellets that have been proven to work, i.e Crosman Premiers, JSB Exact, etc So far we''ve got one fellow member here who says he''s been able to drain a coconut at 50m.....thats quite impressive. I''m inclined to believe the 70m is quite possible then since a coconut is far tougher than a bird. \r\n\r\nFeedback from people who have the gun would be great. I''ve been able to get within 100m of ducks, pheasants, and other game birds....but less than 70m and you start to lose your chances of being able to take a shot without your target flying off.

For that if you are going to carry CCW as your only carry gun than i will suggest baikal mak 12 shot.\n\nEvery cartridge was initially  developed for a certain weapon in mind. So depending upon the barrel length and size of the weapon, the ballistics of the cartridge were configured. Wanted to say whether the catridge is designed to be used with SMG, STANDARD 4.5 to 5 inches barrel length handguns or sub-compact 2 to 3 inches barrel length handguns. So the ballistics are also configured so as the cartridge should exhibit good internal and external ballistics in that particular gun. Bottom line is each cartridge is developed for a particular role and hence provide you top results in that role only.\n\nPowerful cartridge can be fired from small handgun but effective recoil and blast shyness control has to be achieved with it, which by itself is a difficult task.

(320238, ' Sir,\n\nI posted this link because i felt it would be of interest to members of this forum.  I am not an organizer and merely a competitor.  I will try my best to answer your questions, but you may be able to get a better picture from Mr. Salim Khan who is handling this event on behalf of the Safari and outdoor club.   \n\n1.  The difference is in your skill level and level of experience.  If you feel you have a higher skill and experience then you would enter in the Pro category, if you are new to shooting or are still developing your skill set then you would enter in the amateur category.  It is up to you to decide where you fit and of course i trust most people would not claim to have lower skills and experience in order to get a better result in a category with the amateurs.  \n\n2.  The Entry fees is as it is in all competitions the fee you pay to compete.  However room and bard are provided by the Safari and Outdoor club for those who require it.  \n\n3.  In the last competition there were 4 stations with 6 clays being attempted at each so that would be a total of 24 clays you are allowed 2 shots per clay with 1 point for a hit with your first shot and .5 point with a hit on your second shot.  so your cartridge consumption would be between 24 and 48 for the competition.  I am not sure about the team event this time, but last time each team of 2 people got had to score from 4 clays being simultaneously launched at them 4 times so a total of 16 clays and one point per clay.  I am not sure how they well do the .22 competition as this is a new event.  \n\n4. Tie breaker last time was sudden death for example if there is a three way tie they shoot one at a time and if they miss they are eliminated and the remaining continue untill only one is left.  \n\n5.  In the last competition (The Ghulam Mujtaba Jatoi Trophy) the prize money was as follows\n\nPrize Money:\n\n. Pro Category:\n\n* 1st Place--- Rs. 1,00,000/-\n* 2nd Place-- Rs. 25,000/-\n* 3rd Place-- Rs. 10,000/-\n\n2. Amateur Category:\n\n* 1st Place-- Rs. 50,000/-\n* 2nd Place-- Rs. 25,000/-\n* 3rd Place-- Rs. 10,000/-\n\n3. Senior Category:\n\nall places--trophy and certificates\n\n4.

Current flyway management systems rely on information from local hunters, erratic wildlife surveys and raw estimates. \r\n\r\nDuse to 46% reduction in the lake (survey 2008) the birds are visiting in less numbers now. Wildlife experts have stated the numbers of seasonal birds transmigrating to Punjab had decreased by at least 70 per cent over the past few years. \r\nThey warn that excessive tree cutting, pollution and major construction projects make the bird sanctuaries unsuitable\r\n\r\nKey wetland sites include Mangla Lake, Rawal Lake in Margalla Hills National Park, Zangi Nawar Lake, the high mountain wetlands in northern Pakistan including the Naltar wetland complex and the wetlands of Deosai National Park plains. \r\nThere have been several reports of Black Storks, cranes and flocks of vulnerable Marbled Teal.\r\n\r\nWorld Wide Fund for Nature reported that Pakistan&#8217;s wetlands and their rich biological resources are threatened by over-exploitation, habitat destruction and polluted environments. The main causes for wetland degradation are ineffective management, poor stakeholder participation and lack of coordination for management strategies.\r\n\r\n[B][U]MAJOR INTERNATIONAL MIGRATION FLYWAYS [/U][/B]\r\nMigration periods may vary depending upon weather conditions in Siberia and or Pakistan. There are a total of seven identified flyways in the world: \r\n\r\n1.	Northern Europe to Scandinavian countries, \r\n2.	Central Europe to Mediterranean Sea, \r\n3.	Western Siberia to Red Sea, \r\n4.	Green Route from Siberia to Pakistan, \r\n5.	Ganga Flyway from Eastern Siberia to India, \r\n6.	Manchuria to Korea,\r\n7.	Chakotaka to California. \r\nBesides these there are many regional and smaller routs all over the world. \r\n\r\n\r\n[B][U]INDUS FLYWAY  (Green Route ) Known as FLYWAY-4[/U][/B]\r\nThis famous route from Siberia to various destinations in Pakistan over Karakorum, Hindu Kush, and Suleiman Ranges along Indus River down to the delta is known as International Migratory Bird Route Number 4. \r\nIt is also called as the Green Route or more commonly Indus Flyway.\r\n\r\nThe Indus Flyway is important due to the diverse species and large number of birds that take this itinerary: different species of water fowls, cranes, teals, pintail, mallard and gadwall, the list goes on. Some extinguishing species like white-headed duck, Houbara bustard and Siberian crane also travel on this route.\r\nThe birds start on Flyway-4 route in November (some species also vmigrating in start of October). February is the peak time and by March they start flying back home.\r\n\r\nRegards.', ''),

(320622, ' Shah sahib, interesting discussion and Mian-50 has provided some very useful information. I have been through the phase, in which you are currently. I fell in love with skeet and tried to cut cost in the following way:\r\n\r\n1- Acquire a good gun. Don''t think about saving on this, a better gun will prove cheap in long run. A gun can be get imported through a dealer by paying all costs in advance and a fixed profit for the handling. Landed cost of the gun will be 10-15% more than its retail in US or European market. I have got imported a rifle in this way.\r\n\r\n2- For a biggner there is no need to blow ammo and pigeons of worth Rs. 5K every day. First spend more time in dry practice.\r\n a- Perfect your stance and mount, to the level where everything becomes automatic, every time at the same place, effort-lesslyand comfortably.\r\n b- Learn to swing your gun. There are drills you may draw lines on walls and perfect this thing.\r\n c- Understand station management, placement of feet, hold point/ break point/lead/follow through.\r\n d- Untill above are not mastered just one box a day will be enough to get real feel of live game and trigger/recoil management.\r\n\r\n3- Now getting clay pigeons cheap. I contacted Laporte(France)/CCI(Eng)/Chinese supplier. Landed cost for ordering a container (120K pieces)was worked out Rs4.5/piece (Chi), Rs 6.75/Piece CCI(eng), Rs 8/Piece Laporte(france). One may save more than 50% on this by ordering for some buddies and deviding the cost.\r\n\r\n4- Ammo from Wah can be acquired at factory rate. This will reduce cost of ammo by 15-20%.\r\n\r\nAfter doing this all cost can be reduced but it still will not be cheap to shoot skeet. Costs really increase while your skill increases and you really need to practice more and more not dry but live, to remain in form and to be better than the other players. In the end it is not just the money that will make a player to score 25/25 but a lot of hard work/skill/talent and the mental strenth/love for the sport of the player. Yes a good player will be in better position if have a big buck or a sponsor. \r\n\r\nRegards:', ''),

In addition bought a tesco 3-9x40 scope for 1900, the piece was brand new, put in display so no box, and 1 lens cover was missing but i still bagged the deal, bought mounts for Rs 850 and will put them on after firing 250-300 pellets thru my Sargodha made paragon airgun...[/QUOTE]\r\n \r\nSalaam,\r\n\r\nI found the Gamo Match pellets to have better accuracy than the H&N Wadcutters or the Gamo Crow Magnums. And the Iranian and Afghani pellets were just hopeless..... but this is for my two airguns. I haven''t used the Diana pointed pellets yet....I''d love to get a few boxes from the same place you went to....I think I''ll stop by some time this week.\r\n\r\nAlso, please do give your feedback on the scope and its ability to withstand recoil and hold the zero. Regarding the mounts....what type were they? Two rings or one piece or some other variety? \r\n\r\nYou got some good deals....let us know how it turns out, show some pics of your groups.', ''),
(320790, 'Do it yourself Night Vision - hunting at night Salaam Everybody,\r\n\r\nI''ve been looking into setting up a home-made night vision kit. I am starting this thread to we can share some info and experiences on this subject. What I''ve gotten so far is that one needs to get an infra red light, preferably a powerful one that can provide a field of view as well as distance. The other thing thats needed is a camera that either has the infrared filter removed or has some night vision feature. The Sony Night Shot series have this feature and can be purchased used on eBay or probably in the electronics market in Karachi for relatively cheap, i.e. less than Pkr 10,000. Then one needs to get a lens adapter to fit the camera to the scope...the other option is to do it crudely with lots of tape. You turn the IR flashlight on in the dark and turn your Sony Camera on and look at the screen rather than into the scope. This configuration should provide decent visibility at night up to 20-30 meters. I saw several videos on youtube on people using this technique for which they''ve provided videos of their results and they''re pretty good.\r\n\r\n[url]http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mVRvTgdkC-A[/url]\r\n\r\n[url]http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9mwGeDAxhk[/url]\r\n\r\n[url]http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4LB-wxLbj8[/url]\r\n\r\nAnother option is to buy an even older video camera from the early 90s or even the 80s and take it apart as shown in the videos above. Some of the disadvantages I can foresee with this set up as compared to the video cam screen set up is eye relief and recoil......I don''t think that video camera lens provides the kind of eye relief that a scope does, you need to actually stick your eye onto the lens to be able to see where its pointing. The video cam screen set up allows you the eye relief you need to be able to handle recoil. My rifle for which I am thinking of trying this set up is a Diana 54 Airking which has that rail system that makes the scope jerk back and forth. This would mean that if I had to stick my eye right onto the scope, I would hurt myself whereas the proper eye relief would the only way to avoid injury. The video cam screen and the cam itself would probably recoil, but luckily I dont think zero is affected by a loose camera-scope connection.  \r\n\r\nYet another option is to buy a Night Vision Monocular with an adapter to fit it to your scope. I''ve seen Yukon, ATN and other brands available for as little as US$ 80 on eBay. Buy the IR flashlight and the adapter and it may cost another US$ 80 and you''ve got a ready to go night vision kit that you can take off and add to almost any rifle you''ve got scoped as long as your adapter fits the lens. US$ 160 means that for less than PKR 15,000, you can potentially hunt very effectively at short-medium ranges at night. \r\n\r\nI haven''t tried any of the above yet since I just got the idea in the last few days. I am thinking that most creatures that one would like to hunt are far less attentive at night, as long as one can find them. If you can locate them, you can see them well enough at night to shoot them and I am assuming they wouldn''t see you coming if you were quiet and downwind. I know many people use very powerful torches to stun the creatures and take their shot with a shotgun...but this is another way to hunt at night, hopefully with more precision. I am a total novice on the subject so I would love to hear what the more experienced people here have to say', ''),

(320809, ' [QUOTE=12GAUGE;164589]AoA Spartacus\r\n\r\nBro, the idea of making your own night vision hunting equipment is pretty awesome and is definitely worth pursuing therefore I would say by all means go for it. \r\n\r\nHowever I must insist that hunting at night, other than for creatures that are mostly active during nighttime such as hares and hogs, is considered unethical in professional hunting circles. Animals that are most active during the day should only be hunted during daylight hours. Some people use high intensity torches to temporarily stun game animals. this is unethical. this is not hunting. at best it is poaching.\r\n\r\nThe difference between a hunter a poacher is, a hunter respects the game and plays it fair and square as he/she is not a meat collector but only a sportsman, a poacher on the other hand is only interested in collecting meat (i.e., the size of the bag) and is willing to go to any length (even unethical) just to ensure a bigger bag.\r\n\r\nRegards.[/QUOTE]\r\n \r\n+1\r\n\r\nWell said 12 Gauge bro they are not hunters but just destroyers of WildLife.', ''),

As promised since days, the Tomahawk was finally put to a test for it&#8217;s [B]SD capabilities[/B] today, when [B]12G[/B] bro graciously honored myself and [B]Drag80[/B] bro with some wonderful few hours of gup shup, some [I]flow n'' transfer[/I] of knowledge, and course, some big time shooting with some great gunz n'' ammo. :)\n\n12G bro unexpectedly phoned me up right when I was leaving along with Drag80 bro for the site of the review, so we postponed our departure for the village by an hour or so to benefit from the ever great, inspiring and [I]tutorial[/I] company of 12G bro, whose presence made our day and course, any 12G hardware, just doesn&#8217;t deserve being fired off without his commanding appearance as well, coz this is his domain, these are his toys! Thanks 12G bro for all the great &#8216;talk-shawk&#8221;, I regret you had to leave this early, and thanks a lot Drag80 bro for honoring me greatly with your few hours over here, one pleasure to have you around. :)\n\nGuys, the company was spread over firing of different toys today, inclusive of Drag80  bro&#8217;s .357 Magnum revolver, his PT92fs handgun and, of course, 12G bro&#8217;s ever ready &#8220;[I]combat machine[/I]&#8221; the CZ-999 Scorpion! Lols! \n\nThe absolute winner of the day was surprisingly the small wonder of an SD [B]hellfire beast[/B], the Tomahawk [B]4+1[/B] Pump Action Shotgun. To put it in the briefest of[I] descriptions[/I], let me say, it&#8217;s indeed a &#8220;[I]Tomahawk[/I]&#8221;, by the most literal meaning of the word itself.\n\nReliability was a pre-established feature, coz I had already fired some [B]80 [/B]flawless shots from this gun since purchase, so this wasn&#8217;t the focus of today&#8217;s review, more it was the [I]hitting capability[/I], [I]handling[/I] and shot [I]spread-pattern[/I] that had to be evaluated/established, by shooting  from the short barrel of 14&#8221; only, of this ultra-compact model. \n\n[B]SD[/B] ammo used for today&#8217;s review was:\n\n1)	[B]S&B SSSG[/B] ( US Buckshot 4), 20 pellets of some 6.1mm each.\n2)	[B]B.B Cyprus[/B], 35-40 pellets.\n3)	[B]SG[/B] (POF).\n\n[B]Shooting distance[/B] :\n [B]50ft[/B], constant.\n\n[B]Spread pattern [/B]was amazingly [I]controlled[/I] for shots from a [B]14&#8221;[/B] barrel only and from [B]50 ft[/B] distance, in my opinion, a relatively [I]long[/I] [B]SD[/B] distance. So check plz below pics, bearing in mind, it&#8217;s [B]14&#8221; barrel[/B], distance [B]50 ft[/B], [B]and[/B], pellets [I]count[/I] in shells [B]low[/B], 40 and 20 pellets, respectively only, in the B.B and SSSG shells, still, these pics should say something:\n\n[B]BB [/B]shot, [B]50 ft[/B]:\n\n[IMG]http://i1136.photobucket.com/albums/n497/wahstar1/PG%20upload/Shooting014.jpg[/IMG]\n\n[B]US 4 buckshot[/B] ( SSSG), [B]50 ft[/B]:\n[IMG]http://i1136.photobucket.com/albums/n497/wahstar1/PG%20upload/Shooting013Small.jpg[/IMG]\n\n[B]Note[/B]:\n\n[I][B]Though it may be hard for you to judge the [B]size[/B] of the total area of hits, let me assure you, both above shots were within a circle of 12-14 inches, hence from shorter ranges, like in traditional SD situations, within banks, etc, say some 20-25 ft, I''m pretty sure even this 14" barrel will not produce a larger hit size than that of a football, leave alone what traditional security shotguns of barrels 18" and above would  come up to, if you remember another interesting thread on use of security shotguns within closed area, banks, etc[/B].[/I]\n\n\nTarget charts were few and weapons many, so the pattern spread from SG shells could not be photographed singularly, yet we found the pattern spread to be reasonably controlled, bearing in mind, still, it''s only [B]8[/B] pellets being shot from ultra short barrel and 50 ft distance. Thumbs up to the Tomahawk in this regard, excellent!\n\n[I][B]Handling/control[/B][/I]:\n\nContrary to my initial belief, that this sort of weapon should be fired from hip position, it appeared that the best stance in which to shoot out the beast is simply in straight aiming position as with traditional butt-stocked shotguns! This without any buttstock, lols!\n\nThanks to 12G who taught me this feat today, it requires a bit of handling, but I found it pretty manageable, still. The vids below were in total [I]speed-fire[/I] mode and should [B]not[/B] be compared to [I]normal[/I] handling of the gun, which is pretty fine, though does require a bit of getting used to due to greater recoil than full sized shotguns and absence of any shoulder support. As you can see, in speed-fire mode, I kind of slipped my racking hand at shot No.3. 12G bro managed it with splendor, however. Also do check the [I]fireball[/I] from the barrel end, lols!\n\n[B]Conclusion[/B]: \n\n1)The gun has proved highly reliable to me with [B]nil issues [/B]in [B]+100 shots[/B]. \n\n2)The gun is robustly made for it''s size, taking the bashing quite solidly, despite of the fact that only higher 36grs loads, etc, have been fired from it.\n\n3) Deadly up to the range of 50 ft, and [B]highly deadly[/B] at below 50ft! Shot pattern[I] controlled[/I], uniform.\n\n4) [B]Maneuverable size[/B], light weight, [B]easy CC[/B], easy carry.\n\n5) Purely SD item.\n\n6) [B]Value for money[/B].\n\n7) An item for the guy who seeks a reliable, powerful, effective blast from a still quite concealable and easy carry item, not having to employ a guard. In today''s world, an essential [I]front-seat passenger[/I], along with a potent back-up handgun. You just can''t go wrong then, this thing is quite fast and easy [I]out into action[/I]!\n\nI''ll leave the rest for 12G bro to comment on. Adding video links, below.

On a short venture yesterday, I had the pleasant opportunity to check out following two NIB guns, both in the happy ownership of fellow brother Drag80 Sb:\n\n1)	[B]Taurus 608 .357 Magnum[/B] revolver, full sized 8 shots model, [B]NIB[/B], [I]non-ported barrel[/I].\n\n2)	[B]Taurus PT 92fs, SS NIB[/B].\n\nThe shooting was not part of full scaled reviews of both guns, but merely a &#8220;cherry popping&#8221; venture for the pleasure of Drag80 bro, who also had some doubts on the 608 cylinder alignment, as you all know, which needed to be cleared out once and for all.\n\nTherefore, I decided to post the experience of both guns in a combined thread, with following brief observations, leaving room for further comments by the owner himself:\n\n[B]Taurus 608[/B]:\n\n1)	The Taurus 608 was not faulty in any aspect as suspected by Drag80 bro, there were no indications of cylindrical &#8220;misalignment&#8221; at all, it performed fully up to the marks in terms of technical performance, and was a pleasure indeed to shoot out for the first time.\n\n2)	[I]If properly zeroed in with it&#8217;s adjustable sights, one very fine and [B]accurate[/B] handgun, with a remarkably [B]low[/B] [I]recoil[/I] and good, manageable [I]control[/I][/I].\n\n3)	Excellent sharp sights.\n\n4)	Beautiful finish and appearance\n\n5)	A [I]reasonably[/I] tight [B]DA[/B] pull.\n\nSome 50 shots were fired from this monster, [B]50 ft[/B] distance, using [B]Winchester[/B] and[B] Prvi Partizan 158 grains[/B] ammo. Missing the adequate shooting expertise, we did not manage "zeroing-in" of the gun, which requires a specialist&#8217;s hands and insight, yet the last pic below shows that the gun was shooting to the lower left quadrant of the target, for the experts to comment on.\n\nSome [B]Eye Candy[/B] first:\n\n\n[IMG]http://i1136.photobucket.com/albums/n497/wahstar1/PG%20upload/Shooting001Medium.jpg[/IMG]\n[IMG]http://i1136.photobucket.com/albums/n497/wahstar1/PG%20upload/Shooting006Small.jpg[/IMG]\n[IMG]http://i1136.photobucket.com/albums/n497/wahstar1/PG%20upload/Shooting007Medium.jpg[/IMG]\n[IMG]http://i1136.photobucket.com/albums/n497/wahstar1/PG%20upload/Shooting009Medium.jpg[/IMG]\n[IMG]http://i1136.photobucket.com/albums/n497/wahstar1/PG%20upload/Shooting008Medium.jpg[/IMG]\n[IMG]http://i1136.photobucket.com/albums/n497/wahstar1/PG%20upload/Shooting010Small.jpg[/IMG]\n\n[B]The Target[/B]:\n[IMG]http://i1136.photobucket.com/albums/n497/wahstar1/PG%20upload/Shooting018Medium.jpg[/IMG]\n\n[B][I]My impressions[/I][/B]:\n\n1) This is a unique item for a collectors assortment, target shooting, and as a powerful [B]HD[/B] weapon, useful for some fun hunting as well.\n\n2) I find the caliber [I]cumbersome[/I] and [I]inappropriate[/I] for [B]SD[/B] purposes, in terms of slow follow-up shots and reduced [I]control[/I] due to the DA mode. IMHO, a revolver may be the most reliable, but unsuitable weapon for SD purposes. In real life situations, there''s no time for pulling back the trigger for perfect SA shots, nor is it quite easy to play "[I]Dirty Harry[/I]" at all!\n\n3) In SA mode during target firing, it''s excellently controlled, however.\n\n4) Overall, in terms of make, finish, reliability, [I]technical functioning[/I], one adorable item for the show case back home.\n\n5) In open area, like in the below vid link, cotton buds make adequate sound suppression, a "Denovo87 secret", so thanks Den for the kind advise! Otherwise, never fire this handgun without some proper ear-muffling.\n\nIncluding a fun vid of my first ever .357 Mag fires, and leaving the rest of uploads/impressions/reviewing to [B]Drag80[/B] bro.

Firing above is an "out of the box" shooting experience, [B]by a member who fired a handgun for the first time ever[/B]!! This should be enough and speak volumes on the matchless performance of the Taurus PT92/99 models of handguns.\n\nI personally, however, due to smaller hands, do not find the grip suitable for myself, with a tendency to shoot pretty low. It''s my impression that whilst a thick grip, as in the Stoeger, gives reduced control during rapid fires, the "wider" grip of the 92fs, in smaller hands, tend to put the muzzle end [I]low [/I]and downwards, resulting in lower shot placements. \n\nOverall, an excellent handgun, with an excellent performance.

There was absolutely no mis fires or lead shaving detected. The primer strikes on all the 50 rounds were perfectly centered.\r\n\r\nThe sights were better adjusted in the start as it is evident from the video given below. For a person shooting a gun for the first time in his life,  the accuracy was quite good but it became bad after we tried to adjust the sights. We need 50 more rounds and an experienced member to readjust the sights to factory settings.\r\n\r\nThe sound and power of 357 magnum round is simply awsome. I mistakenly fired a round without ear protection and it was like a brick hitting my head. Whatever we read about the [B]BANG[/B] of 357 magnum is absolutely true.

It is that a gun must have a weight at-least 96 times the weight of the shell being fired to be handled comfortably. For shooting a 36-Gram shell we must have a gun weighing at least(36*96)= 3456 gram(3.456 Kg or 7.6 Lb) to maintain a comfortable felt recoil. As now most guns that are liked by us weigh around 2.8 - 3.2 Kg so i consider a 36-gram shell a hot load. For ammo choice i think Turkish ammo was available in great variety.

Tomahawk being a very short shotgun naturally is loud, kicks alot and makes alota noise but one must understand the true benefit of this type of shotgun (cruiser). that is, the ability to maneuver in extremely tight spaces such a vehicle. it is short, weighs less thus is alot easy to carry when compared to typical HD length shotguns (18-21inches). so I guess, when you weigh out the pluses and minuses, it all makes it worth while to have this shotgun if the situation mandates deployment of this type of firearm.\r\n\r\nNow lets talk about the recoil. this type of shotgun generally gives a lot more recoil and on top of that we were using super 36g hot loads which makes controlling even more difficult and to make matters even more worst, there was not buttstock to transfer recoil forces to the operators shoulders. it was pretty clever on AK47 bhai''s part to explicitly use super hot loads in this tiny shotgun for this review as it conveys a clear idea that recoil though abusive can be easily tamed if one knows how to operate this type of firearm. without a buttstock, the shooter''s hands take the full beating of this monster therefore it necessitates a proper grip. this is exactly what the videos showed and exactly what it conveyed. \r\n\r\n[B]that is: This little monster can be easily controlled and aimed at its intended target (while maintaining a decent rate of fire) even with super hot (36g) roman candles.[/B]\r\n\r\n[QUOTE=Topak;164649]gun(MUNNI) was dancing more in AKs hands... were you using HOT loads ? \r\n12G firing was more controlled,is it due to practice or using low pressure loads?[/QUOTE]\r\n \r\nWe were both firing the same hot loads and infact only AK47 bhai fired a couple of 32g SG loads whereas I explicitly fired roman candles. the controlled firing was a direct result of handling and stance.

Tomahawk being a very short shotgun naturally is loud, kicks alot and makes alota noise but one must understand the true benefit of this type of shotgun (cruiser). that is, [B]the ability to maneuver in extremely tight spaces such a vehicle[/B]. it is short, weighs less thus is alot easy to carry when compared to typical HD length shotguns (18-21inches). so I guess, when you weigh out the pluses and minuses, it all makes it worth while to have this shotgun if the situation mandates deployment of this type of firearm.\r\n\r\nNow lets talk about the recoil. this type of shotgun generally gives a lot more recoil and on top of that we were using super 36g hot loads which makes controlling even more difficult and to make matters even more worst, there was not buttstock to transfer recoil forces to the operators shoulders. it was pretty clever on AK47 bhai''s part to explicitly use super hot loads in this tiny shotgun for this review as it conveys a clear idea that recoil though abusive can be easily tamed if one knows how to operate this type of firearm. without a buttstock, the shooter''s hands take the full beating of this monster therefore it necessitates a proper grip. this is exactly what the videos showed and exactly what it conveyed. \r\n\r\n[B]that is: [B]This little monster can be easily controlled and aimed at its intended target[/B] (while maintaining a decent rate of fire) [B]even with super hot (36g) roman candles[/B].[/B]\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\nWe were both firing the same hot loads and infact only AK47 bhai fired a couple of 32g SG loads whereas I explicitly fired roman candles. the controlled firing was a direct result of handling and stance. I could have leaned more into the shot and used my full body weight to counter the recoil but that would have made the gun look recoilless in the video. I intentionally used semi-casual stance to show that this baby kicks like a mule but not to a level that compromises its usefulness.\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\nHahahahhahaha, you are absolutely right Sir and the swelling doesn''t go for 9 months. hahahahahahahha :laugh:\r\n\r\nRegards.[/QUOTE]\r\n\r\nThanks 12G bro, nicely summed up above, those were indeed the salient features of this beast, main part being the "maneuverability" , [I]fast and easy deployment[/I]. :)', ''),

(321337, ' [QUOTE=12GAUGE;163835]AoA Everybody\n \nIts a very good topic and we need to understand a few things about shotguns before we can comment on their usefulness in securing a bank or any such facility where innocent bystanders is a big variable.\n \nFirst of all, shotguns do not have a cone of death. Its pellets do not fly away from their intended path like a guided missile and hit an innocent bystander. Under normal conditions and under typical bank/room type distances (upto 10 yards), shotgun patterns are no bigger than a melon/football and they only hit where they are aimed. yes, i''m talking careful aiming. However, since the pattern is almost the size of a football, it increases the hit probability and increases the chances of wounding a vital organ which eventually results in ending the assault.\n \nUnlike pistol and rifles, shotguns do not suffer from over penetration therefore in a court of law, you do not magically transform from a good guy into a bad guy (trigger happy, gun slinging maniac).\n \nand finally, why pump actions? well, they are reliable as hell and do not need much maintenance therefore are always preferred over autoloaders. under ideal situations an autoloader might be equally reliable but when we factor in total lack of periodical maintenance, lubrication, cleaning and upkeep, pump actions being simple mechanisms win by a huge margin.\n \nas far as conceal carry under such conditions (bank setting) is concerned, ever wonder (in nature) how an animal that has the ability to defend its self proudly displays that ability to defend. think for a second, a snake displays its fangs, make a weird noise when moving, some snakes rattle (ratting snake), some animals display long nails on their bodies, some animals flash warning colors, ever wonder why?\n \nbecause open display carry deters assailants. lets do a mathematical test here. lets say on any given day you are being followed by 100 perspective assailants. out of those 100, 95 will immediately back off when they see that you are in a position to fight back and only remaining 5 will consider attacking you.\n \nwhereas if you are conceal carrying your weapon, 100 out of 100 will be in a position to attack and since you being a normal guy (not a guy who always has his one finger on the trigger and keeps his one eye closed all the time just to get a quick sight picture if the need ever arises) cannot be ready all the time. \n \nhere the interesting question is, would you rather have 100 fights and see which 5 fights you lose or you would rather avoid 95 fights (previous example) and lose in the remaining 5? ITS A SIMPLE PROBABILITY GAME GENTLEMEN :)\n \nRegards.[/QUOTE]\n Excellent and practically most relevent to our local environment, comment brother.

(321365, ' Some very useful stuff here. These are the most agreeable on my part.\n\n At the first place as it is said that security guards are used more as a deterrence and when used in this role one must be the most visible with hitting power. This thing has its own benefits(scaring away the least prepared and least daring ones) but at the same time offers a better plan to handle them first to some, as element of surprise will always be in the control of the bandits. There should be some guards hidden with concealed weapons to offer some surprise to the bad guys.\n\nSecondly, the weapons. No doubt a pump shotgun offers the best reliability(conditional), quick successive shots, flexibility of ammo selection, enough fire power, ease of engaging the target and very lethal. Now a pistol grip thing????????????? without a butt stock use of a shotgun couldn''t be for a serious business i believe.\n\nFinally, the spread thing with reference to the barrel length??? I think spread could be controlled and estimated with reference to the dia of the muzzle(barrel dia and the dia at the muzzle/constriction) at a certain distance. A barrel length just allows the  burning of the powder and getting the shot optimum velocity, off-course offers sighting plane and swing properties.........but pattern???????? Pattern size is not effected by barrel length(not too short say less than 10"), yes, a loss of velocity due to shorter length could allow the pattern to open early as compared to a full energy pattern but not applicable on our scenario up to 20 Yds, i guess. \n\nRegards:', ''),

This was new to me, indeed, I always thought spread had [I]basically[/I] to do with the length of the barrel, and constrictions and chokes were extra determining things for shot pattern. I doubt, however, the suppliers of the guards ever go into "constrictions" of barrels and use of chokes, etc. It''s merely about deploying kind of "statue" with a fire-able piece of steel, I have a habit of checking the weapons of the guards around my area, trust me, those are "lousy" things they''re supplied with, in "lousy" conditions!

See my attached pics earlier on this topic. Do the pintails and mallards look unreal? And the magnum sized mallards are of definite plus point on rivers especially, as they are more visible from skies and far off distance. Read foreign websites for decoy info. I can give you contact numbers of many hunters using consistently these Okara decoys since early 90''s. They have not broken. And pintails and teals are of standard size. Only mallards are magnum. Even another v good guy in Pindi Malik Avais is also buying from Okara and supplying them to hunters after repainting with finer more true to life colors.\r\n\r\nSecondly, if you bothered to read my post closely, then check cabelas.com and email them about shipping info and relate it with the customs info given by a friend here on this topic. I''ve asked customs officials myself and verified. Importing is no prob. Just that hunters do not know at moment in general about importing. They are fast catching up with it now. Mallard decoys (imported) which i imported for personal hunting have not cost me much, nor have the baby mojos cost hunters much who have imported themselves. \r\n\r\nLastly, weapons dealer cum gear dealer doesn''t matter.

Add 25% shipping to Lahore.  and then add customs as detailed by a very informed friend above. WHAT FINAL VALUE DO YOU GET? Even if you add 65% customs figure (which is only applicable to above $200 or $500 imports, i''m not sure which of the two values), this % is applicable on commercial bulk imports, then even you arrive at a figure of Rs8000. This price is on the maximum side with commercial import tariff, but we as individual consumers and importers do not fall in that bracket. For us, the custom tariff is fairly reasonable and low within a certain import value like e.g. $500.', ''),

(321660, ' [QUOTE=Haris;164556]here is what Pakistan customs say \r\nbird decoys are importable @ 10% Customs duty + 16% GST, Customs calculate this value on purchase price+freight upto Pakistan Airport+insurance (max 1%)\r\nhowever, for small quantity if imported via dhl, fedex, UPS etc you dont need to pay these charges as courier companies deals with customs and they deliver cargo to your address by charging approx Rs 1000 (as local charges) if import value is not above $500 (approx) however in case of import through US postal service which will reach GPO or any other post office, you have to govt dues +speed money ;)\r\nbest option is to use DHL, UPS etc (by staying within their minimum charges) by combining few orders so that economy of scale could be achieved[/QUOTE]\r\n \r\n@Haris, very good info as I said earlier too. What mode of shipping should one choose (Fedex or as per supplying company?) and what custom tariff will be charged here at Lahore approx on e.g. a Baby Mojo pair $100, Gadwall Mojo $70, or a regular Mallard Mojo $130, and a dozen mallard decoys by Avery Greenhead Gear Hot Buy II at $37 per dozen? \r\nI''ve asked companies such as [url]www.Cabelas.com[/url]. They say 25% of order value will be charged as surface shipping to LAHORE. And my info abt customs tariff on these consumer items is that if your import value is under say $200 or $500 as you say, then there is very low customs charged. E.g. Rs.1500-2000 on a order value of about $200. Brother you mentioned something like Rs1000 customs tariff. As customs value is the main issue, pls shed some detailed light on it espec regarding items I mentioned above. Some friends are finalizing importing too.

(321759, ' [B][U][COLOR="red"]ONLY SOLUTION LEFT[/COLOR][/U][/B]\r\n\r\nWe have worked over the concept of private game reserves and promoted it at various levels. As far as poaching is concerned it will never finish. \r\n\r\nPrivate Game Reserves is a good idea but I oppose this concept now because a common hunter will be totally out of game after promoting this concept and this is not a long lasting solution. The people who can afford or have some direct relation and influence will always facilitated and common hunter which I consider from lower middle class will just dream a good game ever. The owner when find any fruitful idea about his land, he will wrap the whole concept. The way we are harvesting the crops soon we will hardly see any area for habitat. It&#8217;s hard to find Baila, marshes, koonder, wetlands even at border belts these days. \r\n\r\nIs there any solution???? This is the question we all are thinking about and find no permanent solution yet. \r\n\r\nYes, one of them I want to share here. This is not just dream but the sole solution to save game forever and also our right as a citizen of Islamic Republic of Pakistan. which will not just save the game forever but equal level of playing field will be available for all categories of hunters.\r\n\r\nIn each district of Pakistan Government allocate lands for habitats. For example Punjab has around 36 districts and each district should have at least some land like 2000 acres 2-4 pieces in the suburbs which will be allocated just for hunting purpose only and declared sanctuary. Some of them should be for upland and few for migrated birds as resting areas, if area is specifically not suitable for any of them allocate this area to other.  We have enough land in our beloved country to allocate at least 2 areas must be earmark otherwise no wildlife will be around in coming 5-10 years.\r\n\r\nHunting in said areas will be strictly banned and administration will be a mix of people from public sector, wild life Department and each hunter of the area which carries valid WLD hunting permits.  I assure you when true stakeholders will be added they will never allow illegal hunting at any level. Heaviest fine and imprisonment should be result if any hunting activity (with or without weapon) observed in this area.\r\n\r\nThese areas will populate the whole Pakistan again, I tell you.\r\n\r\nIf 100 pair of partridge gains time for one year in next 3-4 year they will be in millions (I had a calculation which is missing right now about per season growth of pheasants and partridges).  Same like if migrated birds should find any resting area they will migrate here to a greater number and every water pond will be rich with all migrated species which will provide game for every hunter. \r\n\r\nThis is the only solution left to save the wildlife forever in our beloved homeland. Without Government contribution no other solution will be permanent. We have to raise this slogan at all levels. All hunting communal should have atleast one common agenda otherwise we will be here just to talk memories soon. Its time for a wake up call, write latter to authorities, take electronic media on board and share your idea to maximum possible excess. \r\n\r\n[B][COLOR="red"]I am sure if we collectively go for it, we will win.[/COLOR][/B]', ''),

Would like to post questions in mind later ...maybe you would be better able to guide or give website references as you seem to have compiled quite a data on migration and waterfowl behaviour in our region.[/QUOTE]\r\n \r\n@francolino;Why not; according to my poor knowledge I will try my best to share the things with friends.\r\nYou are right sufficient or basic material is not available on any specific website on this topic; it&#8217;s bad luck. \r\n\r\nI availed an opportunity to work in the field with my friend to compile the material and field studies for his PhD on migratory birds in Punjab. Later on jointly we had done few surveys in Punjab about endangered/threatened species.\r\n\r\nAdditionaly I quoted; an animals counting method (very interesting; you can count how many animals are in the specific area). Originally method was adopted by Great Hunter of our continent  Mr. Jim Corbett. \r\n\r\nVoluntarily I also produced a short documentary about endangered species for the briefing on wildlife in Punjab on briefing ceremony to Governor Punjab in 2007. I shall try to upload the video. \r\nI think this is a different topic; but at least the study of regional wildlife is very necessary for good hunting/shooting.', ''),

POF mp series being produced for the armed forces of Pakistan is nearly as good as the one being produced in Germany by H&K, believe it or not, but the special services group of Pakistan Army uses the mp series most of the times and its a class of its own.\n\n2ndly regarding this particular weapon, i am just puzzled what good is it? i mean practically speaking if its not automatic, its useless, you have to understand that the weapon is used for close personal security where VIPs are guarded even when going to a bathroom, so the weapon calibre and performance have to be lethal yet it should be some thing too overly audible, visible and heavy calibrated, because in a close proximity no one would want to use a large calibre weapon because of several reasons, this weapon is basically meant for security personal that too would frankly speaking look good on a guy wearing a jacket and a tie, i cant have my guard AKA khoro khan baba wear a jeans haha let alone a jacket, and it would look like a toy gun in his hand since he is 6"2. \n\nmy final point would be that in this price range one can get any good handgun, obviously you can''t conceal it in your trouser or wear it in a holster, so why buy this in the first place?[/QUOTE]\nBro your points are quite valid :)', ''),

(322073, ' Brother AK-47 the question that you have asked here requires a deterministic answer, unfortunately, when it comes to the killing power of a weapon/ammo it requires a lot of ifs and buts to qualify any determinism. So, i will remain brief and focus on just buck shots(LG/SG, OO/OOO) as these are considered best for self defence.\r\n\r\nLethality: \r\nAny ammo that can hit its target(range/accuracy) with substantial energy(Terminal energy), could penetrate enough to reach to the vital organs(Penetration) and could damage tissues and the vitals(shape/size) to ensure a quick/clean kill(stoping power). Now the easier an ammo can achieve this more lethal we consider it. At the same time there is no guarantee that any ammo that looks pretty lethal on paper would perform accordingly, it will not, rather it can not, unless shot is not placed at the right place. Right placement of a shot is a vital part to make any ammo lethal. Anyway, a 12-gauge buckshot looks very lethal on the basis of the criteria discussed earlier. \r\n\r\nPunch/PenetrationPower:\r\n\r\nOur standard shots have a muzzle velocity of 1250-1350 fps and they will not loose more than 100-120 fps velocity upto the ranges that we expect them to hit a target, now the loads that we often select are 1 Oz(28grams), 1 1/8 Oz(32Grams), in case of brother ak-47 1 1/4 Oz(36 grams). For the comparison purposes 1gram=15.43grains, a 1 Oz shotshell=432.10grains, for the bigger loads please do the calculation by yourself. Just have a feel of punch comparing size of shot.\r\nNow penetration, as our scenario is close quarters and humans. These round, blunt pallets easily penetrate enough to reach to the vitals and deliver maximum punch.\r\n\r\nEnergy:\r\n\r\nI have used Fedral ballistics catalog to write this part. This is the energy total shot will be carrying. \r\n\r\n 7/8 Oz(24Grams)        Velocity 1260 fps       Energy  1350 foot-pound\r\n1 Oz (28Grams)           Velocity 1263 fps       Energy  1550 foot-Pound\r\n1 1/8 Oz(32Grams)      Velocity 1265 fps       Energy  1750 foot-pound\r\n1 1/4 Oz(36Grams)      Velocity 1260 fps       Energy  1950 foot-pound\r\n\r\nNow one can easily find how much energy each pallet will be carrying by dividing the total energy by the number of pallets in a certain shot. And for comparison puposes a 9mm FMJ 124grain bullet having a muzzle velocity of 1150fps carries a muzzle energy 364 foot-pound. \r\n\r\nAs i said earlier that i will be brief so i am. Hope this will provide a basic understanding.\r\n\r\nRegards:', ''),

The customs will stop you (all UAE flights get stopped at customs unlike the US/UK flights) Tell them its airgun they will let you go noduty on airguns. 2days before flying i went to the airport police to findout if there was any issues in taking the airgun. I took the airgun and showed it to them they said its no problem. And also i inquired with flydubai about the problem with airrifles they said no issues.

(322374, ' Brother AK-47, answering your questions is a pleasure, always. Now coming to the number of pallets thing, yes, you are right fewer the pallets the more powerful they would be. \r\nSimple, Energy is the product of Mass(weight) and Velocity(speed),\r\nBut recoil is also directly proportional to the same\r\nWe must look for a balance, considering the job on hand and the gun in hand.\r\n\r\nAt the same time velocity is something that varies with reference to the distance of the target, and it effects twicely the energy and the recoil when compared to the weight of the bullet. Most of our energy and velocity readings are with reference to the muzzle and deceleration never takes place with constant rate, if the BC is different for two different bullets or /and the density of the air. Shotgun pallets have worst BC. I will not complicate the things anymore, otherwise, temptation is quite strong.\r\n\r\nIn HD/SD conditions the velocity readings that i used should hold, as i used the low ranges of standard velocity shots. It is quite normal that we will start from 1300-1350fps at the muzzle and at 16yds we will be around 1250-1270fps. \r\n\r\nDo, not think about getting better energy levels by increasing velocity, it also deforms(except hard pallets) the pallets more, to effect the penetration and the pattern adversely, need not to mention the recoil.\r\n\r\n[B]You have bought quality Fedral ammo. The term Maxi is a marketing term not a universal description of the charge, velocity or the pallets. Companies normally mention the velocity, tragectory/rifle, spread for shots and the weight of the pallets. Faster and/or havier shotshell will deliver more punch and the kick. Logically, more pressure will be required to move faster a shot or move a heavier shot with the same velocity. Now how much powder will be required to do that? i think that should depend on the type of the propellent. [/B]\r\n\r\nRegards:', ''),

It  a question regarding purchase of weapon. It is not a question of  Legality but a question of sensibility and prudence. The Question is:  "Should I purchase my first weapon from Chaudry Arms Dealer as well or  should I go to other reputable arms dealers such as P.A.R.A or Buksh  Elahi Traders etc.???" What do you guys suggest???\n\nI wish to buy a Taurus Pt-92 as my first weapon. Currently Chaudry Arms  don''t have it with them, but they say that they will arrange it for me  from their other shop i.e. Mokel Arms in Nila Gumbad. But I am worried  about being my weapon NIB. I have learned from seniors comments on this  forum that weapon in a NIB condition should be in a box and it is  greased from factory. However, I was shown many weapons which were on  display and they claimed all of them to be completely New. They were dry  and not greased as said. I am Worried and Confused!!! I don''t know whom  to trust :-( \n\nPlease tell me what you guys suggest??? I am looking forward to input from all of our seniors.', ''),

(322861, ' Thanks to all gentlemen for taking part here, I''ve tried using the different formula''s handed in for calculation of 12G ammo delivery impacts, including the one handed in by Sir Skeeter, and have come quite close to the values posted by [B]HJ[/B] bro above.\r\n\r\nMay I repeat his findings:\r\n\r\n7/8 Oz(24Grams) Velocity 1260 fps Energy 1350 foot-pound\r\n1 Oz (28Grams) Velocity 1263 fps Energy 1550 foot-Pound\r\n[B]1 1/8 Oz(32Grams) Velocity 1265 fps Energy 1750 foot-pound[/B]\r\n1 1/4 Oz(36Grams) Velocity 1260 fps Energy 1950 foot-pound\r\n\r\nI''ve highlighted the 1 1/8 Oz(32Grams) load, since it corresponds to the loads of our local POF Shaheen SG shotshell, which is also in common use here.\r\n\r\nI must say that[B] 1750 foot-pound[/B] from a 12g shot is quite an amount of kinetic energy and a blast that would outset any opposing threat, wherefore I feel that we need not calculate the single pellet energy, coz a shotgun shot carrying [B]1750 foot-pound energy[/B], or slightly lesser -[I]with respect to minor decrease due to travel of distance out of muzzle end[/I] - and if fired from literally any barrel length, from SD [I]point blanc range[/I] or some 15-25 feet distance ([I]common CQB range[/I]), will be delivering all the pellets [B]within a very small area of impact[/B], and hence confer the [B]full [/B]load and amount of energy above, of all the pellets combined.\r\n\r\nI agree with HJ bro, that selection of the ammo for SD purposes should be more centered on the size of the pellets, [I]for proper penetration and inflicting damage to vital organs[/I], rather than the [I]amount of powder load [/I]of the shotshells, since 12 Gauge ammo, even in it''s lower load content of 1 Oz i.e, still basically packs quite a huge blast. Hence, I too, would suggest normal loads for better control and[I] reduced recoil[/I] - especially in pump-action shotguns - and use the buckshots 000 or 00 of imported for better lethality/stoppage rate, and of local ammo, the [B]SG[/B] shotshell. The 000 contains [B]08[/B] pellets, the 00 [B]12[/B] pellets, and the SG [B]09[/B] pellets, respectively.\r\n\r\nTo conclude this very nice discussion, and with thanks to HJ bro, Faisji and Skeeter Sir, let me post some excerpts from some surfing around of the net on this particular issue:\r\n\r\n[I][B]The 12 gauge shotgun is the most devastating and lethal weapon yet devised for inflicting rack and ruin at close range[/B]. A safe bet for ammunition selection is to use the 2-3/4-inch 00 buckshot load. [B]The impact of one of these shot shells is essentially equivalent to getting hit with a nine round burst from a submachine gun[/B][/I].\r\n\r\n[B]And[/B]:\r\n\r\n[I]Buckshot loads will exhibit penetration on the order of 12 inches or so, [B]a depth sufficient to intersect vital blood distribution structures and terminate aggression[/B][/I].\r\n\r\n[I][B]The shotgun must be skillfully aimed and fired[/B]. Aiming is just not quite as precise as that required for a handgun or autoloader to score multiple hits on an aggressor.[B]The massive firepower of the shotgun will likely produce a favorable outcome in any self defense encounter[/B][/I].\r\n\r\nBelow some suggestions for selection of appropriate SD ammo with 1.st shot impact lethality/ pacification/stoppage rates in % (Percentages):\r\n\r\n[B]12 Gauge:\r\nOne Shot Stopping Success: 81-96% (Actual) \r\nRecommended Cartridges[/B]:\r\n\r\nFederal "Tactical"	2-3/4-inch	00 buck	96%\r\nRemington "Magnum"	3-inch	00 buck	94%\r\nWinchester 2-3/4-inch	 00 buck	94%\r\n[B]Federal	2-3/4-inch	 00 buck	89%[/B]\r\nRemington 2-3/4-inch	 00 buck	88%\r\n\r\nMarked in highlighted of above is what''s 100% available here, can''t say of the rest, there must be alternatives around?\r\n\r\nAs you can see, the [B]00[/B]( double aught) has been most recommended. I missed it during my last Lahore trip, and instead got the [B]000[/B], which is excellent by itself, containing 8 pellets only, measuring some .36", hence [B]9.14mm[/B] each, so quite some balls indeed, approximately the size of a 9mm handgun caliber round, in cross section.\r\n\r\nI personally also like the mixed tube formula, with an "assortment" of different shotshell types. A higher pelleted shotshell for the first shot would be good to have loaded, with the subsequent ones being the buckshot shells. I''d suggest either the [B]B.B[/B] or Buckshot 4 ([B]SSSG[/B]), as well as the [B]AAA[/B], for the [B]first shot[/B], since these combine both quantity of pellets and reasonable pellet size.\r\n\r\nOf what''s available here in our markets, let me post the types that I use for [B]SD[/B] purposes:\r\n\r\n[B]Federal 2 3/4" 000[/B]:\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i1136.photobucket.com/albums/n497/wahstar1/Ammo/Shooting001Small.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\n[B]B.B[/B] Victory brand:\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i1136.photobucket.com/albums/n497/wahstar1/Ammo/BBCyprusCloseupMedium.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\n[B]US 4 Buckshot S&B[/B]:\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i1136.photobucket.com/albums/n497/wahstar1/Ammo/SSSGSB.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\nConcluding this thread with above, I''d request Mods to change the title of the thread to something like:\r\n\r\n"[I]Suggested 12 Gauge SD Ammo[/I]", since I believe it will serve as a useful source for shotgun owners, to better gear themselves up.\r\n\r\nWith thanks to all Gentlemen having shared here, and [B]HJ[/B] bro, [B]Faisji[/B] in particular.\r\n\r\nRegards. :)', ''),

I took the airgun and showed it to them they said its no problem. And also i inquired with flydubai about the problem with airrifles they said no issues.

(322952, ' [QUOTE=Rotorcrafts;164761]This would turn out to be a nice project for you i guess. Regarding the IR emitter i would suggest the following LED based emitter.\r\n\r\n[url]http://www.dealextreme.com/details.dx/sku.14061[/url]\r\n\r\nYou can use a single LED in a proper flashlight or couple them up to make a very strong Infra red setup. word of caution though, as you can not see Infra red light so you shouldnt be looking at the LED for long when it is on as it will put a lot of strain on your eyes.[/QUOTE]\r\n \r\nthanks for the info..I am shopping for a video camera, a camera mount, and a nice set of IR lights that have at least 50m range. I''ve been checking out the specifications and so far only Sony makes cameras with the Night Shot function. Night Shot allows you to see (without supplementary light) up to 10'' and Super Night Shot gives you an additional 10-15m, except that the picture gets choppy. Adding the IR light provides more range and good resolution and zoom will mean that I should be able to recognize my targets at night, 50m, possibly more if its an open area. I''ve seen used camcorders with this function from as low as Pkr 6,000...however, they have lower resolution and less zoom. I''m looking for at least 20x zoom and I''m still figuring out the whole issue of resolution. The camcorders in Pakistan I''ve seen with these functions are mainly the Sony DCR HC and the DCR TRV models. Some of them have both Night Shot and Super Night Shot...and some of them have the Plus versions of these functions, that gives a little more color apparently. It looks like one can get a very decent unit with all the functions and in excellent condition for around Pkr 15,000....it''ll be a few years old but the new models don''t have these functions in the low end models anymore. \r\n\r\nThe Seben DKA camera mount will allow me to place the camera in proper alignment with the scope...want a view just as if I was looking through it with my own eyes....not misaligned and seeing the black inside of the tube. it seems to be around US$ 30-40 depending on where you buy it. I am looking for alternatives but so far this is what I''ve come up with.\r\n\r\nRegarding the IR light....I''m not sure if the LEDs provide the kind of focused long range light that I need for shooting 20-50 meters in absolute pitch dark. The LED lights are good for shorter distances if I''m not mistaken...they can light up a room or give you a flood light affect up to 10m.\r\n\r\nI''ve seen a shop at Zamzama with a night vision monocular for Pkr 25,000 and it was just crap. It was black & white, no recording functions, no zoom just fixed at 3x mag, no eye relief or lcd screen, nothing.....you get very little for your money. He also had a tactical IR light for Pkr 10,000..he claimed it was 100 lumens but I couldn''t see it through his NV monocular. \r\n\r\nThe set up I''m describing above is far superior to most 1st generation NV monoculars that one could buy, even up to US$ 400 in the US itself.  It will cost no more than Pkr 25-30,000 for a camcorder, a seben camera mount, and a very cool tactical IR light along with a secondary set of IR led lights. The camera mount is very useful for mounting a camera on telescopes, monoculars, weapon scopes, even binoculars....so it is multi-functional. The camcorder is also very useful across the board and you can also record all your shooting to share with anybody you want to. The IR lights are the only items on the list that are not useful for another purpose....but thats probably because I haven''t thought of it yet. I would say overall this set up would be money spent wisely...and it could be done on a much lower budget still.

I have not seen anyone use it before, I seem to default to it every time I''m having a bad shooting day and it cheers me right up :) The only drawback of this grip is that the down force exerted on the joint of the forefinger and supporting hand make it hurt after a few shots. For this grip the slimmer the grip of the pistol the better.

The target had a 1 inch diameter centre with each circle increasing by 1 inch in radius.\r\n\r\nPistol: Tauras PT909\r\nDistance: 15 m\r\nAmmo:\r\n1) Chinese Redbox,\r\n2) Sellier & Bellot 124 grain FMJ\r\n3) American Eagle (by FCC) 124 grain FMJ\r\n4) Armscor Precision 124 grain JHP\r\n\r\nI fired in groups of ten... the first pic is of Armscor, second of Chinese Redbox, third of S&B and fourth of American Eagle.\r\n\r\nOut of these 40 bullets, i had one seating failure, that of S&B, otherwise, everything went smoothly. \r\n\r\nAfter this test session, i noted the following points;\r\n\r\n1) The Chinese Redbox ammo, as pointed out by Abbas bhai, seems like a +p round, with a louder bang, more smoke and recoil. The result of the high recoil was that the bullets were consistently hitting higher even though my elbows were resting on a table and my grip was fairly tight.\r\n\r\n2) American Eagle had less smoke, bang and recoil and seemed to hit exactly where aimed. \r\n\r\n3) My rating for accuracy for the said ammo is as follows\r\nno.1 American Eagle,\r\nno.2 Armscor \r\nfollowed very closely by S&B at no.3, and\r\nno.4 Chinese Redbox .\r\n\r\n4) Even though i loaded and fired 10 rounds each, i could only count 9 on the target sheet for the American Eagle.

(323494, ' Dear all:\r\nI am writing to you from Chile.\r\nBelow is an extract of what I posted on US blogs...\r\n\r\n\r\nThe reason I’m participating in US blogs is to give you all a different perspective on the T14 SAFIR ARMS guns.\r\nAlthough attractive, as they look like AR15s, there is a lot to consider before buying one of them. We thought it was a good product, so we went ahead and ordered 4 guns so we could test them before offering them to our customers, against all recommendations from the sales director in Turkey that we should get more guns, that 4 guns wasn’t an important purchase. After placing the order, paying for them, it’s been more than 4 months, yes…FOUR MONTHS, and still we can not do anything with them.\r\nOne of them came with rust at the tip of the barrel. Parts on the inside of the guns were used and worn out. Springs on all 8 magazines were different. Shells would get stuck and did not feed properly, the side lid of one of them wouldn''t held closed in place…it was worn out…just to name a few.\r\nThe manufacturer makes 2 different versions of the T14. One that goes to the US, caliber .410, and another for latin America, 36 gauge. What I think we got was a mix of parts from those two versions.\r\nThere is a huge language barrier when dealing with Turkey. We’ve done business with other brands, so we speak from experience.\r\nWith SAFIR Arms everything that could’ve gone wrong, went wrong.\r\nEverything I have written here has a video back up of the gun’s operation, and also pictures of the items received, together with email back up of the purchase process, that wasn’t respected, and they sent whatever they felt like they should send out.\r\nPlease be careful before buying. They have no concept of customer service. They do not own up to their mistakes, despite the amount of written evidence and pictures of the faulty items.\r\nI lived in the US and go there often. I know the standards you are accustom to, and this company doesn’t even come close.\r\nPlease don’t take this as a “getting back to them”, instead, it’s a heads up before you spend any money on this guns.\r\nOne of the 4 guns is 100% useless. That is 25% of the product received. They even sent an extra mechanism in the order (which we didn’t ask for), but it doesn’t fit any of the guns…\r\nI will gladly send the video of the jammed guns to anyone who wants it and the pictures of what we got.\r\n[email]alvaro.penaloza@steelfirearms.cl[/email]\r\nBye.', ''),

(323609, ' WIP bro, first of all Viking doesnot have a de-cocker, it has external safety that locks trigger + hammer when engaged.\nDe-cocking is a function (operated by a lever) in some of the handguns which drops a loaded hammer on slide without engaging firing pin, this action makes your loaded gun to fire in double action if trigger is pulled. Some guns like Beretta have both de-cocker and manual safety and others have one of these both.\nBasically both functions are for safety of a loaded weapon, manual safety straight away blocks the loaded gun''s hammer & trigger to avoid unintentional or accidental discharge where as de-cocker rest''s the hammer to down position making it safe to carry and it can be fired instantly (without fiddling with safety lever) in double action if the need arises.\nWhat is better? is always the shooter''s preference, by the way I feel comfortable with de-cocker more than the manual safety.', ''),

You have started making tighter groups which is a very good sign. Shooting is all about staying relaxed and concentrating on basics. I realised it the hardway recently when after shooting 188/200 from my TS from 25 M once, I thought I could hit most bullets in the bull. And when it did not happen, I started focusing too hard to get a perfect sight pic every time. This resulted in mental tension which un-kowingly effected my basics and I started shooting very poorly. \n\nPlease keep concentrating on the basics and shoot relaxed. As far as I recall, I shot right and up with your phantom whereas your groups are mainly left and down. Please see you finger position on the trigger and make sure you place the distal pad on the trigger, giving it a continuous straight pull, and try to achieve surprise break. Focus hard on front sight tip and its correct alignment with the rear sight. DO NOT FOCUS ON THE TARGET. Let it stay in the background and just place the frontsight roughly in the center of black area. Do not focus too hard to place the front sight exactly in the bull, just place it roughly in the center and focus on front sight. This is the mistake that I committed.  \n\nPut your hand down after every shot and rest for a few seconds. Raise your hand and exhale 3/4th of your breath. Shoot within 5-7 seconds of raising your hand. Hold your breath during this time and stay focused on trigger control and front sight, keeping target roughly in the background. \n\nHope to see more of the holes in black area soon...........\nregards', ''),

People believe communal based activities are more necessary than practice serving and Y should somebody take pain where he has to face so many hurdles.\r\n\r\nHowever, we, as a group of a dozen hunters are working hard to register a hunting NGO and working has almost in final stages. Our pattern of doing work is on a serious node where we are not emphasized for communal based activities. First of all we have to be registered to stand anywhere and rise a voice for common hunter, rest is secondary and being done at various forums. Once we got registered, we will start inviting maximum communities to join hands together and form a pressure on authorities to do something practically towards game. Conservation plans, ethical hunting and discourage poaching is agenda items but these cannot be eliminated completely nor save the game for time to come. \r\n\r\nAll we need is a formula to save game at government level with collaboration of hunting community and wildlife authorities. If we got successful to a minimum level we will consider we got full marks out of efforts we made. \r\n\r\nWe are late but still have time to act practically and we are pretty much sure our efforts will get fruitish and we will do something practically to safeguard hunting future in our beloved homeland.\r\n\r\nI would appreciate if friends could guide us further to carry this cause as this is not meant for personal gains but to serve for our hunting passion and save some game for generations to come', ''),

I had to use this weapon to get rid of it. I hated to kill the snake- but I couldn''t have something that deadly around my family. Also for a side note- I picked this gun up for 50 dollars from a friend that didn''t like it or shoot it anymore- so at 50 bucks it was a good deal. When I got it- the barrel was 26 inches long. I cut the barrel down to 18.5 inches for use as a home defense gun and added the side saddle for extra shells. Here in the US- we can''t have a barrel shorter than 18.5 inches without having a license that costs 200 dollars- to me it isn''t worth the extra money.

In 1867, Philip Webley launched a new compact revolver design, which was to achieve recognition throughout the world and remain in production for more than 60 years. Webley secured a contract to supply his weapon to the RIC in January 1868, a stroke of good fortune which ensured the financial success of the company, and established it as the foremost supplier of personal firearms to the Government and Colonial Forces for years to come.\n\n\n\nThe revolver was of the ''solid frame'' variety, a sturdy and heavy piece. Most commonly found in .450 and .455 calibre, it was designated the ''Royal Irish Constabulary Pattern'', and was stamped with the letters R.I.C.\n\nIn September 1869, Lord Berkeley presented a pair of RIC Model revolvers to Brevet Major General (Volunteers) George A Custer, Lt Col 7th US Cavalry Regt. General Custer was to die at the Battle of the Little Bighorn, defeated by the combined forces of the Sioux, Arapaho and Cheyenne Nations in June 1876.\n\nThe solid frame pattern revolver saw service in the RIC for many years, but was gradually replaced by the new and improved ''hinged frame'' Webley revolver from 1890 onwards.\n\nThe first revolvers issued was the No 1 (First Pattern), .450 calibre issued to the RIC (up to serial number 17538); thereafter the slightly improved ''New Model was issued from circa 1881.', ''),

(380965, ' First off, you can forget about warranties of any kind. No dealer will provide any kind of warranty of any sort. It''s unfortunate, but that''s just the way it is. As for after sales services, that really depends on the dealer; if the dealer is a nice, reasonable guy, then he''ll definitely help you out if you need a new mag or grips, or even if you need to get your gun fully serviced (full disassembly and cleaning/lubrication).\n\nThe Canik Shark is indeed an excellent gun. Infact, I plan on buying one inshallah just as soon as the current license situation gets resolved. I''ll be going for the full-frame version instead of the compact, mid-frame C-100.\n\nI wouldn''t recommend going for locally manufactured clones bro, it''s a simple waste of money and a potential hazard. The locally made clones use low-quality metal, because of which a critical part of your gun can fail anytime, leading to what is known as a "catastrophic failure". On the other hand, foreign made clones are a better option. The Canik Shark, infact, is a slightly modified clone of the classic CZ-75. Similarly, you can look at the Kanuni 16, which is another Turkish-made CZ-75 clone. Or, if you''re VERY lucky, try to get your hands on the Norinco NZ-85B, a Chinese-made clone of the CZ-85B. If you can manage to increase your budget to around 75K, then the best buy would be the Taurus PT-92 (based on the famous Baretta 92FS).\n\nAs for "Glock or Walther P22", both are completely different weapons because they feed on different caliber ammo; the Glock is 9mm, while the Walther P22 is a .22LR caliber. A better comparison would be a Glock and a Walther P99, since both are 9mm. But, unfortunately, both guns are FREAKISHLY expensive (more than 150K), so the Canik Shark would definitely a much better alternative.', ''),

A full charge can produce a really nasty crackling arc for around 90 seconds while the torch will function for about a couple of hours of continuous operation. How ever the torch will function fine long after the stun unit has run out of power. \r\n\r\nThe main switch is the same as any conventional torch and indeed has the same application i.e. switching the torch on an off. Just like most torches the stun gun versions also have the little red signal button mounted on top of the switch .With the only difference being that the little red signal button actually powers the stun gun. \r\n\r\nPop the accessory black cap on the electrodes and there is no way u can differentiate it from any other torch! It also has a black carrying case which can be strapped on a belt.\r\n\r\nAs regards power output the instruction manual usually has a 1 or a 5 followed by a mind-boggling number of Zeros. I am almost 100 % sure that these are gross exaggerations especially  since the English of the manual may as well be Chinese. \r\n\r\nHaving the arc touch your body is a singularly unpleasant experience. It will drop a normal man (5.7 12 inch unit) and have him immobilized till the weapon is removed from his person. The twin electrodes leave residual burn marks for a few days and a tingling sensation for a few hours. \r\n\r\nThe price of a typical 12 inch ‘torch’ ranges from Rs. 10,000   in Karachi to Rs. 600-800 for the same unit in Peshawar’s Karkhano bazaar.\r\n\r\nI have been trying to find pics but I could not find any on the main search engines while the unit I had I gave away to my friend’s wife.', ''),

(324250, ' @Sgthoskins Thank you brother, spoken like an IPSC champ ;) I understand that the grip in question is not ideal for combat shooting. I want to use it for bullseye shooting which allows me an entire minute for a single shot.  \n\nBut at the same time it makes for excellent rapid shooting as well. The support hand (although initially uncomfortable) acts like a rest and the trigger finger is left entirely free and no part of the grip is left untouched. A very consistent pressure is applied to the entire grip and the resulting balance and stability go a long way in eliminating triggering errors if any. \n\nI would very much like any shooters trying this grip and posting their results / experiences if possible.', ''),
(324253, ' Dear Waqas Bro, It would have been better if you could have started a new thread. But Its ok. \r\n\r\nDifference b/w sporting and SD pistol.Let me think. One major big difference is the trigger pressure or trigger pull. In my opinion CZ Tactical(never fired it or examined it), CZ999 and Viking(fired both) are not to be used for SD. Why. B/c their single action trigger is LIGHT.And double action too heavy. \r\nSD pistol should have atlease 5/8pounds trigger pull. I have Walther P99. Its sucks at range. Atleast for me. But even If i press the trigger(atleast 3 pounds pressure) the gun doesn''t go boom. Its without safety. But the trigger pull/weight itself is safety. I use for home defence only.\r\nSecond would be the size. CZ999,Viking and CZtactical are way to huge for SD.\r\nSo for me size of the pistol,trigger pull and rapid fire matters the most for a SD pistol.\r\nAnd third would be the weight. SD weapon should be light weight. Regarding sports pistol, don''t know much. Only used Viking. And my range results improved by 40%.', ''),

There will be a shooters list on the main page as well.\n\nThe point of this ranking is to encourage people to shoot seriously and help identify the proficiency level of a shooter to others. For example now, anyone can say Denovo, 12G, Abbas and Kamran have the same level of skill or 12G is slightly better but that''s the best description one can give. With the new system everyone will be able to accurately identify the exact skill level of a shooter by saying Denovo is a Marksman (150 + at 25M), Abbas is Self Defense Proficient (80+ at 10M), 12 G and Kamran are Sporting GrandMasters (180+ at 25m).', ''),

The thoughts about getting 2 Chinese TTs against one Russian TT are well justified for you. But I think bit differently. I will go for the original breed (pedigree :D ) where ever possible. To me if the original breed is available with the minimal difference as compare to other available options then why not go for the original rather than clones. I AM not against the clones but original gun with it''s own history is better than any replica/clone.\n\nI use to have an original Russian TT, which I very much regret that I had let it go. As you may have seen the original Russian TT which clearly shows the difference among Chinese and Serbian TTs. All Serbian or Chinese TTs have sharp edges on the internal parts and very rough finish on the internal parts including internal surface of slide and frame. While on the other hand the Russian TT has quite smooth and nice finish on all internal parts including the slide and frame.\n\nHaving said that I do like Chinese/Serbian TT as they have proven to be reliable and nice shooters but when I have a chance to get the original breed/design/model then why not go for it where the difference of price is not that much (Comparing with M57).', ''),

(324891, 'Range Report SV10 Perenia 3 Finally on Friday 24th Dec I got the opportunity to test fire my new Beretta SV10 Perenia 3 Over Under Shotgun. I had to degrease it a night before and enjoyed every bit of it. Some characteristics of the gun, it is 12 guage with a 3 inch chamber, ribbed, comes with 5 OCHP Chokes has a 28 inches barrel and comes with kickoff recoil pad. The gun weighs about 7.13 pounds. The gun is third in evolution of legendry Beretta Over unders its predecessors being the famous 68 Series and the classic SO series. SV10 has a fine engraving with both side plates having different game scenes. The gun is well balanced both for the sporting and field use. I had no problem in adjusting with the gun as despite the kickoff system it mounted perfectly and the the swing was easily controlled. The position of the opening lever and length has been modified from previous Beretta models which makes it more convenient to handle. The single selective trigger was smooth . The length of pull is 14.7 inches and drop at comb 1.38 inches while drop at heel 2.7 inches. Though it was my first time with a gun fitted with kickoff recoil system and I was little apprehensive since some of my friends had adviced me to get one without kickoffs. However now I do not regrett the decision since the system did kill the recoil considerably and made the shooting more accurate and fun. Overall the gun is a fine piece of engineering from Beretta and hope will give me a good company on my field trips.', ''),

(337284, '.22, the Mighty Mouse [FONT=Arial][SIZE=6][SIZE=2][B]I found this recently on: [URL]http://www.chuckhawks.com/history_rimfire_ammo.htm[/URL] Mr. Hawks explains this better than I ever could, therefore I shall not try to steal his thunder. \n[/B]\n[/SIZE]A Brief History of .22 Rimfire Ammunition \n[/SIZE][/FONT] [FONT=Arial][B]By Chuck Hawks[/B][/FONT]\n[FONT=Arial]\n [/FONT][FONT=Arial]The rimfire principle was used to create  the first successful self-contained metallic ammunition.  Rimfire cases  are constructed with the priming compound spun inside the rim of the  copper or brass case, which is crushed by the blow of the firing pin to  ignite the main powder charge.[/FONT]\n  [FONT=Arial]The first rimfire cartridges were .22s, but after  the type became established many larger caliber rimfire cartridges were  developed in the mid to late 19th Century.  Some of these had a good run  of popularity until they were superceded by the development of higher  pressure centerfire ammunition.[/FONT]\n  [FONT=Arial]Calibers ranged from the .25 Short to the .58  Miller.  Probably the best known of the larger caliber rimfires are the  .25 Stevens, .32 Long, and .44 Henry Flat.  The latter was the cartridge  for which the seminal Henry and Winchester 1866 "Yellow Boy" lever  action rifles were chambered.[/FONT]\n  [FONT=Arial]Guns and ammunition for the last of the larger  caliber rimfires was discontinued in the U.S. in the late 1930''s and  early 1940''s.  According to [I]Cartridges of the World[/I] by Frank C.  Barnes/Edited by M.L. McPherson, for which I am indebted for much of the  historical information in this article, Navy Arms commissioned a run of  .32 Long ammunition from a Brazilian manufacturer in 1990.[/FONT]\n  [FONT=Arial]In addition to the larger caliber rimfire  cartridges of the past, in recent times sub-caliber rimfire cartridges  have been introduced.  Among these are the 5mm Remington Magnum, .17  Mach 2, and the very successful .17 HMR.  However, the focus of this  article is .22 caliber rimfire cartridges.[/FONT]\n  [FONT=Arial]All .22 rimfires (except the WRF and WMR) are  ancient black powder designs, and use tapered heel bullets.  If you  examine a .22 S, L, or LR cartridge, you will see that the case and  bullet are the same diameter.  The part of the bullet inside of the case  (the heel) is reduced in diameter to allow it to fit inside of the  case.  Such bullets are also called "outside lubricated," because they  are ordinarily waxed or copper plated.  In all other modern cartridges,  the bullet shank is of constant diameter and the case is slightly larger  than the bullet to allow the heel of the latter to fit inside.  This  old fashioned term for this design is "inside lubricated," as the  lubrication grooves of lead bullets are inside of the case.[/FONT]\n  [FONT=Arial]The BB Cap was the first type of rimfire  ammunition.  BB stands for "bullet breech."  It was invented in France  around 1845, designed for the Flobert indoor target rifle.  BB Caps were  designed for shooting gallery use and are seldom encountered these  days, as shooting galleries are now considered politically incorrect by  socialists, tort lawyers, girly men, and liberal politicians.[/FONT]\n  [FONT=Arial]The BB Cap fires a round lead projectile (ball)  powered only by the priming compound in the rim of the case, which is  very short as no powder is used.  The case is just there to hold the  priming compound and bullet together.[/FONT]\n  [FONT=Arial]BB Caps were made in Europe and America until  fairly recently.  The last I saw were made in Germany by RWS who, I  believe, still loads them today.[/FONT]\n  [FONT=Arial]The successor to the BB Cap was the CB Cap.  "CB"  stands for "Conical Bullet."  The CB cap uses a 29 grain round nose lead  bullet and a tiny pinch of powder.  This is also shooting gallery  ammunition.  CCI produces modern CB Cap loads in .22 Short and .22 Long  cases (firearms chambered for the Long Rifle cartridge being far more  common today) for gallery and indoor practice use.  The MV of either is  710 fps.[/FONT]\n  [FONT=Arial]The common .22 Short cartridge dates from 1857.   It is the oldest cartridge still being loaded today.  It was the first  American metallic cartridge, introduced in for the first S&W  revolver, a pocket pistol developed for personal protection.  It was  popular during the American Civil War, carried as personal weapons by  soldiers on both sides.[/FONT]\n  [FONT=Arial]The .22 Short is a development of the BB cap using  a 29 grain round nose (RN) bullet in a lengthened case (compared to the  BB Cap).  It was originally powered by 4 grains of fine black powder  (about FFFFg).  After the advent of smokeless powder, the .22 short was  adapted to the new, cleaner burning propellant.  Although no longer  extremely popular, it is still used all over the world and in the  Olympic games for the rapid fire pistol event.  Modern .22 Short High  Velocity ammunition is loaded to a MV of approximately 1095 fps and ME  of 77 ft. lbs. from a rifle barrel (Remington figures).[/FONT]\n  [FONT=Arial]The .22 Short is a pretty anemic round, and in  1871 a longer case of the same diameter was developed for the 29 grain  Short bullet.  This became the .22 Long cartridge, still occasionally  seen (but obsolescent) today.  The .22 Long was once chambered in a  large number of pistols and rifles.  It was originally loaded with 5.0  grains of very fine black powder and offered about 100+ fps greater  velocity than the .22 Short.  The Long survived the change to smokeless  powder and is still occasionally seen today.  CCI loads their .22 Long  High Velocity ammo to a MV of 1215 fps and ME of 95 ft. lbs.[/FONT]\n  [FONT=Arial]Around 1880 the .22 Extra Long cartridge appeared,  powered by 6.0 grains of black powder.  It fired a 40 grain tapered  heel bullet (the same as the later .22 Long Rifle) at a MV similar to  the Long Rifle, but used a longer case than the .22 LR.  This cartridge  was available in a number of rifles in the late 19th Century.  .22 Extra  Long ammunition was finally discontinued around 1935.[/FONT]\n  [FONT=Arial]In 1887 the Stevens Arms Co. developed the  ultimate in .22 rimfire cartridges, the .22 Long Rifle.  This used the  .22 Long case with a 40 grain RN bullet loaded to higher velocity than  the 29 grain Long bullet.  It shot flatter and hit harder than any of  the previous .22 rimfires except the .22 Extra Long, whose performance  it essentially duplicated in a shorter case, and it was more accurate  than that cartridge.[/FONT]\n  [FONT=Arial]The .22 Long Rifle caught on, was adapted to both  rifles and pistols, and became the most popular sporting and target  shooting cartridge in the world.  After the advent of smokeless powder a  High Velocity version of the .22 LR was introduced, which further  extended the .22 LR''s superiority as a small game hunting cartridge.[/FONT]\n  [FONT=Arial]Modern .22 LR target ammunition is loaded to a MV  of about 1085 fps with a 40 grain RN bullet.  .22 Long Rifle High  Velocity cartridges drive a 40 grain copper-plated bullet at a MV of  1255 fps and ME of 140 ft. lbs. from a rifle barrel.  For small game  hunters, most manufacturers offer a 36-37 grain copper-plated lead  hollow point bullet at about 1280 fps (Remington figures).  This load  expands nicely and makes for quick kills on small game, given proper  bullet placement.[/FONT]\n  [FONT=Arial]Because of its popularity there are many  permutations of the .22 LR cartridge.  One of the more useless is the  .22 LR shot cartridge, which fires a pinch of very fine #12 shot.  This  load is used, among other things, to collect very small creatures, mice  and the like, for museum displays.  This is not a hunting load, as it is  ineffective for use even on very small birds beyond about 10 feet.[/FONT]\n  [FONT=Arial]Far more useful are the Hyper Velocity .22 LR  loads pioneered by CCI in the form of the Stinger.  These use  lightweight hollow point bullets at increased velocity for flatter  trajectory and dramatic expansion.  Remington followed suit with their  famous Yellow Jacket load, and the idea was subsequently picked-up by  most other manufacturers.  The CCI Stinger drives a 32 grain GLHP bullet  at a MV of 1640 fps with 191 ft. lbs. of ME.[/FONT]\n  [FONT=Arial]In 1890 the .22 Winchester Rim Fire (WRF) was  introduced.  This cartridge is loaded with a 45 grain, flat point,  inside lubricated bullet with a full diameter heel, rather than the  tapered heel bullet of the .22 LR.  The .22 WRF fires a .224" diameter  bullet, just like modern centerfire .22s and the later .22 Magnum (WMR).   At one time a 40 grain HP bullet was also available, but it has since  fallen by the wayside.[/FONT]\n  [FONT=Arial]Remington called this cartridge the .22 Remington  Special, and loaded it with a 45 grain RN bullet.  The .22 Rem. Spec.  and .22 WRF are the same cartridge and are interchangeable.[/FONT]\n  [FONT=Arial]The .22 WRF is a good small game cartridge,  superior to the .22 LR.  CCI loads the ammunition, and Winchester does  an occasional run of .22 WRF.  Modern CCI ammo is loaded to a MV of 1300  fps and ME of 169 ft. lbs.[/FONT]\n  [FONT=Arial]Today the .22 WRF is kept alive primarily as a  less destructive small game load for rifles chambered for the .22 WMR  cartridge.  The .22 Magnum is a lengthened version of the .22 WRF and  will chamber in firearms designed for the .22 WMR, much as .38 Special  ammunition may be fired from .357 Magnum guns, although it will not  function correctly in autoloaders.[/FONT]\n  [FONT=Arial]In the early 20th Century a pair of cartridges  about the same size and offering about the same ballistics as the .22 LR  were introduced.  These were designed for use in autoloading rifles,  used smokeless powder and inside lubricated bullets, and in that respect  are a more modern design than the .22 LR.  However, as soon as the  established .22 LR was universally converted to smokeless powder, the  .22 Auto cartridges became superfluous.[/FONT]\n  [FONT=Arial]The .22 Winchester Automatic cartridge was  designed for their Model 1903 autoloading rifle (discontinued in 1932).   Ammo was produced into the 1970''s.  Remington''s .22 Automatic appeared  in their Model 16 autoloader.  That rifle was discontinued in 1928, and  the ammunition was not loaded after the Second World War.  Although  similar, these two cartridges differ dimensionally and are [I]not[/I] interchangeable.[/FONT]\n  [FONT=Arial]Jump to 1959, the year Winchester introduced their  very successful .22 Winchester Magnum Rimfire (WMR).  This cartridge  pushes the limits of pressure possible with a rimfire case given the  limits of contemporary metallurgy.  The .22 Magnum was initially offered  with 40 grain FMJ and JHP bullets at an advertised MV of 2000 fps from a  rifle barrel and 1550 fps from a pistol barrel.  Due to its high  velocity, .22 WMR cartridges are loaded with jacketed bullets.[/FONT]\n  [FONT=Arial]The .22 WMR is based on a lengthened version of  the .22 WRF case, like that cartridge uses standard diameter .224"  inside lubricated bullets, and remains to this day the most powerful .22  rimfire cartridge ever.  It has been adapted to many types and brands  of firearms, and .22 WMR ammunition is loaded by all of the major  rimfire ammunition manufacturers and is very widely distributed.[/FONT]\n  [FONT=Arial]As good as the .22 WMR is as a rifle cartridge, I  feel that it is even better as a revolver cartridge.  It offers velocity  and trajectory similar to the centerfire magnum pistol cartridges at a  fraction of the recoil and cost.  Convertible revolvers, supplied with  both .22 LR and .22 WMR cylinders, are the ultimate in versatility for  plinking, small game hunting, and varmint shooting.[/FONT]\n  [FONT=Arial]Today the .22 WMR is available with bullet weights  ranging from about 30 to 50 grains, and CCI loads a shot shell version.   The standard Winchester 40 grain JHP bullet is now loaded to a rifle  MV of 1910 fps with ME of 324 ft. lbs.  The various 30-40 grain JHP  bullets are best for varmint hunting, but are overly destructive on  small game intended for the dinner table.  A better choice in that case  are the heavier 45-50 grain bullets intended for small game hunting, or  the use of .22 WRF ammo when possible.[/FONT]\n  [FONT=Arial]The .22 WMR is the newest, commercially  successful, .22 rimfire cartridge (so far).  With .22 rimfire cartridges  now available from the BB Cap to the WMR, the field seems pretty well  covered.  Recent rimfire development has concentrated on lighter,  smaller caliber bullets that can achieve higher velocity within the  existing pressure limits.  The .17 HMR, based on a necked-down .22  Magnum case, is the best example.[/FONT]\n  [FONT=Arial]Rimfire cartridge design is limited by the fact  that the brass case rim must be weak enough to be crushed by the blow of  the firing pin.  This severely limits the permissible maximum pressure  and thus the performance of the cartridge.  I suspect that the advent of  more potent .22 rimfire cartridges will depend on the future  development of more advanced case materials. [/FONT]', ''),

(325244, ' [QUOTE=Silent killerr;166510]Then please elaborate, What is the difference between these two.[/QUOTE]\r\n\r\nThere are differences in chamber specs and maximum pressures. The SAMMI/CIP maximum pressure for the .308 Win cartridge is 62,000 psi, while the 7.62x51 max is 50,000 psi. Also, the headspace is slightly different. The .308 Win "Go Gauge" is 1.630" vs. 1.635" for the 7.62x51. The .308''s "No-Go" dimension is 1.634" vs. 1.6405" for a 7.62x51 "No Go" gauge. That said, it is normally fine to shoot quality 7.62x51 NATO ammo in a gun chambered for the .308 Winchester (though not all NATO ammo is identical). Clint McKee of Fulton Armory notes: "[N]obody makes 7.62mm (NATO) ammo that isn''t to the .308 ''headspace'' dimension spec. So 7.62mm ammo fits nicely into .308 chambers, as a rule." You CAN encounter problems going the other way, however. A commercial .308 Win round can exceed the max rated pressure for the 7.62x51. So, you should avoid putting full-power .308 Win rounds into military surplus rifles that have been designed for 50,000 psi max.', ''),

I had to bring in some influence to impress upon the armoury that they can''t get away with ''vanishing'' my grandfather''s gun. I mean its not just about the bloody revolver, its the principle and sentimental value attached to it.\n\n So after a phone call, suddenly the dealer ''found'' the revolver. How convenient was that? He even came to drop it off to our home. I suppose some things just never change. Good old Pakistan!

(325438, ' [QUOTE=mehranbiz;166550]There are differences in chamber specs and maximum pressures. The SAMMI/CIP maximum pressure for the .308 Win cartridge is 62,000 psi, while the 7.62x51 max is 50,000 psi. Also, the headspace is slightly different. The .308 Win "Go Gauge" is 1.630" vs. 1.635" for the 7.62x51. The .308''s "No-Go" dimension is 1.634" vs. 1.6405" for a 7.62x51 "No Go" gauge. That said, it is normally fine to shoot quality 7.62x51 NATO ammo in a gun chambered for the .308 Winchester (though not all NATO ammo is identical). Clint McKee of Fulton Armory notes: "[N]obody makes 7.62mm (NATO) ammo that isn''t to the .308 ''headspace'' dimension spec. So 7.62mm ammo fits nicely into .308 chambers, as a rule." You CAN encounter problems going the other way, however. A commercial .308 Win round can exceed the max rated pressure for the 7.62x51. So, you should avoid putting full-power .308 Win rounds into military surplus rifles that have been designed for 50,000 psi max.[/QUOTE]\n \nThanks for sharing.BTW i have already read this on wiki.', ''),

Luckily, I checked the catalogue and realized that I actually wasn''t missing any washers...one side has one less because it already has a steel plate below which is of the exact same thickness as the washers. I put the gun together a few days back and have been using it since.\r\n\r\nI have to say, it is absolutely devastating! I haven''t tried anything past 70 yards, but even at that distance I was able to take out a pesky kite/eagle that has a habit of attacking anybody who goes to the roof. He''s not going to be doing that anymore! At around 50 yards I''ve been able to take out around two dozen crows within an hour...they just drop and don''t even flinch after they''ve been hit. For this I''ve been using the Gamo Magnum Energy pointed pellets which are 15.89 grains...so its a really crushing shot. \r\n\r\nThe recoilless function is just amazing....I can''t feel a thing when I pull the trigger and the great thing is that I can maintain my view through the scope during the shot and actually watch the target get hit. \r\n\r\nThis morning I set up targets at 25 yards, 50 yards and then at 70 yards. At both 25 yards and 50 yards this weapon was able to provide one hole groups using Crosman Premier''s dome shaped pellets....they are the most accurate pellets I''ve used thus far. At 70 yards I was getting 1 inch groups. All of this was despite strong crosswinds...which I know is quite hard to believe but I wasn''t the one doing the shooting, it was a retired army friend of mine who was zeroing the weapon for me. At 25 yards he was trying to hit a fly that was sitting on the target we set up..and he actually almost hit it....I''ll bet if it wasn''t windy he''d probably be able to hit a fly at that distance. \r\n\r\nI''ve currently got a Nikon Prostaff fixed mag (4x32) scope with an RWS one piece scope mount. The Nikon is on loan from the same friend and I''ll be returning it to him to mount my Hawke Sport 3x9x40. With the Hawke I''ll be able to magnify my targets and try for 100 yards when its not so windy. \r\n\r\nAll in all...this is no doubt the best airgun either I, or anybody I know has owned. I highly recommend it.', ''),

When bullet''s velocity drops below the speed of sound, its trajectory is disturbed.

You''re actually right about the ''corvids''...they''re staying away from my place altogether for the last two days after I dropped a few dozen in the few days before that. With the scope its a lot more fun because I''ve got serious precision which I use to take shots I couldn''t otherwise.  But I do miss the crows...they make such great targets. My friend and I were plinking at roughly 120 yards yesterday and we managed to hit our target twice out of 10 attempts...but that was mainly because our target was very small (an energy saver light bulb) and we were still getting accustomed to the distance and didn''t know how much elevation to give. I don''t know if it was because we were only grazing it or another reason, but though we heard the cling sound of the pellet grazing the bulb...it didn''t break. The bulb was at a friend''s house who bet us on whether we could hit it...so we did win cause breaking the bulb wasn''t part of the bet. At 70 yards it was going all the way through plastic nestle bottles that were completely full of water. In the evening today, I managed to take out the only crow I saw out of my window at roughly 70 yards....almost no elevation adjustment..instant kill as it fell roughly 30 feet straight down from a very tall tree. \r\n\r\nI''m going to take photos and share for sure....after the 1st I''ll make some time to do this properly. I''m going to be ordering a Seben DK Camera Mount along with a video cam so I can take videos of sniping sessions and target practice. The video cam also has a night shot function which give you night vision capabilities...add the extra IR light and you''ve got an awesome piece of kit. \r\n\r\nThe 350 magnum is a killer airgun. I''ve heard great things about it. The difference though would be the recoil....you''ll need to learn the right grip cause apparently that makes a huge difference in accuracy with these high recoil magnum air-rifles. I would say if you enjoy target practice and improving your aim, paying the price for a quality airgun is definitely worth it. My own experience says that you should add a good scope and you''ll enjoy its accuracy and range a LOT more. Don''t buy those cheapo Tasco scopes...get a Hawke or something of that caliber since that''s good quality at a reasonable price.  Also, I''m sure you know this, but make sure you order good pellets from abroad. The selection locally is pathetic and good pellets make all the difference for accurate shooting. \r\n\r\nPics coming soon', ''),

In any case, duties in Pakistan, even if they ask you for them, will not be higher than a couple of thousand rupees.

Its a super powerful airgun and you''ll get some serious range and accuracy with it. I hope you have a nice scope to use with it and a solid one piece scope mount with the proper recoil pins to hold it in place. I bought the Diana 54 a couple of weeks ago from Al Sayad and I paid Pkr 3,500 for transportation to Pakistan via khepia. He didn''t pay any customs or duties, but the guy probably has contacts so thats why. I think you should disassemble it and put it in your luggage and nobody in Pakistan customs will even look at it twice....that is if you even get searched at all. I don''t know about Multan airport, but at the Karachi Airport you could literally walk through with cartons and boxes full of illegal cargo and these guys don''t even stop you.....I know of people who''ve brought through entire cases of alcohol without any prior "setting" and they just walk right through. In my experience, customs in Pakistan is the last thing to worry about. I would advise that you inform your airline in advance though.....PIA is very lenient but other airlines are high troublesome regarding this. In any case, duties in Pakistan, even if they ask you for them, will not be higher than a couple of thousand rupees. I don''t think you need to worry about customs, but maybe rather find out about your airline''s situation with respect to transportation of the airgun. Best of luck and let us know how it handles.[/QUOTE]\r\n \r\nBro can I get the number of your khepia so I can get my gun from Dubai it''s waiting at my friends place.', ''),

A friend in Los Angeles will buy it off eBay and send it to me via courier or anybody who''s travelling in this direction. Its about US$ 44 including shipping to my friend...the cost to me will depend on how much shipping to Pakistan or the UAE is. It''s going to be a long journey, but it will get here eventually.\r\n\r\nThis is the link for the item. \r\n\r\n[url]http://cgi.ebay.com/Seben-DKA2-digital-camera-camcorder-adapter-PC-USB-/380289836137?pt=LH_DefaultDomain_0&hash=item588b0a6469#ht_6570wt_902[/url]\r\n\r\nNext on my list is an IR Laser. I''ve done a little bit of research and if I want to be able to clearly see a target sitting in the middle of a tree or bushes in pitch dark, I need the intensity of an adjustable laser. The options include a Dipol L3 which is ridiculously expensive at over US$ 250 (not incl shipping). Some other options include lasers in Belarus \r\n\r\n[url]http://www.posp.ru/ls.html[/url]\r\n\r\nThese are not as good as the Dipols but they''ve got pretty good results for the price which starts at US$ 60ish including shipping. The one I''m considering is US$ 160...but I''m not sure if that''s a wise use of my money. Still thinking about it and wondering how to go forward. Getting a good laser will mean that it will last and will be usable in the future when and if I decide to upgrade to proper night vision equipment...these lasers are good for use with Sony Night Shot cameras, and Gen 1,2 and 3 NV devices. The pros use Dipol L3....if I can get a good used one, that''s what I''ll buy. \r\n\r\nThe Sony Night Shot cameras are pretty cheap.

The buddy bottle on Rapid is 400ml and is supposed to be able to fire around 400 shots per fill. It has a regulator too, so having a pressure of 300bar or 232 bar makes almost no difference at all. I have been filling and firing using a 232 bar cylinder and the power has been always 11.8ft/lb. I have brought the chrono with me to test and tune my Webley here too.\r\nA few questions for you please brother:\r\n1. Do you fill up just the buddy bottle or the bigger cylinder using your pump?\r\n2. How much effort is it to use this pump, and is a 4 stage pump supposed to be better or worse?\r\n3. How and where to find a 240 bar cylinder, and will it be new or used (in which case it will be risky), and what would be the approx price for the cylinder?\r\n4. I intend to empty the cylinder, then take off the valve from the top so it can be seen that it has absolutely no pressurised air in there and then bring it on the plane.\r\n5. Did you have any problems bringing your logun with you on the plane? (i think it fits in a neat case after dissembling the gun right?)\r\n6. Is it possible to speak to you please? if its ok, then could you PM me your contact number please and I will call you?\r\n\r\nI havent used Nitrogen so far, but from what I read on the forums, people were using it regularly because of the low moisture content. I understand that the air is almost 80% Nitrogen anyway so it shouldnt make too much of a difference. The expanding properties may be slightly different so I am not sure and also not sure how the rubber seals will handle Nitrogen, but as its already there as 80% I thought it may be an alternative. But it would be ideal if I can just find compressed air as thats what the gun is intended for anyway :)\r\n\r\nMany thanks to all of you guys.\r\nGB', ''),

Hunters of our category who have valid hunting permit & arms license are no danger to any wildlife. We who can pay 2k for hunting permit can also pay 4 or 5k for conservation, if  anyone(authority, organization,deptt) takes responsibility and assures better bags, good shooting grounds, growth in wildlife and who can keep a strict check on the other two categories....\n  As mentioned earlier: Hunters who belong to our category are most concerned and most effected by this issue, the other two categories will still hunt even if 10 partridges or 5 urials are left in pakistan.\n \n \n  I always have heard that some gun men in XYZ area were caught by the raid team with 1-9 partridges and were fined heavily. But havent heard any local hunter being caught who wipes out whole coveys sitting at trees at night. Most of partridge population is effected by netting and trapping and surely gunmen are never doing this. \nEven the PWLD officials have given their direct numbers to local duck hunters, so that when ever they see any duck hunter at the bank of river soan they call them. But these locals themselves don’t spare any waterfowl, they don’t let any flock sit at any corner of the bank for more than an hour, these are the ones who hunt everyday of the week without any question.\n  According to the statistics 1 villager carrying a single barrel shot gun with 2 cartridges in his pocket is a killer of more 500 ducks, 50+ surkhabs, and other waterfowl  also (wounded & lost excluded from calculation).\n  Why the deptt is always chasing us instead of real killers?????  \n  We need some one who can stop these two categories, is there anyone  who can do it.', ''),

Other factors are much after these like *sifarishi hunters who hunt illegally *habitat destruction or preservation *not monitoring limits of hunted birds by authorities etc. And let me add, a repeater does not assure more birds killed. Its just a personal preference. I am myself very comfortable with repeater than double barrel because of its handling and easier sighting. And I seldom fire more than three cartridges, and mostly 80% just two.\r\n\r\nI''ve a feeling that the dept just tries to cover their own weaknesses & loopholes by announcing silly restrictions.

(326821, ' [QUOTE=Jillanik;167242]The interesting thing is that some hunters use newspaper or shoppers as decoys for geese hunt. Can some one throw light on it.[/QUOTE]\n \nDear Jillani Bhai,    thats not an amazing thing. Buying a bunch of decoys can prove to be expensive. Hunters have learned that using inexpensive items such as trash bags and even paper plates for decoys is just as effective as store-bought plastic decoys. The best way to make a homemade goose decoy is by tying an ordinary white plastic grocery bag to a stake.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS\n1\nOpen the bag up and set a wadded up piece of newspaper in one corner. Twist the bag around twice, holding the corner in place. This will form the head. An ideal size for the head should be just less than the size of your fist.\n2\nTie off the corner using a garbage bag wire tie.\n3\nFill the rest of the bag with newspaper until the bag becomes about the size of a regulation NFL football, then twist the bag and tie off the end using a plastic wire tie.\n4\nMake about two dozen of these decoys, then take them out to your hunting spot and stake them to the ground using available sticks. An ideal stick to use would be about 10 inches long. Drive the stick into the ground until its about 3 inches deep, then set the decoy body on top of the stick and push down until it punctures the bag and holds it in place. \n\n[B][COLOR="red"][B]PVC STICK DECOYS[/B][/COLOR][/B] \n\nJillani Bhai one of my friend is making PVC Stick decoys for me. I bought Rudy Shelduck decoys per pair 450.rupees, good thing is you can order the duck pose as you required. \n\nI used, and the result is more than expectation. Another favorable element is you can carry 100 decoys pouch in one hand very easily, its waterproof, light weight and long life with light weight.\nTomorrow I will post the pictures of stick decoys.', ''),

Returned home from Lahore a day before New Year, with my latest &#8220;goodie&#8221; item of the year, the [B]RAMI 2075 D[/B], for the completion of my CCW [B]SD[/B] requirement &#8211;[I] at least for now, hopefully[/I]! \n\nHad since long been suffering from an &#8220;itching&#8221; [I]crave[/I] for something [I]carry-able[/I] in the popular low recoil 9mm parabellum caliber for routine carry, and to [I]mate[/I] it up with my cal .45 CCW [I]PT 145[/I].\n\nThe Rami 2075 D is one beautiful small wonder by itself, the most solidly built subcompact handgun I&#8217;ve ever had and felt in my bare hands, and though I paid above the average price for it, I&#8217;m still content to have availed it, believing, it may be better late than never, since you all know of our local-market instabilities.\n\nA review of the RAMI is due anytime soon in the second part of this thread, firing both with FMJ&#8217;s and JHP&#8217;s, so stay tuned here for news, looking forward to present you with both vids and pics, as soon as weather is just a little bit better.\n\nThough the RAMI is no longer a new item amongst us and has been portrayed before also by senior members, I still thought I should share my [I]Power Duo[/I] with you, [I][B]for comparison purposes mainly[/B][/I], since, on homecoming, I found both handguns stunningly similar in dimensions, and the [B]PT 145[/B] has been a rather popular CCW amongst us so far - before this little beast of a CZ hit our local markets with it&#8217;s dashing appearance, [I]impact radiance[/I],  and outstanding performance as per senior member reviews.\n\nAs of such, and before the &#8220;eye candy&#8221; is presented further below in this thread, following are the details of these two CCW&#8217;s, as you can see, [I]quite a duo of twins[/I]:\n\n[I][COLOR="red"]Caliber[/COLOR][/I]:\n\nTaurus PT 145   : [B].45 ACP[/B]\nCZ RAMI 2075 D: [B]9X19[/B]\n\n[I][COLOR="red"]Capacity[/COLOR][/I]\n\nTAURUS PT 145 :  [B]10+1[/B]\nCZ RAMI 2075 D:  [B]10+1[/B] ( optional 14+1)\n\n[I][COLOR="red"]Weight[/COLOR][/I]:\n\nTAURUS PT 145 :  [B]22.2 oz[/B]\nCZ RAMI 2075 D:  [B]24.5 oz[/B]\n\n[COLOR="red"]Barrel Length[/COLOR]:\n\nTAURUS PT 145 : [B]3.25"[/B]\nCZ RAMI 2075 D: [B]3.00"[/B]\n\n[I][COLOR="red"]Overall Length[/COLOR][/I]:\n\nTAURUS PT 145 : [B]6.12"[/B]\nCZ RAMI 2075 D: [B]6.50"[/B]\n\n[I][COLOR="red"]Width[/COLOR][/I]:\n\nTAURUS PT 145 : [B]1.25"[/B]\nCZ RAMI 2075 D: [B]1.30"[/B]\n\n[I][COLOR="red"]Height[/COLOR][/I]:\n\nTAURUS PT 145 : [B]5.12"[/B]\nCZ RAMI 2075 D: [B]4.7 "[/B]\n\n[COLOR="red"]Prices[/COLOR]:\n\nTAURUS PT 145 : [B]60-65K[/B] (If available)\nCZ RAMI 2075 D : [B]118K[/B] (Variable between 100-120K)\n\nAs you may have judged, apart from the difference in calibers, the physical dimensions are [I]quite[/I] identical, major difference being in the height department, where the PT 145 is a fair bit taller. The RAMI, however, with the 14 shots mag coupled, brings itself fully at par with the PT 145 here also, being much better concealable with the 10 shots mag( Perfect for my hands, watch below).\n\nThe pair was simply born for mating and with these two in hands, I''m quite satisfied with this department for now, enabling me to move on to the larger framed guns.

(327017, ' Thanks to Adil for sharing this with us.\n\nI''m not really a shotgun guy but I''ve seen much better copies of Pakistani made Holland and Holland. One or two even have the distinction of excelling the factory itself in the workmanship of the wood. \n\nThe one pictured above is a half decent copy but as far as I''m aware even with Holland and Holland copies they are over 3 qualities. Prices for the above kind of quality cost around Rs. 50,000 and an A grade copy with genuine serial numbers would cost around Rs. 250,000. \n\nThe name escapes me but this gunsmith in K.P used to make them with a 3/6 month waiting period and his craftsman ship was flawless. Used to charge 250,000+.\n\nBtw Akram in Lahore (when he wants to and is sufficiently compensated for) does magic with wood that would do Holland and Holland proud. \n\nOur gun industry is sadly still at the cottage stage. If PHASDC was actually serious and did something instead of taking free trips to  Las Vegas and Europe on the pretext of promotion of the local gun  industry we would actually get somewhere. The funds that they waste their, if put toward buying new machinery and training our local gunsmiths Pakistan would be the Number 1 in the world in hand crafted weapons.', ''),

POF mp series being produced for the armed forces of Pakistan is nearly as good as the one being produced in Germany by H&K, believe it or not, but the special services group of Pakistan Army uses the mp series most of the times and its a class of its own.\n\n2ndly regarding this particular weapon, i am just puzzled what good is it? i mean practically speaking if its not automatic, its useless, you have to understand that the weapon is used for close personal security where VIPs are guarded even when going to a bathroom, so the weapon calibre and performance have to be lethal yet it should be some thing too overly audible, visible and heavy calibrated, because in a close proximity no one would want to use a large calibre weapon because of several reasons, this weapon is basically meant for security personal that too would frankly speaking look good on a guy wearing a jacket and a tie, i cant have my guard AKA khoro khan baba wear a jeans haha let alone a jacket, and it would look like a toy gun in his hand since he is 6"2. \n\nmy final point would be that in this price range one can get any good handgun, obviously you can''t conceal it in your trouser or wear it in a holster, so why buy this in the first place?[/QUOTE]\nI understand you point of view regarding its use but i dont understand that why would pof do all the effort to use cheap materials in this semi version.', ''),

(334719, 'A Simple Way to Remove FTF/FTE I have seen some users struggling and using unnecessary force while trying to remove FTF/FTE, in my opinion it is  dangerous to play like that when you are dealing with the live ammo.\r\n\r\nThere is a simple and rather effortless way to solve the problem and could be helpful for new users \r\n\r\nFirst step is to lock the slide manually by pushing the slide-lock up while pulling the slide back, in either Case FTF/FTE.\r\n\r\nIn first scenario, the FTF (half feed),  while the slide is manually locked, just push the round back in the mag from neck ring with any hard object i.e. screw driver, key, knife etc and remove the mag and rest the round. \r\n\r\nYou can also use your finger but in this case, don''t trust the slide lock with your finger in the ejection port, as a little backward push/movement of slide will release the slide lock (and it is not a good scenario if you need your finger),therefore, it is a good practice to hold the slide firmly against frame with one hand and keep the slide lock pushed up with thumb of same hand while removing problem.\r\n\r\nIn second FTF scenario,the round completely fed/seated but the ejector is not engaged (head is not seated in the slide properly),lock the slide, remove the mag and tilt the gun (chamber side) down, the round will fall with out any effort or a little taping may help, (in this case if you fire, the round may fire but it can damage the ejector and cause the FTE and double feed).\r\n\r\nIn case of FTE either by failed engagement or damaged ejector, there is always second half fed round round in the way pushing the un ejected case.\r\n\r\nThe procedure is same, lock the slide, push back the half fed round in the mag, remove the mag and need a little effort to remove the empty case with any hard object as the case of fired round always expands and stuck in the chamber.\r\n\r\nHere are some simulated illustrations.\r\n\r\nFTF\r\n[IMG]http://i931.photobucket.com/albums/ad156/abbas437/common/FTF.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\nEjector not engaged\r\n[IMG]http://i931.photobucket.com/albums/ad156/abbas437/common/EjectorNotEngaged.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\nFTE\r\n[IMG]http://i931.photobucket.com/albums/ad156/abbas437/common/DoubleFeed.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\nSlide lock\r\n[IMG]http://i931.photobucket.com/albums/ad156/abbas437/common/SlideLock.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\nRemoval\r\n[IMG]http://i931.photobucket.com/albums/ad156/abbas437/common/Pushingback.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i931.photobucket.com/albums/ad156/abbas437/common/Tilt.jpg[/IMG]', ''),

It has a slightly larger wing area for its weight than other geese, which is believed to help the goose fly at high altitudes\nThe Bar-headed Goose migrates over the Himalayas to spend the winter in parts of India (from Assam to as far south as Tamil Nadu]), Northern Burma and the wetlands of Pakistan. The winter habitat of the Bar-headed Goose is cultivated fields, where it feeds on barley, rice and wheat, and may damage crops. The bird can fly the 1000-mile migration route in just one day as it is able to fly in the jet stream. Birds from Kyrgyzstan have been noted to stopover in western Tibet and southern Tajikistan for 20 to 30 days before migrating further south. Some birds may show high wintering site fidelity.\n\n[B][U][COLOR="red"]GREYLAG  GEESE[/COLOR][/U][/B]\nThe Graylag is the largest and bulkiest of the grey geese. It has a rotund, bulky body, a thick and long neck, and a large head and bill. It has pink legs and feet. \nThe geese are migratory, moving south or west in winter, but Scottish breeders, some other populations in northwestern Europe, and feral flocks are largely resident. This species is one of the last to migrate, and the "lag" portion of its name is said to derive from this lagging behind other geese\nThis species is found throughout the Old World, apparently breeding where suitable localities are to be found in many European countries, although it no longer breeds in southwestern Europe. Eastwards it extends across Asia to China. In North America. England, Scotland Norway,  there are both feral domestic geese, which are similar to graylags.  \n\n[B][U][COLOR="red"]CANADIAN GEESE[/COLOR][/U][/B]\nThe first citation for the ''Canada Goose'' dates back to 1772. The Cackling Goose was formerly considered to be a set of subspecies of the Canada Goose.\nThis specimen is the largest wild goose ever recorded of any species. The Canada Goose also eats grains such as wheat, beans, rice, and corn when they are available. In the water, it feeds from silt at the bottom of the body of water. It also feeds on aquatic plants, such as seaweeds\nThe Canada Goose is a wild goose, which is native to arctic and temperate regions of North America, This species is native to North America. It breeds in Canada and the northern United States in a variety of habitats. Its nest is usually located in an elevated area near water such as streams, lakes, ponds and sometimes on a beaver lodge. Its eggs are laid in a shallow depression lined with plant material and down. The Great Lakes region maintains a very large population of Canada Geese.\n\n[B][U][COLOR="red"]MUTE WHITE SWAN[/COLOR][/U][/B]\nThe Mute Swan  is a species of swan, and thus a member of the duck, goose and swan family. It is native to much of Europe and Asia, and (as a rare winter visitor) the far north of Africa. It is also an introduced species in North America, Australasia and southern Africa. The name ''mute'' derives from it being less vocal than other swan species. Measuring 125 to 170 centimeters in length, this large swan is wholly white in plumage with an orange bill bordered with black. It is recognizable by its pronounced knob atop the bill.\n\n[B][U][COLOR="red"]TRUMPETER WHITE SWAN [/COLOR][/U][/B]\nThe Trumpeter Swan, is the largest native North American bird, if measured in terms of weight and length, and is (on average) the largest living waterfowl species on earth. It is the North American counterpart of the European Whooper Swan. Males (also known as Cobs) typically measure from 145 to 163 centimeters (57 to 64 in) and weigh 11.8 kilograms (26 lb); females typically range from 139 to 150 centimeters (55 to 59 in) and weigh 13 kilograms (29 lb).', ''),

Their preferred breeding habitat is wetland, but semi-domesticated birds will build a nest anywhere close to water.

If we want to go for some solution or suggestion to some issues, first thing we opt should be positive frame of mind and patience. Personal grudges or agendas never result fruitish. \r\n\r\nEveryone has right to explain his view point but not to impose on others. One can agree or disagree and add some positive in it too. For example, i appriciate @TR, who always portrays his point with more eleborations to convience imicably, rather going to extreme extent.\r\n\r\nEvery forum has all kind of hunters and a hunter can be ethical or unethical, conservationalist or devistating but its not responsibilty of the forum admin to distinguish, however, policy matters. \r\n\r\nThere are number of hunters at every forum who violates the rules, we also have many here but it doesn''t mean we held PG responsible for such acts. Similarly, pointing out any forum is not a healthy way. If someone has some personal equation with some people there or have negitive agenda with some other forums they must not discuss them to other. These cammunals are meant to consolidate ppl, who are devoted for same casue i.e. hunting.\r\n\r\nConservation and ethical hunting is a common casue, our collective efforts are needed to safeguard our mutual intrest, despite raising fingers to individuals.\r\n\r\nLets be creative and discuss with open heart.

In fact, I doubt there''s a clone anywhere in main market Lahore, RWP, unless you visit Ravi Road dealers in LHR and Fawara Chowk dealers in RWP. That is why I was asking for your location, to better guide you.\n\nFinally, a 40K budget may need to be increased a bit for a NIB Stoeger, again depending on your location. The weapon itself is such a nice, reliable thing, and a "[I]sense and feel[/I]" of a Beretta so much, that I just can''t imagine letting it go, even after my recent handgun, the Rami, fulfills the very CC purpose excellently, for which the Stoeger was initially acquired, yet let''s see.\n\nIn order to confine ourselves to the very issue of this thread, let me humbly add, the 917 Taurus has no reliable feedbacks here, I''d suggest the PT 99 first, then the CZ-999. \n\nRegards.', ''),

(327537, ' [B]ONLY SOLUTION LEFT [/B]                 DATE: 15/12/2010 (SAME POST)\r\n\r\nWe have worked over the concept of private game reserves and promoted it at various levels. As far as poaching is concerned it will never finish. \r\n\r\nPrivate Game Reserves is a good idea but I oppose this concept now because a common hunter will be totally out of game after promoting this concept and this is not a long lasting solution. The people who can afford or have some direct relation and influence will always facilitated and common hunter which I consider from lower middle class will just dream a good game ever. The owner when find any fruitful idea about his land, he will wrap the whole concept. The way we are harvesting the crops soon we will hardly see any area for habitat. It&#8217;s hard to find Baila, marshes, koonder, wetlands even at border belts these days. \r\n\r\nIs there any solution???? This is the question we all are thinking about and find no permanent solution yet. \r\n\r\nYes, one of them I want to share here. This is not just dream but the sole solution to save game forever and also our right as a citizen of Islamic Republic of Pakistan. which will not just save the game forever but equal level of playing field will be available for all categories of hunters.\r\n\r\nIn each district of Pakistan Government allocate lands for habitats. For example Punjab has around 36 districts and each district should have at least some land like 2000 acres 2-4 pieces in the suburbs which will be allocated just for hunting purpose only and declared sanctuary. Some of them should be for upland and few for migrated birds as resting areas, if area is specifically not suitable for any of them allocate this area to other. We have enough land in our beloved country to allocate at least 2 areas must be earmark otherwise no wildlife will be around in coming 5-10 years.\r\n\r\nHunting in said areas will be strictly banned and administration will be a mix of people from public sector, wild life Department and each hunter of the area which carries valid WLD hunting permits. I assure you when true stakeholders will be added they will never allow illegal hunting at any level. Heaviest fine and imprisonment should be result if any hunting activity (with or without weapon) observed in this area.\r\n\r\nThese areas will populate the whole Pakistan again, I tell you.\r\n\r\nIf 100 pair of partridge gains time for one year in next 3-4 year they will be in millions (I had a calculation which is missing right now about per season growth of pheasants and partridges). Same like if migrated birds should find any resting area they will migrate here to a greater number and every water pond will be rich with all migrated species which will provide game for every hunter. \r\n\r\nThis is the only solution left to save the wildlife forever in our beloved homeland. Without Government contribution no other solution will be permanent. We have to raise this slogan at all levels. All hunting communal should have atleast one common agenda otherwise we will be here just to talk memories soon. Its time for a wake up call, write latter to authorities, take electronic media on board and share your idea to maximum possible excess. \r\n\r\nI am sure if we collectively go for it, we will win.', ''),

Armscor Ammo by itself is a little inaccurate as compare to the other Ammo mentioned above.. the most accurate was S&B FMJ followed by Prvi Partizan JHP.. as far as Winchester Ammo was concerned, infact its almost 30 years old stalk but still more accurate than Armscor.. may be I wish if the new stalk arrives, it will certainly outperfom the others.. actually in accuracy department it depends on the handgun primarily but it also depends on which Ammo you use.. does''t lay my hands on [B]Magtech[/B] despite a thorough market search.. I have heard good things about this Ammo as well.\r\n\r\nIn .45ACP we don''t have many choices of Ammo as compare to 9mm.. I wish with the arrival of .45 pistols, different variety of .45 Ammo should hit the market.', ''),

Excessive rains also damage population to great extent. Partridges will be finished soon if it continued in same fashion. We can hardly stop anybody but yes voluntarily. \r\n\r\nLets have a factual analysis, if we have courage to face realities :-\r\n\r\nOnly for partridge.... why??? .... We should also think what is happening around ...... look around facebook, orkut, and other sites where a greatest massacre of geese hunting can be seen these days&#8230;.. Over hundreds birds bags and all is being done under the shelter of Rangers & PWLD. However, ppl reporting Chanab, dadyal, ravi etc. but reality is different, we all know Its almost impossible to enter double figure in open areas &#8230;&#8230;.. Till date all bag''s reported are scored in border belt ............. Just Might is Right &#8230;&#8230;&#8230; Jiska Hath Par Gaya koi muafi nahi janab\r\n\r\nDG rangers Major G. Yaqoob transferred yesterday and Major G. Nawaz has taken charge, sources claimed border violation was also one of the reason for change &#8230;.. Not much sure about this change but now bags will be under limits and we hardly see any bag entering double figure now. \r\n\r\nJust a chance is needed for every hunter including me. We forget every rule or principle when opportunity strikes us. We can just debate about code of ethics we can hardly stop ourself when a chance is available rather it is a game reserves, sanctuaries close tehsil&#8217;s or border belts. Every area and authority is available for sale, some due to influence and others with Baba Quaid-e-Azam, we r ready for both. Afterwards we are delivering speeches at code of ethics and raising fingers to others. Even after being confiscated sometime by some authorities, we have never change our habits. \r\n\r\nReality is that as a nation we are surrounded is corruption and it has penetrated in each aspect of our lives. Only ALLAH can \r\nchange us all.\r\n ...............[/QUOTE]\r\n \r\nFirst point you stated here, partridge netting is discussed repeatedly many times here on this forum but the point is to get the issue across to authorities in whose hands is the actual power to curb it ... and then do something actual ON GROUND, not by making silly policies in offices. Wildlife presevervation is more of a GROUND WORK than office desk job issuing papers.\r\n\r\nSecond, DG Rangers transfer has no link with wildlife thing, rather these matters are of insignificance with respect to hunting matters at such senior level offices. Tenure had exceeded the allotted time, simple, time for new boss to take seat. Even if he allows hunting now, main thing for the new rangers boss would be he should maintain equilibrium in relation to hunted wildlife numbers rather than allowing shooting of such crazy figures (100+, 200+ etc) by some hunters including this conservation organization CHAP''s admin/head(s). From the same place (Narowal), there are many pictures floating on internet and private emails with hog deer and geese, and sorry to say, hunters have clearly identified CHAP management and founding members in them. But if you still wish to deny it or justify it by saying : ''Not them only, but every individual here in this country is an opportunist and a cheat'', it is your choice.\r\n\r\nThirdly, you have generalised the issue and merged it at national level  ! Every problem identification cannot be justified by a GENERIC answer like "We as a nation are a bunch of corrupt people" like you implied. I am on the other hand pinpointing a grave issue .... If XYZ (say 400 or 800 or 2000) members join such CONSERVATION organizations, with a lot of conservation frenzy and preaching going around by the organization head(s) ...not mentioning you or any specific person ...and the very same people (the admin or management) indulge THEMSELVES in illegal hunting of banned species etc ... why & how would anybody in relevant government departments listen to hunters in general??? They would simply tell us on face your organisation is just an eye-wash and a facade. If I were in there shoes, I would certainly tell them to mend their ways first before demanding favors for hunters or talking about wildlife conservation. I hope you get the point?\r\n\r\nAnd as I said, in USA too major conservation work was done by hunters (genuine, motivated ones) working in close liaison with law enforcement depts and wildlife commissions of respective areas.', ''),

If i got any info regarding one for sell than will let you know. I have seen only two lightweight commanders, and two standard comanders till now in the market (affordable i mean). I like lightweight commanders more. These are a couple of years old pictures. I have switched back to the origional grips which were Pachmayr signature series. Pachmayr Signature Grips feature full wrap-around design and are made from rubber specially formulated for use on semi-automatic pistols. This rubber compound gives them a feel that is typical of Pachmayr. Built-in steel inserts are there to ensure they maintain their shape.\r\nHolster for the gun is Galco fully lined with silicone suede FED Paddle one. This holster offers a lightweight open-welt design that is tension screw adjustable. Stitched sight rails, a reinforced thumb break retention strap, and combat grip accessibility.', ''),

Dark brown patches could mean rust, but it could also be cosmoline (a type of grease for long term storage. The best way to tell is to smell.) I use Bore Tech Eliminator to clean out the copper and carbon that gets trapped between the layers of copper inside the barrel. Here is a review on the product: [url]http://www.700rifle.com/bore_tech.php[/url] . With the barrel clean you want to look down the bore for indicators of uneven/excessive wear. Use good light and move the light slightly so you don''t get fooled by shadows.\r\nPitting: These are tiny little holes or craters in the bore. They look like little speckles.\r\nFrosting: Just like it says, it looks like frost. Easier to see in the grooves.\r\nErosion: Look at the lands in the barrel. They need to be well defined, sharp edges, crisp. With wear the edges become rounder. In the first few inches of the barrel, look for what looks like tiny scales. Like when mud dries and cracks. This is called throat erosion, and indicates that the rifle is ready for a new barrel.\r\nOverall: Look for dark spots and rough patches.\r\n\r\nWhile a certain amount of wear is inevitable in a 60-70 year old rifle, most of them were carried more than shot when they were military weapons. The period after they were demilitarised is where they were most likely to be exposed to excessive wear and improper storage. The age of a rifle does not neccesarily indicate heavy use. I have a Swiss Schmidt Rubin rifle that was made in 1896, and the bore is excellent. I would guess that it has had less than 500 rounds through it in over 100 years.\r\n\r\nIf I can help my brothers in arms with info, just ask. If I don''t know, I''ll tell you.\r\n\r\nI still feel the pain from buying a worn-out rifle when I was young and knew everything.', ''),

(328237, ' [QUOTE=Enigmatic Desires;166115]There are various &#8220;non-lethal weapons&#8221; around designed for fast but temporary incapacitation of an assailant/s. These include teargas rounds/rubber bullets/stun guns/tasers etc.\n\nWhile I have yet to see a real taser  here. There are lots of stun guns mostly of Chinese make in gun shops all over the country. \n\nThe most common ones look and work like torches with a couple of tiny electrodes on the tip. They range in size from 8 inches to humongous 2 feet units and are equipped with rechargeable batteries. The most common ones are around a foot long \n\nIt takes about 20 hours to generate a full charge. A full charge can produce a really nasty crackling arc for around 90 seconds while the torch will function for about a couple of hours of continuous operation. How ever the torch will function fine long after the stun unit has run out of power. \n\nThe main switch is the same as any conventional torch and indeed has the same application i.e. switching the torch on an off. Just like most torches the stun gun versions also have the little red signal button mounted on top of the switch .With the only difference being that the little red signal button actually powers the stun gun. \n\nPop the accessory black cap on the electrodes and there is no way u can differentiate it from any other torch! It also has a black carrying case which can be strapped on a belt.\n\nAs regards power output the instruction manual usually has a 1 or a 5 followed by a mind-boggling number of Zeros. I am almost 100 % sure that these are gross exaggerations especially  since the English of the manual may as well be Chinese. \n\nHaving the arc touch your body is a singularly unpleasant experience. It will drop a normal man (5.7 12 inch unit) and have him immobilized till the weapon is removed from his person. The twin electrodes leave residual burn marks for a few days and a tingling sensation for a few hours. \n\nThe price of a typical 12 inch &#8216;torch&#8217; ranges from Rs. 10,000   in Karachi to Rs. 600-800 for the same unit in Peshawar&#8217;s Karkhano bazaar.\n\nI have been trying to find pics but I could not find any on the main search engines while the unit I had I gave away to my friend&#8217;s wife.[/QUOTE]\n \nGenerous of you to give away such a thing to your friends wife as ladies should carry that around. My wife carries one with her all times alongwith her .22 revolver. The sight & sound of the discharge is scary for the assailant even if not so effective in application. I bought 4 units from Rwp with prices ranging from PKR 6000-9000. I do agree upon the power exaggeration of the voltages. Mine lasts for 3mins continous discharge. A little advice for you, get the capacitor of your Stun-Gun changed to a higher Amp and the batteries to CR123 and you will see a considerable difference in its power.This would cost you under PKR1000. Trust me, I tried all mine on myself and friends and the modified one is ''non-lethal'' in a very lethal way! \nI am currently in the process of importing a lot of StunGun models from China and will inform the forums as soon as I have them. I am putting up a pic of the 3 small versions and will put up the large modified one as I am currently changing its casing from plastic to metal! Do pray for me! lol\nRegards\n[IMG]http://i1200.photobucket.com/albums/bb340/Almuharib/Ultimate%20Survival%20Kit/StunGuns.jpg[/IMG]', ''),

I have observed my self that population of Pigeons and Doves has decreased in my area, that is why ban is imposed here.\r\n\r\nWe use all types of wepeons usually used for hunting all over the world you can say.\r\n\r\nShot gun Cartridges which are normally used by Hunters are Pakistani made with brand name Shaheen.

These are intelligent birds and ducks knows its easy to get tehm in such conditions, so hardly any moment observed during days.\r\n\r\nAnother factor which counts a lot is moon positioning, during low moon ducks starts arriving right after mughrib Aazaan at feeding spots but during high moon, it can be late than mid night.\r\n\r\nI have already wrote in Dr. hanif''s post that he should try in the evening around some marshes, he will get his shares.

Ducks are not crazy that they must flew in the morning for nothing because Migration has taken place and ducks are settled where they have find the places to fed during the night so no need to travel unnecessarily.\r\nWe can hardly find any duck during this stipulated time which is feeding somewhere, usually, she rests in safe waters or enjoys at river beds which are byound reach.', ''),

(328471, ' [QUOTE=Prince;167960]@TR bro, you always come with answers too, i blv you are just kidding otherwise you are much more experienced than anyone ..........\n\nAnyhow, yes, ducks move in the nights these days and i have seen them in thousands in late night at KUNDIAN (chasma adjacent area). These are intelligent birds and ducks knows its easy to get tehm in such conditions, so hardly any moment observed during days.\n\nAnother factor which counts a lot is moon positioning, during low moon ducks starts arriving right after mughrib Aazaan at feeding spots but during high moon, it can be late than mid night.\n\nI have already wrote in Dr. hanif''s post that he should try in the evening around some marshes, he will get his shares. The sole reason behind the mind was same which i narreted here.\n\nFurhtermore, during the period, which i mentioned in my previous post, the days without fog or misty conditions may also have very rare moment.\nFor me its period which mainly concerned to their moment. Ducks are not crazy that they must flew in the morning for nothing because Migration has taken place and ducks are settled where they have find the places to fed during the night so no need to travel unnecessarily.\nWe can hardly find any duck during this stipulated time which is feeding somewhere, usually, she rests in safe waters or enjoys at river beds which are byound reach.[/QUOTE]\n \n\nDear Prince Bhai: with oath I can say I never kidding or immature act done by me with hunters even junior either senior. Because; hunting is my only and one hobby.\n\n I adopted the hunting from my grandfathers/uncles and at the same time I learnt, observe and absorbed the hunting knowledge from other hunters plus by my fields excursions. \nBut still I am student; for example if I am visiting a spot for any game since 20 years doesn&#8217;t matter but nature is showing me total different education and signs at my every visit. Really I gained many things by your posts.\n\nYar G; I am serious one and remember don&#8217;t take my appreciations, post replies and questions in kidding acts. \nI shot Rudy Shelduck in full moon at 2:30.am in Dec and many shoots till 10-11.pm. Ducks I shot till 9-10.pm many times in full moon. \n\nRudu Shelduck is my favorite game specie because you need an extra skill to deceive this bird comparatively all other ducks (especially at day time).\n I have deep study and practical experience about Rudy Shelduck since long time. But till now I have many questions, which need to be further studies.\n\nI never remembered any good shoot in foggy weather. But in cloudy weather with light winds I have many good shoots in my hunting carrier.\nEven in the bad stories of current game season; on 25 Dec-2010 I spread mixed decoys of Rudy Shelduck plus Pintails, Mallard and Teal decoys on main River. \n\nWeather was cloudy/misty At 5:30.am I was settled in hide but movement saw at 9.am, than till 12:15.pm there was movement of 2-3 to plus dozens of ducks time by time, Rudy Shelduck and Cormorants were roaming in the area. I took first shot at 9:30 and bag was 2 Rudy Shelduck, Common Crane and 3 teals.', ''),

(328615, 'O/U shotguns problems I have recently bought brand new Turkish O/U shotgun. The gun is a beautiful weapon, but has a problem that the top barrel does not fire. I have taken up the case with the manufacturers and hope that I will be provided a new weapon and therefore  I have intentionally not mentioned the name of the weapon. If they do n ot honour their commitments then I will inform the whole forum of  the name of the manufacturer.\n \nAt present I want to ask all the O/U shoth gun owners that did anyone else have this problem with their weapon. Gunsmiths in town inform me that it is a common problem even in very high quality weapons.\n \nThe worst thing that I experienced was that not a single gunsmith could diagnose the  actual problem. All they could suggest were measures which could have solved the problem but not correct the actual problem.\n \nThe problem in my gun was that the hammers had been installed incorrectly i.e. the left hammer was installed on rigth side and vice e versa. The result of this change was that the hammer face was not flush or at 90degrees to the firing pins. Thus the whole thrust was not tranfered and the pin strike was not sufficient to fire the cartridge. \n \nThis problem could be observed simply by looking at the hammers, but what a pity, none of the gunsmiths in town would agree or could notice this fact even when they were shown the hammers. They insisted that you simply change the springs and the gun will fire. Therefore, per force I changed the hammer my self and then made the gun fire both barrels. only then they accepted my diagnosis. \n \nSo any owner having a similar problem,  do look at the hammers before simply changing or putting a harder spring.', ''),

(328629, ' [QUOTE=PA;168120]@ak 47\n[B]Would you please explain single and double action and their advantages[/B][/QUOTE]\n \n[B]@PA[/B]..........Bro, the CZ RAMI 2075 is both DA/SA. So is the PT 145, but in a different way.\n\nThe Rami is traditional DA/SA mode, hence, in case of a "dud-fire" (misfire) on first strike, you can strike the same round over an over, without having to rack the gun or extract the round, just keep pulling the trigger, the hammer is cocked, activated each time, by spring mechanism.\n\nFirst pull (DA) is heavier than the subsequent pulls(SA), and the gun goes from DA mode to SA mode after 1.st fire, as long as your ammo is working fine. In case of misfire, you''re back to the heavy DA pull.\n\nAnother benefit of the DA/SA mode is, that if you like to carry cocked and locked, you neither need to rack the gun, nor pull the hammer back for a fire, just aim and pull your trigger, when needed. Hence, shorter reacting time.\n\nWith SA guns, like the Tokarev TT (30 bore) or the 1911 Colt, you first have to either rack the slide( if unchambered), or at least pull the hammer back(if chambered). Course, there''s the option of moving around with hammer cocked on the 1911, since the grip safety is still there, as an extra and unique feature. When there would be a misfire in Single Action only handguns, you can''t strike the same round again, and will have to extract the un-fired round.\n\nThe PT 145, however, is DA/SA in a different way. The internal striker is activated when you rack the gun to feed a round, and since there''s no decocker on the PT 145, the gun is always in SA mode, with a round chambered. Hence, first shot with the PT 145 is always SA, whereas, with the Rami and other external hammer guns, first chambered shot is DA, unless, you pull the hammer back manually.\n\nThe double action in PT 145 begins when there''s a dud-fire, and you can keep pulling the trigger and strike till round is fired. Generation 2, however, of PT 145 was all DA only. The one portrayed here is Gen. 3 and DA/SA both.\n\nMay I say, some people prefer extracting the un-fired round, rather than keep trying to fire it. Also, in my opinion, a round that doesn''t go off with first two strikes, may not make it in the subsequent ones as well!\n\nI hope I managed to reply your question.\n\nRegards.', ''),
(328630, ' [B]@Aquarius[/B].......Thanks , Sir, well, if round was weakly indented, you may be right, Sir, about the weaker hammer, but may I add, at times residue within firing- pin area, also gives "soft" primer strikes, even if hammer hit is strong enough, and results in failure to fires.\n\nI also hope, that newer ones have improved.\n\nRegards.', ''),

As I have read across Internet that this stance reveal shooter''s body to be the target.\r\n\r\nAs for the SD scenario I think that Weaver stance is better because it is less revealing and you can easily switch positions, and I have read that LEAs use this stance and above all, Col. Jeff Cooper loved it!\r\n\r\nSo, Please share your thoughts and experiences, also please tell me if I am right in practicing Weaver more (or any other stance you think is better), as some of my friends suggest that I should only practice my SD stance.

So your whole side is unprotected. Many people have been killed this way beside wearing the vest.

During day time provide direct sunlight to your birds for some time they are capable to store this heat for that night.\r\n\r\nand a good tip, in winters do not keep their water dish inside the cage over night, its always better to provide them fresh water on daily basis in day time.\r\n\r\nSome Tips Other than Ka_khan''s wish, may be helpful for new hobbyist : P\r\n\r\nfurther vitamins are very important for these kind of birds, as in captivity you are responsible to provide them all of those what they get from natural environment, calcium deficiency is most common in grey parrots, vitamin A also counts.\r\n\r\nThe best and less expensive solution is to provide them mixed diet (seeds, fruits, and vegs) but first check allowed n not allowed things.\r\n\r\nlast but not least, greys, macaws, electus cockatoos, even cocktails need your time and stimulation... so spend some time with them they will be good friends... :)\r\n\r\nagain, all of this info shared is on good faith basis and writer is not responsible for any mishap caused by these tips (lolz disclaimer bhe tu zaroori hai), if some expert wish to correct or add something.... i will be more than happy and thankful.', ''),

(329409, ' @Hsnmz\r\n\r\nDear, The ammo about which u are talking doesn''t require stability when it leaves the barrel. It simply disperses as the distance increases. a rifled barrel provides stability which increases range and stops the projectile from tumbling and reduces the Magnus effect. smoothbores are good for heavier projectiles like that of tanks, Recoilless rifles, RPGs and mortars in which the projectile is either "spin stabilized" or "fin stabilized" so the barrel doesn''t have to do much about it. If u put SG, 4 or 6 in a rifled barrel, the spherical balls are going to spin inside the barrel individually and go haywire after leaving the barrel', ''),
(329411, ' Couldnt have been explained better', ''),
(329412, ' Let''s take a trip back through time firearms then, were mostly ''Long Rifles'' also called ''Long Barrelled Muskets'' because they were smoothbore and bullets were smooth ''balls'' of lead.\n\nI forget who realised that if you drilled grooves along a barrel, you caused a projectile to ''spin'', but he or she realised that range was greatly increased. As the projectile spins, it moves very much like an arrow - it flies away from the target then, because of gravity, falls back on target.\n\nIf you think of a smoothbore weapon, the most obvious choice is the shotgun. When you fire a shotgun, wadding flies off the shot which then disperses throughout a wide arc. \n\nWhen mounted on a tank, the only advantage in the smooth bore, is the ability to fire both normal ammunition and missiles from the main gun. Smooth bore gun barrels have a longer life as there is no ''rifling'' to wear out.\n\nAll types of ammunition cause tremendous pressures within the breech block and barrel - be they smooth or rifled but with a rifled barrel under wartime conditions, it would have to be replaced after about 400 -450 rounds.', ''),

(629866, ' FAbhai\n\nlove your display of patriotism but let me share an epiphany with all the members, but before i begin let me please request members to understand the concept of free speech and "every one being entitled to their opinion" *Grins*\n\nBeing from a military family i have been around POF weapons quite a bit, the most important thing that firearm aficionados fail to realize that POF will never EVER..produce military grade firearms for a civilian market, its not just a matter of automatics or semis, the weapon would never be the same quality as the one being supplied to the armed forces or the ones being exported to friendly nations, call me anything you like, term it a fool''s wind, but this is the reality. POF mp series being produced for the armed forces of Pakistan is nearly as good as the one being produced in Germany by H&K, believe it or not, but the special services group of Pakistan Army uses the mp series most of the times and its a class of its own.\n\n2ndly regarding this particular weapon, i am just puzzled what good is it? i mean practically speaking if its not automatic, its useless, you have to understand that the weapon is used for close personal security where VIPs are guarded even when going to a bathroom, so the weapon calibre and performance have to be lethal yet it should be some thing too overly audible, visible and heavy calibrated, because in a close proximity no one would want to use a large calibre weapon because of several reasons, this weapon is basically meant for security personal that too would frankly speaking look good on a guy wearing a jacket and a tie, i cant have my guard AKA khoro khan baba wear a jeans haha let alone a jacket, and it would look like a toy gun in his hand since he is 6"2. \n\nmy final point would be that in this price range one can get any good handgun, obviously you can''t conceal it in your trouser or wear it in a holster, so why buy this in the first place?\n\n\n\n[QUOTE=FA226;467650]POF zinda baad.[/QUOTE]', ''),

Handgun sales were up 65% to 395 in Ohio and nationally increased by about 5 per cent to 7,906.\n\nThe spike in sales has been particularly pronounced for precisely the model of gun and ammunition deployed by the shooter: Glock 19. \n\nIt is light, powerful, accurate and easy to shoot at high speed. Since a ban on assault weapons was allowed to lapse in 2004, it can legally be equipped with an extended magazine that holds 33 bullets.\n\nYet sales of the extended magazines are doing particularly brisk business in Arizona. At Glockmeisteroverall sales have approximately doubled. But sales of the extended 33-bullet\nclip are up almost 400 per cent this week.\n\nGlock owners were apprehensive that Congress might clamp down on possession of the high-capacity magazines.\n\nSimilar runs on guns and ammunition have been seen following other gun rampages such as the Virginia Tech massacre in 2007, in which 32 people died.\nThere was also a surge after Barack Obama was elected president in November 2008 as gun owners again expected restrictions.', ''),

Always take your old trusted pen in an examination. You know how it behaves and its limitations. In the movie the ghost and the darkness the hero goes on a lion hunt. He exchanges his old rifle with the surgeon''s rifle. When he comes across lion he fails to operate the new rifle. But he survives due to other hunter''s judgement who fires at lion seeing him doing nothing. He tells him not to repeat this mistake again.

The only way to find out which cartridge your rifle likes,  take different available ammo to the range and test it in groups of at least 8-10 rounds per type of ammo, ppl may do it differently but it works for me. Always slow fire &#8230;.. means that u should allow about 10 + min between each fire, this is to ensure that ur always firing thru a cool barrel. fire 2 to 5 rounds first before going into the grouping to clear oils/lubricants because first few rounds will fly and will give different groups.8-10 rounds will give you a good idea how that particular type of ammo will act in your rifle.

(329655, 'FUTURE OF WILDLIFE IN PUNJAB - Letter to CM Punjab Having inherited this passion from my ancestors, I am a proud hunter and a lover of wildlife and game since I was 5 years old. I have had experience of hunting in all areas of Pakistan and almost all species of wildlife less the banned ones, and therefore can speak with some authority on the subject. My experience increases manifold if my inheritance of over 70 years of hunting is added to my own 38 years. With increase in population, rampant poverty and quest for more land brought under the plow, the chances for wildlife are diminishing by the hour due to shrinking habitat. A dreaded stage has now come within my own lifetime that I am actually worried for dwindling population of partridge, quail, duck and geese. Areas in Punjab where Urials, and Chunkaras roamed free, have now become obscure. \r\n	Laymen including many of my acquaintances are quick to point out that, “stop shooting and the wildlife will come back”; In other words blame it on hunters. Without going through the lengthy debate on blame game I am summarizing some of the main contributors of this decline.\r\n•	Shrinking Habitat.	Shrubs, jungles, clumps of tall grass are needed by partridges for breeding. Similarly other species like Chakors, Sisees, and Quail also need it for the same purpose as well as to hide during daytime. Ever increasing farmland is good for the country but detrimental to the cause of wildlife. A balance or restricted areas for wildlife are essential in this regard.\r\n•	Commercial Hunting.	This takes two distinct forms; firstly all types of landlords invite bigwigs for hunting on their landholdings for favours later on. Secondly and more damaging is the common villager shooting scores of birds at night while they are asleep tightly packed together for warmth. Netting, poisoning is also on the rampage these days. A new phenomenon hitherto unknown has developed, where rich people and landlords too lazy to come out of their cushy environments have deputed coaster loads of professional hunters who scour the land and wipe it clean of all and every edible specie in view of an upcoming marriage party or for sending as gifts to the rich and powerful of the country.\r\n•	Game and Wildlife Department.	Interestingly instead of helping to save wildlife, the department is actually contributing towards its demise. Some of the failings are as following.\r\no	Recruitment of unqualified and untrained staff including its leadership.\r\no	Lack of motivation due to a horde of reasons like, lack of incentives, resources, pressure from powerful elite, and corruption.\r\no	Lack of imagination, resulting in half hearted adherence to British era practices of hunting control. There has been a glaring lack of newer and imaginative schemes as are being adopted in rest of the world.\r\no	Poor survey and lack of planning for next hunting season. A case in point is poor breeding pattern due to excessive rains during critical breeding time in Punjab last year and resultant dangerously low partridge population observed this time. As a first step all types of hunting should have been banned this year.\r\no	There is distinct lack of coordination with leading hunters and hunting organization of the country with the Department which results into a colonial Master-Awam relationship instead of two partners of civil society working together for it type relationship.\r\n•	Unabated use of Pesticide.	Areas where cash crop is sown and where pesticide is used has become devoid of bird population. A case in point is Pothohar region, where due to negligible presence of cash crops, very limited pesticide spray is used, and despite hunting pressure from rest of the country (thanks to the Motorway) maximum game is still found in this region.\r\n•	Lack of Private/Public Partnership.	In USA millions of Ring neck pheasants are shot some times in one state alone every year, but the population of this bird doesn’t dwindle. It so happens because a lot of hunting is done on commercial game farms. Private individuals are given licenses to build and manage game farms on private and public land for this purpose. Wildlife and Game Department only provides advice and help implementing rules and laws.\r\n•	Killing of game by Scientific means with Resupply left to Nature.	There is no programme available in Pakistan where artificial breeding of game birds for the purpose of later release into the wild is earnestly undertaken. One or two ‘Numaishi’ such farms managed by Wildlife Department are a sorry tale to say the least. When millions of birds are killed through scientific means every year, how can poor nature cope with resupply?', ''),
(329656, 'FUTURE OF WILDLIFE IN PUNJAB - Letter to CM Punjab (Part 2) There is an urgent need for us to wake up to this serious threat to a national asset and take immediate steps lest this beautiful spectacle of sights and sounds in the wild become folklore for our children. I am suggesting some steps in this direction which would mostly be refuted by Wildlife and Game Department people citing license to authority by virtue of their subject, very conveniently forgetting years of experience that people like me have actually gained through our continuous love and connection with Wilderness without being paid for it.\r\n•	Develop Partnership with the People.	There is a need to declare Tehsils in Punjab as hunting areas for the season where people of the area themselves are responsible to protect their Wildlife. Balloting should be done at national level during summers for allowing limited number of hunters in each such hunting area. After balloting hefty fees should be charged on per bird basis. Incentives to government servants and taxpayers (according to the amount of tax actually paid) should be built in to provide balance against the rich elite. Funds so gathered should be divided between people of the area and Game Department in a way that 80 % goes to the local people. With money thus gathered and spent on road construction, hospitals, schools etc there would be such an incentive for the locals that they would guard the wildlife with their lives if need be. Can Game watchers of the Department have similar motivation on few thousands of Rs salaries? Similar experiments for big game hunting have had a tremendous success in South Africa, and in Northern Areas of Pakistan.\r\n•	Lease Land to Interested Parties.	Public land laying fallow in Pothohar region and semi desert terrain of Punjab alongwith land falling in government forests should be given on lease to interested parties to develop commercial hunting farms. It would also provide a means for employment for the locals as well as an alternative to those unsuccessful in ballots scheme as mentioned above.\r\n•	Encourage Artificial Breeding.	Public needs to be encouraged through education and tax breaks to establish Partridge, Quail and Chakor Farms on commercial basis. Chicks in wild form can be supplied to the owners of Commercial Hunting Farms, as well as to the Department for release into the wild. Grown birds can be marketed to bring down the prices of game birds being sold illegally in the market and thus put an indirect but effective check on illegal commercial hunting.\r\n•	Recruit Individuals with Correct Education/Qualification for Wildlife Department. Without knowledge and motivation, nobody can produce results. The jobs should be correctly advertised and right people selected. On job training coupled with courses abroad should bring fresh ideas into an otherwise close and morose department. \r\n•	Make the Department more Friendly and Helpful.	With game protection being increasingly franchised out to locals, the role of Department should evolve towards that of a guide and facilitator. With a more helpful and friendly face people would be encouraged to interact with it and thus form a thriving and healthy partnership.\r\n•	Encourage Organization like NRA (national rifle association) and Ducks Unlimited.	Setting up of such organizations in Pakistan is the dream of every responsible Pakistani. Once established these organizations can take over most of the responsibilities of Game and Wildlife Department without any cost to the public money. Through voluntary contributions these organizations in USA and Canada have bought and set aside millions of acres of land for sole purpose of natural breeding by the birds.\r\nThis piece is written in the hope that someone, somewhere might do something for wildlife of Pakistan and especially so in Punjab so that our children can continue to enjoy these breath taking spectacles that we enjoyed in our lifetime. Let it not be said that we didn’t put in our bit of hard work and ingenuity into it.', ''),

Reliability can only be judged after certain number years in use and number of shots fired and the results are compared from more than one gun. Personally, hardly few guns of this value go to such extreme comparisons and mostly people change guns ling before their useful life expectancy. STILL, I think its a very well built gun. \n3. Yeah, I bought it for 50k from Lahore after telling them the prices of the same gun in Rawalpindi to be 50k. Since then, didn''t check again but it should be around 50k as some friends have bought semi-auto Hatsans to be under 45k.

(329872, 'About Partridges - Few Neglected Points Since I have been hunting in all regions of Punjab from last 20 years, I have no doubt in saying that partridge count has been decreased considerably. Now it’s a rare thing that you hunt a black from Punjab.\n \nI have no doubt in saying that this scarcity is not result of legal and above all [B]SENSIBLE HUNTING[/B]. A gun is not a reason. You can hit the population of this kind of a bird in planes of Punjab but the regions of Upper Punjab are like heaven for this bird. Reason: difficult mountainous terrain and spots which are not possible to reach. They breed and breed well in these areas.\n \nYesterday I was at one spot in salt range, near my native village and this is the place where I went so often and where there is an abundance of partridges. As it’s my native land so no one is allowed to hunt. This was my 2nd scouting. Last time when I visit there was huge amount of partridges and chakurs. I even saw many chicks too in breeding season. \n \nNow it’s all barren, no birds, nothing. This is my observation when scouted the entire salt range belt and its vicinities.\nWhile taking to locals especially from those who live in forests of slat range. I have no doubt in saying that this year the entire population of partridges was hit by few diseases.  \n \n[B]The So Called Wild Life Protection Department[/B] didn’t do any and even don’t have any [B]Biodiversity Action Plan[/B]. They have no [B]Partridge Count Scheme[/B] never they announce and performed such activities. \n \nThe summer floods of Jhelum and Indus coupled with less/delayed rains of the winter season might created some epidemic/disease for this bird. Let’s not blame the hunters and his gun all the time. Few locals have confirmed me about the disease. Even few who catch them illegally for selling/buying purposes confirmed me of the disease.\n \nI have discussed this with some veterinary docs, some from University of Veterinary Sciences, Lahore too. They told me about some common diseases found in their surveys which they do voluntary on partridges. Let me share those diseases:\n \n[B]M. gallisepticum[/B] – Disease called chronic respiratory disease (CRD) in, quail, pheasants, and partridges.\n \n[B]HISTOMONIASIS/ TOXOPLASMOSIS[/B]\nAlso called black head, a common protozoal disease partridges\n \nThough the govt had issued [B]Punjab Wildlife (Protection, Preservation, Conservation and Management) Ordinance[/B]. But in reality they didn’t do even a single thing for Protection, Preservation, Conservation and Management of Wild Life.\n \nStaff hired at local level which is the key for such reports at grassroots level is illiterate and know nothing about the wild life and its Protection, Preservation, Conservation and Management.\nHunters will continue to hunt for all times to come. \n \nThe hunting facilities and opportunities are of very high standards in West and they hunt thousands of partridges every year. But on the other hand their government and concern departments work hard as well for the Protection, Preservation, Conservation and Management of the wildlife. And this is how it works.\n\nThe onus will also lie on Local/Provincial and Federal Govt to hire/appoint qualified people in respective departments. So that this eco system can be maintained and maintained well.', ''),

(329883, ' Very true sir.A similar experience was encountered by many hunters this season. Our hunting party hunts once a year, on private fields and we keep track of the bird count in the area. Much to our dismay, the fields had a bad disease this year which made the birds so lethargic that locals have been catching them by hand. I wonder if its even safe to eat those disease struck birds but nonetheless the locals did. end result, there s hardly any bird left in the area barring a controlled pheasant population which was planted in 2009 by us. That too had a slow growth due to an early disease. prospects arent very good at all.\r\nThis year, we will try to inject more pheasants in the area Inshallah. The cover is good and the terrain is perfect for ring necks. Lets pray it works this time around. \r\nAlso, we have decided to not have our yearly hunting in the field for at least 3 years in order to revive the partridges.', ''),
(329884, ' [QUOTE=AzamAgha44;169113]There is an urgent need for us to wake up to this serious threat to a national asset and take immediate steps lest this beautiful spectacle of sights and sounds in the wild become folklore for our children. I am suggesting some steps in this direction which would mostly be refuted by Wildlife and Game Department people citing license to authority by virtue of their subject, very conveniently forgetting years of experience that people like me have actually gained through our continuous love and connection with Wilderness without being paid for it.\r\n•	Develop Partnership with the People.	There is a need to declare Tehsils in Punjab as hunting areas for the season where people of the area themselves are responsible to protect their Wildlife. Balloting should be done at national level during summers for allowing limited number of hunters in each such hunting area. After balloting hefty fees should be charged on per bird basis. Incentives to government servants and taxpayers (according to the amount of tax actually paid) should be built in to provide balance against the rich elite. Funds so gathered should be divided between people of the area and Game Department in a way that 80 % goes to the local people. With money thus gathered and spent on road construction, hospitals, schools etc there would be such an incentive for the locals that they would guard the wildlife with their lives if need be. Can Game watchers of the Department have similar motivation on few thousands of Rs salaries? Similar experiments for big game hunting have had a tremendous success in South Africa, and in Northern Areas of Pakistan.\r\n•	Lease Land to Interested Parties.	Public land laying fallow in Pothohar region and semi desert terrain of Punjab alongwith land falling in government forests should be given on lease to interested parties to develop commercial hunting farms. It would also provide a means for employment for the locals as well as an alternative to those unsuccessful in ballots scheme as mentioned above.\r\n•	Encourage Artificial Breeding.	Public needs to be encouraged through education and tax breaks to establish Partridge, Quail and Chakor Farms on commercial basis. Chicks in wild form can be supplied to the owners of Commercial Hunting Farms, as well as to the Department for release into the wild. Grown birds can be marketed to bring down the prices of game birds being sold illegally in the market and thus put an indirect but effective check on illegal commercial hunting.\r\n•	Recruit Individuals with Correct Education/Qualification for Wildlife Department. Without knowledge and motivation, nobody can produce results. The jobs should be correctly advertised and right people selected. On job training coupled with courses abroad should bring fresh ideas into an otherwise close and morose department. \r\n•	Make the Department more Friendly and Helpful.	With game protection being increasingly franchised out to locals, the role of Department should evolve towards that of a guide and facilitator. With a more helpful and friendly face people would be encouraged to interact with it and thus form a thriving and healthy partnership.\r\n•	Encourage Organization like NRA (national rifle association) and Ducks Unlimited.	Setting up of such organizations in Pakistan is the dream of every responsible Pakistani. Once established these organizations can take over most of the responsibilities of Game and Wildlife Department without any cost to the public money. Through voluntary contributions these organizations in USA and Canada have bought and set aside millions of acres of land for sole purpose of natural breeding by the birds.\r\nThis piece is written in the hope that someone, somewhere might do something for wildlife of Pakistan and especially so in Punjab so that our children can continue to enjoy these breath taking spectacles that we enjoyed in our lifetime. Let it not be said that we didn’t put in our bit of hard work and ingenuity into it.[/QUOTE]\r\n \r\n\r\nDear Agha Azam Sahib; Weldon sir, sure you will receive response in next few days inshallah.\r\n\r\nFew points mentioned or highlighted by you to CM are already under an exercise of Provincial Wildlife departments. Now Wildlife officers/Supervisors/Inspectors are qualified in new badges; but there is lack of academic trainings. \r\n\r\nAlready CBOs Policy introduced by Punjab Government for Urial & Partridges breeds & shoots/hunts; but after hard struggles no body was interesting in Partridge CBO.\r\n\r\nBut for dollars every person having influenced either he is not having land in relevant areas; but they were running for Urial CBOs. So; few of them got permissions for CBOs and finally result was corruptions done by the agents of some politicians and favorite persons of Wildlife Department in many areas of Salt Range. Nothing done by facilitated peoples for Urial fields; for hunters or for local community. \r\n\r\nBut we peoples are not willing to take hard time for legislations and pursuing matters against pouching/netting and illegal hunting normally we all are silent in this regard.\r\n\r\nSo; intact we need strong hunting organization like NRA & Ducks Unlimited; because some favorable polices are still standing.\r\n\r\nAt the same time Punjab Government is offering golden land for lease out to interesting parties for Private Hunting Game reserves. And you can manage according to as you quoted examples of USA, Canada.  \r\n\r\nIf you are some another one is interesting drop your email or send at mine; I can provide some material and offered spots information too. \r\nI think in the past there are also few posts on PG also covering basic information.\r\n\r\nMany close persons to the some officials of ruling parties in Punjab are involved in wild species trading. Think about it; few years to back Punjab Wildlife Department was offering Blue Bull, Blackbuck, Hog Deer, Chinkara and Chital trophies harvesting at very reasonable prices; but its very said there was no good response by our hunting community. \r\n\r\nSo; finally department closed that project and the offered trophies are now offering by private resorts at very high prices.\r\n\r\nThe matter is what we are doing really? If already there some fruitful policies are at our disposal by Government. \r\nTAREEN is right our there is major lack of our individual participation too.', ''),

This clone of famous 1911 is one of the best clones and one of  the best upgraded/tricked/customized out of box 1911 available in a very  affordable price range. I don&#8217;t think it makes any sense to copy paste  the gun specs from Taurus&#8217;s website as all of you either have read those  or will do so just after reading below, so lets get on to the business  straight away.\n   \n  Bought it yesterday @ 80k&#8217;ish + 2 mags + 200 rounds for it to eat.  Spent couple of hours last night cleaning n caressing it and took it to  range this afternoon as most of you know how I hate a gun with her  cherry intact ;)\n   \n  Fires 50 Armscor FMJ&#8217;s and 8 Prvi Partizan JHP&#8217;s, tested all the 4  mags (2 with gun and 2 xtra I bought), one full mag of JHP&#8217;s fired  just  to check its digestion on these. As did not have much time to spend at  range so fired all 58 rounds in just 20 minutes but it was my first  session that I enjoyed seeing the results of, below are the pics of  target, gun and a closer look at the muzzle to show what 58 230grainers  did to the poor gun.\n   \n   [IMG]http://i577.photobucket.com/albums/ss220/denovo87/PT%201911/01targt.jpg[/IMG]\n   \n  [IMG]http://i577.photobucket.com/albums/ss220/denovo87/PT%201911/02targt.jpg[/IMG]\n   \n  [IMG]http://i577.photobucket.com/albums/ss220/denovo87/PT%201911/03targtgun.jpg[/IMG]\n   \n  [IMG]http://i577.photobucket.com/albums/ss220/denovo87/PT%201911/04fouling.jpg[/IMG]\n   \n  There was not a single hiccup of any sort in 58 rounds.\n   \n  Let me admit that PT 1911 is a real out of the box customized 1911,  trigger is too clean, crisp and light for me to handle and will take  some shooting to get used to it, I let it go un-intentionally numerous  times in the heat of shooting resulting many shots landing far from the  bull which easily could be put in sub 6 circle at least if I was not  behaving that greedy.  Trigger has no pre or post travel at all it just a  surprise break.\n   \n  I normally cannot feel/tell the difference of recoil in various guns,  so to me PT 1911 has not much of the different recoil than a 9mm.\n   \n  Sights are Taurus&#8217;s typical Hinie 3 dot, which I honestly am not fan of , like the Glock or Sig sights more.\n   \n  One more thing that I noticed is the ease of racking the slide, I did  not feel any difference in racking lowered hammer or cocked hammer, it  racked smoothly n sweetly both ways.\n   \n  Will be writing more on the subject and will post PT1911 porn and a  disassembly tutorial in a day or two.

Provided the rifle is a modern make and in good condition. \r\nQuoting from [url]http://www.6mmbr.com/308win.html[/url]\r\n[QUOTE].308 Win vs. 7.62x51--The Straight Scoop\r\nBefore we go much further, we want to address the oft-posed question "Are the .308 Winchester and 7.62x51 NATO one and the same?" The simple answer is no. There are differences in chamber specs and maximum pressures. The SAMMI/CIP maximum pressure for the .308 Win cartridge is 62,000 psi, while the 7.62x51 max is 50,000 psi. Also, the headspace is slightly different. The .308 Win "Go Gauge" is 1.630" vs. 1.635" for the 7.62x51. The .308''s "No-Go" dimension is 1.634" vs. 1.6405" for a 7.62x51 "No Go" gauge. That said, it is normally fine to shoot quality 7.62x51 NATO ammo in a gun chambered for the .308 Winchester (though not all NATO ammo is identical). Clint McKee of Fulton Armory notes: "[N]obody makes 7.62mm (NATO) ammo that isn''t to the .308 ''headspace'' dimension spec. So 7.62mm ammo fits nicely into .308 chambers, as a rule." You CAN encounter problems going the other way, however. A commercial .308 Win round can exceed the max rated pressure for the 7.62x51. So, you should avoid putting full-power .308 Win rounds into military surplus rifles that have been designed for 50,000 psi max. For more information on this interesting topic, read the following articles: Gun Zone''s 30 Caliber FAQ; Cruffler.com Technical Trivia, June 2001; and last, but not least, Steve Redgwell''s .308 vs 7.62x51 Analysis, which really provides a definitive explanation. Reloaders should also note that military ammo often is made with a thicker web. Consequently the case capacity of 7.62x51 brass is usually less than that of commercial .308 brass. You may need to reduce recommended .308 Winchester loads by as much as 2 full grains, if you reload with military 7.62x51 brass, such as Lake City or IMI.[/QUOTE]\r\n\r\nThough this debate would be never ending\r\nbut I know of people that use Mil Surplus Ammo in thier Bolt Action .308s and are fine with it but the Semis tend to have extraction problems.\r\n\r\nRegards', ''),

The only bad part about it is that mine fell off during a duck shoot, if u have the magnetic one you should glue it to the barrel or something, otherwise it will fall off ......\r\n\r\nI now have the fixed Truglo bead on my shotgun in place of the original one and it works well ..... All hunters should put these on their guns ..... "Two thumbs up"   :D[/QUOTE]\r\n \r\nI agree, SNAP-ON, CLIP-ON and MAGNETIC types do fall off. unless screwed on barrel properly. On the other hand, the screw in the fixed FO beads becomes loose & shooter doesn''t know when the entire bead or lite pipe in it falls (such as in Tru-bead by Truglo supplied with some Beretta AL391''s).\r\n\r\nDespite those problems, the best bet is the fixed type FO bead with a diameter of 0.120 to 0.135 inches, and with interchangeable lite pipes in different colors (RED for daylight or skeet, GREEN for dawn dusk, WHITE for overall hunting in low light or green backdrop). A very good FO sight which satisfies these conditions is the "Hiviz CompSight" (very popular in West & retailed @$29.99). Different diameter lite pipes in it also help as one can choose the diameter of his own choice, such as in clay shooting larger dia (0.135") red color lite pipe suits me more, and in hunting generally 0.125" dia flouresecent green lite pipe suits more. Also this sight is a LOW PROFILE sight which is impt also, as the shot pattern keeps aligned to the barrel, while in many high profile ones in market, either shot pattern shift upward of the bird OR their metal jackets obstruct the bird sight picture. The length of the lite pipe is impt too, as the more length the pipe is generally, it collect more natural light from environment, thus shining brighter.\r\n\r\nAlso, do remember to put a drop or two of ''clear nail polish'' in the thread before tightening the FO bead''s screw onto barrel. This was advised by Truglo company tech dept via phone. This way it doesn''t become loose. I have this Hiviz CompSight ...works fantastic for me in skeet as well as low light + daylight hunting ... and ''master eye dominance'' as 12gauge said is indeed supported, as well as with a relatively larger dia lite pipe like 0.125" or 0.135", very quick target acquisition is obtained. And I have found it to be helpful over the traditional 0.100" (1/10") dia brass silver metal bead which is so common (and also comes as a std with all Berettas for example, including A303, A390, AL391 Urika2 & A400 Xplor Unico). But, again, many would say a shotgun is an extension of one''s arm and these things hardly matter ... for me, I find it a delight to shoot with.', ''),

(330123, ' Xplor Unico with 28" barrel would be prefered in bw these too. You can check both versions (KO and Non-KO) and then see which weight and especially balance suits you. I know guys who have bought Xplor and then sold them to buy earlier models of Urika2 or Teknys, as weight and balance is also of very importance. According to me, slightly heavier gun will always be a better weapon in waterfowl hunting. And you will notice obvious advantage in smooth swings.\r\n\r\nXplor and Win SX3 are both 6.75 kg category guns and its not an ideal gun weight for waterfowl. Its a very good weight for upland agreed. Urika2 and Teknys are 7.25-7.5 lbs guns and thats the best waterfowl shotgun weight as well as not a bad upland gun weight (but depends too). So, the crux of my argument is ... It doesn''t matter which weapon you buy among all these mentioned here. All are A+ class in semi autos. What matters is which of them comes on your shoulder perfectly centered and WITH THE RIGHT BALANCE for your particular physique. For e.g. for me slight forward weight bias with a relatively heavy gun (7.25-7.5 lbs) is a definite plus in upland and waterfowl both. So choose it accordingly, rather than buying ''the best gun''...because there is no best gun per say among these category of semi autos.\r\nCheers ... and Happy Hunting!', ''),

(330273, ' AoA aj.\r\n\r\nBro, contrary to a popular belief that you need millions in your bank account to play and enjoy skeet, all you need is a good shotgun that is durable and reliable (enough) for you last a couple of hundred shots before you decide that you need to seriously take-up this sport and need better, more expensive equipment.\r\n\r\nI would say, by all means get yourself a Baikal IZH-27-EM-1C (or MP-27, same thing) over and under shotgun. it runs at about 50-60K depending upon which city you are in. with this gun you are probably good for about 20K rounds. by the time you reach this figure, you have utilized the true value of the said shotgun and have either exhausted all the desire of the sport or this sport would be so important to you by then that you would be considering spending some serious amount of cash in upgrading your equipment.\r\n\r\nto break it down for you, you can either wait and get yourself a good racket before start playing tennis. upside is that you start your game with good equipment but downside is that you could end up endlessly planning importing high end equipment which may never happen. another downside is that you could end up in waiting more for the right equipment and playing less.\r\n\r\nor you can get yourself an ordinary racket and start playing tennis. this way, your skill level (which eventually outgrows your equipment) will tell you when you need better equipment in order to improve your scores. downside is that you begin your game with mediocre equipment but upside is that you plan/talk/decide less and play/enjoy more and develop your skill level in the process. eventually your skill level tells you what to do.\r\n\r\nin other words, you can start skeet with a 50-60K gun. when you have fired around 5K rounds, your skill has probably developed to a level that it will tell you what to do next and how much to spend on a high end shotgun and what benefits that would give you. at that point, you can always sell that shotgun (the one that you bought in 50-60K) at around 35-40K and use that money to buy something nice. this way, not only you''ll know where to spend to money, but you''ll also know how to truly appreciate a quality shotgun.\r\n\r\nRegards.\r\n\r\np.s. if you still want a good shotgun then I would suggest that you buy Baikal IZH-27-EM-1C "Sporting" over and under shotgun. It has all the bells and whistles of a sporting shotgun but at heart its still a basic Baikal with the same estimated service life. kindly accept my apologies for a very length post.', ''),

The cleaning mechanism of SX3 is very simple however raw materials used in Explore has an edge. Both the guns are great but for waterfowling where there is a greater risk of dirt sand and mud, I prefer SX3.

It uses the Browning linkless cam locking system similar to that used in the [URL="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Browning_Hi-Power"]Browning Hi-Power[/URL]  pistol, where the barrel and slide are locked together on firing, using  locking lugs milled into the barrel mating with recesses in the roof of  the slide. An enclosed cam track integral with the barrel is actuated  by the slide release lever''s transverse pin. After the first few  millimetres of the recoil stroke, the barrel is cammed downwards at the  rear, enabling the slide to continue the recoil stroke and eject the  spent cartridge. Most models have the capability of being fired in both [URL="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trigger_%28firearms%29"]single[/URL] and [URL="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_action"]double action[/URL][URL="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safety_%28firearms%29"]manual safety[/URL].  Some recent models have a decocking lever that doubles as a manual  safety. Starting in the late 1980s, all CZ 75s have been made with [URL="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firing_pin_block"]firing pin blocks[/URL],  designated by the letter B (as in CZ 75B). The CZ 75 was one of the  first high capacity 9mm pistols with a manual safety similar to that of  the [URL="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Browning_Hi-Power"]Browning Hi-Power[/URL].  This allows the CZ 75 to be carried with the hammer cocked with safety  applied and a round chambered, ready for use simply by switching the  safety off --- a configuration known as [I][URL="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeff_Cooper_%28colonel%29#The_Modern_Technique"]condition one[/URL][/I]. It is somewhat unusual for double-action pistols to have this "cocked and locked" type of safety; most such as the [URL="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walther_P38"]Walther P38[/URL] and the [URL="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beretta_92F"]Beretta 92F[/URL]  have a combination safety/decocking lever (as do later versions of the  CZ 75). The trade-off of this configuration is that to uncock the hammer  for a double action first shot, the hammer must be dropped manually by  pulling the trigger while lowering the hammer with the firer''s thumb  under control. Once lowered in this manner, a double action first shot  can be achieved in a similar manner to other double action pistols  without actuating any controls. Subsequent shots will be single action  unless the hammer is again manually lowered. Unlike most other semi-auto  pistols, the slide rides inside the frame rails rather than outside,  similar to the [URL="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SIG_P210"]SIG P210[/URL].

(330435, 'Gauges, Pellets, Chokes How about some yardsticks for choosing a gauge?There is at least some use for anything from a 10 gauge to a 20 gauge. That means 10, 12, 16 and 20 gauge, all of which have some form of buckshot load available. The best choice, by a wide margin, is the 12, which has dozens of different buckshot choices. The 10 gauge is usually large, heavy and inclined to recoil so hard as to be intimidating. Going down the scale, 16s and 20s are OK, but gun and ammunition choices are limited. That leaves the 12, where, again, the ammo choice is very wide.\r\n\r\nAlso, for about the last 10 years, the American ammunition industry has responded to a law enforcement request for shotgun loads with less recoil. At the same time, it has made most of these 12-gauge loads in such a way that they also shoot much tighter patterns.\r\n\r\nLet''s consider pellet size. Regular shot runs from No. 12 all the way up to 000 buckshot. The odds-on favorite for combat (read anti-personnel) use is 00 Buck. Double-ought pellets are approximately .33 caliber and weigh around 52 to 54 grains apiece. You can get as many as 12 of them in a 2 3/4-inch "short magnum" shell, but standard and low-recoil loads use either eight or nine pellets. This is probably the best all-around choice. However, there is a low-recoil load from Federal that uses eight 000 pellets that  is the best possible compromise. But to be frank, this is an area where there''s a lot of leeway. At "inside the house" ranges, 10 to 12 yards is a long shot, and shot size isn''t critical. Even No. 8 birdshot will pattern into a six- to eight-inch circle at these distances. And it''ll do plenty of damage, too.\r\n\r\nWhat kind of barrel do you want on your fighting scattergun? First of all, you want as short a tube as possible. This is not because a short-barreled shotgun has any ballistic advantage but rather because it handles better in confined spaces like hallways. The legal minimum is 18 inches (as long as that length does not result in a gun with an overall length less than 26 inches). Many shotguns are currently made and sold with 18-inch barrels, so they aren''t hard to find. You can have a shorter barrel as well.\r\nWhen you talk about shotguns, the subject of choke always comes up. Choke is the degree of constriction machined into the muzzle end of the barrel. It''s a way of controlling the size of the pattern at a given range. For many years, most fighting shotguns came in cylinder bore. But we have come to understand that, even with buckshot loads, a certain amount of choke is a good idea. Improved-cylinder or even modified chokes work very well with buckshot, tightening patterns a bit and thereby extending the gun''s effective range. So if you can get your gun with a choke (improved-cylinder or modified) in its short barrel, by all means do so.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSource: [url]http://www.gunsandammo.com/content/home-defense-shotgun#ixzz1BVMus199[/url]', ''),

This is the question which specifically few people have accurate answers or statistically correct answers. General theory goes like this ... longer forcing cones especially a 1"-1.5" parallel section extending out of the barrel and over-bored barrels give a slight edge in patterning because of longer taper and a parallel sec to stabilize the shot load after going through the longer taper ...while the over-bored (larger dia) barrel exerts lesser force on pellets striking with each other, thus making pattern less deformed .... I doubt that it is practically of significant difference in reality. espec using reg Shaheen loads which are LEAD shells and most of the game in West is centered around steel loads .. and that is where Beretta has now introduced Optima Plus HP for steel cartridges in Xplor Unico.', ''),

(628156, ' Hi osiraj,\n\nI am still in the process of learning to shoot it.  Actually I read on some other forums about Nitro Piston guns that you can hold them tightly and they jolt like a firearm. \n\nI have felt that this is a false perception. Their jolt feels like a fire arm because of lack of (or very low) typical vibration of a conventional springer. But the similarity ends here. \nIn a firearm, the bullet has already left the muzzle when rearward recoil is in process. While in a nitro piston air gun, when this reverse and then forward recoil occurs, the pellet has merely started its travel in the barrel.\n\nWe have to cradle this gun in our hands in such a way that it should have its recoil freely in the same way every time. Classic artillery hold is best for this, with no pulling the gun to your shoulder at all.\n\nSomehow, I have developed a liking for these gas ram guns and ordered a Norica Spider GRS in camo.

Appreciated.\n\nAnyhow, let me just draw up my personal views here, as far as [I]durability[/I] tests are concerned, I''m not backing out at all, lolz! But try to understand my actual opinion. We''re not going to suggest any such "[I]passed-out[/I]" gun to any forces, offering us supplier contracts!!! At the maximum, such results will serve common members with a [I]general SD purpose[/I], for which such endurance tests are not required, since all these guns can and do serve the very SD purpose, reliably well.\n\nSecond, I never said, the CZ-999 cannot sustain a test like that favorably, I always conceded this as a true "combat" gun, evident from all my previous posts. Since it''s an adopted duty gun of Serbian forces, course, it must have stood up to even tougher tests than we all could throw onto it. So, nothing [I]disputable[/I] here, at all, requiring a test.\n\nAs far as the Stoeger is concerned, either my "Katrina" with all it''s silky "smoothness", or any other for that sake, well, since this gun has not been adopted as a duty gun anywhere in the world, exposing it to tests like those prescribed for duty guns or comparing it to such guns - [I][B]in terms of military combat use[/B][/I] - is perhaps not needed at all, nor due.\n\nThe Stoeger, exposed to any such test, along with CZ-999 and MP-446, which both are adopted service guns, is no doubt an "underdog", yet at times even "underdogs" cope up quite fine and satisfactorily. The two guns that should be exposed to such tests, in my opinion, would be the CZ-999 and Baikal MP 446 ALL STEEL, or [B]MP 443 Yarigin[/B] "Grach", since these will be most comparable, [B]both serving their respective armies[/B].\n\nMay I add, guns exposed to such tests are usually prototypes with specific manufacturing care and instructions, like the guns having been offered by Taurus and other other manufacturers to SOCOM, USA, when the US forces were considering a new service handgun back in 2005, finally deciding on the Beretta M-9. The Taurus 24/7 OSS - as can be read in the review, I posted the link of in my previous post - even underwent being driven over by a truck, first in forward, then reverse gear, and exposed to +5000 rounds, still delivering!! Such guns are not used any more after the tests, and presented only for the test itself.

(330509, ' Salam All,\n1911 is a very ergonomic designed handgun, its also the gun that has seen MANY fields of battles around the world, it has been offered in many calibers, .45, 9mm, LAR Manufacturing .45 winchester mag., Coonan Arms .357 mag, .38 super, .30 bore, .22lr, .32 acp, 10mm, .40, and I am sure many more.  Its also the ONLY handgun for which ANY AND ALL accessories one can think of IS being manufactured.  Its easily customizable for various roles.  These days due to the 1911 cult, its also being manufactured by literally all the major manufacturers.  However, a 1911 is best customized by purchasing parts which made certain people in this field famous during the early 70s to late 80s.... ie Clark''s, EdBrown, Les Baer, Wilson Combat, Nowlin, EGW, Briley, Ogelsby & Ogelsby (make the famous WitchDoctor1911), Richard Hinie, Pistol Dynamics, ChipMcCormick, King''s and many many more.\nWhenever purchasing a 1911 one must take into account all aspects of purchase... ie collectibility for example - in the world market only one name is mostly desired....

In order to make one gun "fail" in these tests, a limited "mini-experiment" may not be enough, and a lot more and tougher tests will be required, causing one heck of a damage to the finishing of these guns, so I''d advise it only, if you''re really sick about your own handgun.

Ans: (infact the only probable answer) head east and see for yourself.\r\n\r\n[QUOTE=AK47;169975]Finally no [I]chickening[/I] out, coz you can only back off from something, that you actually threw yourself into, I always maintained the CZ 999 as a combat machine, interesting, however, would be, how it compares to the Viking.[/QUOTE]\r\n\r\nnow since it has been established that Cougar is in fact a combat handgun therefore it absolutely makes sense to compare it to other combat handguns in similar price range. such as Scorpion and Viking. that is all i''m suggesting a direct competition between CZ999, MP446 and SC8000\r\n\r\n[QUOTE=AK47;169975]\r\nI''d suggest we muster up enough cash, [I]collectively[/I], to avail 3 NIB''s of these and do a world class review in not only exposing them to simple mud, sand and water, but to tough concrete drops from 8-10 feet, kicks and blows along concrete floors a''la genuine FBI endurance tests, ride them over with trucks, kicking their butts painfully, till they cry: [I]"plz, no more[/I]", and then shooting them out till [I]Caputso[/I], finally throwing them into the nearest garbage dump on the way back home to a nice cup of tea together, taking pride in having screwed up some of the best iron out there, and sending out the clear signals to the manufacturers, something that will speak.

You can well imagine, how much would be the volume of 30% of the crop cultivated for 160 million Pakistanis ... whatever amount in millions of tons ... also needs lacs of boars to eat !\r\nSo these boars are every where, .. and believe me ... they are in lacs ... literally in lacs, however, since they are very smart, intelligent and active noctornal animals, it''s not so easy to get hold of them. \r\nMost of our "Shehri Hunters" think they are stupid, goofy looking animals but you must believe they are very smart & intelligent. If you need to verify my claim, go and ask the farmers or the villagers who are sick & tired of this pest.\r\nAlthough, finding & shooting boars is not a rocket science and anyone can do it with some preparation and practice, however, being a professional hunting outfitter, when I take dollars from my clients, I have to be professional, qualified, experienced, tactful and above all, confident to cater them a baor hunt with good results otherwise, their guns can be turned towards me if they are not happy with my service. \r\nSo in order to hunt this illusive animal with proficiency, I studied its behavior in depth, spent lot of time tracking its habitats, studied its migratory traits, then I trained and produced a strong team of dogs and professional beaters and equipped them with proper clothing and equipment. Buying dozens of accessories, tools, equipment and community gear is also a vital part of this venture and above all, I spent a lot of time, money and labor to adopt it as a serious profession. There is also a lot of fiscal investment behind this venture !!! \r\nNow after all this work, you take me to any area in Pakistan (except deserts & mountains) & I & my team will flush these buggers out of their nests ! Believe me they are everywhere, all you need is the right skills to flush them out & there is no SPECIAL PLACE where you can find them in hundreds ... & even if they are found in hundreds you DO NEED good hunting skills to shoot them.\r\nGood Luck & Happy Hunting !!!', ''),

Second but abit smaller + is the relative smaller size without loossing firepower. The biggest - minus of being relatively less reliable (Mostly with hollowpoint). So if FMJs are used this problem of unreliability can be addressed to a greater extent. Colour of the Stoeger Couger is enemal type and is far more helpful in preventing rust and the gun looks nice and black for much longer periods than the CZ 999.\r\n\r\nAt the End both guns are nice.

The box has ''for training shooting'' printed on it and quite frankly it is excellent ammo for range shooting. I like it and have shot 2 inch groups at 25 M''s with it. In the 2000+ rounds I''ve shot, I have yet to have a misfire or FTE. \n\nPreviously I was shooting Wolf and POF but this ammo is better and more accurate not to mention consistent which is a big problem with WOLF ammo here in Pakistan. Often the batches we get are from different lots and from different factories even. This makes them irritating for target shooting since one box might shoot dead center, another an inch higher and the third an inch lower. Different ammo''s fire slightly different from the same gun. \n\nBarnaul is sold world over under different brand names, most prominent being Monarch and RAM (Russian Arms Manufacturing). The cases are sold in quantities of 1600 rounds and the ammo costs around Rs. 40. \n\nBtw interesting fact: Barnaul is a city in Siberia, Russia and the Barnaul factory has been producing ammo for more than a 100 years. \n\nSome pictures and technical specs about it which it being Russian ammo is hard to come by.\n\n[IMG]http://i262.photobucket.com/albums/ii99/AbbasMalik/Barnaul5.jpg[/IMG]\n\n[IMG]http://i262.photobucket.com/albums/ii99/AbbasMalik/Barnaul4.jpg[/IMG]\n\n[IMG]http://i262.photobucket.com/albums/ii99/AbbasMalik/Barnaul1.jpg[/IMG]\n\n[IMG]http://i262.photobucket.com/albums/ii99/AbbasMalik/Barnaul2.jpg[/IMG]\n\n[IMG]http://i262.photobucket.com/albums/ii99/AbbasMalik/Barnaul3.jpg[/IMG]', ''),

The weapons used by most snipers are hunting rifles (eg. the M24 is a Remington 700), therefore I move that the only difference between a sniper and a hunter is in the target.\n[IMG]http://ts2.mm.bing.net/images/thumbnail.aspx?q=562140292533&id=2a67da80bba8c6314cb19327c8c62ad5&url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.sportsmanguncentre.co.uk%2fi%2fproducts%2f964c73b227833644634898321.jpg[/IMG]\n\nWith that off my chest, to the meat. I have recently encountered the CZ 527 carbine, made by Ceska Zbrojovka in the Czech Republic. They are available in .223 Remington and 7.62X39 and feature a removable 5 round box magazine. The rifle I evaluated was the model chambered for the 7.62X39 round. The finish on the rifle is a work of art. Smooth as silk action and beautiful Turkish walnut stock.\n\nDimensions:\nWeight             5.9 lbs\noverall length    37.4 inches\nbarrel length     18.5 inches\nheight               8 inches\nwidth               3 inches\nlength of pull    13.5 inches\n\nUsing a bore-scope I checked out the barrel and confirmed that the quality of workmanship is not restricted to the outside. The bore is lapped to a mirror finish, rifling sharp and crisp, with no microscopic tears or blemishes as would be found when cutting rifling with worn tools. Just perfection from the crown all the way down the 18 1/2 inches of cold hammer forged barrel.\n\nShooting this rifle is like being in a dream you don''t want to wake up from. Recoil is very light, and accuracy very good. 4 5-shot groups (using match  125gr FMJ Silver Bear ammo) were all under 1 inch at 100 meters with the factory iron sights.\n\nWhat I liked: \nThe weight/size ratio makes this rifle very comfortable to carry when hunting.\nThe price is very comparable to rifles in the same class made by manufacturers such as Ruger, Winchester and Marlin, and the finish is better.\n\nWhat I didn''t like:\nThe rear factory sight is mounted too far forward, thus reducing the sight-radius on a rifle that has a short barrel to begin with.', ''),

(330766, ' @Ak47 Hmmm it seems I have opened a pandora''s box with the math specs. That is not really my field of interest but in a nutshell, the kill probability chart is just a fancy renaming of the bullet trajectory graph. The inches represent the line of sight.\n\n@Rasal.Saleh The data above explains the behavior of this particular ammo over various distances. That said, ballistics is an entire science which would require a crystal clear understanding of the subject to explain to others which sadly I cannot claim. Skeeter60 would be the right person to ask, if you''re interested I suggest you read up a little for a basic understanding before knowing which questions to ask. \n\nSomething I forgot to mention in the post above is that I have heard that this ammo is not very successful in the Stoger Cougar. I find that quite strange since I have used it in over 10 handguns all with flawless performance. If anyone has tested it in the Stoeger please report back here.\n\nThe ammo itself is less messy than WOLF and certainly cleaner than 1Z/2Z (POF). For shooting I would rate it on the same accuracy level as Federal or S&B.', ''),
(330768, ' vepr 12 molot', ''),
(330769, ' Although, some hunters prefer shotguns for shooting wild boars, it''s a challenging job to accomplish success simply because shot gun has very short range and as the distance from the boar increases the pellets spread out diffusing its strength (despite using chokes) thus it tends to wound the animal instead of killing it. Shotgun is effective only if you are stalking and succeed in reaching the boar as near as possible, whereas, in driven hunts the boars are farther away from the hunters and you always find them runing at fast  speed ... so it''s quite a challenge. \r\n\r\nA good rifle (bolt action or semi auto) with a scope (of 2 to 6 power) makes this job quite easier. Any caliber above 22 & 243 would be OK ! But some of popular, rather, preferable calibers are 30-06, 308, 300 mag, 7 mag and 338, whereas, some people do also prefer weatherby mags. \r\n\r\nIn driven hunts, since the boars are mostly shot at shorter distances, as compared to hunts of other ungulates, one need not worry about the lead drop and heavier grainage may safely be used, like anything from 165 to 180 grain, yet, for stress free shoot, I would still prefer 125 to 150 grain. \r\n\r\nUnlike trophy hunting, since hunters like to shoot boars in big numbers, consideration of ammunition cost is also an important factor. In Pakistan, none of the above calibers are commonly available and if at all you find them with some dealer, they are quite expensive, whereas, 30-06 is the only caliber which is found easily and its price is also less than other calibers. For example, an imported cartridge of 270, 7mag, 300, 338 ..etc are available @ approx Rs 500 to Rs 1200 per cartridge. Whereas, 30-06 (east european brand) is available @ Rs 300 per cartridge. \r\n\r\nAnother cheaper ammo is of drangonov whose cartridge is approx Rs 40. And last but not the least, I''ve also seen people shooting boars with AK-47, (kalashinkov) whose ammo is commonly & cheaply available. \r\n\r\nThe 416 Rigby is meant for big game animals like Buffalo, Elephant, Hippo & Rhino ..etc and it''s too big a caliber for any bear specie. Personally, I beleive Rem 7MM Mag (130 - 170 grain) is an all rounder and covers a wide range of big game. \r\n\r\nIn order to be more precise, let me explain the technical (bookish) recommendation of right calibers for the right games as follows.\r\n\r\nIn America all games are classified into three categories as follows.\r\n\r\nCXP1 - Small Game / Varmints - Animals less than 50 lbs.- Squirrel, Fox, Coyotes, Javelin\r\nCXP2 - Average sized animals less than 200 lbs. - Goats/Sheep, Pronghorn, White-tailed deer, Mule Deer, Feral Hogs\r\nCXP3 - Large animals over 200 lbs. - Wild Boar, Caribou, Bear (Black, Brown, Grizzly), Elk\r\n\r\nThe experts ideally recommend the following calibers for the above game\r\n\r\nCXP1 - .22LR (36-37 grains), .223 (50 grains), .243 (80-95 grain), .257 (100 grain)\r\nCXP2 - .243 (95-100 grains), .260 (130-140 grains), .270 (130-180 grains), .308 (125-170 grains), .30-06 (130-180 grains)\r\nCXP3 - .308 (165-200 grains), 7mm Mag, (150-170 grains) .338 (225-250 grains), .350 (250 grain), .458 (250-350 grain)\r\n\r\nHaving read the above, please do not forget that we live in Pakistan and with all the imposed restrictions we cannot have shleves full of variety of weapons and boxes full of ammunition of all calibers. So with good marksmanship and smart hunting skills you can make the best use of your available gun & yet shoot a  variety of game with it. \r\n\r\nI sincerely hope my above comments will prove useful for my fellow hunters, however, we have many senior hunters on our panel who can throw further light on this subject & give their expert opinion.', ''),

(330802, ' Denovo and 12 G bro, this is a debate that has long been discussed in various circles. I being a .45 fan, have always loved the 1911 design. I own the good old Colt 1911 as well as a few newer models. The engine example is a very good one, but I like to think it this way, regardless of the past and current speeds of vehicles, they both operate on internal combustion engines, the basic principles are the same, but over time engineers have learned many things to improve on the basic design, but we must remember that the basic design and workings of the internal combustion engines are the same, from the day of their conception to this present day.\n\nSimilarly I believe that the 1911 platform was built for the .45  auto and the design etc has live a good old 100 years to prove that it works. Yes the newer 1911''s perform much better than the old 1911''s, but to this day 1911 platform remains to be one of the most solid and trusted firearm platform and design, and many many law enforcement agencies around the world use it as their duty weapon. Even if you look at the new CZs, Sigs, HKs etc, they are excellent weapons all of these weapons have borrowed one thing or another if not everything from the 1911 platform, one big example is the tight slide to frame fit, second is the action system, and so on.\n\nSo INMVHO the 1911 is a pinnacle in firearms, and I don''t think that it is going away anytime soon. Just my two cents. :)', ''),

(330815, ' @Abbas\r\n\r\nThanks Abbas Bhai. The latex gloves are for handling and cleaning of the work piece after it has been sprayed with CLP. I always recommend them because CLP/lubricants/gun cleaning solutions might have solvents in them that can enter into the blood stream through contact via skin. therefore it is always advised to used latex gloves whenever handling such chemicals. thing with latex gloves is that they are air tight and inside your hands sweat alot. therefore I tend to minimize the discomfort by only wearing them when i''m actually handling chemicals or chemical drenched work pieces. since the aerosol can directs the blast in a focused area therefore I was in no danger of contacting the chemicals therefore I chose not wear gloves for this part. I did however wear them when I scrubbed it with a tooth brush. And you are absolutely right, the best practice should have been that I wear gloves the whole time during this exercise.\r\n\r\nabout cleaning of the barrel. Abbas Bhai, that is probably the most easiest part in the initial cleaning of an over and under shotgun. all you need is a pull-through or a cleaning rod. some patches (no solvent necessary as it is a new shotgun) and just run it a couple of time through the bore and you are good to go. I will however start a new thread on cleaning a shotgun barrel that has just been fired. i''m thinking two processes at the same time. cleaning a barrel with a round count of 100 rounds (less messy operation) and a barrel with a round count of 1000 (a little tricky, slightly more messy).\r\n\r\nRegards.', ''),

(330873, 'Zigana T (Law Enforcement) Review Salams, \n\nFor quite some time I have been seeing the Zigana T (LEA) version at the range. It''s very much like the normal Zigana except everything :) \n\nThe LEA version as I understand were imported in limited quantities and were made to a much higher spec than the normal Zigana. The first difference is that these pistols were built for sustained auto fire. The metallurgy, parts and machining are excellent and there is a marked difference when compared to the semi auto version. Before I go on I must mention that although built for auto fire the one I have is a semi auto. \n\nThe pistol has a 5.1 inch barrel and weighs around 1000 g which is slightly less than twice the Glock 17''s weight. In this gun however the weight adds to the functionality instead of being a negative. The gun has an ambidextrous safety for cocked and locked carry mode which also acts as a decocker when moved further. The sights are fixed and rather large, I would have much preferred that this gun comes with adjustable sights. It comes with a Houge like wrap around grip which makes the gun quite comfortable to hold and the slide release control is easy to use and always accessible due to it''s large size. The magazine release button is unobtrusive/works well and the magazines drop out smoothly. The gun comes with two high capacity magazines holding 20 rounds each. Disassembly is simple akin the Beretta/Taurus 92/99. \n\nThe slide and frame fit is exceptionally good and the finish is  quite pleasing. What really makes this gun exceptional however is the single action trigger, it''s lovely & razor precise and pulls at the exact right moment every time. The single action pull should be around 3 pounds while double action is around a solid 10 pounds. I must mention again that the trigger is fantastic and can be compared to CZ''s Omega trigger system. The gun itself is very accurate, stays steady in your hands and is a joy to shoot. \n\nI took it to the range today for some testing and this is one of those guns that ensure you go back home smiling. \n\nSome pictures and range results. Targets were shot at 15 M.\n\n[IMG]http://i262.photobucket.com/albums/ii99/AbbasMalik/Zigana1.jpg[/IMG]\n\n[IMG]http://i262.photobucket.com/albums/ii99/AbbasMalik/Zigana2.jpg[/IMG]\n\n[IMG]http://i262.photobucket.com/albums/ii99/AbbasMalik/Zigana3.jpg[/IMG]\n\n[IMG]http://i262.photobucket.com/albums/ii99/AbbasMalik/Zigana4.jpg[/IMG]\n\n[IMG]http://i262.photobucket.com/albums/ii99/AbbasMalik/Zigana6.jpg[/IMG]\n\n[IMG]http://i262.photobucket.com/albums/ii99/AbbasMalik/Zigana5.jpg[/IMG]\n\n[IMG]http://i262.photobucket.com/albums/ii99/AbbasMalik/Zigana7.jpg[/IMG]\n\n[IMG]http://i262.photobucket.com/albums/ii99/AbbasMalik/Zigana8.jpg[/IMG]\n\n[IMG]http://i262.photobucket.com/albums/ii99/AbbasMalik/Zigana9.jpg[/IMG]\n\nThe last target was shot by Mr. Faisal Azad of LRC. \n\n[B]Verdict: Great gun, joy to own.[/B]\n\n[SIZE=2]On an ending note I would like to mention that I have heard some people making these pistol auto by installing an auto switch.

(330944, ' @alinawaz\r\n\r\nBro, CLP is infact a "cleaner, lubricant and a preservative" all rolled into one. the purpose of a CLP is to do all these jobs in a single application. a dedicated lubricant (without any solvents) is by far a much better option if lubrication is a primary concern which is not the case here. \r\n\r\nA shotgun''s (o/u or sxs) internals do not require that much of a lubrication to begin with as they do not face the high levels of load, stress, friction, speed and heat typically associated with semiautomatic firearms such as handguns or autoloader shotguns. \r\n\r\nTherefore in my humble opinion, all you need is a good quality preservative for rust protection. lubrication here is only a secondary concern. therefore any CLP is good enough for the job. Even with a CLP, the application has to be kept to a bare minimum as lubrication is only a secondary objective. with too much lubrication here, one runs the risk of oil seeping into the wood which in the long run can ruin the shotgun''s furniture through oil seeping into the wood.\r\n\r\n@Bilal Malik\r\n\r\nBro, Nasa Rusto-Nil is easily available at most hardware/auto parts shops at around PKR 200 per aerosol can. you can also use brunox as well as it is also a more popular and probably a better CLP. in a pinch WD40 is good enough too but for applications where extended period of time is involved WD40 has a tendency to gum-up.\r\n\r\nRegards.', ''),

I thought I should put all methods to the test and see if any of them make sense. \n\nI picked three different household cleaning products which I thought could be used to clean guns, the first and most obvious choice was hot water and soap (Lemon Max), the second being Glint which is a universal cleaner similar to Windex or Simple Green and the third was Nail Polish remover. \n\nI was determined only to use a single brush (the same for all guns) and cotton patches. \n\nThe products strike a pose:\n\n[IMG]http://i262.photobucket.com/albums/ii99/AbbasMalik/Cleaning1.jpg[/IMG]\n\nAssigning Guns to cleaning products: Glint went to the Zigana LEA, Lemon Max to CZ TS and the little Rami took the Nail Polish remover head on.\n\n[IMG]http://i262.photobucket.com/albums/ii99/AbbasMalik/Cleaning2.jpg[/IMG]\n\nSince this was an experiment, I was only interested in putting the toughest and the most messy parts of the gun, the barrel and recoil springs to the test. All were equally dirty.\n\n[IMG]http://i262.photobucket.com/albums/ii99/AbbasMalik/Cleaning3.jpg[/IMG]  \n\n\nThe TS went first in hot water around (80c) and 5ml of Lemon Max. \n\n[IMG]http://i262.photobucket.com/albums/ii99/AbbasMalik/Cleaning4.jpg[/IMG]\n\n\nRubba dub dub my Ts in the tub ;)\n\n[IMG]http://i262.photobucket.com/albums/ii99/AbbasMalik/Cleaning5.jpg[/IMG]\n\n\nRami''s barrel and springs went next and were soaked in Nail Polish remover:\n\n[IMG]http://i262.photobucket.com/albums/ii99/AbbasMalik/Cleaning6.jpg[/IMG]\n\n[IMG]http://i262.photobucket.com/albums/ii99/AbbasMalik/Cleaning7.jpg[/IMG]\n\n\nThe Zigana parts were initially only spayed and then soaked in Glint but that didn''t seem enough so I added hot water to the mix as well. \n\n[IMG]http://i262.photobucket.com/albums/ii99/AbbasMalik/Cleaning8.jpg[/IMG]\n\n\nAfter rinsing off with water and drying:\n\n[IMG]http://i262.photobucket.com/albums/ii99/AbbasMalik/Cleaning9.jpg[/IMG]', ''),

(331115, ' After drying, I was skeptical about the long last effects of these  chemicals on my gun barrels, they were also understandably over dry in  most places and moist in others. The best solution was to liberally  spray all parts with WD40. It acts as a cleaning, lubricating and  protective agent. \n\n[IMG]http://i262.photobucket.com/albums/ii99/AbbasMalik/Cleaning11.jpg[/IMG]\n\nPrior to WD40 I had run a clean cotton patch in each of the barrels to  see if any more grime came out, none did. I was interested to see how  much more of it I could remove from the barrels after them being soaked  in WD40. \n\n[IMG]http://i262.photobucket.com/albums/ii99/AbbasMalik/Cleaning12.jpg[/IMG]\n\nThat done I was not too pleased with any of the cleaning agents all the  more or less the same result. After running the above patches I used  clean ones and tried to remove more grime but all came out clean. Time  for the Hoppe''s test.\n\n[IMG]http://i262.photobucket.com/albums/ii99/AbbasMalik/Cleaning13.jpg[/IMG]\n\nThe same method which was applied with WD40 was used, clean patches with  a little Hoppes on the center was applied for 60 seconds on each of the  barrels. Results below:\n\n[IMG]http://i262.photobucket.com/albums/ii99/AbbasMalik/Cleaning14.jpg[/IMG]\n\nPretty much the same all across the board. The barrels afterwards.\n\n[IMG]http://i262.photobucket.com/albums/ii99/AbbasMalik/Cleaning15.jpg[/IMG]\n\n[B]\nConclusion:[/B] This was just an experiment to put all the various gun  cleaning theories to a practical test to see if any of them make sense.  Frankly they don''t, the time for soap and hot water cleaning ended with  mass availability of non corrosive ammo, Glint, Windex, Simple Green and  Nail Polish remover are no substitute for even a below average / cheap  gun cleaner like Diesel or WD40. \n\nDo it right the first time, use Hoppe''s, Brunox etc. \n\nHope you guys enjoyed this little experiment, it was done as much for amusement as for practical usage possibilities. \n\nThe "Anti Bacterial Cleaned" guns: ;)\n\n[IMG]http://i262.photobucket.com/albums/ii99/AbbasMalik/Cleaning16.jpg[/IMG]', ''),
