When you took your license for entry at the Commissioner''s office, the same gentleman would have signed it to evidence entry. \n\nA.H. Narejo, SO (Arms), signed your license when you extended the ''purchase period''. He would also have signed it if you increased the number of rounds or extended its validity to All Pakistan.\n\nAs for "HMQ", I am no expert on the workings of the Sindh Government but even if neither Mr Manzoor Wassan nor Dr Zulfiqar Mirza were holding the portfolio of Home Minister when your license was issued, I still do not see what the problem might have been.

And without any hesitation they said don''t worry and come here we will get your 144 permit (Very confident). I asked Adnan if they recently got 144 for other HMQ manual under-25 licenses and if he can show me, he said yes ofcourse! Rabbi also told me to come to his outlet and he will "relax me" :p\n\nSo I think I will go to one of those 2 mentioned dealers and apply for MOI (which is available for under 25), expect it in 3-5 months while get 144 permit issued with help of other dealer and stay put.

Mistakes are like ''varification'', patrol (petrol), latter (letter), then / than, accept / except etc.\n\nWhy I wasted my 2000? right question. But where did I say that I got cheated? He was not willing to get that money, but I insisted on payment and paid. I wasted my 2000 as I got this permit thing for the first time in my life. So being a newbie, I was much excited that I got a special permission for carrying weapons, even got successful in front of police during 144 imposed. But rangers didn''t accepted that letter, so got the specific 144 permit.\n\nI have just shared my experience as I have both the permits, so no newbie should waste his money like I did. If you are satisfied with that the ''all Pakistan life time carry permit'' (or policy letter ''whatever'') and you still feel that it is worth getting, decision is entirely yours. :)', ''),

(485336, ' @ Avais:  There are only 1 or 2 competitions for long range shooting in Karachi annually. So the platform would be multipurpose for me in that i would want to use it in hunting situations also. From what i have gathered a fine hunting barreled weapon (not the ultra lights)  would be just as accurate on the 1st and 2nd shot as a heavy barrel. Its only when the barrels start to heat up (due to shots in quick succession as we would on a target range) that the advantages of the bull barrel really come out to play wherein the regular hunting rifle''s groups would start to open up , typically upwards. You are right that the heavier weight of the bull barrel would also make shooting a little easier and recoil a little less also and that the target rifle would also come with other goodies such as a better target-shooting oriented stock and probably more ready-to-go fine tuning features such as a great trigger, free floated barrel, bedded action etc.\n\n So still contemplating and looking out for platforms available to buy.

(485357, '@ Tareen bhai Thank u for your compliments kind sir. Unfortunately my darned French keyboard seems to make me lose coherence. Evidently I have failed to express myself in a lucid manner.\n\nMy vew point is based on&#8217; physical&#8217; rather then &#8216;metaphysical&#8217; justifications. &#8216;Logical&#8217; rather than &#8216;theological&#8217; points. \n\nTheology incidentally is the science that studies religion. \n\nThe thing about [B]belief[/B] is that it accepts no rationale or logic. In fact these 2 concepts go out of the window the minute &#8220;belief&#8221; takes centre stage. Hence my cravat..  That religion should be kept out of such discussions\n\nBeliefs can justify just about everything irrespective of validation. Let us take the example of the &#8220;totenkopfverbände SS&#8221; The Death&#8217;s head! The most feared branch of the Nazi 3rd Reich&#8217;s armed forces. And the people directly responsible for the liquidation of non Aryan nations at Auschwitz  at Treblinka at myriad concentration camps&#8230; Though out the lands occupied by the German Reich. \n\nTheir belt buckles bore the logo: &#8220;God is with us&#8221;. U see by eliminating &#8220;vermin&#8221; they were doing God&#8217;s work!!\nRemember the Spanish inquisition?  For centuries the Roman catholic church actively liquidated heretics. His holiness the Pope himself had given it Papal sanction. The priests and bishops who carried out the mass burning were absolutely utterly convinced they were doing God&#8217;s workl.\n\nCloser to our own home and times. I have came across multiple people including a close blood relative who was convinced that it is our &#8216;sacred&#8217; duty to liquidate certain members  of certain sects. \n\nThere are millions who believe so. Are they all wrong? No The pope and the priest were not wrong. Hiter and his SS were not wrong. The hairy barbarians who blow up schools and mosqes are not wrong either. Why?? \n\nBecause they &#8220;BELIEVE&#8221; that they are right..  End of story. \n\nThe German nation applauded the cleansing of &#8216;vermin&#8217; (read non Aryan peoples).  Large parts of our population actively aid and abet the cleansing of certain members of our population. \n\nIn our neck of the woods yours is the dominant narrative hence I am sure 90% of the people don&#8217;t even bother to read what I write.  Learnt sages  such as Plato, Aristotle,  Madison, The Frenchman Monsieur Tocquivvile et el Called it &#8220;The tyranny of the majority&#8221; . I have a simpler term. \n\n[B][I] Piety-though-mass-slaughter&#8221;.[/I][/B]\n\nThe idea of equating humans to crows will certainly seem ludicrous to many. However the point  I am trying to make is that it&#8217;s the mindset of the narrative that is essentially the same in all the examples above.. Including  am afraid..   yours as well.   \n\n I have not had the honour or the privilege of observing kites. But as an aspiring amateur ornithologist I have spent a considerable period of time studying crows and they are a &#8220;sentient species&#8221;. There is no doubt about it. If U want I can give u multiple personal examples based on my own primary data rather than ancillary sources such as books or the net. \n \nI asked u what will be the effect of obliteration of entire species to the global ecosystem. In fact gave detailed scenarios. U  blithely ignored them and gave me .. well.. more (for want of a better term) &#8220;textual&#8221; answers rather then&#8221; factual&#8221; ones.  \n\nI am asking u once again. How do [B]&#8220;You&#8221;[/B] think the global ecosystem will benefit once u take away its primary scavengers? \n\nI gave u my concept of what will happen when they disappear. Now I want your answer as to the supposed benefits to the ''real term global environment; rather than as an esoteric textual construct. The disposal of 10s of billions of bodies.. How to deal with the  flies and the maggots? Who will take their place as scavengers and clear organic waste? Humans.. Again how?\n\nRemember &#8220;each and every action has an equal and opposite reaction&#8221;  And every species has a role to play..   \n\nStill not getting through Sir?\n\n If not please let me know?  I will endeavour to elucidate my viewpoint in a more concise manner with more factual information. Including from this forum as well...\n\nTailpiece: Since U prefer rhetoric to rationale.

Collected few hunting rifles with adjustable or hair lock trigger features. Last Sunday I took my .270 wichester XTR feather weight to the range and played 6 shots in less than 5 minutes from 200 meters and achieved 53/60. Though it was not a good score as far as the target shooting is concerned but it was not bad to the hunter''s point of view. After the 3rd shot the barrel of the rifle was heated and understanding the fact that its cooling time is more than the bull barrel i took a break of exactly one minute and played the remaining 3 shots quickly. \nIn your situation if you can get hold on fluted barrel with adjustable trigger features, it would be wonderful deal both for hunting and target shooting needs.', ''),

(485473, ' [h=2]AIR RIFLE REVIEW: WEIHRAUCH HW80: A POWERHOUSE CLASSIC [B]MARK CAMOCCIO gets his hands on some sizeable German hardware[/B][/h][COLOR=#000000][FONT=Verdana]IN TRUTH, I''m a patriotic sort of chap: if a product exists that''s as good or better than its rivals, and it''s British-made, then I''ll try and go for it. OK, it also has to be realistically priced, but it makes sense to support British industry where possible.[/FONT][/COLOR]\n[COLOR=#000000][FONT=Verdana]Of course, this policy has to be shelved now and then, and while our pneumatic airguns often rule the roost, cost-cutting and sheer economics have seen much of the spring-powered market shift production abroad.[/FONT][/COLOR]\n[COLOR=#000000][FONT=Verdana]With the advent of Field Target Shooting back in the 1980s, we simply had no choice (at the top end anyway) and tooling up with German hardware was the key if silverware was the goal; the likes of Anschutz, Weihrauch and my old favourite Feinwerkbau Sport just about cleaning up. Even today, if a top-quality break-barrel rifle is on the shortlist, then good old Weihrauch still takes some beating.[/FONT][/COLOR]\n[COLOR=#000000][FONT=Verdana]While Anschutz and Feinwerkbau sadly dropped their spring-powered models, for one reason or another, Weihrauch has gone from strength to strength.[/FONT][/COLOR]\n[COLOR=#000000][FONT=Verdana]This German giant has built up an enviable reputation for the solid construction and beautiful finish of its products, and my test rifle here is the relative heavy weight classic- HW80.[/FONT][/COLOR]\n[COLOR=#000000][FONT=Verdana]Break-barrel in design, the HW80 was always over engineered, with an abnormally wide main cylinder. The designers clearly had one eye on the FAC market when they penned the original blueprint, and the HW80 is the supreme candidate for customising and modifying to over-the-limit status.[/FONT][/COLOR]\n[COLOR=#000000][FONT=Verdana]The bold dimensions come at a price, and that weight of 8.6lbs, certainly puts the HW80 in the upper bracket for heft, making it one of Weihrauch''s heaviest break-barrels.[/FONT][/COLOR]\n[COLOR=#000000][FONT=Verdana]Primarily launched as a hunting rifle, it soon became clear that the performance (especially when expertly tuned) could be useful in those outdoor competitions too, and it''s this quality, coupled with the sheer engineering integrity of the brand, that makes this model such a classic.\n[B]\n[IMG]http://www.targetsportsmagazine.com/js/tiny_mce/plugins/imagemanager/files/2007/December_07_/POWERHOUSE_CLASSIC/26-27-1.jpg[/IMG]Refined powerhouse[/B][/FONT][/COLOR]\n[COLOR=#000000][FONT=Verdana]Today''s HW80 doesn''t quite have the same aggressive profile as the early model but it''s still the same powerhouse underneath, with the same mouth-watering spec list.[/FONT][/COLOR]\n[COLOR=#000000][FONT=Verdana]Stock-wise, it comes fitted with an attractive beech stock as standard. Weihrauch doesn''t seem to entertain the idea of custom walnut stocks on its springers these days, preferring to leave this side of things to the after-market specialist outlets.[/FONT][/COLOR]\n[COLOR=#000000][FONT=Verdana]However, the quality of beech used is of a pleasingly high standard, displaying a fair amount of grain pattern through the medium brown lacquer.[/FONT][/COLOR]\n[COLOR=#000000][FONT=Verdana]Shape-wise, the profile follows a fairly conventional `sporter` configuration and is admittedly something of a compromise, since it allows for open-sight use and the ever-likely addition of glassware. A modestly raised cheekpiece does the job, but just feels a fraction low for scope use. To be fair, it`s hard to be all things to all men, but realistically, is anyone actually going to buy one of these rifles and not fit a scope? I wouldn''t have thought so, and hunting with open sights is surely best left to those skilled in their use. Maybe Weihrauch has done its marketing and knows otherwise.[/FONT][/COLOR]\n[COLOR=#000000][FONT=Verdana]The sporter-style pistol-grip is treated to a panel of chequering on each side to aid grip, and was well executed on the test model, although maybe not quite as deeply as on a Weihrauch of old.[/FONT][/COLOR]\n[COLOR=#000000][FONT=Verdana]The forend is near parallel-sided, yet ends in an annoyingly practical rounded tip. Call me a bore, but it just doesn''t compare with that starkly angular design on the original - OK; this is more comfortable in the aim, but what''s that got to do with it![/FONT][/COLOR]\n[COLOR=#000000][FONT=Verdana]Actually, in the aim, this `80 is a beauty; the front heavy bias giving near perfect balance- aided in no small measure to that whopping 16" barrel. Comparatively, it''s not actually that long; it just seems so when compared to all those trendy carbines of late.[/FONT][/COLOR]\n[COLOR=#000000][FONT=Verdana]Those open sights, incidentally, are nicely made, being of metal construction. The rearsight is fully adjustable for windage and elevation, via a sprung leaf, and a reversible notch-style is an added feature. The foresight is particularly neat, with interchangeable elements easily swapped via the standard screw-on front; giving the owner the best of both worlds.[/FONT][/COLOR]\n[COLOR=#000000][FONT=Verdana]I''m the first to appreciate that quality ‘iron sights'' are an education in the basics, promoting a consistent, disciplined approach and well worthwhile for newcomers - but this is no novice rifle! That said; if open sights excite, then they don''t come much better appointed than these.[/FONT][/COLOR]\n[COLOR=#000000][FONT=Verdana]One key feature that the much - lauded `80 has over its older stable mate-the HW35, is a single-piece cocking linkage. The HW35 developed something of a reputation for spooking the rabbits when hunting, with the ‘click'' produced by the articulated two-part link.[/FONT][/COLOR]\n[COLOR=#000000][FONT=Verdana]The HW80 basically streamlines the design, and coupled with the classic Weihrauch slotted cross bolt at the breech, a more positive barrel `lock-up` would be difficult to find.[/FONT][/COLOR]\n[COLOR=#000000][FONT=Verdana]The whole finish to the metalwork is up to standard, with the traditional chemical blueing that is both even and lustrous.[/FONT][/COLOR]\n[COLOR=#000000][FONT=Verdana][B]Rekord trigger unit[/B][/FONT][/COLOR]\n[COLOR=#000000][FONT=Verdana][IMG]http://www.targetsportsmagazine.com/js/tiny_mce/plugins/imagemanager/files/2007/December_07_/POWERHOUSE_CLASSIC/26-27-2B.jpg[/IMG]The famous Weihrauch ‘Rekord'' trigger unit comes fitted to the `80, and while no match unit, it still has few rivals (other than Air Arms) in this sporting spring-gun class. Adjustment is there for those who possess the knack (not myself, I hasten to add), and when carried out and set-up by the specialists, this unit is both crisp and reasonably light. This test model (supplied in .22 for the record) came factory-set, with the trigger release maybe a fraction heavier than I''m used to; totally crisp and predictable nonetheless.[/FONT][/COLOR]\n[COLOR=#000000][FONT=Verdana]Weihrauch''s usual automatic button safety catch (pretty well standard across the range) is easily thumbed off from the left hand rear of the cylinder, and whilst occasionally irritating, is well-positioned and easily dealt with.[/FONT][/COLOR]\n[COLOR=#000000][FONT=Verdana]Fitting a scope is child''s play on the HW80, with lengthy dovetail rails, and several arrestor stud-retaining holes machined into the receiver.[/FONT][/COLOR]\n[COLOR=#000000][FONT=Verdana]On the range, and over the chronograph, this large calibre sporter returned near textbook energy figures; with the best pellet proving to be JSBs. I tried Superdomes but they proved too slack in the barrel on this particular example.[/FONT][/COLOR]\n[COLOR=#000000][FONT=Verdana]The JSBs returned variation over a 10-shot string, of 18fps, and accuracy was equally impressive, with five-shot groups of 5/16" the norm at 30yd.[/FONT][/COLOR]\n[COLOR=#000000][FONT=Verdana]Although some oil was clearly burning off as the rifle fired (perfectly normal for a new rifle of this type), the action felt both crisp and surprisingly quick. The recoil was more of a snap, and there was very little spring resonance, so a pleasant experience at the end of the day.[/FONT][/COLOR]\n[COLOR=#000000][FONT=Verdana][IMG]http://www.targetsportsmagazine.com/js/tiny_mce/plugins/imagemanager/files/2007/December_07_/POWERHOUSE_CLASSIC/26-27-2.jpg[/IMG][/FONT][/COLOR]\n[COLOR=#000000][FONT=Verdana][B]Conclusions[/B][/FONT][/COLOR]\n[COLOR=#000000][FONT=Verdana]Overall, The HW80 is something of a timeless classic; a powerhouse for those with the legal paperwork in place, or just a solid, no-nonsense sporting rifle that''s surprisingly versatile.[/FONT][/COLOR]\n[COLOR=#000000][FONT=Verdana]Obviously, it''s equally at home in the field, but with Hunter Field Target Shooting also including a dedicated spring-gun class, not to mention the .22 class, the HW80 is a worthy addition to any air rifle enthusiast''s shortlist.[/FONT][/COLOR]', ''),

The prices differs from few thousands to 30-40 thousands and more. There is also a shop in Bahadurabad by the name of Tactical Arms, he also have a good collection of Gerber knives. \n\nOr, if you want Bear Gryll knives, they are available from Salman Qadeer at Corel Hunting in Lahore and he can courier to you the knives in Karachi as well.

There is a regulator in front marked ''1'' and ''2''. One is for normal cartridges and the other is for shooting magnum powered cartridges. If the setting is on the magnum setting, the gun will not cycle properly when shooting normal cartridges. Just in case this happens, there is no need to panic. just change the setting. At this point i do not recall if ''1'' is the normal load setting or if it is ''2''. It should say so in the manual.

In the newer berettas this has been taken seriously.. and they have cut the lock as well as removed it from that place in many models from the slide to frame itself.\n\nOnce you see the Practical shooting you will want to do it.. that is where all the short comings will take the toll on you.

I asked why? He replied that Custom & Excise Monitor the site and he will have to pay Tax. hahahahhaa\nSo all I will say is this, If Para is on your left then the second to last shop on your left.

After 2 hours of Bargaining the basic Saiga Price 110,000pk & Saiga 12c 122,000pk. My friend also manage to get 2 boxs of Shaheen Cartridges No: 6 & SG slugs FREE yes FREE. The dealer has only One Left and he said due to the very very sad situation of Karachi, his guns are stuck in Dock yards. Do Dua plenty of Duas that the situation becomes better and Imports open. I know there are a couple of other dealers who do have Saiga 12 but are demanding 140k or more.

(485778, 'Finally bought 9mm Hand Gun Assalam alaikum everyone,\nI am new to this forum as you would see from my posts but trust me I have been silent reader of this forum ever since I started thinking of purchasing a gun.\nSo basically I went to the dealer and checked the guns with him, as I am new to this, I wasn''t aware that I needed a licence to purchase a gun. I thought I would purchase a gun first and then make a licence but the dealer actually shaterred my dreams when he said he can''t do it this way. But to my relief he said he would make the licence for me in a month time at the most. So I gave him the full money for two licences (handgun and shortgun), somehow I started trusting the guy. While I was waiting for the licences I have been reading this forum almost every day. So finally I short listed CZ75 and Vepr 12 Molot. Talked to the dealer on phone after a month, as I live in RWP, and he said licences are ready. So I went a couple of days earlier to Pesh., and checked the handguns first, CZ75 family. When he showed me the CZ75 New Edition (Silver body and wooden look hand grip) I said that is it, I couldn''t resist and said to him I want this one, the price he said was 125k for the handgun but after some negotiations he gave me some discount, nice guy I must say.\nUnfortunately, the Vepr 12 wasn''t available with him at that time all sold out but he said he is expecting delivery in the next week so another trip to pesh., I guess in the next week. The Hand GUn came in a box with one spare magzine, one brush manual and one plasticy thing for cleaning the barrel I guess. I asked the dealer to show me how to clean the gun. He said the only thing you can do is just cleane the barrel with the brusk or may be cotton bud and don''t open the gun as it would be difficult for you to assemble it again. Although I am not that naive I have cleaned my 30 bore handgun many times by disassembling and then assembling. Anyway, I am just an enthusiastic not a regular shooter.\nBy the way the licences were issued by the Home Dept. KPK but there was stamp and Signature of DCO office as well with 25 bullets limit. Both the licences have been Validated for All Pakistan though. The dealer said once you purchase the gun, it would again be registered with the DCO office in Pesh. I didn''t have time as I have to come back so he offered me the service, and I asked him to increase the bullets number as well. So I have sent have the licence to day by TCS hopefully he would get it on Monday and do the job for me. He said a charge of Rs. 40 would incur per bullet. I hope that is done too when I go next time to purchase the Vepr. Forgot to mention that I have bought bullets with it as well Chezk Republic bullets Rs 50 each.\nPictures of the guns are somewhere on this forum I think, but if you want to see I''ll try to upload in a few days time.\nThanks everyone, and thanks to this forum for guiding me to the right direction.', ''),

(485830, ' hi Gunda Bacha,  thanks for your reply. but there are some things you must know, firstly, Walther Dominator FT .22 cal is around 900 US $$ plus, \n\nthus, one of the most powerful and accurate long range PCP rifle in market.  A good value for money.\nhere is some details and information which might be helpful.\n\n[B]Pressure & bar:[/B]\nIts Cylinder can hold upto 350 bar pressure max. and from 300 to 140 bars, it can shot with same FPS of and range because of seperate chamber. where the pressure is remained. 100 shots in total.\n\nsecondly, CNG means ( compressed natural gas) which is high inflamable (never use it, its gona burn you and ur gun alive ), CNG Bar pressure is between 180 to 240 max. whereas, its PCP Cylinder can hold pressure upto 350 Bars. Recommended pressure is 300 Bars-140 bars underwhich you can have accurate and long range shot.\nNote: Never use oxygen, Co2 or any other gas, always use flitered dry atmospheric gas to get PCP cylinders filled. Otheriwse you will destory ur weapon. for Co2, there are seperate carteriges or cylinders as recomended by its company.\n\nthirdly, Lahore Shooting Club does have PCP filling facility but for members and it costs 25k membership fee, and they refill it with 200 bars max. \n\nfourthly, hand pump isnt a good idea at all, it needs 400 pumps to get to almost 200 bars and as bars increase effort to pump increases ( very intensive labor required to fill) implies on all PCPs\n\n[B]Accuracy and Range:[/B]\nNow come to real world senairo. You have 8 shots in its round. with the range of 25-60 meters you can shoot 8 birds, never gona miss any. so with 100 shots means 100 birds. its plenty for a day. Isnt it?\n[I]why i assumed above senario ? please read below[/I]\nIts meant for long range thats why the Scope its 8-32 x, which means one can target something which is 8 times far from you. Normally the scopes used for .22 caliber air guns are 3-9x. It has good powerful telescope, its range is 320 Meters, which is again 300 yards plus, this means it can accurately shoot till there. \n[B]\nPoweR & Quality:[/B]\nas mentioned above, it starts from 300 Bars and ends at 140bars (recomended for .22 caliber to refill) for 40 Joules pressure . its one most powerful air gun, as compered with discovery, it can be compered with bejimen rifles only.\nIts cylinder have life expentancy of 10 years. after that it needs a service and replacement of its cylinders.\nYeah one more thing, one cannt hear a thing (gun fire sound) who is 10 meters fars. So, GAME/PLIKING wont hear a thing when you shoot and wont fly becuz you are far from them. 1250 has a compensator cum silencer which increases its velocity and decreases its sound. \n\nit has zero recoil and very low sound.  \n[B]\nPricing:[/B]\nBuying a good airgun is not everyday job, its kinda once in a lifetime thing for me when one grows up or leaves the teenage ( teenagers should go for .177 (4.5mm) and should buy pump rifles of daisy or crossman for target practicing)\nDiana (break Barrel) or any other with side lever are old tech guns, one should go for the latest and approved technology air guns. PCPs are new and are better than Co2 even, because its easier to maintain and with almost no maintaince except oiling once a week or once in a month.\nthus, for Murgabi, pigions etc even wildboar & jackals(head shots) can be killed with ease. so, for having 100% results paying some extra bucks /Rupees isnt an issue. \n\nIt Costs around 100k ( one Lakh) rupees while discovery with pump is about 80 K. \n\n\nThus, thats what i come across, after reading reviews on differenct country blogs and some market OOGLING in Lahore, I personally find it best and It made me think ZILLION Times before going and making a purchase of WALTHER 1250 Dominator FT for 1 Lakh Rupees, Today, Alhumdolillah \n\nlast, about refilling the PCP Cylinder at 300 Bars exact, i m looking a proper way. IF any PCP owner Knows how to get it done cheaply in Lahore please do inform me, else i  m gona post it inshallah as well.\nAnyone can contact me for more details at 0321 8787333. I searched almost 90% of websites, read reviews internationally regarding PCP rifles and their performances. and i personally think its a good value for Money. thats all.', ''),

(485914, 'mathematics of big game hunting TITLE: Mathematics of Big Game Hunting\r\nFrom: [email]davepat@olivej.olivetti.com[/email] (David Patterson)\r\nNewsgroups: rec.humor,sci.math,sci.physics\r\nSubject: Math Humor, or Lion Hunting...\r\nKeywords: Math and Physics and Lions, Oh My!\r\nMessage-ID: <41856@oliveb.olivetti.com>\r\nDate: 17 May 89 00:42:20 GMT\r\nSender: [email]news@oliveb.olivetti.com[/email]\r\nFollowup-To: rec.humor\r\nLines: 161\r\n\r\nWRT the strange stuff I''ve seen on the net lately, here is some very strange \r\nstuff I came across a while back:\r\n\r\n"The following is from a book whose title I don''t recall. The book is\r\nin German but the article is actually a translation from the original\r\nby H. Petard which appared in the American Monthly 54, 466 (1938).\r\nUnfortunately our library is lacking some years of this journal \r\naround WW 2, so I had to re-translate the stuff into English.  (That\r\nwill make you people share the experience of reading German\r\ntranslations of books on Einstein which also usually \r\nre-translate Einstein''s words :-) ).\r\n\r\nA Contribution to the Mathematical Theory of Big Game Hunting\r\n=============================================================\r\n\r\nProblem: To Catch a Lion in the Sahara Desert.\r\n\r\n1. Mathematical Methods\r\n\r\n1.1 The Hilbert (axiomatic) method\r\n\r\nWe place a locked cage onto a given point in the desert.  After that we\r\nintroduce the following logical system:\r\n   Axiom 1: The set of lions in the Sahara is not empty.\r\n   Axiom 2: If there exists a lion in the Sahara, then there exists a lion in\r\n            the cage.\r\n   Procedure: If P is a theorem, and if the following is holds:\r\n              "P implies Q", then Q is a theorem.\r\n   Theorem 1: There exists a lion in the cage.\r\n\r\n1.2 The geometrical inversion method\r\n\r\nWe place a spherical cage in the desert, enter it and lock it from inside. We\r\nthen perform an inversion with respect to the cage. Then the lion is inside\r\nthe cage, and we are outside.\r\n\r\n1.3 The projective geometry method\r\n\r\nWithout loss of generality we can view the desert as a plane surface. We\r\nproject the surface onto a line and afterwards the line onto an interior point\r\nof the cage. Thereby the lion is mapped onto that same point.\r\n\r\n1.4 The Bolzano-Weierstrass method\r\n\r\nDivide the desert by a line running from north to south. The lion is then\r\neither in the eastern or in the western part. Lets assume it is in the eastern\r\npart. Divide this part by a line running from east to west. The lion is either\r\nin the northern or in the southern part. Let''s assume it is in the northern\r\npart. We can continue this process arbitrarily and thereby constructing with\r\neach step an increasingly narrow fence around the selected area. The diameter\r\nof the chosen partitions converges to zero so that the lion is caged into a\r\nfence of arbitrarily small diameter.\r\n\r\n1.5 The set theoretical method\r\n\r\nWe observe that the desert is a separable space.  It therefore contains an\r\nenumerable dense set of points which constitutes a sequence with the lion as\r\nits limit. We silently approach the lion in this sequence, carrying the proper\r\nequipment with us.\r\n\r\n1.6 The Peano method\r\n\r\nIn the usual way construct a curve containing every point in the desert. It has\r\nbeen proven [1] that such a curve can be traversed in arbitrarily short time.\r\nNow we traverse the curve, carrying a spear, in a time less than what it takes\r\nthe lion to move a distance equal to its own length.\r\n\r\n1.7 A topological method\r\n\r\nWe observe that the lion possesses the topological gender of a torus. We embed\r\nthe desert in a four dimensional space.  Then it is possible to apply a\r\ndeformation [2] of such a kind that the lion when returning to the three\r\ndimensional space is all tied up in itself. It is then completely helpless.\r\n\r\n1.8 The Cauchy method\r\n\r\nWe examine a lion-valued function f(z). Be \\zeta the cage. Consider the integral\r\n\r\n           1    [   f(z)\r\n        ------- I --------- dz\r\n        2 \\pi i ] z - \\zeta\r\n\r\n                C\r\n\r\nwhere C represents the boundary of the desert. Its value is f(zeta), i.e. there\r\nis a lion in the cage [3].\r\n\r\n1.9 The Wiener-Tauber method\r\n\r\nWe obtain a tame lion,  L_0, from the class L(-\\infinity,\\infinity),  whose\r\nFourier transform vanishes nowhere. We put this lion somewhere in the desert.\r\nL_0 then converges toward our cage. According to the general Wiener-Tauner\r\ntheorem [4] every other lion L will converge toward the same cage.\r\n(Alternatively we can approximate L arbitrarily close by translating L_0\r\nthrough the desert [5].)\r\n\r\n2 Theoretical Physics Methods\r\n\r\n2.1 The Dirac method\r\n\r\nWe assert that wild lions can ipso facto not be observed in the Sahara desert.\r\nTherefore, if there are any lions at all in the desert, they are tame. We leave\r\ncatching a tame lion as an execise to the reader.\r\n\r\n2.2 The Schroedinger method\r\n\r\nAt every instant there is a non-zero probability of the lion being in the cage.\r\nSit and wait.\r\n\r\n2.3 The nuclear physics method\r\n\r\nInsert a tame lion into the cage and apply a Majorana exchange operator [6] on\r\nit and a wild lion.\r\n\r\nAs a variant let us assume that we would like to catch (for  argument''s sake) a\r\nmale lion. We insert a tame female lion into the cage  and apply the Heisenberg\r\nexchange operator [7], exchanging spins.\r\n\r\n2.4 A relativistic method\r\n\r\nAll over the desert we distribute lion bait containing large amounts of the\r\ncompanion star  of Sirius. After enough of the bait has been eaten we send a\r\nbeam of light through the desert. This will curl around the lion so it gets all\r\nconfused and can be approached without danger.\r\n\r\n3 Experimental Physics Methods\r\n\r\n3.1 The thermodynamics method\r\n\r\nWe construct a semi-permeable membrane which lets everything but lions pass\r\nthrough. This we drag across the desert.\r\n\r\n3.2 The atomic fission method\r\n\r\nWe irradiate the desert with slow neutrons. The lion becomes radioactive and\r\nstarts to diintegrate. Once the disintegration process is progressed far enough\r\nthe lion will be unable to resist.\r\n\r\n3.3 The magneto-optical method\r\n\r\nWe plant a large, lens shaped field with cat mint (nepeta cataria) such that\r\nits  axis is parallel to the direction  of the horizontal component of the\r\nearth''s magnetic field. We put the cage in one of the field''s foci. Throughout\r\nthe desert we distribute large amounts of magnetized spinach (spinacia\r\noleracea) which has, as everybody knows, a  high iron content. The spinach is\r\neaten by vegetarian desert inhabitants which in turn are eaten by the lions.\r\nAfterwards the lions are oriented parallel to the earth''s magnetic field and\r\nthe resulting lion beam is focussed on the cage by the cat mint lens.\r\n\r\n[1] After Hilbert, cf. E. W. Hobson, "The Theory of Functions of a Real\r\n    Variable and the Theory of Fourier''s Series" (1927), vol. 1, pp 456-457\r\n[2] H. Seifert and W. Threlfall, "Lehrbuch der Topologie" (1934), pp 2-3\r\n[3] According to the Picard theorem (W. F. Osgood, Lehrbuch der\r\n    Funktionentheorie, vol 1 (1928), p 178) it is possible to catch every lion\r\n    except for at most one.\r\n[4] N.

(486109, 'visit to pre-historic path of river indus. the hamal lake The hectic schedule impeded me to to go for a hunting since the season started, thus \nI could not resist the planning of my friends to go for one on this Saturday being a holiday. This time , the venue selected for hunting was a famous hunting site nemed &#8220; Hamal Lake&#8221;. \n this Lake is situated in the arid zone of Sindh called as the &#8220;Kachho&#8221; in Sindhi. The subject area located in upper Sindh is mainly consisting upon &#8220;Kheerthar &#8221;mountain range which starts from the western side of District Kamber-Shahdadkot (part of old District Larkano) and reaches sea shores of Sindh by crossing through old Dadu District . The word &#8220; Kachho&#8221; is derived from the Sindhi word &#8220;Kachh&#8221; means &#8220;Lap&#8221; . The reason behind this name seems to be the location of this area as this area is situated in the &#8220;Kachh&#8221; or in the &#8220;lap&#8221; of &#8220;Kheerthar &#8220; mountain range . The word &#8220;Kheerthar&#8221; is also a fascinating word having the meaning of &#8220; Cream of the Milk&#8221; ( that we usually see in fresh milk immediately after milking a she Camel or cow or after boiling the milk ). This name , &#8220;Kheerthar&#8221; has probably taken its origin from the shape of hills found in this particular mountain range . This area , the &#8220; Kachho&#8221; occupies a very unique status not only in the geography but also in history of Sindh. Geographically , this area houses the tallest  mountain peak of Sindh named &#8220; Kutte-ji-Kabar " ( there is a folk lore behind this name) this peek is 6780 feet in height from sea level while the height of queeta is 6000 feet, hence the highest peak of sindh. This  area is mostly inhabited  by chandio tribe which  mainly   resides in district kamber - shahdadkot right from the times of Dooleh Darya Khan, the genaral of Jamm NIzamuddin Sammo , the true  founder of Samma Dynesty in sindh . Samma dynesty is the 2nd dynesty founded by locals of Sindhis after fall of arab rule in sindh. (the soomra dynesty was the first). Dooleh Darya Khan granted a very vast area to chandios as" jagir "on the eastern side of sindh , sharing a common border with balochestan . the area comprises of kheerthar mountain ranges. Darya kahn entrusted the chandios with a task of guarding sindh from the invasions from western side , which they performed excellently, however darya khan was killed fighting those invaders in lower Sindh and is buried in a magnificent Maqbara in makli hills thatta , where the Mausoleum of his mentor Jam Nezamuddin Sammo is not very far from it. The area where this lake is situated is the part of old historical and abandoned River bed of mighty river Indus . Not only this, but this area has remained the seat of pre-historic human settlements and there are many spots where the cave complexes where the pre-historic humans lived, are discovered. I am of the view that since in that era, there was no control over the flow of river Indus, thus, these hilly areas were most suitable and safe spots for human dwellings as they benefited from the riches of the river and  remain protected in floods as well  . This is an irony that we have forgotten that this area has once belonged to Mighty river Indus and we  build cities, Towns , canals and roads on this historical path. But the memory of  Indus is not weak enough  forget this and it claimed its right over its historical Bed back in 2010 . When i heard  in 2010 that Indus has freed itself from the bounds of  &#8220; Flood Protection Band&#8221; at the spot of &#8220; Torri Band&#8221; i knew that Sindhoo ( Local name of River Indus) is just few days away from visiting its old domain situated  in Kachho . I told everyone in my circle that the last line of defense against the unprecedented flood were the banks of Begari Canal and as i red the breaking news scrolls that Indus water is over-topping  Begari Canal , i knew that last fortress against  the agony of Indus has been lost and there is no possibility to avert the   destruction of the entire right bank as there is nothing that  could stop Indus from reverting to its original and pre-historic path and it happened just as i feared   . In those days the Indus took its historical course by paving the way on its forgotten foot prints in the areas of District Jacobabad, Kandhkot-Kashmore,  Shikarpur, Kamber-shahdadkot ( the area under discussion) dadu(Manchhar Lake)right up to its end / fall in sea in District Thatta . This area is again is facing the wounds at the hands of flood waters that entered Sindh  due to the torrential rains on Balochistan Heights as  the water has ultimately to follow this historical path.  \nWe arrived at the village of our Friends , stayed a night there and in pre-dawn hours we left for our hide which was a perfect for the purpose being feeding ground for birds and a natural Island like spot not far from the banks. We were armed with the decoys, coffee flasks and of course shot guns.I took along my BRNO model 2 , .22lr rifle scoped with a redfield 4-12x40 scope too as due to its laser-like accuracy, i have become  an addict of shooting it. The hunt was a success indeed. After exhausting every possibility to find birds on that spot , we carried the kill of the day in the boats to reach at our base camp. After having a breakfast, we decided to have a boat hunt too and proceeded in two boats. The boat i was sitting in was driven by a comparatively inexperienced boatman who proved his incompetence in handling his boat when, after taking some ugly jolts it capsized  in deep waters and we , who were thinking that boatman would handle it easily , find ourselves in  deep freezing   water with our guns disappearing in the depth of the lake .we were, however,  rescued within seconds by the second boat and our guns were salvaged within no time too. I was not worried about my Baikal MP 153 being a rough tough Russian shot gun, neither i was much worried about any damage to BRNO Mod 2 as they didn&#8217;t remain submerged for even one complete minute , i was concerned about my Redfield scope. I remembered that it was said to be waterproof in the papers it contained in its packaging but i was a bit skeptical. I was much relaxed to see it completely safe after i gave it an emergency cleaning  when i got hold of the rifle. It worked excellently and flawlessly  for the rest of the day as i deliberately pushed it to its limits with a view to find out any possible damage caused by the water but there was none by the grace of Allah. I can say for sure now that the quality of Redfield scopes is outstanding. The only loss i regret was of my cell phone which refused to work and to be energized thus resulting in the loss of pictures of the event i took with a view of sharing with all of you friends over here. The pics shared here are taken by my hunting buddy.\nThe land on the other side of lake is invisible.

(486199, ' [QUOTE=Enigmatic Desires;323500]Thank u for your compliments kind sir. Unfortunately my darned French keyboard seems to make me lose coherence. Evidently I have failed to express myself in a lucid manner.\n\nMy vew point is based on’ physical’ rather then ‘metaphysical’ justifications. ‘Logical’ rather than ‘theological’ points. \n\nTheology incidentally is the science that studies religion. \n\nThe thing about [B]belief[/B] is that it accepts no rationale or logic. In fact these 2 concepts go out of the window the minute “belief” takes centre stage. Hence my cravat..  That religion should be kept out of such discussions\n\nBeliefs can justify just about everything irrespective of validation. Let us take the example of the “totenkopfverbände SS” The Death’s head! The most feared branch of the Nazi 3rd Reich’s armed forces. And the people directly responsible for the liquidation of non Aryan nations at Auschwitz  at Treblinka at myriad concentration camps… Though out the lands occupied by the German Reich. \n\nTheir belt buckles bore the logo: “God is with us”. U see by eliminating “vermin” they were doing God’s work!!\nRemember the Spanish inquisition?  For centuries the Roman catholic church actively liquidated heretics. His holiness the Pope himself had given it Papal sanction. The priests and bishops who carried out the mass burning were absolutely utterly convinced they were doing God’s workl.\n\nCloser to our own home and times. I have came across multiple people including a close blood relative who was convinced that it is our ‘sacred’ duty to liquidate certain members  of certain sects. \n\nThere are millions who believe so. Are they all wrong? No The pope and the priest were not wrong. Hiter and his SS were not wrong. The hairy barbarians who blow up schools and mosqes are not wrong either. Why?? \n\nBecause they “BELIEVE” that they are right..  End of story. \n\nThe German nation applauded the cleansing of ‘vermin’ (read non Aryan peoples).  Large parts of our population actively aid and abet the cleansing of certain members of our population. \n\nIn our neck of the woods yours is the dominant narrative hence I am sure 90% of the people don’t even bother to read what I write.  Learnt sages  such as Plato, Aristotle,  Madison, The Frenchman Monsieur Tocquivvile et el Called it “The tyranny of the majority” . I have a simpler term. \n\n[B][I] Piety-though-mass-slaughter”.[/I][/B]\n\nThe idea of equating humans to crows will certainly seem ludicrous to many. However the point  I am trying to make is that it’s the mindset of the narrative that is essentially the same in all the examples above.. Including  am afraid..   yours as well.   \n\n I have not had the honour or the privilege of observing kites. But as an aspiring amateur ornithologist I have spent a considerable period of time studying crows and they are a “sentient species”. There is no doubt about it. If U want I can give u multiple personal examples based on my own primary data rather than ancillary sources such as books or the net. \n \nI asked u what will be the effect of obliteration of entire species to the global ecosystem. In fact gave detailed scenarios. U  blithely ignored them and gave me .. well.. more (for want of a better term) “textual” answers rather then” factual” ones.  \n\nI am asking u once again. How do [B]“You”[/B] think the global ecosystem will benefit once u take away its primary scavengers? \n\nI gave u my concept of what will happen when they disappear. Now I want your answer as to the supposed benefits to the ''real term global environment; rather than as an esoteric textual construct. The disposal of 10s of billions of bodies.. How to deal with the  flies and the maggots? Who will take their place as scavengers and clear organic waste? Humans.. Again how?\n\nRemember “each and every action has an equal and opposite reaction”  And every species has a role to play..   \n\nStill not getting through Sir?\n\n If not please let me know?  I will endeavour to elucidate my viewpoint in a more concise manner with more factual information. Including from this forum as well...\n\nTailpiece: Since U prefer rhetoric to rationale. I have a question. How do U give back a life that you have already taken?[/QUOTE]\n\n\nDear ED Bro,\nits a question of faith, our religion starts where logic ends, how? wellllll.... it started of with wahi ( the message from Allah SWT to our Holy Prophet PBUH ). wahi has no scientific explanation, there was no study of oceans meeting but their waters not mixing 1400 yrs back, but quran explained it, also millions of other things that can be described by science today.\nTherefore with due respects once a hadith has been quoted one should remain silent in its respect even if u logically differ as your logic and wisdom is not even one billionth of our lovely prophet PBUH.\n\nbottom line, logic cannot be brought in front once a hadith is stated. the only logic that can be presented would be in its favor, if one doesnt have it then one should look for it.', ''),

Why?\n[B]\nThey are a direct threat to other smaller birds, most of which are halal[/B] for consumption. Because crows do not make their own nests. They lay their eggs in an inhabited nest of some smaller bird usually by either consuming their eggs or throwing them off the nest. They ruthlessly kill & feed on chicks may they be domestic or nesting.\n[B]\nThey have a known habit of eating less of and spreading trash & garbage all over the place[/B]. They even dig out garbage that is sub-surface enroute to decomposition or atleast burial.\n[B]\nThey are disease carriers & spreaders[/B]. These are the two species that physically & directly touch a garbage dump & human habitat in a row. I hope we agree to the fact that the garbage dumps see mostly (read only) these two birds to be their favorite primary feeding & resting place. There is not much need to elaborate on the filth, germs, diseases & rubbish that clings to their claws & beaks when they feed there and travel directly to human colonies. One can guess how close crows can get to their living areas & fly by every  day.

This is absolutely not the case that we only reply to the people who wants to purchase Caracal. Caracal owners are by far the most important for us. The only reason your question might have been over looked because it was answered before here at the same forum. Caracal USA is totally a different entity. It has been established through the research that there might been some potential fault in the Pistols which were sent to the USA. However, the research department still didn''t find any trace that any of those potential pistols were shipped to pakistan. Still, as per the order of the Board the trained has traveled to pakistan and inspecting randomly some pistols which have been sent to Pakistan. Even if there is no trace still our majority of the board is in favor to replace the part on all pistols delivered in pakistan to make sure that all Caracal customers can sleep with peace. Apart from the replacement of the parts, the Caracal pisyol owners will also be given a free magazine, Caracal T - shirt , Caracal Cap and thank you letter from Caracal. We assure you that our team will not sleep in peace till they provide you complete satisfaction. Regards, Dr. Kaiser Rafiq - Managing Director Royal Emirates Group.

(486388, ' [QUOTE=Leon;324500]Did anybody read this reply of Caracal Pakistan to a comment on Facebook page: \n\n"Dear Mr. C----a, Thanks for your enquiry. This is absolutely not the case that we only reply to the people who wants to purchase Caracal. Caracal owners are by far the most important for us. The only reason your question might have been over looked because it was answered before here at the same forum. Caracal USA is totally a different entity. It has been established through the research that there might been some potential fault in the Pistols which were sent to the USA. However, the research department still didn''t find any trace that any of those potential pistols were shipped to pakistan. Still, as per the order of the Board the trained has traveled to pakistan and inspecting randomly some pistols which have been sent to Pakistan. Even if there is no trace still our majority of the board is in favor to replace the part on all pistols delivered in pakistan to make sure that all Caracal customers can sleep with peace. Apart from the replacement of the parts, the Caracal pisyol owners will also be given a free magazine, Caracal T - shirt , Caracal Cap and thank you letter from Caracal. We assure you that our team will not sleep in peace till they provide you complete satisfaction. Regards, Dr. Kaiser Rafiq - Managing Director Royal Emirates Group. (If you have any further enquiry, you can directly email me at [EMAIL="dr.kaiser@royalemiratesgroup.ae"]dr.kaiser@royalemiratesgroup.ae[/EMAIL].)"[/QUOTE]\n\n\n\n@Leon: I had posted the material enclosed below on another thread on 29-10-2012. Less than an hour of internet research - undertaken because I wanted to know more about the identity and bona fides of Caracal Pakistan - yielded these results. \nIt seemed to me that there were many promises on Facebook and a lot of expectations expressed on Pakguns but no actual action. \nI will leave you to draw your own conclusions. Please note that I have cited sources and they are well worth a read. I wish you luck.\n\n==================\n\nRoyal Emirates Group of Dubai is said to be the sole agent of [COLOR=#417394]Caracal[/COLOR] for 9mm sales to Pakistan.\n\n[URL="http://www.prlog.org/11746440-caracal-9-mm-pistol-receives-big-welcome-in-pakistan.html"]http://www.prlog.org/11746440-caraca...-pakistan.html[/URL]\n\nRoyal Emirates Group is not an Associate or Subsidiary of Tawazun Holdings. Royal Emirates is not a Dubai Government owned company. \n\nSheikh Butti Bin Suhail Al Maktoum, one of the many members of the extended royal family of Dubai chairs the Royal Emirates Group.\n\nThe MD of Royal Emirates is a man called Dr Kaiser Rafiq (MBA, PhD). As you can see from the news item published in The National (dated April 23, 2011), questions have been raised in a respected UAE daily newspaper about claims that he made on his CV.\n\n[URL="http://www.thenational.ae/business/media/doubt-over-la-liga-football-deal-chiefs-cv"]http://www.thenational.ae/business/m...deal-chiefs-cv[/URL]\n\n**************\n\n[URL="http://www.guillembalague.com/guestwriter_desp.php?id=27"]http://www.guillembalague.com/guestw...desp.php?id=27[/URL]\n[TABLE="class: cms_table_tabla_central, width: 993"]\n[TR]\n[TD][TABLE="class: cms_table_margen_3"]\n[TR]\n[TD="class: cms_table_tabla_interior_centro"][TABLE="class: cms_table_tabla_blog, width: 713"]\n[TR]\n[TD="class: cms_table_cuerpo_blog, width: 100%, bgcolor: #FFFFFF, align: left"][COLOR=#ffffff][FONT=Arial][B]5/04/2011[/B][/FONT][/COLOR] \n\n[COLOR=#99cc00][FONT=Arial][B]Doubts grow over Getafe investors [/B][/FONT][/COLOR]\n[/TD]\n[/TR]\n[TR]\n[TD="colspan: 2"][COLOR=#666666][FONT=Arial][COLOR=#333333]Over the past few days there has been some dramatic revelations regarding the sale of Getafe CF to the UAE based company, Royal Emirates Group. Here is a view from the UAE.[/COLOR]\n[COLOR=#333333][I]By [B]Abdalla M. Taryam[/B][/I][/COLOR]\n[COLOR=#333333][B]\nWho is Royal Emirates Group? [/B]The premium business information portal in the Middle East, zawya.com, carries absolutely no information about this company or its subsidiaries. Its own website declares that the chairman is [B]Sheikh Butti bin Suhail Al Maktoum [/B]and its General Manager is[B] Dr. Kaiser Rafiq[/B]. Other than that, very little is revealed.[/COLOR]\n[COLOR=#333333]\nButti AlMaktoum carries the title of Sheikh due to his relation to the ruling family of Dubai. Unlike Sheikh Mansour of Manchester City, he is an unknown individual mainly due to his tender age and lack of political weight.[/COLOR]\n[COLOR=#333333]\nThe more intriguing character is Mr. Rafiq who through the several press releases seems to be the more influential individual. He boasts an incredible CV that was posted on Linkedin.com (recently amended), which included several educational degrees from renowned universities such as NYU, UCLA and Yale. UAE press has recently exposed him by verifying that he has never attended those universities. He also seems to have inaccurately overstated his work experience in certain American organizations that have never heard of him.[/COLOR]\n[COLOR=#333333]\nVery few in the UAE media are convinced that a company that has no identified holdings can come out of nowhere and pull this deal off. It claims it owns 64 companies yet they disclose only 2 online businesses and the personal family wealth of the young Sheikh cannot be ascertained. Getafe’s future seems questionable at best.\n[B]\nAbdalla M. Taryam is a UAE based football commentator tweets @AbdallaTaryam[/B]\n\n[/COLOR][/FONT][/COLOR][/TD]\n[/TR]\n[/TABLE]\n\n[/TD]\n[/TR]\n[/TABLE]\n\n[/TD]\n[/TR]\n[/TABLE]\n\n\n**************\n\nIn Pakistan, Fazal Jan Corporation''s website states that it has been authorised by Royal Emirates Group for sale of 9mm pistols to the Government and Armed Forces of Pakistan.\n\n[URL]http://www.fazaljan.com/services.html[/URL]\n\nThe company lists an address on Nicholson Road, Lahore as its office address and lists two cell phone numbers as its contact numbers.\n\n**************\n\nThe aftermath of the recent tender for KPK Police was handled somewhat amateurishly by Royal Emirates. It appears that they tried to bully the KPK government into buying [COLOR=#417394]Caracal[/COLOR] and pretended to have clout where, in actual fact, they had little more than some nuisance value. \n\n[URL="http://www.thenews.com.pk/Todays-News-7-138680-Police-under-political-pressure-to-buy-UAE-made-Caracal-instead-of-Glock"]http://www.thenews.com.pk/Todays-New...stead-of-Glock[/URL]\n\n***************\n\nTayabally''s website ([URL]http://www.tayabally.com/arm/index.htm[/URL]) does not claim that it is sole agent/distributor/dealer or whatever. That does not necessarily mean that it may not be any of the above. It may just be that Tayabally does not consider its relationship with [COLOR=#417394]Caracal[/COLOR] LLC (through Royal Emirates) to be worthy of mention on its website (which, incidentally, mentions brands like Taurus, Daewoo, Beretta) or has been unable to update it.\n\nTipu had, once, mentioned that they had sent some technicians to Dubai to be trained by [COLOR=#417394]Caracal[/COLOR]. That, by itself, does not mean much more than that some technicians were sent to Dubai for training (hardly nuclear technology) at [COLOR=#417394]Caracal[/COLOR] UAE. \n\nAnyone willing to pay for it may also arrange for such training with Glock and Steyr (though, it is much cheaper to send people to the UAE in[COLOR=#417394]Caracal[/COLOR]''s case).\n\n[URL]http://www.glocktraining.com/[/URL]\n\n*****************\n\nSo, it would be useful to know:\n\n1. Who actually represents [COLOR=#417394]Caracal[/COLOR] in Pakistan as far as the ordinary consumer is concerned and what do they acknowledge to be their responsibility towards the ordinary consumer?\n\n2. What is said representative''s contractual relationship with [COLOR=#417394]Caracal[/COLOR] LLC?\n\n3. What does [COLOR=#417394]Caracal[/COLOR] LLC have to say about the guns bought in Pakistan by ordinary consumers with respect to:\n\n(i) any warranty that may be in place (who should one contact, for e.g., in case one wants to make a claim under the warranty)? and\n\n(ii) ascertaining whether any guns sold in Pakistan may be subject to the same issues as the ones voluntarily recalled in the US (irrespective of whether the Company intends to do anything similar in Pakistan, we have the right to know so that we may make informed decisions about safe handling of weapons).\n\n***************\n\nPlease feel free to question the above, challenge it, add to it but try to do so in a manner that is logical, knowledgeable and inoffensive...difficult but not impossible.', ''),

(486459, ' let me give you a simpler answer. CF98 has a trigger system that is intended for plain shooting if the need be for defense and NOT for Practical shooting let alone when you are practicing calling shots. Too much slap, too much disengaging travel, too much over travel. It would be the same as testing a mehran car on a f1 track. What would you get out of testing such a car?? all the results will only show that it is working perfectly for a normal person.\n\nIPSC is the F1 racing (best car with best driver and tactics) with multiple calibers and highly tuned normal guns available for carry as well; and target shooting Olympics style is like Drag race (dedicated weapons such as Hammerli 208s) where the gun matters a lot and only small calibers are used.\n\nNP22 is a regular military gun design, and we use it to learn high end things; kam kharch bala nashin.. at 1000 rounds the gun has removed all the creep in the trigger and works smoothly, though it needs cleaning at every 300 rounds or so, so that the buildup of carbon doesnt start to create crud and act as emery IF you want your gun to reach 15000 rounds and LOOK as if IN top condition and resale isn''t diminished to such an event that the guns is worthless piece of junk.\n\nIF the factory itself admits that the gun life is 10000 rounds then they are implicitly saying that it is NOT intended for heavy use and is for occassional use. Whereas NP22 as i have seen is well worth the amount of money you put in.\nTHERE is NO comparision between CF 98 and NP22; absolutely NO comparision and doing it would make one wonder am i doing something that is within the lines of sanity.', ''),

(486529, ' [QUOTE=Salmanqadeer;323973]hi Gunda Bacha,  thanks for your reply. but there are some things you must know, firstly, Walther Dominator FT .22 cal is around 900 US $$ plus, \n\nthus, one of the most powerful and accurate long range PCP rifle in market.  A good value for money.\nhere is some details and information which might be helpful.\n\n[B]Pressure & bar:[/B]\nIts Cylinder can hold upto 350 bar pressure max. and from 300 to 140 bars, it can shot with same FPS of and range because of seperate chamber. where the pressure is remained. 100 shots in total.\n\nsecondly, CNG means ( compressed natural gas) which is high inflamable (never use it, its gona burn you and ur gun alive ), CNG Bar pressure is between 180 to 240 max. whereas, its PCP Cylinder can hold pressure upto 350 Bars. Recommended pressure is 300 Bars-140 bars underwhich you can have accurate and long range shot.\nNote: Never use oxygen, Co2 or any other gas, always use flitered dry atmospheric gas to get PCP cylinders filled. Otheriwse you will destory ur weapon. for Co2, there are seperate carteriges or cylinders as recomended by its company.\n\nthirdly, Lahore Shooting Club does have PCP filling facility but for members and it costs 25k membership fee, and they refill it with 200 bars max. \n\nfourthly, hand pump isnt a good idea at all, it needs 400 pumps to get to almost 200 bars and as bars increase effort to pump increases ( very intensive labor required to fill) implies on all PCPs\n\n[B]Accuracy and Range:[/B]\nNow come to real world senairo. You have 8 shots in its round. with the range of 25-60 meters you can shoot 8 birds, never gona miss any. so with 100 shots means 100 birds. its plenty for a day. Isnt it?\n[I]why i assumed above senario ? please read below[/I]\nIts meant for long range thats why the Scope its 8-32 x, which means one can target something which is 8 times far from you. Normally the scopes used for .22 caliber air guns are 3-9x. It has good powerful telescope, its range is 320 Meters, which is again 300 yards plus, this means it can accurately shoot till there. \n[B]\nPoweR & Quality:[/B]\nas mentioned above, it starts from 300 Bars and ends at 140bars (recomended for .22 caliber to refill) for 40 Joules pressure . its one most powerful air gun, as compered with discovery, it can be compered with bejimen rifles only.\nIts cylinder have life expentancy of 10 years. after that it needs a service and replacement of its cylinders.\nYeah one more thing, one cannt hear a thing (gun fire sound) who is 10 meters fars. So, GAME/PLIKING wont hear a thing when you shoot and wont fly becuz you are far from them. 1250 has a compensator cum silencer which increases its velocity and decreases its sound. \n\nit has zero recoil and very low sound.  \n[B]\nPricing:[/B]\nBuying a good airgun is not everyday job, its kinda once in a lifetime thing for me when one grows up or leaves the teenage ( teenagers should go for .177 (4.5mm) and should buy pump rifles of daisy or crossman for target practicing)\nDiana (break Barrel) or any other with side lever are old tech guns, one should go for the latest and approved technology air guns. PCPs are new and are better than Co2 even, because its easier to maintain and with almost no maintaince except oiling once a week or once in a month.\nthus, for Murgabi, pigions etc even wildboar & jackals(head shots) can be killed with ease. so, for having 100% results paying some extra bucks /Rupees isnt an issue. \n\nIt Costs around 100k ( one Lakh) rupees while discovery with pump is about 80 K. \n\n\nThus, thats what i come across, after reading reviews on differenct country blogs and some market OOGLING in Lahore, I personally find it best and It made me think ZILLION Times before going and making a purchase of WALTHER 1250 Dominator FT for 1 Lakh Rupees, Today, Alhumdolillah \n\nlast, about refilling the PCP Cylinder at 300 Bars exact, i m looking a proper way. IF any PCP owner Knows how to get it done cheaply in Lahore please do inform me, else i  m gona post it inshallah as well.\nAnyone can contact me for more details at 0321 8787333. I searched almost 90% of websites, read reviews internationally regarding PCP rifles and their performances. and i personally think its a good value for Money. thats all.[/QUOTE]\n\n\n\n\ndear salman, i have dominator its very nice gun, you should go for manual pump, it is easy, u just need less then 50 pumps to fill 250 bar which is more enought, because there is no cheap way other then hand pump other wise you will spend 8 lack to buy a good high presure electrict pump, i have one i imported it from uk and it cost me 8 lak rupees. but still i am using hand pump 250 bas 60 nice shots enought for me.', ''),

(486619, ' AoA Avais Bhai,\r\n \r\nThis matter was all cleared up through a following newspaper report.WHAT A LEG-PULLING NATION\r\nwe belong to.\r\n\r\n\r\n"Shooter to miss India event as Customs refuses to allow gun" \r\n\r\n  \r\n \r\nKARACHI: Pakistan&#8217;s skeet shooter Usman Chand was not allowed by Pakistan Customs to fly for India where he was to take part in the 2nd Asian Championship Shotgun in Patiala, India, from November 28 to December 9. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n&#8220;They said I was not allowed to carry a shotgun with me without a letter of permission from the Ministry of Interior. I had the required letter issued by National Rifles Association of Pakistan (NRAP) stating I was going to play in the championship,&#8221; he said while talking to &#8216;The News&#8217;. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nHe further said it is usual for skeet shooters going abroad for tournaments to only have NRAP&#8217;s letter, but this demand from the Customs annoyed me because any letter from the interior ministry was not required. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n&#8220;The customs officials showed me their rules book in which it was written that a letter from the Ministry of Interior is required for carrying weapons. But I know that for shooters the NRAP&#8217;s letter suffices,&#8221; he said, adding that it was understood that a shooter carried his weapon for any event he was taking part in. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nUsman said it was very disappointing for him as he had been training hard for the last three months and had spent more than Rs500,000. &#8220;I am at a loss; who is going to compensate me, the customs or NRAP,&#8221; he questioned. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nHe further said that he tried hard to convince the customs officials at Lahore airport but they refused to listen. &#8220;I came back home dejected when the time of my flight lapsed. I was denied a bright chance of representing Pakistan at the championship despite my hard training for months,&#8221; he added. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nSecretary NRAP Javed Lodhi said this was the first time in three years that customs did not allow a shooter to carry his weapon despite seeing their letter. &#8220;I have been here for the last three years as the secretary. Every year we send a number of shooters to international competitions but this never happened before,&#8221; he said. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nHe further said that this demand by the customs department to have a clearance letter from the Ministry of Interior was shocking. &#8220;The practice is that we issue a letter to those shooters who go abroad for competitions stating that this person is carrying a weapon so he or she should not be held by customs. This is a common practice and never has any incident of denial of boarding happened to any shooter,&#8221; he added. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nTherefore, he added, stopping Usman was very disappointing. &#8220;We will write a letter to the customs department that this was a bad thing to happen to a very talented player,&#8221; he added. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nBut it appears that there is a conflict regarding this issue. A skeet shooter based in Karachi was asked by this scribe about the practice of clearance of weapons. &#8220;NRAP issues letter to both the customs department and the Ministry of Interior, requesting them to allow weapons for shooters going abroad for competitions. Then the interior ministry issues clearance letter and shooters have to show that to the customs department before leaving,&#8221; he added. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nUsman was to represent Pakistan for the first time at any international event and had been aiming at the gold medal. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nHe was supposed to leave on December 1 to show his skills at the championship in which 117 players of 12 countries are contesting. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nUsman, who won all gold medals in the categories of trap, double trap, and skeet at Punjab Games this year, said after this incident he would consider playing for Army or Navy. &#8220;I didn&#8217;t want to leave Punjab, but now I don&#8217;t feel like playing for Punjab as nobody supported me. No official was there to help me,&#8221; said 28-year-old Usman, who runs a business of surgical equipment manufacturing.', ''),

That makes it a better gun than it was before bedding.\n[/B]\n\nThis gives me an opportunity to add a few more things to the thread and share my views on your question.[INDENT]\n[/INDENT]\n[LIST]\n[*]This rifle has a true floating barrel which used to be pressing hard with the fore-end at about 4 places. Now the barrel sits tight with stock for about an inch at the throat, rest is free floating.\n[/LIST]\n\n[LIST]\n[*][FONT=Verdana]The contact area of the action with the stock has increased many folds.[/FONT]\n[/LIST][FONT=Verdana]&#8203;[/FONT]\n[LIST]\n[*]Fore-end is also sealed off with epoxy to avoid any potential swelling due to moisture.\n[/LIST]\n\nA rifle is worth much more when it is accurate (and vice versa), and bedding helps in achieving that. There a quite a number of factors effecting accuracy though. Bedding will not necessarily make a bad rifle good, its just going to help make a good rifle, better & more accurate. What good a rifle will be if it cannot shoot accurately.\n\nThough some would value [I]originality[/I] in ''collectors'' or ''resale'' terms. Which is very valid in that context.\n\nThere may be no need to bed a rifle if its shooting accurately enough to satisfy ones requirement.

I am aware that even the Winchester uses a derivative of the mauser bolt but this is a personal preference.\n3- The CZ just fits better for me than the Winchester based entirely on my physical build. \n\nI have found them both to be almost equally accurate for hunting purposes when fed with ammunition they like.

Scope height I already measured was 2 inches. I wanted to see the drop of pellet at this distance. To my surprise the pellet hit above instead of below the target. I shot 23 pellets (same gamo match) taking care to aim exactly at the horizontal line on the target at 50 yards. Following were the results.\n\n5 pellets hit about 1.75 inches below the line.\n10 pellets were with in 0.5 inch of the line (4 below and 6 above the line).\n4 pellets hit 0.75 inch above the line.\n4 pellets hit approximately 1.25 inches above the line.\nSo, most of the pellets were close to line with in half an inch or just above that.

My sentiments exactly and this is a good learning for some of us who carry and who think that just because we carry that we can beat the bad guy even though the BG''  weapon is pointed at our heads in close quarters. \n\nbrothers rightly pointed out here is to always keep a situational awareness especially at traffic lights and other deserted spots. \n\nThough avoiding incidences of BG''s impersonating as Police officers and kidnapping people is a tough nut to crack. We in Karachi have frequent checks at non-designated areas by the police especially at night. So i would appreciate any members giving their two cents on how to avoid becoming just such a victim.\n\n\nApologies in advance to the OP for discussing something a little off-topic, but it would be truly englightening to hear on this related subject also.

At 800 meters a .22 caliber with 40 grains and 1230 fps mv holds the same energy as the Point Blank airgun, enough to split open the head of a small rodent/ poke an eye out and get into human brain..  so the real question is will you be able to shoot a moving target at 15 meters in his BRAIN?? or will you opt for the body/ torso with .45cal.\n\n.45 is a very potent round with almost double the WHACK/ Energy than 9mm. You will be doing more damage to a person in his body that just ONE JHP round is worth 3 x 9mm shots to torso. My first pistol was a .45 and know its real power.\n\nAs far as the speed is concerned.. all of them are so fast that you cannot see the bullet.. if you see it .. it is already there and too late to do anything about it. The ammo quality is never tested with the speed.. it is always judged by the energy that it carries with it when hitting the target.. normal 9mm is 115 grains.. whereas normally all the ammo of .45 in Pakistan is 230 grains. .45 is 11.5 mm and about 1/3 bigger than 9mm and holds double the energy.\n\nIF the gun is going to be for SD/HD then .45 cal is probably the best round in Pakistan. The pistol i saw is 12 +1 in .45 cal. Well worth the carrying for self defence.\n\nThe ballistics of .45 are one of the tops just behind 10mm and .44 magnum cartridges.\n\nThe only draw back with the .45 cal is the cost of the top quality weapons. Such as DW''s Valor or Wilson Combat or even the STI series. The availability and the price of these guns is far far beyond the reach of a budget conscious shooter like me. Ammo is the same cost as 9mm @ 65 rs a pop for the old american brand to 80 rs a pop for the armscor. 9mm american ammo is more expensive than the .45. The only reason .45 didnt catch is the fear of the recoil. .30 Tula Tokarev has MORE kick in it than the .45 only because of the amount of propellant behind the small .30 cal bullet.', ''),
(487320, ' Thanx Raja sahb, I appreciate your comments :) Sorry for the bad video quality. I just wanted to check my zero so did not have a better camera at hand.\n\nI''ll tell you how I judged it to be at about a 100 yards, the roof Im at is 28 yards (calculated) then there a road between this building and the white building which is approx 40 yards wide (it is main road with a 4 lane  overheard bridge running along) then the width of the white building is again approx 25-30 yards, then there is an alley between the white building and the brown one where pigeon sits. If we take the alley''s width to be 7-8 yards the total distance comes close to a 100. As I said, it was a very long walk to retrieve that pigeon ;)', ''),

She is always issued a letter by NRAP, which states the following:- \r\n1. Competition and the dates.\r\n2. Shooter''s name and passport details.\r\n3. Weapon''s make, caliber and serial no.\r\n4. Ammo qty.\r\n\r\nOne copy for customs, one for airport security, one for the airline and one to be retained by the shooter duly signed and stamped by the custom guy to be shown to them when one returns to Pakistan. This is very important as otherwise the weapon may be considered as a fresh import.\r\n\r\nOn all her trips, things went smoothly with absolutely no hitch, with customs and security staff wishing the shooters good luck. \r\n\r\nI too don''t understand why Usman was stopped, well established practice abandoned and the rule book thrown in. I am sure NRAP, with chief of navy as its head, will be able to sort out the mess.\r\n\r\nMunir', ''),

Your reaction will depends upon different factors like Area, Number & type of People in the mob and most importantly, the issue on which mob is formed. Another factor is your state of readiness i.e. Ammo quantity and type of weapon. However, if you are in car, the best solution is to drive away if you can. If not, make your decision based on factors mentioned above. And make sure that you can escape afterwards.

(487514, ' Here is one of my many funny experiences with these security guards:\r\n\r\nSomewhere during 1999, my then employers after a robbery in our office decided to place an armed security guard. Our GM Administration was referred to a security agency where every official''s title was nothing less than Major (R) or Captain (R), who claimed that most of their personnel are ex-SSG.\r\n\r\nAfter a couple of days we saw a person dressed in camouflage at our office entrance, holding the weight of a rifle with box magazine and folding stock. His tummy size was bigger than my 38 inches. The GM Administration during the morning tea tried to praise his efficiency by saying that ex-SSG person armed with ‘Kilashin’ has been appointed for staff security. I was unable to control my laugh but kept quite despite questions.\r\n\r\nLater went to GM’s office and asked him to call the guard. Tried to explain that this is a good-for-nothing AK-47 look alike semi-automatic desi rifle chambered for 8mm bullet. The guard was unable to answer simple questions like number of bullets inside the magazine, difference between semi and automatic rifle, effective range of rifle he was carrying, etc. The poor guy told us that he used to work at a car service station and lost the job. After remaining jobless for about three months he has found this job where he will get some Rs. 2,900 per month for a full-week / 12-hour duty. He never fired a single bullet from any weapon.\r\n\r\nI checked the rifle, which contained ten bullets in the magazine. The bolt jammed when I pull it—though it was returned manually. I removed the magazine and pulled the bolt again to remove the bullet. Guess what? The bullet was caught in the chamber, while the bolt came back and jammed again. I tried to convince the GM Administration that our Pakhtoon watchman who has been hired to stay at the office during night maybe more reliable with a 30 Caliber TT Pistol --- but the GM considered this as my interference in his department’s activities.\r\n\r\nAfter some days during a day-off, the same Pakhtoon watchman (on my secret instruction) stripped the rifle and the guard nearly fainted. The poor guy recovered only when the watchman brought it back to its shape after applying emery paper to some parts, properly cleaning and lubricating it.\r\n\r\nI am thankful to Allah that no such situation came up when the ‘armed-guard’ has to be utilized. In most the localities, these armed guards just serve the duty of a receptionist.', ''),

(487597, 'REVIEW &amp; RANGE REPORT: SAM Desert Storm 1911 John Moses Browning is commonly known as a mechanical genius who has made far more contributions to the world of firearms than any other single person in human history. Despite a plethora of guns of all shapes and sizes bearing his name, John Browning will perhaps forever be remembered for his classic masterpiece, the [B]M1911[/B]; the fact that the M1911 is the world''s most replicated, cloned and copied handgun stands as a testament to this.\n\nThe [B]Shooters Arms Manufacturing "Desert Storm"[/B] is a Philippine-made Government-model, all-steel 1911 available in both the traditional .45ACP and the 9mm Parabellum. This particular 1911 model (chambered in 9mm) comes with all the bells & whistles one would expect from a high-end competition handgun; in fact, on a budget, this beast just might be the ideal range weapon. Let''s take a detailed look at it.\n\n\n[B]Initial Impression:[/B]\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]15298[/ATTACH]\n\nThe Desert Storm comes in a simple, almost flimsy, and bland plastic case. Upon opening it, you find the gun and 2 9-round MecGar magazines (the mags, by the way, are Italian, [B]not[/B] Turkish-made). That''s it. Nothing more. No cleaning tools, no manual, no documentation of any kind, nothing. To say that it''s a bit disappointing to see the gun without any "accessories" is an understatement. On the other hand, this being a "budget high-end competition pistol", I guess the manufacturer had to cut certain expenses.\n\nHowever, all disappointment (and curses sent the manufacturer''s way) suddenly vaporise as soon as you lay your eyes on the gun itself. To put it simply, the Desert Storm is absolutely [B]beautiful![/B] There''s literally no other word in the human vocabulary to describe the gun; it''s like the "Monica Bellucci meets Sasha Grey" of handguns, sheer elegance & super sexiness all rolled into one. Every inch of the gun compels you to pick it up and caress every corner of it''s being.\n\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]15299[/ATTACH]\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]15304[/ATTACH]\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]15305[/ATTACH]\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]15306[/ATTACH]\n\n\n[B]Ergonomics & Features:[/B]\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]15307[/ATTACH]\nAs soon as you pick up the Desert Storm, three things immediately burst into your mind:\n[LIST]\n[*]First, the gun feels simple amazing! The extended bevertail, the grip angle, the placement of the safety, everything is sheer perfection.\n[*]Second, the gun fits your hand like a glove and feels like a natural extension of your arm.\n[*]Third, the gun is [B]bloody heavy![/B] At over a kilo (empty), the Desert Storm is definitely [B]NOT[/B] carry-friendly and can cause quite an arm-sore at the shooting range if you''re solely used to polymer toy guns! :p\n[/LIST]\n\nAs mentioned earlier, the Desert Storm comes with quite a handful of premium features like an extended safety (although the safety is not ambidextrous), extended beavertail, heavy & aggressive chequering on both the front and backstrap, walnut wood grips, a bevelled magazine well (Taurus could learn a thing or two from the Desert Storm about bevelled magazine wells!), full-length guide rod, wide & prominent slide serrations, etc. All in all, it''s quite a sweet package!\n\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]15303[/ATTACH]\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]15313[/ATTACH]\n\ncontinued...', ''),

I asked him that i am allergic to this, he said ooh sorry, and threw the whole cigerette out of the window, closed the window and looked at me. I thanked him and then he asked me to get back on my window seat as there was no reason for him to sit there. I simply accepted again.\n\nNow i was on window seat.

The trigger is also adjustable. Out of the box, the trigger has slight take up and almost no pre-travel at all, and makes a crisp break at about 2.75-3.0 lbs.

Very sorry to say that this is our nation wide dilemma that we don&#8217;t bother to understand or get the Islamic teachings I saw many people saying that &#8216;falan molvi sb is wrong&#8217; and  &#8216;falan molvi sb ka qul or fail main tazad ha&#8217; but we don&#8217;t ever think about us who we are and what are we doing these are the people who don&#8217;t know the faraiz and wajibat of  namaz I can say with full confidence that more then 90% of people in this forum don&#8217;t know and never bothered to know the  faraiz and wajibat of namaz as many of us pray 5 time daily and do sajda e sahw when do mistake in namaz ,as this is not a part of my discussion but I grief and grief  lot on whats going on with muslims and what we are doing, I just tell you one thing and then just move on to my topic ,I say that you people do sajda e sahaw every time but very less of you know when to do sajda e sahaw  mean on which mistake we do sajda e sahaw and on which mistake the salah is not completed by just sajda e sahaw,I can say with full confidence that 90% of people praying don&#8217;t know this they just do it on every mistake (If any one want to know this he could contact his imam masjid if he is alim or can contact me on my email [EMAIL="kahatab@gmail.com"]kahatab@gmail.com[/EMAIL]),by discussing this I just want to bring you people on one point and the point is &#8220;We must learn before we do&#8217;.Now I come to my original topic.\n \n[B]Which  bird is halal and which is haram:[/B]\nI just give you a simple rule follow this and got your ans,\n \n&#8216;Tamam parinda halal hain kisi ko haram kahna ke koi wajha nai siwai un parindon ka jo shikar kar ka kahata hain ya un ki ghiza faqat gandagi ha&#8217;\n \nSome say that the birds who eats by getting help from there claws are haram there is no difference between the two but the rule which I discussed is original and more comprehensive because the ellat of hurmat is shikar and the birds who do shikar definitely get help from there claws, and the second thing is the bird who always eat dirt are haram these birds are normally found in the area near garbage dumps and sewerage canals in the city areas normally these birds are not found but some hens get addicted of eating dirt  so one must take care.\nHere I want to tell you an interesting thing which very less of you know the thing is there is an exception of this rule one bird which eats while getting help from its claws but still it is halal !!! and that is PARROT .Parrot is halal its another thing that it is not eaten any where but still it is halal some people say that it is makruh it is not even makruh fully halal .Thats why I said that the rule I had discussed is more more comprehensive then the later one.\nOne or two days before I am reading a thread here some one had posted a pic of a bird  the bird had a long legs and he asked to the people that is this bird halal or haram the other said that you must see that is it got help with its claws while eating or not if it get then haram and if not then halal he must know that the first one is going on shikar not for the research on birds so let me tell you one more easy rule to get a quick reply of a bird being halal or haram but keep in mind the original rule is the first ,these are just a signs the thing is you must see its beak if its beak has a sharp bend and had a pointed sharp end then this must be haram bird nearly all of the halal birds don&#8217;t have one or both.\n[IMG]https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcQburdazk-LywHegAesCB20cyAySE4coCMGLVEHdHqml29a-azy[/IMG]\nSome people are very strange they just say and say and don&#8217;t  think what they are saying in pg I read one thread some one is saying maina is halal other said that yes maina is halal but red beaked maina is not halal .I am just amazed with his jahalat I can ask whats the diff between the two is the second one had one eye or had a eye aver its back so that it is haram just amazing  both the maina&#8217;s are halal no dalil of saying any one of them as haram the color never makes any thing haram.The thing is the same which I said above we had a time for every thing we had a time for watching tv, playing games, eating food ,doing gup shup with friends even two or three hours but we don&#8217;t have any time for our religion if we spent only half an hour for reading religious books after an year we will be a scholar but sorry to say we don&#8217;t have time this is because we don&#8217;t have belief on akrat and life after death .See what your prophet says:\nProphet PBUH said:\n \n''Tum kisifasiq (gunhgar) par kisi namat ke wajha sa rask mat karna kun ka tumhain maloom nain ka akrat main us ka sath kaya paish ana wala ha akhrat main allah ka han us ka lia aik aisa qatil ah jis ko kabhi mot nai&#8217;.\n\nIf we want jannah and evade naar we must have to learn islam and follow its rules with full devotion other wise the wrong path leads to the wrong destiny.\n \n[B]About Zibha :[/B]\n I had saw many pics of hunted birds and animals like rabbits in this forum but I saw a strange thing that  people don&#8217;t slaughter the bird or animal\nafter shooting it \n[IMG]http://www.pakguns.com/attachment.php?attachmentid=8207&stc=1&d=1328554031[/IMG]\n [IMG]http://www.pakguns.com/attachment.php?attachmentid=8204&stc=1&d=1328554019[/IMG]\nIt seems to me from this pics that the man who shoots it don&#8217;t slaughter and i saw many other pics too  man it will be haram if you don&#8217;t slaughter it after shooting a pallet  .\nThe masala is ,the bullet or an airgun pallet if it is pointed heaving a very sharp point I think like the point of a  lmg &#8216;s bullet\n[IMG]https://encrypted-tbn2.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcQC1PIWJPC9reOrULQI800QlzFf8l7Z5UCDUa7yChM8ZVNcCb4fVjvODjos[/IMG]\nif you shoot with this kind of a bullet or any throwing wapon and say before throwing bismillah he allah o akbar and shoots on the bird or animal and the bird died before you reached it to slaughter it will be halal but if you shoot with the pallets like gamo promagnum or gamo machdiablo or any other pallet that don&#8217;t have the sharp pointed end then you must have to slaughter the bird before it dye and if it die before you slaughter it will be haram.Keep in mind and place you shoot accordingly .', ''),

You do not shoot at 100 or 200 yards; so the .45 has retained itself in US for taking down BG in the LEA arena.. however with the development of the newer ammos such as 10 mm which TOPS the list.. many of the federal agencies in US are opting for it. next is .44 magnum and same is case it is rated just below the 10mm in ballistics. As far as Kinetic energy is concerned.. the .45 has more kinetic energy than 9mm.. It is a better round than 9mm. Simply put as an example it would be the same as throwing a smaller hammer which will go farther.. but when you throw a larger hammer it will travel less far but have more kinetic energy.\n\n\nI feel that i have stepped on your toes or tail.. ;).. Brother the flesh and the gelatin tests have prooved it that the vacuum that is produced behind the bullets is the main cause of hemorrhage and damage to tissue. I hope you have seen some of the photographs where they have done extensive testing.\n\n\n\n\nI have never said that .45 is better than any of the magnums. Magnums are far superior due to their ballistics due to more propellant behind them thus asking for more metal around the chamber area. I think you should read and re-read my words.. I said was "The ballistics of .45 are one of the tops just behind 10mm and .44 magnum cartridges." if my statement is confusing let me explain.. .45 is just behind 10mm and .44 magnum cartridges in ballistics if seen from the top towards descending order. There are many other calibers also available.. which are intermittently placed in between.\n\n\n\n\nBrother if i seriously need to look at my calculations then you should start reading more.. if recoil doesnt depend on the amount of propellant then 7x57 should give the same kick as 7mm rem mag; which will stand true your scientific theory.\n\n[B]In damage the amount of HOLE that goes into a person and the damage the trailing vacuum does; shows the stopping power of an ammo..

HD/SD encounters are not determined by a single projectile vs a single projectile. so why should we compare the two when one is almost half the weight of the other? 115 vs 230 grains.\r\n\r\nwhat we found out that if 45ACP gives you a deadly uppercut, a 9mm hits you with a jab followed by a cross. what we saw on a bright sunny Sunday of testing is that a combo (jab+cross) inflicts far more damage than a single strike (uppercut).\r\n\r\nin other words, a 9mm is a more potent round when you consider the ability to fire more rounds at your intended target due to less recoil, more controllability, higher magazine capacity, [B]only slightly less expansion[/B], [B]only slightly less projectile holes[/B] (entry and exit) and [B]negligible difference in kinetic energies[/B] of both rounds.\r\n\r\nso... I''ve said it before and I''ll say it again: 9mm might not be a better man-stopper than a 45ACP but it is definitely a more efficient man-stopper than a 45ACP. it draws its efficiency by an overly simplified fact that it competes against a heavyweight (230 grains) while only being a middleweight (115 or 124 grains) and competes well.\r\n\r\nRegards.', ''),

Because, it has bit larger frame, barrel and capacity (18 rounds) than Caracal C.\r\n\r\nCaracal C is good for conceal carry. But sometimes, Caracal C fits one''s hand better than F. Check both and select which suits your hands better (means which you grip better). Accuracy also depends on shooter.[/QUOTE]\r\n\r\n\r\nI completely agree. \r\n\r\nIt took me awhile to decide between the two, the Caracal F won out due to the extra capacity.  The thing is that the Caracal F is still smaller than a Sig Sauer 226 or a Glock 17, but with the added benefit of having a larger standard magazine capacity.\r\n\r\nWill also go out shooting with the Caracal C and see how it feels as well.

As i mentioned earlier, as soon as i got hold of the gun i focused all of my attention on the scope and started to clean it gently with soft dry cloth on the other boat . i didnt rub it just tried to soak the water with  that cloth and succeeded to get the magnification glass free from mud completely . Than i tried to remove the mud from the windage knob and cleaned it gently too .i left  the thin and fine layer of mud on the knob to get dry. I was advised to rub clean it but i didnt took the advise as the rubbing was capable of damaging the finish or even the internals of scope . I knew that it would be safe to let dry that fine and thin layer of mud as it would be easy to peel it off the scope once it is dry and it happened as it . i was also advised to use burnox or WD40 on scope but i didnt as these strong solvents would definitely damage the adjustment ring or other movable parts of scope as they are said to be permanantly lubed in the papers came in the packing of scope . So without any harsh treatment or use of any oil or solvent, the scope remained waterproofed and worked excellently for the rest of the day and today , before writing these words , i checked it once again , and it is safe and sound and working excellently by the grace of Allah .

(488171, ' The Hague Convention of 1899, Declaration III, prohibited the use in international warfare of bullets that easily expand or flatten in the body. This is often incorrectly believed to be prohibited in the Geneva Conventions, but it significantly predates those conventions, and is in fact a continuance of the St. Petersburg Declaration of 1868, which banned exploding projectiles of less than 400 grams, as well as weapons designed to aggravate injured soldiers or make their death inevitable. NATO members do not use small arms ammunition that is prohibited by the Hague Convention.\r\n\r\nDespite the ban on military use, hollow-point bullets are one of the most common types of civilian and police ammunition, due largely to the reduced risk of bystanders being hit by over-penetrating or ricocheted bullets, and the increased speed of incapacitation.\r\n\r\nIn many jurisdictions, even ones such as the United Kingdom, where expanding ammunition is generally prohibited, it is illegal to hunt certain types of game with ammunition that does not expand. Some target ranges forbid full metal jacket ammunition, due to its greater tendency to damage metal targets and backstops.\r\n\r\nUnited States of America\r\nThe state of New Jersey prohibits the possession and use of hollow-point ammunition by private citizens, specifically in firearms carried outside the home, but with many exceptions.\r\nUnited Kingdom\r\nAll expanding ammunition, including hollow point bullets, falls under Section 5 (prohibited weapons) of the Firearms Act 1968 and so is illegal to possess or transfer without the written permission of the Home Secretary. The law is in conflict with ''Schedule 2'' of ''The Deer Act 1991'', prohibiting the use of any ammunition other than soft-nosed or hollow-point bullets for the killing of deer. Because of this conflict, Section 5A allows the police licensing authority to add a condition to a firearm certificate for possession of expanding ammunition for:\r\n\r\n1.the lawful shooting of deer\r\n2.the shooting of vermin or, in the case of carrying on activities in connection with the management of any estate, other wildlife\r\n3.the humane killing of animals\r\n4.the shooting of animals for the protection of other animals or humans', ''),

(488174, 'Glossary of firearms terms A\r\n•	accurize, accurizing: The process of altering a stock firearm to improve its accuracy.\r\n•	action: The physical mechanism that manipulates cartridges and/or seals the breech. The term refers to the method in which cartridges are loaded, locked, and extracted from the mechanism. Actions are generally categorized by the type of mechanism used. A firearm action is technically not present on muzzleloaders as all loading is done by hand. The mechanism that fires a muzzle-loader is called the lock.\r\n•	ammunition or ammo: Gunpowder and artillery. Since the design of the cartridge, the meaning has been transferred to the assembly of a projectile and its propellant in a single package.\r\n\r\n B\r\n•	back bore, backbored barrel: A shotgun barrel whose internal diameter is greater than nominal for the gauge, but less than the SAAMI maximum. Done in an attempt to reduce felt recoil, improve patterning, or change the balance of the shotgun.\r\n•	bandolier or bandoleer: A pocketed belt for holding ammunition and cartridges. It was usually slung over the chest. Bandoliers are now rare because most military arms use magazines which are not well-suited to being stored in such a manner. They are, however, still commonly used with shotguns, as individual 12 gauge shells can easily be stored in traditionally designed bandoliers.\r\n•	barrel: A tube, usually metal, through which a controlled explosion or rapid expansion of gases are released in order to propel a projectile out of the end at a high velocity.\r\n•	ballistic coefficient or BC: a measure of projectiles ability to overcome air resistance in flight. It is inversely proportional to the deceleration—a high number indicates a low deceleration. BC is a function of mass, diameter, and drag coefficient. In bullets it refers to the amount that drop over distance and wind drift will affect the bullet.\r\n•	bayonet lug: An attachment point for a bayonet.\r\n•	belt: ammunition belt is a device used to retain and feed cartridges into a firearm.\r\n•	belted magnum or belt: Any caliber cartridge, generally rifles, using a shell casing with a pronounced "belt" around its base that continues 2-4mm past the extractor groove.1 This design originated with the British gunmaker Holland & Holland for the purpose of headspace certain of their more powerful cartridges. Especially the non-shouldered (non-"bottlenecked") magnum rifle cartridges could be pushed too far into the chamber and thus cause catastrophic failure of the gun when fired with excessive headspace; the addition of the belt to the casing prevented this over-insertion.\r\n•	bipod: A support device that is similar to a tripod or monopod, but with two legs. On firearms, bipods are commonly used on rifles to provide a forward rest and reduce motion. The bipod permits the operator to rest the weapon on the ground, a low wall, or other object, reducing operator fatigue and permitting increased accuracy.\r\n•	black powder also called gunpowder: a mixture of sulfur, charcoal, and potassium nitrate. It burns rapidly, producing a volume of hot gas made up of carbon dioxide, water, and nitrogen, and a solid residue of potassium sulfide.2 Because of its burning properties and the amount of heat and gas volume that it generates, gunpowder has been widely used as a propellant in firearms and as a pyrotechnic composition in fireworks. Modern firearms do not use the traditional black powder described here, but instead use smokeless powder.\r\n•	black powder substitute: A firearm propellant that is designed to reproduce the burning rate and propellant properties of black powder (making it safe for use in black powder firearms), while providing advantages in one or more areas such as reduced smoke, reduced corrosion, reduced cost, or decreased sensitivity to unintentional ignition.\r\n•	blank: A type of cartridge for a firearm that contains gunpowder but no bullet or shot. When fired, the blank makes a flash and an explosive sound (report). Blanks are often used for simulation (such as in historical reenactments, theatre and movie special effects), training, and for signaling (see starting pistol). Blank cartridges differ from dummy cartridges, which are used for training or function testing firearms; these contain no primer or gunpowder, and are inert.\r\n•	blowback: A system of operation for self-loading firearms that obtains power from the motion of the cartridge case as it is pushed to the rear by expanding gases created by the ignition of the powder charge.3\r\n•	bluing or blueing: A passivation process in which steel is partially protected against rust, and is named after the blue-black appearance of the resulting protective finish. True gun bluing is an electrochemical conversion coating resulting from an oxidizing chemical reaction with iron on the surface selectively forming magnetite (Fe3O4), the black oxide of iron, which occupies the same volume as metallic iron. Bluing is most commonly used by gun manufacturers, gunsmiths and gun owners to improve the cosmetic appearance of, and provide a measure of corrosion resistance to, their firearms.\r\n•	bolt action: A type of firearm action in which the weapon''s bolt is operated manually by the opening and closing of the breech (barrel) with a small handle. As the handle is operated, the bolt is unlocked, the breech is opened, the spent shell casing is withdrawn and ejected, the firing pin is cocked, and finally a new round/shell (if available) is placed into the breech and the bolt closed.\r\n•	bolt thrust or breech pressure: The amount of rearward force exerted by the propellant gases on the bolt or breech of a firearm action or breech when a projectile is fired. The applied force has both magnitude and direction, making it a vector quantity.\r\n•	bore snake: A tool used to clean the barrel of a gun.\r\n•	boresight: Crude adjustments made to an optical firearm sight, or iron sights, to align the firearm barrel and sights. This method is usually used to pre-align the sights, which makes zeroing (zero drop at XX distance) much faster.\r\n•	brass: The empty cartridge case.\r\n•	break-action: A firearm whose barrels are hinged, and rotate perpendicular to the bore axis to expose the breech and allow loading and unloading of ammunition.\r\n•	breech pressure or Bolt thrust: The amount of rearward force exerted by the propellant gases on the bolt or breech of a firearm action or breech when a projectile is fired. The applied force has both magnitude and direction, making it a vector quantity.\r\n•	bullpup: a firearm configurations in which both the action and magazine are located behind the trigger.\r\n•	burst mode: a firing mode enabling the shooter to fire a predetermined number of rounds with a single pull of the trigger.\r\n•	button rifling: Rifling that is formed by pulling a die made with reverse image of the rifling (the ''button'') down the pre-drilled bore of a firearm barrel. See also cut rifling and hammer forging.\r\n\r\n C\r\n•	caliber/calibre: 1. In small arms, the internal diameter of a firearm''s barrel or a cartridge''s bullet, usually expressed in millimeters or hundredths of an inch; in measuring rifled barrels this may be measured across the lands (such as .303 British) or grooves (such as .308 Winchester). 2. A specific cartridge for which a firearm is chambered, such as .44 Magnum. 3. In artillery, the length of the barrel expressed in terms of the internal diameter; for example, a 3 inch, 30 caliber gun would have a barrel 3 inches in internal diameter and 90 (30 times 3) inches in length.\r\n•	carbine: 1. A shortened version of a service rifle, often chambered in a less potent cartridge. The M4 Carbine is an example which uses the same cartridge but a shorter barrel, whereas the M1 Carbine is an example using a different cartridge. 2. A shortened version of the infantryman''s musket or rifle suited for use by cavalry.\r\n•	cartridge: The assembly consisting of a bullet, gunpowder, shell casing, and primer. When counting, it is referred to as a round.\r\n•	caseless ammunition: a type of small arms ammunition that eliminates the cartridge case that typically holds the primer, propellant, and projectile together as a unit.\r\n•	Casket magazine: a quad stack box magazine.\r\n•	centerfire: A cartridge in which the primer is located in the center of the cartridge case head. Unlike rimfire cartridges, the primer is a separate and replaceable component. The centerfire cartridge has replaced the rimfire in all but the smallest cartridge sizes. Except for low-powered .22 and .17 caliber cartridges, and a handful of antiques, all modern pistol, rifle, and shotgun ammunition are centerfire.\r\n•	chain gun: type of machine gun or autocannon that uses an external source of power to cycle the weapon.\r\n•	chamber: The portion of the barrel or firing cylinder in which the cartridge is inserted prior to being fired. Rifles and pistols generally have a single chamber in their barrels, while revolvers have multiple chambers in their cylinders and no chamber in their barrel.\r\n•	chambering: Inserting a round into the chamber, either manually or through the action of the weapon (e.g., pump-action, lever-action, bolt-action, or automatic-action.).\r\n•	charger: A speedloader that holds several cartridges together in a single unit for easier loading of a firearm''s magazine. A stripper clip is used only for loading the magazine and is not necessary for the firearm to function.\r\n•	charging handle: device on a firearm which, when operated, results in the hammer or striker being cocked or moved to the ready position.\r\n•	clip: A device that is used to store multiple rounds of ammunition together as a unit, ready for insertion into the magazine of a repeating firearm. This speeds up the process of loading and reloading the firearm as several rounds can be loaded at once, rather than one round being loaded at a time. The term clip commonly refers to a firearm magazine, though this usage is incorrect. In the correct usage, a clip is used to feed a magazine or revolving cylinder, while a magazine or a belt is used to load cartridges into the chamber of a firearm.4\r\n•	collateral damage: Damage that is unintended or incidental to the intended outcome.5 The term originated in the United States military, but it has since expanded into broader use.\r\n•	collimator sight: A type of optical "blind" sight that allows the user looking into it to see an illuminated aiming point aligned with the device the sight is attached to regardless of eye position (parallax free).6 The user can not see through the sight so it is used with both eyes open while one looks into the sight, with one eye open and moving the head to alternately see the sight and then at the target, or using one eye to partially see the sight and target at the same time.7 (variant names/types: collimating sight, 8occluded eye gunsight (OEG).9)\r\n•	combination gun: A shoulder-held firearm that has two barrels; one rifle barrel and one shotgun barrel. Most combination guns are of an over/under design (abbreviated as O/U), in which the two barrels are stacked vertically on top of each other, but some combination guns are of a side-by-side design (abbreviated as SxS), in which the two barrels sit beside each other.\r\n•	cordite: A family of smokeless propellants developed and produced in the United Kingdom from 1889 to replace gunpowder as a military propellant. Like gunpowder, cordite is classified as a low explosive because of its slow burning rates and consequently low brisance. The hot gases produced by burning gunpowder or cordite generate sufficient pressure to propel a bullet or shell to its target, but not enough to destroy the barrel of the firearm, or gun.\r\n•	CQB: Close quarters combat (CQC) or close quarters battle (CQB) is a type of fighting in which small units engage the enemy with personal weapons at very short range, potentially to the point of hand-to-hand combat or fighting with hand weapons such as swords or knives.\r\n•	cylindro-conoidal bullet: A hollow base bullet, shaped so that, when fired, the bullet will expand and seal the bore. It was invented by Captain John Norton of the British 34th Regiment in 1832, after he examined the blow pipe arrows used by the natives in India and found that their base was formed of elastic locus pith, which by its expansion against the inner surface of the blow pipe prevented the escape of air past it.10\r\n\r\n D\r\n\r\n \r\nA view of the break-action of a side-by-side double-barrelled shotgun.\r\n•	damascus barrel or damascus twist: An obsolete method of manufacturing a firearm barrel made by twisting strips of metal around a mandrel and forge welding it into shape. See also Damascus steel.\r\n•	direct impingement: A type of gas operation for a firearm that directs gas from a fired cartridge directly to the bolt carrier or slide assembly to cycle the action.\r\n•	doglock: The lock that preceded the ''true'' flintlock in both rifles and pistols in the 17th century. Commonly used throughout Europe in the 1600s, it gained popular favor in the British and Dutch military. A doglock carbine was the principal weapon of the harquebusier, the most numerous type of cavalry in the armies of Thirty Years War and the English Civil War era.\r\n•	double-barreled shotgun: A shotgun with two barrels, usually of the same gauge or bore. The two types of double-barreled shotguns are over/under (abbreviated as O/U), in which the two barrels are stacked on top of each other, and side-by-side (abbreviated as SxS), in which the two barrels sit beside each other. See photo at right for example of side-by-side double-barreled shotgun. For double-barreled guns that use one shotgun barrel and one rifle barrel, see combination gun.\r\n•	double rifle: A rifle that has two barrels, usually of the same caliber. The two types of double rifles are over/under (abbreviated as O/U), in which the two barrels are stacked on top of each other, and side-by-side (abbreviated as SxS), in which the two barrels sit beside each other. The photo at right is of a side-by-side shotgun, but a side-by-side rifle is very similar. For double-barreled guns that use one shotgun barrel and one rifle barrel, see combination gun.\r\n•	drilling: a firearm with three barrels (from the German word drei for three). Typically it has two barrels side by side on the top, with a third rifle barrel underneath. This provides a very versatile firearm capable of taking winged animals as well as big game. It also is useful in jurisdictions where a person is only allowed to own a single firearm.\r\n•	drum magazine: a type of firearms magazine that is cylindrical in shape, similar to a drum.\r\n•	dry fire: the practice of "firing" a firearm without ammunition. That is, to pull the trigger and allow the hammer or striker to drop on an empty chamber.\r\n•	dum-dum: A bullet designed to expand on impact, increasing in diameter to limit penetration and/or produce a larger diameter wound. The two typical designs are the hollow point bullet and the soft point bullet.\r\n•	dummy: A round of ammunition that is completely inert, i.e., contains no primer, propellant, or explosive charge. It is used to check weapon function, and for crew training.11 Unlike a blank it contains no charge at all.\r\n\r\n E\r\n•	electronic firing: The use of an electric current to fire a cartridge, instead of a percussion cap. In an electronic-fired firearm an electric current is used instead to ignite the propellant, which fires the cartridge as soon as the trigger is pulled.\r\n•	eye relief: For optics such as binoculars or a rifle scope, eye relief is the distance from the eyepiece to the viewers eye which matches the eyepiece exit pupil to the eye''s entrance pupil. Short eye relief requires the observer to press his or her eye close to the eyepiece in order to see an unvignetted image. For a shooter, eye relief is an important safety consideration. An optic with too short an eye relief can cause a skin cut at the contact point between the optic and the eyebrow of the shooter due to recoil.\r\n•	expanding bullet: An expanding bullet is a bullet designed to expand on impact, increasing in diameter to limit penetration and/or produce a larger diameter wound. The two typical designs are the hollow point bullet and the soft point bullet.\r\n•	extractor: A part in a firearm that serves to remove brass cases of fired ammunition after the ammunition has been fired. When the gun''s action cycles, the extractor lifts or removes the spent brass casing from the firing chamber.\r\n\r\n F\r\n•	falling block action (also known as a sliding-block action) is a single-shot firearm action in which a solid metal breechblock slides vertically in grooves cut into the breech of the rifle and actuated by a lever. When in the top position, it is locked and resists the force of recoil while sealing the chamber. In the lower position, it leaves the chamber open to be loaded by a cartridge from the rear.\r\n•	Ferritic nitrocarburizing: A case hardening processes that diffuse nitrogen and carbon into ferrous metals at sub-critical temperatures to improve scuffing resistance, fatigue properties and corrosion resistance of metal surfaces. Also called nitriding.\r\n•	fire forming: the process of reshaping a metallic cartridge case to fit a new chamber by firing it within that chamber.12\r\n•	forcing cone: The tapered section at the rear of the barrel of a revolver that eases the entry of the bullet into the bore.13\r\n•	fouling shot: A fouling shot is a shot fired through a clean bore, intended to leave some residue of firing and prepare the bore for more consistent performance in subsequent shots. The first shot through a clean bore will behave differently than subsequent shots through a bore with traces of powder residue, resulting in a different point of impact. Also, the Fouling Shot Journal, a publication of the Cast Bullet Association14\r\n•	forward assist: A button, found commonly on M16 and AR-15 styled rifles, usually located near the bolt closure, that when hit will push the bolt carrier forward, ensuring that the bolt is locked.\r\n•	fouling: The accumulation of unwanted material on solid surfaces. The fouling material can consist of either powder, lubrication residue, or bullet material such as lead or copper.\r\n•	frangible: A bullet that is designed to disintegrate into tiny particles upon impact to minimize their penetration for reasons of range safety, to limit environmental impact, or to limit the danger behind the intended target. Examples are the Glaser Safety Slug and the breaching round.1516\r\n•	frizzen: an "L" shaped piece of steel hinged at the rear used in flintlock firearms. The flint scraping the steel causes a shower of sparks to be thrown into the flash pan.\r\n\r\n G\r\n•	gas check is a device used in some types of firearms ammunition when non-jacketed bullets are used in high pressure cartridges, to prevent the buildup of lead in the barrel and aid in accuracy.17\r\n•	gas-operated reloading: a system of operation used to provide energy to operate autoloading firearms.\r\n•	gauge: The gauge of a firearm is a unit of measurement used to express the diameter of the barrel.\r\n•	general purpose machine gun: a machine gun intended to fill the role of either a light machine gun or medium machine gun, while at the same time being man-portable.\r\n•	grain is a unit of measurement of mass that is based upon the mass of a single seed of a typical cereal. Used in firearms to denote the amount of powder in a cartridge or the weight of a bullet. Traditionally it was based on the weight of a grain of wheat or barley, but since 1958, the grain (gr) measure has been redefined using the International System of Units as precisely 64.79891 mg.1819 There are 7,000 grains per avoirdupois pound in the Imperial and U.S. customary units.\r\n•	grip safety: A safety mechanism, usually a lever on the rear of a pistol grip, that automatically unlocks the trigger mechanism of a firearm as pressure is applied by the shooter''s hand.13\r\n•	gunpowder, also called black powder, is a mixture of sulfur, charcoal, and potassium nitrate. It burns rapidly, producing a volume of hot gas made up of carbon dioxide, water, and nitrogen, and a solid residue of potassium sulfide.2 Because of its burning properties and the amount of heat and gas volume that it generates, gunpowder has been widely used as a propellant in firearms and as a pyrotechnic composition in fireworks. The term gunpowder also refers broadly to any propellant powder. Modern firearms do not use the traditional gunpowder (black powder) described here, but instead use smokeless powder.\r\n\r\n H\r\n•	hammer bite: The action of an external hammer pinching or poking the web of the operator''s shooting hand between the thumb and fore-finger when the gun is fired. Some handguns prone to this are the M1911 pistol and the Browning Hi-Power.20\r\n•	hang fire: An unexpected delay between the triggering of a firearm and the ignition of the propellant. This failure was common in firearm actions that relied on open primer pans, due to the poor or inconsistent quality of the powder. Modern weapons are susceptible, particularly if the ammunition has been stored in an environment outside of the design specifications.\r\n•	half-cock: The position of the hammer where the hammer is partially but not completely cocked. Many firearms, particularly older firearms, had a notch cut into the hammer allowing half-cock, as this position would neither allow the gun to fire nor permit the hammer-mounted firing pin to rest on a live percussion cap or cartridge. The purpose of the half-cock position has variously been used both for loading a firearm, and as a safety-mechanism.\r\n\r\n \r\nrevolver hammer\r\n•	hammer: The function of the hammer is to strike the firing pin in a firearm, which in turn detonates the impact-sensitive cartridge primer. The hammer of a firearm was given its name for both resemblance and functional similarity to the common tool.\r\n•	headspace: The distance measured from the part of the chamber that stops forward motion of the cartridge (the datum reference) to the face of the bolt. Used as a verb, headspace refers to the interference created between this part of the chamber and the feature of the cartridge that achieves the correct positioning.21\r\n•	headstamp: A headstamp is the markings on the bottom of a cartridge case designed for a firearm. It usually tells who manufactured the case. If it is a civilian case it often also tells the caliber, if it is military, the year of manufacture is often added.\r\n•	heavy machine gun: a larger class of machine gun.\r\n•	high brass: A shotgun shell for more powerful loads with the brass extended up further along the sides of the shell, while light loads will use "low brass" shells. The brass does not actually provide a significant amount of strength, but the difference in appearance provides shooters with a way to quickly differentiate between high and low powered ammunition.\r\n•	Holographic weapon sight: a non-magnifying gun sight that allows the user to look through a glass optical window and see a cross hair reticle image superimposed at a distance on the field of view.22 The hologram of the reticle is built into the window and is illuminated by a laser diode.', ''),
(488175, ' I\r\n\r\n \r\n.243 Winchester Ackley Improved (left) and .243 Winchester (right)\r\n&#8226;	improved cartridge: A wildcat cartridge that is created by straightening out the sides of an existing case and making a sharper shoulder to maximize powder space. Frequently the neck length and shoulder position are altered as well. The caliber is NOT changed in the process.\r\n&#8226;	IMR powder or Improved Military Rifle: A series of tubular nitrocellulose smokeless powders evolved from World War I through World War II for loading military and commercial ammunition and sold to private citizens for reloading rifle ammunition for hunting and target shooting.\r\n&#8226;	improvised firearm: a firearm manufactured by someone who is not a regular maker of firearms.\r\n&#8226;	internal ballistics: A subfield of ballistics, that is the study of a projectile''s behavior from the time its propellant''s igniter is initiated until it exits the gun barrel. The study of internal ballistics is important to designers and users of firearms of all types, from small-bore Olympic rifles and pistols, to high-tech artillery.\r\n&#8226;	iron sights are a system of aligned markers used to assist in the aiming of a device such as a firearm, crossbow, or telescope, and exclude the use of optics as in a scope. Iron sights are typically composed of two component sights, formed by metal blades: a rear sight mounted perpendicular to the line of sight and consisting of some form of notch (open sight) or aperture (closed sight); and a front sight that is a post, bead, or ring.\r\n\r\n J\r\n\r\n \r\njacketed bullets\r\n&#8226;	jacket: A metal, usually copper, wrapped around a lead core to form a bullet.\r\n&#8226;	jeweling: a cosmetic process to enhance the looks of firearm parts, such as the bolt. The look is created with an abrasive brush and compound that roughs the surface of the metal in a circular pattern.\r\n\r\n K\r\n&#8226;	keyhole or keyholing: Refers to the shape of the hole left in a paper target by a bullet fired down a gun barrel which has a diameter larger than the bullet or who fails to properly stabilize the bullet. A bullet fired in this manner tends to wobble or tumble as it moves through the air and leaves a "keyhole" shaped hole in a paper target instead of a round one.\r\n&#8226;	Khyber Pass copy: a firearm manufactured by cottage gunsmiths in the Khyber Pass region between Pakistan and Afghanistan.\r\n&#8226;	kick: The backward momentum of a gun when it is discharged. In technical terms, the recoil caused by the gun exactly balances the forward momentum of the projectile, according to Newton''s third law. (often called kickback or simply recoil)\r\n\r\n L\r\n&#8226;	length of pull: The distance between the trigger and the butt end of the stock of a rifle or shotgun.\r\n&#8226;	lever-action is a type of firearm action which uses a lever located around the trigger guard area, (often including the trigger guard itself) to load fresh cartridges into the chamber of the barrel when the lever is worked.\r\n&#8226;	light machine gun: machine gun designed to be employed by an individual soldier.\r\n&#8226;	live fire exercise or LFX: Any exercise in which a realistic scenario for the use of specific equipment is simulated. In the popular lexicon this is applied primarily to tests of weapons or weapon systems that are associated with the various branches of a nation''s armed forces, although the term can be applied to the civilian arena as well.\r\n&#8226;	lug: any piece that projects from a firearm for the purpose of attaching something to it. For example barrel lugs are used to attach a break-action shotgun barrel to the action itself. If the firearm is a revolver, the term may also refer to a protrusion under the barrel that adds weight, thereby stabilizing the gun during aiming, mitigating recoil, and reducing muzzle flip. A full lug extends all the way to the muzzle, while a half lug extends only partially down the barrel. On a swing-out-cylinder revolver, the lug is slotted to accommodate the ejector rod.13\r\n M\r\n&#8226;	machine gun: a fully automatic mounted or portable firearm.\r\n&#8226;	machine pistol: a handgun-style fully automatic or burst-mode firearm.\r\n&#8226;	machine revolver: a revolver that uses the energy of firing for cocking the hammer and revolving the cylinder, rather than using manual operations to perform these actions (more correctly, a semi-automatic revolver).\r\n&#8226;	magazine: A magazine is an ammunition storage and feeding device within or attached to a repeating firearm. Magazines may be integral to the firearm (fixed) or removable (detachable). The magazine functions by moving the cartridges stored in the magazine into a position where they may be loaded into the chamber by the action of the firearm.\r\n&#8226;	match grade: Firearm parts and ammunition that are suitable for a competitive match. This refers to parts that are designed and manufactured such that they have a relatively tight-tolerances and high level of accuracy.\r\n&#8226;	muzzle: The part of a firearm at the end of the barrel from which the projectile will exit.\r\n&#8226;	muzzle brakes and recoil compensators: devices that are fitted to the muzzle of a firearm to redirect propellant gases with the effect of countering both recoil of the gun and unwanted rising of the barrel during rapid fire.\r\n&#8226;	muzzle energy is the kinetic energy of a bullet as it is expelled from the muzzle of a firearm. It is often used as a rough indication of the destructive potential of a given firearm or load. The heavier the bullet and the faster it moves, the higher its muzzle energy and the more damage it will do.\r\n&#8226;	muzzle velocity is the speed at which a projectile leaves the muzzle of the gun. Muzzle velocities range from approximately 800 ft/s (240 m/s) for some pistols and older cartridges to more than 4,000 ft/s (1,200 m/s) in modern cartridges such as the .220 Swift and .204 Ruger. In conventional guns, muzzle velocity is determined by the quality (burn speed, expansion) and quantity of the propellant, the mass of the projectile, and the length of the barrel.\r\n\r\n N\r\n&#8226;	necking down or necking up refers to shrinking or expanding the neck of an existing cartridge to make it use a bullet of a different caliber. A typical process used in the creation of wildcat cartridges.\r\n&#8226;	NRA or National Rifle Association of America is an American organization which lists as its goals the protection of the Second Amendment of the United States Bill of Rights and the promotion of firearm ownership rights as well as marksmanship, firearm safety, and the protection of hunting and self-defense in the United States. The NRA is also the sanctioning body for most marksmanship competition in the U.S.A., from the local to the Olympic level (particularly bullseye style events).\r\n\r\n O\r\n&#8226;	out-of-battery: The status of a weapon before the action has returned to the normal firing position. The term originates from artillery, referring to a gun that fires before it has been pulled back into its firing position in a gun battery. In firearms where there is an automatic loading mechanism, a condition in which a live round is at least partially in the firing chamber and capable of being fired, but is not properly secured by the usual mechanism of that particular weapon can occur.\r\n&#8226;	over-bore: Small caliber bullets being used in very large cases.23 It is the relationship between the volume of powder that can fit in a case and the diameter of the inside of the barrel or bore.24\r\n&#8226;	obturate: Obturation is the process of a bullet expanding under pressure to fit the bore of the firearm, or a cartridge case expanding under pressure to seal the chamber. See also swage.\r\n P\r\n&#8226;	parkerizing: A method of protecting a steel surface from corrosion and increasing its resistance to wear through the application of an electrochemical phosphate conversion coating. Also called phosphating and phosphatizing.\r\n&#8226;	percussion cap: a small cylinder of copper or brass that was the crucial invention that enabled muzzle-loading firearms to fire reliably in any weather. The cap has one closed end. Inside the closed end is a small amount of a shock-sensitive explosive material such as fulminate of mercury. The percussion cap is placed over a hollow metal "nipple" at the rear end of the gun barrel. Pulling the trigger releases a hammer which strikes the percussion cap and ignites the explosive primer. The flame travels through the hollow nipple to ignite the main powder charge.\r\n&#8226;	Picatinny rail: a bracket used on some firearms in order to provide a standardized mounting platform.\r\n&#8226;	pinfire: an obsolete type of brass cartridge in which the priming compound is ignited by striking a small pin which protrudes radially from just above the base of the cartridge.\r\n&#8226;	plinking: Informal target shooting done at non-traditional targets such as tin cans, glass bottles, and balloons filled with water.25\r\n&#8226;	powerhead or bang stick: a specialized firearm used underwater that is fired when in direct contact with the target.\r\n&#8226;	pump-action: A rifle or shotgun in which the handgrip can be pumped back and forth in order to eject a spent round of ammunition and to chamber a fresh one. It is much faster than a bolt-action and somewhat faster than a lever-action, as it does not require the trigger hand to be removed from the trigger whilst reloading. When used in rifles, this action is also commonly called a slide action.\r\n\r\n Q\r\n&#8226;	quad-barrelled: A gun, typically artillery, with four barrels, such as the ZPU.\r\n R\r\n&#8226;	ramrod: a device used with early firearms to push the projectile up against the propellant (mainly gunpowder).\r\n&#8226;	rate of fire: the frequency at which a firearm can fire its projectiles.\r\n&#8226;	recoil: The backward momentum of a gun when it is discharged. In technical terms, the recoil caused by the gun exactly balances the forward momentum of the projectile, according to Newton''s third law. (often called kickback or simply kick)\r\n&#8226;	recoil operation: Recoil operation is an operating mechanism used in locked-breech, autoloading firearms. As the name implies, these actions use the force of recoil to provide energy to cycle the action.\r\n&#8226;	Red dot sight a type of reflector (reflex) sight for firearms that gives the uses a red light-emitting diode as a reticle to create an aimpoint.\r\n&#8226;	Reflector (reflex) sight: A generally non-magnifying optical device that has an optically collimated reticle, allowing the user to look through a partially reflecting glass element and see a parallax free cross hair or other projected aiming point superimposed on the field of view.26 Invented in 1900 but not generally used on firearms until reliably illuminated versions were invented in the late 1970s (usually referred to by the abbreviation &#8220;reflex sight&#8221;).\r\n&#8226;	revolver: a repeating firearm that has a cylinder containing multiple chambers and at least one barrel for firing.\r\n&#8226;	ricochet: (  /&#712;r&#618;k&#601;&#643;e&#618;/ RIK-&#601;-shay) is a rebound, bounce or skip off a surface, particularly in the case of a projectile.\r\n&#8226;	rifle bedding: a process of filling gaps between the action and the stock of a rifle with an epoxy based material.\r\n&#8226;	rifling: Helical grooves in the barrel of a gun or firearm, which imparts a spin to a projectile around its long axis. This spin serves to gyroscopically stabilize the projectile, improving its aerodynamic stability and accuracy.\r\n&#8226;	rimfire: A type of firearm cartridge that used a firing pin which strikes the base''s rim, instead of striking the primer cap at the center of the base of the cartridge to ignite it (as in a centerfire cartridge). The rim of the rimfire cartridge is essentially an extended and widened percussion cap which contains the priming compound, while the cartridge case itself contains the propellant powder and the projectile (bullet).\r\n&#8226;	rolling block: A form of firearm action where the sealing of the breech is done with a circular shaped breechblock able to rotate on a pin. The breechblock is locked into place by the hammer, thus preventing the cartridge from moving backwards at the moment of firing. By cocking the hammer, the breechblock can be rotated freely to reload the weapon.\r\n&#8226;	round: a single cartridge.\r\n\r\n S\r\n&#8226;	sabot : a device used in a firearm to fire a projectile, such as a bullet, that is smaller than the bore diameter.\r\n&#8226;	safety: A mechanism used to help prevent the accidental discharge of a firearm, helping to ensure safer handling. Safeties can generally be divided into subtypes such as internal safeties (which typically do not receive input from the user) and external safeties (which typically allow the user to give input, for example, toggling a lever from "on" to "off" or something similar). Sometimes these are called "passive" and "active" safeties (or "automatic" and "manual"), respectively.\r\n&#8226;	sawed-off shotgun/short-barreled shotgun (SBS): a type of shotgun with a shorter gun barrel and often a shorter or deleted stock.\r\n&#8226;	selective fire: A firearm that fires semi&#8211;automatically and at least one automatic mode by means of a selector depending on the weapon''s design. Some selective fire weapons utilize burst fire mechanisms to limit the maximum or total number of shots fired automatically in this mode. The most common limits are two or three rounds per pull of the trigger.\r\n&#8226;	semi-wadcutter or SWC: A type of all-purpose bullet commonly used in revolvers which combines features of the wadcutter target bullet and traditional round nosed revolver bullets, and is used in both revolver and pistol cartridges for hunting, target shooting, and plinking. The basic SWC design consists of a roughly conical nose, truncated with a flat point, sitting on a cylinder. The flat nose punches a clean hole in the target, rather than tearing it like a round nose bullet would, and the sharp shoulder enlarges the hole neatly, allowing easy and accurate scoring of the target. The SWC design offers better external ballistics than the wadcutter, as its conical nose produces less drag than the flat cylinder.\r\n&#8226;	shooting range: a specialized facility designed for firearms practice.\r\n&#8226;	shooting sticks: are portable weapon mounts.\r\n&#8226;	short-barreled rifle (SBR): a legal designation in the United States, referring to a shoulder-fired, rifled firearm with a barrel length of less than 16" (40.6 cm) or overall length of less than 26" (66.0 cm).\r\n&#8226;	single-action: Usually referring to a pistol or revolver, single-action is when the hammer is pulled back manually by the shooter (cocking it), after which the trigger is operated to fire the shot. See also double-action.\r\n&#8226;	single-shot: A firearm that holds only a single round of ammunition, and must be reloaded after each shot.\r\n&#8226;	slamfire: a premature, unintended discharge of a firearm that occurs as a round is being loaded into the chamber.\r\n&#8226;	sleeving: A method of using new tubes to replace a worn-out gun barrel.27\r\n&#8226;	slide bite: A phenomenon which is often grouped with hammer bite. In this case the web of the shooting hand is cut or abraded by the rearward motion of the semi-automatic pistol''s slide, not by the gun''s hammer. This most often occurs with small pistols like the Walther PPK and Walther TPH that have an abbreviated grip tang. This problem is exacerbated by the sharp machining found on many firearms.\r\n&#8226;	sling: is a type of strap or harness designed to allow an operator carry a firearm (usually a long gun such as a rifle, carbine, shotgun, or submachine gun) on his/her person and/or aid in greater hit probability with that firearm.\r\n&#8226;	snubnosed revolver: a revolver with a short barrel length.\r\n&#8226;	speedloader: A device used for loading a firearm or firearm magazine with loose ammunition very quickly. Generally, speedloaders are used for loading all chambers of a revolver simultaneously, although speedloaders of different designs are also used for the loading of fixed tubular magazines of shotguns and rifles, or the loading of box or drum magazines. Revolver speedloaders are used for revolvers having either swing-out cylinders or top-break cylinders.\r\n&#8226;	spitzer bullet: an aerodynamic bullet design.\r\n&#8226;	sporterising, sporterisation, or sporterization: The practice of modifying military-type firearms either to make them suitable for civilian sporting use or to make them legal under the law.\r\n&#8226;	squib load, also known as squib round, pop and no kick, or just squib: A firearms malfunction in which a fired projectile does not have enough force behind it to exit the barrel, and thus becomes stuck.\r\n&#8226;	stock: The part of a rifle or other firearm, to which the barrel and firing mechanism are attached, that is held against one''s shoulder when firing the gun. The stock provides a means for the shooter to firmly support the device and easily aim it.\r\n&#8226;	stopping power: The ability of a firearm or other weapon to cause a penetrating ballistic injury to a target, human or animal, sufficient to incapacitate the target where it stands.\r\n&#8226;	stripper clip: A speedloader that holds several cartridges together in a single unit for easier loading of a firearm''s magazine. A stripper clip is used only for loading the magazine and is not necessary for the firearm to function.\r\n&#8226;	suppressor, sound suppressor, sound moderator, "hush puppy",or silencer: A device attached to or part of the barrel of a firearm to reduce the amount of noise and flash generated by firing the weapon.\r\n&#8226;	silencer, suppressor, sound suppressor, sound moderator, or "hush puppy": A device attached to or part of the barrel of a firearm to reduce the amount of noise and flash generated by firing the weapon.\r\n&#8226;	swage: To reduce an item in size by forcing through a die. In internal ballistics, swaging refers to the process where bullets are swaged into the rifling of the barrel by the force of the expanding powder gases.\r\n&#8226;	swaged bullet: A bullet that is formed by forcing the bullet into a die to assume its final form.\r\n&#8226;	swaged choke: A constriction or choke in a shotgun barrel formed by a swaging process that compresses the outside of the barrel.\r\n&#8226;	swaged rifling: Rifling in a firearm barrel formed by a swaging process, such as button rifling.', ''),
(488176, ' T\r\n&#8226;	Taylor KO Factor: mathematical approach for evaluating the stopping power of hunting cartridges.\r\n&#8226;	telescoping stock or collapsing stock: A stock on a firearm that telescopes or folds in on itself in order to become more compact. Telescoping stocks are useful for storing a rifle or weapon in a space that it would not normally fit in.\r\n&#8226;	terminal ballistics: A sub-field of ballistics, is the study of the behavior of a projectile when it hits its target.28\r\n&#8226;	trigger: A mechanism that actuates the firing sequence of a firearm. Triggers almost universally consist of levers or buttons actuated by the index finger.\r\n&#8226;	trunnion: a cylindrical protrusion used as a mounting and/or pivoting point. On firearms, the barrel is sometimes mounted in a trunnion, which in turn is mounted to the receiver.\r\n\r\n U\r\n&#8226;	upset forging: A process that increases the diameter of a workpiece by compressing its length.\r\n&#8226;	underlug: 1. The locking lugs on a break-action firearm that extend from the bottom of the barrels under the chamber(s) and connect into the receiver bottom.29 2. The metal shroud underneath the barrel of a revolver that surrounds and protects the extractor rod. The two types of underlugs include half-lug, meaning the shroud doesn''t run the entire length of the barrel but instead is only as long as the extractor rod, and full-lug, meaning the shroud runs the full length of the barrel.\r\n&#8226;	underwater firearm: a firearm specially designed for use underwater.\r\n\r\n V\r\n\r\n \r\nvarmint rifle\r\n&#8226;	varmint rifle: A small-caliber firearm or high-powered air gun primarily used for varmint hunting &#8212; killing non-native or non-game animals such as rats, house sparrows, starling, crows, ground squirrels, gophers, jackrabbits, marmots, groundhogs, porcupine, opossum, coyote, skunks, weasels,30 or feral cats, dogs, goats, pigs and other animals considered to be nuisance vermin destructive to native or domestic plants and animals.31\r\n\r\n W\r\n&#8226;	wadcutter: A special-purpose bullet specially designed for shooting paper targets, usually at close range and at subsonic velocities typically under 800 ft/s (240 m/s). They are often used in handgun and airgun competitions. A wadcutter has a flat or nearly flat front that cuts a very clean hole through the paper target, making it easier to score and ideally reducing errors in scoring the target to the favor of the shooter.\r\n&#8226;	WCF: An acronym for a family of cartridges designed by Winchester Repeating Arms Company, called Winchester Center Fire, as in the .30-30 WCF or .32 WCF.32\r\n&#8226;	wheellock: an obsolete mechanism for firing a firearm.\r\n&#8226;	wildcat cartridge or wildcat: A custom cartridge for which ammunition and firearms are not mass produced.

(488214, ' There is a thread where this has been discussed in detail. I remember that I had also posted complete LAW about self defense. Secondly the Arms Ordinance does NOT specify that whether a gun has to go loaded or unloaded. IT is the RESPONSIBILITY of the person on whose name the license is to safely carry the weapon so that he doesn''t break the law. Here breaking the law means accidental discharge included, as well as any other notifications such as 144 restriction imposed by provincial Home department.\n\n[QUOTE=davidglory;326191]first of all carrying a loaded weapon with a proper training is stupid and unlawful. using cheap is the second worse thing you can do it to yourself. third carrying a weapon with yourself can be more dangerous than you think. forth it takes a person to be a real man to shoot another man. \n\n"Those who would give up essential liberty to purchase a little temporary safety, deserve neither liberty nor safety".[/QUOTE]\n\nAs far as davidglory has written above quoted words of wisdom.. all i can say is he is a sheep that is ready to be taken by the wolf. When the law allows you to do something and specifies the method of doing something you do it that way.. take example of Driving license; You need to have one to drive, it is THAT simple.. similarly to possess a gun you have to go through all the paperwork and the police verification as well as through the purchase and subsequent re-entry of the weapon on the register of arms.. THEN you are legally carrying a weapon with all the formalities complete. So saying that following the law and getting a license is stupid and unlawful.. then my friend david.. i cant say anything.. loss of words. \n\nCarrying cheap weapon is surely dangerous but you cannot say anything unless you are in the shoes of the person. Just DONT be judgmental.. OR the JUDGE is going to say YOU are MENTAL.\n\nThirdly you cannot be far from reality when you think carrying a gun is more dangerous that any one can think. Brother when you live in a rife city like karachi where anything can happen anytime and that too on top when you VALUE you life more than anything.. that is then when you realise that ALL the money and ALL the things you have earned.. medals, degrees, house, cars, clothes, expensive mobile phone and what not is all pieces of crap when you didnt even prepare to save your self from a worthless bandit. IF you want to live.. for your self and are prepared to save the life of your family then you should be prepared.. preparation comes firstly from buying a weapon (with legal formalities) and then training with it.. and then lastly carrying it according to law. SIMPLE... when you have 2 seconds to decide as you see a bandit coming what will you do..?? call police and ask the bandit to wait till police arrives??? OR just shoot that bastard down?? just choose quickly and wisely .. that is all i can ask from you for your family''s sake.\n\nLastly it does take a man to shoot another man.. think makes me think.. are you a woman or a transvestite?? and NOT ready to defend yourself and your family?? if that is so.. then please refrain from posting such derogatory remarks about men who arm them selves to defend their liberty, honor and life for the sake of their future.. \n\n[QUOTE=davidglory;326191]"Those who would give up essential liberty to purchase a little temporary safety, deserve neither liberty nor safety".[/QUOTE]\nAbsolutely true.. it is the freedom to carry a weapon for personal safety that keeps the bad guys away.. those who choose NOT to go armed are always the ones to be robbed and shot. It is a fundamental right in all the constitutions of the world that every person has the right to be safe and live with liberty to his own choosing.. IF the people choose to keep arms available then it is their choice to make such laws in the country... and follow them accordingly.. make rules for those who choose NOT to follow the law. IF you give up your gun to have temporary safety from the BG or the crooked politician.. rest assured that there is a massacre coming up in near future, thence true that you deserve neither liberty nor safety.\n\n"Keeping a weapon of your choice is what is included in the word LIBERTY; YOU are at LIBERTY to CHOOSE how to spend YOUR life."', ''),

There is NO restriction that you carry a weapon with a chambered round. IT is YOUR responsibility own, possess and carry the weapon. The only restriction that came was in the shape of Act XVI of 1997 and thereafter the notification by federal government as well as supplanted by the provincial government that OPEN carry is restricted as it gives the populace a fear of threat or terror. In some areas of Pakistan this is not so strictly applied and in some areas it is takes seriously severe.\r\nIf there is a section 144 Cr.P.C restriction imposed the only way out of it is the permit to carry in section 144 imposed days. This takes care of the legal implications if you are carrying the weapon.. carry the original permit, original license and your original CNIC at all times when you have the weapon with you.

(488222, ' Telemarketers suck big time. Here are some proven ways to rid your life of them for good...\n\n1. If they want to loan you money, tell them you just filed for bankruptcy and you could sure use some money.\n\n2. If they start out with, "How are you today?" say, "I''m so glad you asked, because no one these days seems to care, and I have all these problems. My arthritis is acting up, my eyelashes are sore, my dog just died . . . "\n\n3. If they say they''re John Doe from XYZ Company, ask them to spell their name. Then ask them to spell the company name. Then ask them where it is located, how long it has been in business, how many people work there, how they got into this line of work if they are married, how many kids they have, etc. Continue asking them personal questions or questions about their company for as long as necessary.\n\n4. (This works great if you are male) Telemarketer: "Hi, my name is Judy and I''m with XYZ Company. " You: Wait for a second and with a real husky voice ask, "What are you wearing?"\n\n5. Cry out in surprise, "Judy? Is that you? Oh my God! Judy, how have you been?" Hopefully, this will give Judy a few brief moments of terror as she tries to figure out where she could know you from.\n\n6. Say "No" over and over. Be sure to vary the sound of each one, and keep a rhythmic tempo, even as they are trying to speak. This is most fun if you can do it until they hang up.\n\n7. If MCI calls trying to get you to sign up for the Family and Friends Plan, reply, in as sinister a voice as you can, "I don''t have any friends, would you be my friend?"\n\n8. If the company cleans rugs, respond: "Can you get out blood? Can you get out goat blood? How about human blood?"\n\n9. After the Telemarketer gives his or her spiel, ask him or her to marry you. When they get all flustered, tell them that you can''t just give your credit card number to a complete stranger.\n\n10. If the Telemarketer is selling raffle tickets, tell him or her that you work for the same company, and that employees cannot participate.\n\n11. Answer the phone. As soon as you realize it is a Telemarketer, set the receiver down, scream, "OH MY GOD!" and then hang up.\n\n12. Tell the Telemarketer you are busy at the moment and ask if he/she will give you their home phone number so you can call him/her back. When the Telemarketer explains that telemarketers cannot give out their home numbers say, "I guess you don''t want anyone bothering you at home, right?" The Telemarketer will agree and you say, "Me either!" and proceed to hang up.\n\n13. Ask them to repeat everything they say, several times.\n\n14. Tell them it is dinner time, but ask if they would please hold. Put them on your speaker phone while you continue to eat at your leisure. Smack your food loudly and continue with your dinner conversation. For added effect, clanging of cutlery and dishes is recommended.\n\n15. Tell the Telemarketer you are on "home incarceration" and ask if they could bring you some beer.\n\n16. Ask them to fax the information to you, and make up a number.\n\n17. Tell the Telemarketer, "Okay, I''ll listen to you. But I should probably tell you, I''m not wearing any clothes."\n\n18. Insist that the caller is really your buddy Leon, playing a joke. "Come on, Leon, cut it out! Seriously, Leon, how''s your momma?"\n\n19. Tell them you are hard of hearing and that they need to speak up... louder... louder!\n\n20.

(488353, ' I''d like to mention Paul Marie Eugène Vieille, the French chemist who invented smokeless powder in 1884.\n\n As with many things, "smokeless powder" was invented many times, in many places, by various people.  There were others who predated Vieille, but all modern smokeless powders are descended from Vieille, who managed to come up with a process that was both safe and suitable for mass production.\n\n Interestingly, Vieille''s smokeless powder patent was the first big test of international patent law. The British simply ignored the patent and began producing powder by the Vieille process without payment.  The Vieille sued, with the backing of the French government, and relations between the two countries became *very tense* for a few years.\n\n The main reason was that the Vieille patent gave France a huge military advantage over other nations.  Not for small arms, but for the French army and navy, which were always short of powder for their artillery, same as any other country.  The bottleneck was over potassium nitrate, the chemical that provided the oxidizer component of black powder.  At the time there was no practical way to synthesize potassion nitrate in quantity; it was mostly obtained from bird guano.  England''s tax men dug out the ground under public toilets; the French put in public "pissoirs" to collect and recover potassium nitrate from human urine.  Vieille''s process broke the nitrate bottleneck; smokeless powder wasn''t only cheaper, but could be made in essentially unlimited quantities.\n\n In the end it didn''t make any major historical difference; by World War 1 all combatants had completed the changeover to smokeless powders.  But it did upset the balance of powder at a critical point in history...', ''),

Then you f1st load the magazines and then start shooting again . That is an uphill task during a combat situation . Only rock and lock type 12 shot extra magazines are available in the market ( US.made). Pus you have an added advantage of installing a 2 round drum.

(488498, ' @ Takenleader: \nYou have a very valid point. Indeed surefire 12 round magazines which are more common as well as the drum magazines which are 20 rounders are relatively easily available for the saiga''s without magwells. \n\nHowever, if one googles the subject , the regular magazines and even the hi capacity banana types can be modified to fit the magwell type saigas with a little at-home work.  Though in all fairness i have not found a solution yet for the 20 rounder drums. \n\nThe reason i am not a big fan of saiga''s without magwells is because in the case of high caps (i use 12 rounders from surefire) with the magazine fully loaded it is a PAIN to load the Saiga with the bolt closed. Also, with a fully loaded magazine, the top plastic round gets deformed when pushed up against the closed bolt. \n\nHence i am looking for a magwell to install on my saiga which i bought early last year when magwells did not come as standard on some models. i will modify my magazines accordingly. \n\nAnyhow, takenleader has a very legitimate and insightful point to what i posted earlier and the user should choose the weapon according to his needs.', ''),

In my humble opinion, the reason is that CZ999 is considered to be a better pistol than NP22/34... I never had the opportunity to shoot with CZ999, but have used NP22, currently using NP34 and REALLY like it... According to many senior members/ users of NP22/34 & CZ999, CZ999 is FAR better than NP22/34... AND... if its better than NP22/34, then it MUST be a "HELL OF A GUN"... I don''t know about the political scenario, but the only reason of CZ999 being cheap rather "economical" is that in Pakistan, unfortunately, Serbian guns don''t have that much of demand, compared to Turkish guns... Unfortunately most of the people in Pakistan, go for the looks rather than functionality...

(488722, 'Hatsan Escort Magnum meets DSA ZARS We were planning to condust a test + friendly match between different security/zombie slaying shotguns since DSA ZARS was developed, tested and reviewed at Pakguns. So it finally happened on Sunday 9-12-12 after weeks n weeks of deliberation. \n  It was beautiful sunny day at Sialkot range with the company of dearest friends AK47 & 12Gauge making it more beautiful. \n  Had 3 different shotguns to select one from to pit against DSA ZARS ( detailed review can be read here;  [url]http://www.pakguns.com/showthread.php?10081-Review-DSA-Zombie-Apocalypse-Response-Shotgun-P-A[/url] );\n   \n  1) Mossberg Rolling Thunder - (PA owned by AK47)\n  2) Mossberg 835 Ultimag - (PA owned by Denovo87)\n  3) Hatsan Escort Magnum - (SA owned by Denovo87)\n   \n  Main objective was to gauge consistent accuracy of DSA vs other similar shotguns; so decided first to do it at 50 meters using Pakguns special slugs. But after 1st round of 3 shots each from DSA and Mossberg 835 it was decided to pull the Mossberg 835 off from competition having rifled barrel (Mossberg Rolling Thunder was already out having only pistol).  So we left with only one shotgun to through in the match against DSA that was Hatsan Escort.\n  Also was decided to reduce shooting range to 25meters.\n   \n  It also was agreed (between me and 12Gauge bro) that none of us will give any comment on which among DSA n Hatsan proved more accurate; we will let viewers decide after seeing targets. By the way there wasn''t any sort of stoppage or malfunction experienced in any of the shotguns used that day.\n   \n   \n  Below are the photos of range, shooter n equipment;\n   \n  AK47 & Denovo87 posing before starting smoking shotguns:\n   \n  [IMG]http://i577.photobucket.com/albums/ss220/denovo87/Range%20n%20Targets/9-12-12%20Shotguns%20Tested/AKnDenovo.jpg[/IMG]\n   \n  AK47:\n   \n  [IMG]http://i577.photobucket.com/albums/ss220/denovo87/Range%20n%20Targets/9-12-12%20Shotguns%20Tested/AKposing.jpg[/IMG]\n   \n  1-2-3...GO: \n   \n  [IMG]http://i577.photobucket.com/albums/ss220/denovo87/Range%20n%20Targets/9-12-12%20Shotguns%20Tested/GettingreadyforAction.jpg[/IMG]\n   \n   \n  [IMG]http://i577.photobucket.com/albums/ss220/denovo87/Range%20n%20Targets/9-12-12%20Shotguns%20Tested/MossbergSmokingslug.jpg[/IMG]\n   \n  Now lets targets do the talking:\n   \n  Target shot with Mossberg 835:\n  [IMG]http://i577.photobucket.com/albums/ss220/denovo87/Range%20n%20Targets/9-12-12%20Shotguns%20Tested/Mossbergnslugs.jpg[/IMG]\n   \n   \n  Target shot with DSA ZARS and Hatsan Escort Magnum:\n   \n  [IMG]http://i577.photobucket.com/albums/ss220/denovo87/Range%20n%20Targets/9-12-12%20Shotguns%20Tested/DSAvsHatsan.jpg[/IMG]\n   \n   \n  And here a non-ending argument starts as always ;)\n\n   \n  [IMG]http://i577.photobucket.com/albums/ss220/denovo87/Range%20n%20Targets/9-12-12%20Shotguns%20Tested/HatsanwiningDSA.jpg[/IMG]\n   \n   \n  Good news for all Escort Magnum Combo owners is that small barrel has been tested now with slugs and we declared it safe & very accurate to shoot slugs.', ''),

(488734, ' @Ahmad\nAgreed. That''s exactly the reason why practically all the C96''s you come across here in Pakistan have been ruined to the point of being completely useless as firearms; people continuously use the higher-powered 7.62x25mm ammo and eventually destroy the gun. The 9mm version, IMHO, would be the ideal version of the C96 to get (the best of those are known as the "Red 9''s" because they have a large 9 numeral stamped on the grip); even though this particular version was very popular and manufactured by the thousands, unfortunately almost none have made it to our country. A very close relative of mine has a C96 but hasn''t shot it in almost 30 years simply because the right ammo isn''t available and he isn''t willing to ruin a perfectly good gun using the wrong kind of rounds.', ''),

Start recording on laptop placing it midway between gun and target (away from line of fire), and fire the gun.

Works better if there is minimal background noise, like wind etc. Read software manual before trying for quick and accurate results. It is quite simple in fact.

Though I hate to say it (having been firmly on the .38 Special side of the numberless ".38 vs. 9mm" wars of yesteryear) the 9mm''s easy availability and cost advantage would probably lead me to choose the 9mm over the .38, given two otherwise identical pistols.\n\n(yes, "pistols".

Unless you can do your own leather work you''ll be limited to what''s available to buy, and some holsters are downright miserable to live with on a daily basis.  Nowadays most concealed holsters seem to be designed for small-frame automatics.\r\n\r\n When you find a holster type you like (position of the gun) you can determine if a revolver or an automatic fits the space best.  A lot will depend on your body weight and the type of clothing you usually wear.  \r\n\r\n If it is a hassle to carry the gun, you''ll start leaving it at home.  And then you''ve wasted your money.\r\n\r\n Whatever kind of gun you buy first, chances are you''ll decide you want something different in a year or two.  You can research things until your brain aches now, but after a year you''ll *know* what you want.  Don''t overthink your first purchase.', ''),

(489036, ' At that time - 25 years ago - the commonly available cartridges were .38 Special with round nose lead bullets and 9mm Parabellum (9x19) with pointier full metal jacket bullets.  Other loads were very rare.\n\n For police or self-defense work, the .38''s bullet provided adequate stopping power with less risk of overpenetration; unlike a military or target environment, you have to be extremely careful of what/who is behind who you''re shooting at.  Taking out a bad guy is great, but not taking out someone''s grandmother who happened to be standing behind him.\n\n Nowadays there are many more options for 9mm ammunition, particularly hollowpoints, that will outperform the .38 in such situations. \n\n As for your .357... a loud report and big flash aren''t necessarily bad things in a defensive weapon.

I like the grip angle of the gun better then Cz999, The lower bore axis gives lesser recoil. So rapid shooting is easier and more accurate. It has more fire power then Cz999(18 rounds vs 15 i guess). Its lighter due to its polymer frame and is more concealable. Oh and the trigger of the Caracal is much much better. The only advantage that Cz999 has over Caracal is the in the reliability and accuracy department. I''m not saying that Caracal isn''t accurate, but Cz999 might be more.

I like the grip angle of the gun better then Cz999, The lower bore axis gives lesser recoil. So rapid shooting is easier and more accurate. It has more fire power then Cz999(18 rounds vs 15 i guess). Its lighter due to its polymer frame and is more concealable. Oh and the trigger of the Caracal is much much better. The only advantage that Cz999 has over Caracal is the in the reliability and accuracy department. I''m not saying that Caracal isn''t accurate, but Cz999 might be more.

It is heavy, similar weight category of Diana 54, lighter than the diana 56th by almost a kg. It has got quite a recoil. And with proper technique it shoots accurately.', ''),
(489224, ' Shahroze brother, as far as I have understood, It records the sound. In the sond recording, there is one spike when gun fires, and then within milliseconds, there is another spike when pellet hits the target. This software plays with this time interval, taken by pellet to cover a measured distance. For high powered guns, I think this distance should be minimum 20 yards, ie 60 feet. It does not matter how loud a gun is. That noise is just taken as start of the time interval. Interesting to experiment.', ''),
(489225, ' No sir I beg to differ, these days an average PCP comfortably delivers 30-35 fpe whereas the 56TH gives 22-23 fpe at best. PCPs mostly are multi-shot as opposed to single shot break barrels so you can kiss all the cocking and feeding pellets goodbye. And then the 56th or 54 airking reduce/eliminate the [B]felt recoil [/B] but the recoil is still there which isnt an issue with PCPs so scope and mount selection becomes easy.', ''),

(489228, ' You can also calculate pellet velocity from CHAIRGUN PRO. Zero your gun at 15 feet, so that it hits center at 15 yards. Now shoot at a paper target 50 yards away, after a few shots , measure the pellet drop (or rise). Then open chairgun pro and select pellet type and calibre you used. Then enter all data including scope height as required, enter zero range as 15 yards. then varying the velocity build the graph with same point of impact at 50 yards as your gun has shown. this will be your pellet velocity (muzzle velocity). Any body who has some experience of using chairgun pro can easily do that.', ''),

(489338, ' Thank you for the replies.\n\nGasoline is NOT a cleaning option for me.  I know people who have been severely burned using gas as a cleaning solvent when something unexpected went wrong and started a fire.  I have made my living fixing cars for nearly forty years and have too much respect for the danger in gasoline to even consider it.\n\nAfter removing the plastic grips and detail stripping the pistol I used mineral spirits to clean the cosmoline, soaking the hammer assembly as a unit and working into the corners with an old toothbrush.  There was a single rust spot on the slide that cleaned up nicely with 0000 steel wool and oil.  After blowing out everything with air and letting it dry overnight, I followed up with a generous oiling.  The M57 turned out better than I expected.  It took me a long time to get the firing pin and retainer plate back in, but I finally did it by standing the slide up vertically and using the retainer plate to push the firing pin assembly down into place.  I probably spent an hour and a half looking for the firing pin washer after everything went flying in one of my early attempts at reassembly, but "all''s well that ends well".\n\nAnyway I hope it ends well.  I have not yet fired the M57 because it took about a week to find some 7.62x25mm Tokarev ammunition locally.  I will report back after shooting the pistol and try to post some pictures of my new ''friend''.  It feels real good in the hand and the bottleneck cartridges look like they should have some real pop.\n\nThank you all again for the help.

(489637, 'Understanding Calibers and Gauges There are many myths, misconceptions, and legends about various guns and ammunition, and it seems like everyone who knows anything about firearms considers themselves an expert. The language of firearms has evolved with few rules, and as a result there is a lot of confusion. This won’t solve everything, but here are some things I’ve learned, when I was looking up other things.\r\n\r\nTip 1: Caliber vs. Gauge.\r\n\r\nGauge is a measure of the inside diameter of a shotgun barrel, while caliber generally refers to the diameter of rifle and handgun bullets. However, a .410 is the caliber of a small shotgun, which is never called a 67½-gauge. Gauge was developed hundreds of years ago, before accurate devices allowed for precise measurement.\r\n\r\n\r\nTip 2: Caliber.\r\n\r\nCaliber refers to the diameter of a bullet, and can be expressed in either metric (7mm) or English (.284) measurements, depending on where it was developed (Europe or the U.S.), or the whims of the marketing department of the company that first designed the bullet.\r\n\r\nTip 3: Numbers Aren’t Always Exact.\r\n\r\nThe .38 Special and .357 Magnum are both 38-caliber, but the bullet is actually 357-thousandths of an inch in diameter. The .30-30, .30-06, .300 Winchester Magnum, and .308 are all different, non-interchangeable rounds that are all 30-caliber. However, 30-caliber bullets are .308-inches in diameter. I once saw a customer go ballistic (pun intended) because he wanted to handload his .30-30, and the clerk gave him bullets that were .308-inch in size. The clerk was right.\r\n\r\nTip 4: Those Other Numbers.\r\n\r\nSo if a .30-30 and a .30-06 are both 30-caliber rounds, that are .308-inch in diameter, why do they have those extra numbers? In the case of the .30-30, it meant that there was originally 30-grains of smokeless powder inside the case. However, for the .30-06, the -06 has nothing to do with powder—that was the year, 1906, that the round was adopted by the U.S. Army. There are other cartridges, such as the .30-378 Weatherby Magnum that is 30-caliber (.308), but it used a necked-down .378 case. And then there are rounds like the 7.62×39 and the 7.62×51, where the 39 and 51 refer to the length of the case.\r\n\r\nTip 5: Never Assume.\r\n\r\nA .22 LR (long rifle) is much different from a .220 Swift, a .22-250, or a .22 Hornet. A .300 Winchester Magnum will not work in a .300 Weatherby Magnum, and you can’t buy a spacer to make a .300 Super Short Magnum work in a .300 Short Magnum. I was once ridiculed by a friend when I wanted to buy a .44 Magnum rifle, because everyone knew that the .44 Magnum was a handgun cartridge. The joke was on him, as there are a number of rifles chambered to shoot handgun rounds, and a few handguns that shoot some rifle cartridges.\r\n\r\nTip 6: Other Language Problems.\r\n\r\nLanguage is constantly changing, and the rules can change as popular usage changes. It drives me nuts when a gun’s magazine is called a “clip.” However, I often use the word “bullet” to indicate an individual round or cartridge, even though the bullet is actually just one component of that cartridge.\r\n\r\nTip 7: Why So Many?\r\n\r\nLooking through a reloading manual, I found bullets with actual diameters of .257, .264 (6.5mm), .277, and .284 (7mm). Do we really need bullets in so many diameters that are so similar? Well, I don’t need them, but someone does. Bullet diameter is only one variable in the performance of a particular round. The case size and shape, as well as the kind of powder and primer, all have an effect on the downrange performance. To each his own.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nby Whitetails Unlimited on October 10, 2011', ''),

When I saw that CZ has a great potential for modifications then I decided to go for all the CZ Line of guns, meaning Sports/Competition, CC and HD.\r\n\r\nI have acquired CZ&#8217;s Custom and Factory Parts to begin with my modifications. I had plans for different handguns and the first thing I was interested in was to convert my CZ 75 SP-01 Shadow in to Single Action.  Alhamdulillah its been done and quite a few other modifications have been performed on my CZs as well. Couple of days ago I called Moeen Bhai and discussed with him about these mods and we decided to start without any delay. I went to Moeen Bhai&#8217;s home and we started the work and managed to perform the listed modifications. We went on the work for 5 hours, during which we managed quite a work. Next day Moeen Bhai visited my home and we managed to do most of the modifications. There are few more left which will Inshahallah be completed in coming days. I really appreciate the assistance and the hardwork by Moeen Bhai who knows Guns quite well. A Big Hand of Applause for him. \r\n \r\nWe are looking forward to our Range Sessions and will be updating with the Range results as soon as we are done having Range fun.

(489782, ' [QUOTE=Denovo87;326859]We were planning to condust a test + friendly match between different security/zombie slaying shotguns since DSA ZARS was developed, tested and reviewed at Pakguns. So it finally happened on Sunday 9-12-12 after weeks n weeks of deliberation. \n  It was beautiful sunny day at Sialkot range with the company of dearest friends AK47 & 12Gauge making it more beautiful. \n  Had 3 different shotguns to select one from to pit against DSA ZARS ( detailed review can be read here;  [URL]http://www.pakguns.com/showthread.php?10081-Review-DSA-Zombie-Apocalypse-Response-Shotgun-P-A[/URL] );\n   \n  1) Mossberg Rolling Thunder - (PA owned by AK47)\n  2) Mossberg 835 Ultimag - (PA owned by Denovo87)\n  3) Hatsan Escort Magnum - (SA owned by Denovo87)\n   \n  Main objective was to gauge consistent accuracy of DSA vs other similar shotguns; so decided first to do it at 50 meters using Pakguns special slugs. But after 1st round of 3 shots each from DSA and Mossberg 835 it was decided to pull the Mossberg 835 off from competition having rifled barrel (Mossberg Rolling Thunder was already out having only pistol).  So we left with only one shotgun to through in the match against DSA that was Hatsan Escort.\n  Also was decided to reduce shooting range to 25meters.\n   \n  It also was agreed (between me and 12Gauge bro) that none of us will give any comment on which among DSA n Hatsan proved more accurate; we will let viewers decide after seeing targets. By the way there wasn''t any sort of stoppage or malfunction experienced in any of the shotguns used that day.\n   \n   \n  Below are the photos of range, shooter n equipment;\n   \n  AK47 & Denovo87 posing before starting smoking shotguns:\n   \n  [IMG]http://i577.photobucket.com/albums/ss220/denovo87/Range n Targets/9-12-12 Shotguns Tested/AKnDenovo.jpg[/IMG]\n   \n  AK47:\n   \n  [IMG]http://i577.photobucket.com/albums/ss220/denovo87/Range n Targets/9-12-12 Shotguns Tested/AKposing.jpg[/IMG]\n   \n  1-2-3...GO: \n   \n  [IMG]http://i577.photobucket.com/albums/ss220/denovo87/Range n Targets/9-12-12 Shotguns Tested/GettingreadyforAction.jpg[/IMG]\n   \n   \n  [IMG]http://i577.photobucket.com/albums/ss220/denovo87/Range n Targets/9-12-12 Shotguns Tested/MossbergSmokingslug.jpg[/IMG]\n   \n  Now lets targets do the talking:\n   \n  Target shot with Mossberg 835:\n  [IMG]http://i577.photobucket.com/albums/ss220/denovo87/Range n Targets/9-12-12 Shotguns Tested/Mossbergnslugs.jpg[/IMG]\n   \n   \n  Target shot with DSA ZARS and Hatsan Escort Magnum:\n   \n  [IMG]http://i577.photobucket.com/albums/ss220/denovo87/Range n Targets/9-12-12 Shotguns Tested/DSAvsHatsan.jpg[/IMG]\n   \n   \n  And here a non-ending argument starts as always ;)\n\n   \n  [IMG]http://i577.photobucket.com/albums/ss220/denovo87/Range n Targets/9-12-12 Shotguns Tested/HatsanwiningDSA.jpg[/IMG]\n   \n   \n  Good news for all Escort Magnum Combo owners is that small barrel has been tested now with slugs and we declared it safe & very accurate to shoot slugs.[/QUOTE]\n\nNice shooting Sir G "sanoo vee sollah maar landay" that was the best chance to check my Winchester defender 1300 with slugs.', ''),

(489791, ' [B]Method to Convert Caliber into Millimeters[/B]\n\n[B]Intro:[/B] Caliber, or diameter of the bullet is measured in inches, or millimeters. When I say bullet, I mean the actual projectile that leaves then gun and strikes the target. The bullets of most American and English cartridges are measured in inches: .22 caliber (.224"), .25 caliber (.257"), .30 caliber (.308") etc., etc.\n\nMost European calibers are metric: 7mm (.284"), 8mm (.323"), 9mm (.355")\n\nCartridge names (like 30-06, .45-70, etc.) are a whole different matter altogether.\n \n\n[LIST]\n[*]Caliber is the measurement of the diameter of the bore/muzzle of a gun described in either milometers (mm) or inches.\n[/LIST]\n \n\n[LIST]\n[*]The caliber of a cartridge refers to the approximate diameter of the projectile, whether expressed as inches or millimeters. The cartridge manufacturer designates the caliber based on the weapon it''s designed for, to distinguish it from other cartridges of similar size. In the North American system, a bullet''s caliber is expressed in inches. A .357-caliber bullet is roughly 357 hundredths of an inch in diameter. The European system designates the bullet''s diameter in millimeters. Converting from the American system to the European method of measuring a bullet doesn''t yield the exact measurement in millimeters, but it offers a close comparison.\n[/LIST]\n \n[B][U]1 [/U][/B]\nPlace a decimal point in front of the bullet''s caliber if it''s written without one. A 32-caliber bullet is roughly .32 inches in diameter.\n[B][U]2 [/U][/B]\nUse the decimal designation of the bullet in inches and ignore any numbers that follow it. For instance, a .30-06 and a .30-03 should both be considered .30 inches in diameter.\n[B][U]3 [/U][/B]\nDisregard words and abbreviations that follow the decimal size. Consider a .38 ACP and a .38 Special to both be .38 inches.\n[B][U]4 [/U][/B]\nMultiply the diameter in inches by 25.4---the number of millimeters in an inch---to convert the size to millimeters. For example, .30 inches x 25.4 mm/inch = 7.62 mm.\n[B][U]5 [/U][/B]\nKeep in mind that the size comparison is only approximate because the caliber is based on factors other than size. For instance, a .380-caliber actually measures .355 inches and a .38-caliber measures .357 inches. Both calibers convert to 9.65 mm, but neither is accurate.', ''),
(489792, ' And those who could not get after reading previous post... they can enjoy this\n\n[B][U]Formula:-[/U][/B]\nCaliber is inches in standard English/American measurement systems. 1.00 calibers equals one inch.\n \nexample:- If you have 9mm and you want to know whether its powerful from Tokarev .30 or less than simply do \n 9mm/25.4 = 0.35 means its .35 caliber\nIf you have a box of bullets just written on it  7.62*25 and you have two pistols .30 Tokarev and 9mm Pistol and you&#8217;re just a newbie don&#8217;t know what to do so by putting bullets in each you can simply do \n7.62 just leave the other part after * which is 25 its actually the overall length of the bullet including case so just leave that and take \n7.62/25.4= 0.3 so you get the point that its .30 caliber bullet so just put inside and bang.\nHope you get the point!\n \n  \nNote: - One inch equals 25.4 millimeters.', ''),

However, he said that various forge and foundries are  beginning to meet the demand including specialised steels for the  barrels and the required ones for springs.\n The officials attribute the improvements in standards to the higher price the users are beginning to pay to the smelters.\n &#8220;This is mainly because the sports, hunting and personal weapons  makers are getting significant orders from abroad, which also brings  better profit margins,&#8221; said Shahnawaz Burney, CEO Pakistan Hunting  & Sporting Arms Development Company (PHSADC) and the organisers of  TOSS.\n &#8220;The western countries, which have a strong tradition of gun making  and cutlery industry, are getting away from the labour intensive jobs  leaving space for country like Pakistan. Luckily, we have a strong base  for gun making &#8211; hardly matched in any developing country of the world &#8211;  besides the daggers and knife makers of Wazirabad have excellent  expertise in the field,&#8221; Burney said.\n He went to add that the important issue that needs serious attention  is the conversion of majority of these cottage and informal sector into a  standardised industry.\n Many internationally recognised brands, including Beretta 9mm and TT  pistol, have stopped making certain models of arms including pistols and  have lifted the patents restrictions too. This in turn has helped the  Pakistani manufactures to market these well known varieties in Europe  and the US as well as earning a local fan base of these cloned guns.\n Recently, the Peshawar Arms Company has received a huge order to  produce parts of 30 bore pistol, as a result the company has started to  modernise its manufacturing units to meet the international standards.\n The authorities expect that within 12-14 months the local  manufacturers would be able to reach the barrel making capacity of  international standards, due to increase in business flow.\n &#8220;Soon the production of barrels to match the international standards  starts &#8211; we are going to ask the government to include the local  manufacturers in the bidding process for the purchase of weapons  including 9 mm pistols for various agencies including\nthe FIA, police and other security forces,&#8221; Burney said.', ''),

I am sure I could do lot better with Caracal QS if it was not my first time doing this drill (raising gun on caution from rest position to shoot all 5 in less than 5 seconds on target from 15 meters).\n\nI then tried Sig Tac. Ops. with conventional three dot sights to replicate same but it was very hard to recover from first shot & align sights to be on target in rapid mode; putting 5 shots with Sig not only took more time than QS (even 1st shot was released after 12G bro shouted to remind me that I was supposed to be doing rapid shooting ;) ) but only 4 shots hit the target and 5th went astray.\n\n\nBelow is the target I shot with both hand guns, Caracal in red & Sig in green:\n\n[/QUOTE]\n\n@[URL="http://www.pakguns.com/member.php?116-Denovo87"][B]Denovo87[/B][/URL] sir from where i can get the PG targets? or any other target for handgun target shooting?', ''),

(490283, ' AOA All,\nafter thinking a lot about the SAWED OFF Shotguns and specially inspired by the movies I was able to finish my SAWED OFF yesterday.  I cut the barrel by 14inch and wood stock to make pistol like grip and finished in chrome plating.  It really looks cute as soon I reassembled all parts together.\n \nTill to date i am still reading pros and cons of a SAWED OFF and getting opinions from the experts but the problem is every one has his own experience.  Most people says that SAWED OFF is a wrist breaker, have very high recoils, difficult to aim and some people says that with this short length of barrel 14” there will be less recoils but aiming is still difficult, less shot impact and lot more BLA BLA BLA stuff, but most of them actually didn’t fired or tested SAWED OFF.\n \nBeside all factor I really want to test and want to see the results but the major problem I am facing is testing itself. The place where I live doesn’t have any firing range and I really don’t want to try at home or to frighten my neighbors but I have to test this thing. I want to try different loads for example no 4 shot, no 6 shot, no 8 shot, LG/SG, Slugs etc to see the results of impacts, sounds and flashes at muzzle.\n \nAs soon as I have some results I will definitely will post on the forum.', ''),

(490408, 'Great Gun [QUOTE=Birdshooter007;215852]AOA.\nI was going to get a RWS 34 classic (price was 32k) but when I went to the shop, Badruddin and Son in Rawalpindi, I saw this sheer beauty and bought it without a second thought. It was very reasonably priced at just Rs 40k and I didn''t hesitate in getting this beauty.\n\nThe gun is very balanced, and although it''s weight is 8lbs as compared to the normal rws350 magnum''s weight of 8.20lbs, it feels very much lighter than the latter. The gun is very well balanced and feels like half the weight of the normal 350magnum.M.A I got a good piece and the recoil is almost half than that of the 350 magnum I had and it''s much more accurate due to this fact. Although I have just shot 3 pellets through it, really amused by this slim and fun-to-use airgun. It''s stock does not have a raised cheek-piece and that is what I like the most about it. With the other 350mag, I couldn''t aim properly as the stock would hit my jaws due to raised cheeck-piece and high recoil. It''s very comfortable to use and what I liked the MOST are the well-made fiber optic''s which simply outshine the normal 350 mag''s useless, cheap iron sights, and not to miss the TO-6 trigger.\nAt that shop, they had Gamo Shadow 1000 for Rs 21k, Gamo Whisper for 22.5k, rws 34 classic for 32k, rws 34 premium for 37, rws 34 professional for 35k, got mine the 350 Feuerkraft for 40k and they had the 460 magnum for 45k.....ALL NIB.\nHere are the pics:\n[IMG]http://i1203.photobucket.com/albums/bb399/B77W/rws350classic016.jpg[/IMG]\n[IMG]http://i1203.photobucket.com/albums/bb399/B77W/rws350classic017.jpg[/IMG]\n[IMG]http://i1203.photobucket.com/albums/bb399/B77W/rws350classic019.jpg[/IMG]\n[IMG]http://i1203.photobucket.com/albums/bb399/B77W/rws350classic018.jpg[/IMG]\n[IMG]http://i1203.photobucket.com/albums/bb399/B77W/rws350classic020.jpg[/IMG]\n[IMG]http://i1203.photobucket.com/albums/bb399/B77W/rws350classic021.jpg[/IMG]\n[IMG]http://i1203.photobucket.com/albums/bb399/B77W/rws350classic023.jpg[/IMG]\n[IMG]http://i1203.photobucket.com/albums/bb399/B77W/rws350classic022.jpg[/IMG]\n[IMG]http://i1203.photobucket.com/albums/bb399/B77W/rws350classic025.jpg[/IMG]\nthis pattern is just oiling\n[IMG]http://i1203.photobucket.com/albums/bb399/B77W/rws350classic024.jpg[/IMG][/QUOTE]\n\nYo[COLOR=#3E3E3E]u have to b[/COLOR][COLOR=#3E3E3E]uy a heavy scope like Dia[/COLOR][COLOR=#3E3E3E]na 4-16X42 AO[/COLOR]', ''),

(490582, 'Gun storage Dear All,\n\nI am new to the PG forums. I knew about PG during a random search on the interned. I could see that this forum is active since a couple of years. Now I regret why I couldn''t find about it earlier. People here are very knowledgeable and sincere to their hobby. I could have get lot of useful information and saved myself from a lot of hassle as well that too just reading through the posts.\n\nI want to ask a question regarding which I couldnt find much information in the forum posts. But forgive me if my querry has been already replied somewhere since I couldn''t go through everything.\n\nI have a Browning fusion evolve semi auto shotgun. Due to my other commitments I cant use this often and it is kept stored in its original box most of the time. For storing in the original box the gun has to be dismantled and the barrel separted from the receiver. The owners manual recommends to remove the barrel while the bolt is in locked position rearward. After removing the barrel, I slowly release the bolt in order to avoid its hitting forward since barrel is removed. But this keeps the hammer in cocked position. I am afraid of releasing the hammer in this position by just pulling the trigger and damaging something. The owners manual mentions nothing about the position in which hammer should be while the gun is stored in this way. In my case the hammer always remained cocked. It would have been easier had the gun stored in assembled position since in that case I could use an empty shell or a snap cap and pull the trigger to release the hammer.\n\nCan anybody help me in this regard. Since my gun is most of the time not used and I dont want to ruin it without ever getting a chance to use it whenever I have enough time.\n\nThanks in advance for the help from all experienced seniors,', ''),

(490722, 'Improving the Looks of Your Baikal O/U Shotgun When you buy a Baikal shotgun, you know that the furniture of the gun isn''t going to be as good as many other budget guns like Hatson and certainly not as good as high-end shotguns like Maroochi, Beretta, Winchester etc. But the beauty of budget gun is that you can always fiddle with it or upgrade it. In my shotgun i didn''t like the finish of the stock and forend and the finish of the receiver, which was brushed. So i decided to change it by polishing the receiver and refinishing the stock with Birchwoodcasey''s Tru-oil. Honestly i got the idea while watching youtube. Luckily the Tru-oil was available in the market when i was in Lahore. Got to work as soon as i came back. When i started working on it i found out that it''s lengthy process and requires lot of patience and dedication. It took me almost 10 days to get it done. Here is the video that i followed and the instructions can also be found on the Birchwood casey''s website. There are many useful videos on youtube for this process and everybody has there own way of doing it. I liked the finish of this guy so decided to follow it. \n[url]http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOhnr9AENLU[/url]\nThe birchwoodcasey guys did things little differently. Which could be found here\n[url]http://sport.birchwoodcasey.com/files/Literature/BC%20Refinishing%20Guide.pdf[/url]\n\nFirst thing to do is to separate the receiver from the stock. So you got to remove the recoil pad. Then the trigger guard and then remove the big screw in the butt stock. Then comes the hard part of removing the receiver from the stock. As i''m a new to this kind of stuff and we have the shotgun guru here, so i kept in-touch with 12guage bro every step of the way. Continuously calling him and discussing what to do next over the phone. So thanks 12Guage bro for helping me out and taking time to guide me through the process. So first step is to disassemble the stock completely. \n[IMG]http://i1113.photobucket.com/albums/k512/bilal_qureshi1/IMAG0382_zps58d6e426.jpg[/IMG]\n\nThen you separate the receiver from the stock :frusty:\n[IMG]http://i1113.photobucket.com/albums/k512/bilal_qureshi1/IMAG0386_zps9d8adc9c.jpg[/IMG]\n\nNext step is to remove the original finish of the stock of your gun. I didn''t do this step and now wondering if i had done it, it would have looked even better. If you do want to remove it then follow the steps in the video or in the link above with appropriate sand paper. Next you stain the wood to your liking. I liked the way mine looked so i skipped this step too and went straight for true oiling step. Then i sanded my stock with the 320 grit sand paper and applied thin layer of Tru-oil to the whole stock. The pros recommend to let it dry for 15-20 min, but i would recommend to let it dry for an hour atleast. Then apply another thin coat of Tru-oil and let it dry for overnight. Remember to apply thin layers as thicker layers are hard to sand and there will be lots unwanted build-up and runs. Next step is to Wet sand the whole stock with the appropriate sand paper. I used 1000 grid sand paper recommended by our Guru 12Guage. This is the most important step in this process. The more you wet sand the stock the better its gonna turn out. After you have wet-sanded the stock allow it to dry for overnight. It''s gonna look something like this. \n[IMG]http://i1113.photobucket.com/albums/k512/bilal_qureshi1/IMAG0389_zps6d626608.jpg[/IMG]\n\nBe sure to mask the stapling of the gun with the masking tape or paper tape. Once the stock is dry check for rough spots, runs or streaks and knock them down with wet sand paper again. Apply little bit of Tru-Oil in the dry spots and after drying for 15-20 min wet sand it again. I applied 5 coats of Tru-Oil and then wet-sanded the whole thing. Yeah! not easy. Between each coat of Tru-Oil and wet sanding, i allowed it to dry for 24-48 hours depending how quickly it dries. Here is how i dried my stock and how it looked after these coats. \n[IMG]http://i1113.photobucket.com/albums/k512/bilal_qureshi1/IMAG0399_zps93f38f5d.jpg[/IMG]\n[IMG]http://i1113.photobucket.com/albums/k512/bilal_qureshi1/IMAG0400_zps0c408352.jpg[/IMG]', ''),

Then i applied the last coat of tru-oil and it turned into rich glossy finish or as Mr Boyds says Satin finish. If you want a high Sheen finish then there are two things you can do. Either get Birchwoodcasey''s Tru-oil in aerosol spray or polish the final coat with the Birchwoodcasey''s ''Stock and Sheen conditioner''. But it liked the glossy or Satin finish. So i just polished it with Turtle wax car polish. Which removed any remaining rough spots and imperfections in the finish and made it bit less shiny. After finishing the stock i polished the receiver with the SONAX Aluminum and Chrome polish paste and polished it again and again until my arm couldn''t go anymore to give the brushed Stainless steel finished receiver and chrome look. \n[IMG]http://i1113.photobucket.com/albums/k512/bilal_qureshi1/IMAG0390_zpsecf2bfe4.jpg[/IMG]\n[IMG]http://i1113.photobucket.com/albums/k512/bilal_qureshi1/IMAG0391_zpsceb6330e.jpg[/IMG]\n[IMG]http://i1113.photobucket.com/albums/k512/bilal_qureshi1/IMAG0392_zps53bff796.jpg[/IMG]\n\nAfter alot of rubbing and agony the final polished receiver looked sweet. \n[IMG]http://i1113.photobucket.com/albums/k512/bilal_qureshi1/IMAG0393_zpsc05d1700.jpg[/IMG]', ''),

(490745, ' [B]Four Safety Rules of Firing a Handgun:\n\n[/B]\nThe very first thing is the four rules of firing a hand gun, if followed strictly, will keep you and others safe.\n\n1. Always treat every firearm as if it were loaded. No ifs, ands, or buts. Even if you know the gun is unloaded.\n\n2. Always keep the firearm pointed in a safe direction, a direction where a negligent discharge would cause minimum damage and zero physical injury. \n\n3. Always keep your trigger finger off the trigger and outside the trigger guard until you have made a conscious decision to shoot.\n\n4. Always be sure of your target. You want to be aware of what&#8217;s in your line of fire. \n\n[B]Grip\n[/B]\nThe Two-handed grip is a must! Sorry but gangsta style won''t do you any good!\n\n1. The gun hand (your dominant hand) should grip the gun high on the back strap .  This gives you more leverage against the weapon which will help you control recoil when you fire the gun.\n\n2. Place your support hand (your non-dominant hand) so that it is pressed firmly against the exposed portion of the grip not covered by the gun hand. All four fingers of your support hand should be under the trigger guard with the index finger pressed hard underneath it. \nYou should place your support hand as high as possible on the grip with the thumb pointing forward, roughly below where the slide meets the frame. \n\n[B]Stance\n[/B]\nStand with your feet and hips shoulder width apart. Take your reaction leg and put it slightly forward not extremely forward so that there is no wasted movement. Avoid hyper-extension. It allows you to fire the weapon with stability and mobility. Raise the weapon toward your target. \n[B]\nSight Alignment and Sight Picture[/B]\n\nUse your dominant eye. \n\nAlign your sights.  Aim at your target and align the top of the front sight so that it lines up with the top of the rear sight. There should also be equal amounts of empty space on both sides of the front sight.\n\nSet your sight picture. The sight picture is the pattern of your gun&#8217;s sights in relation to your target. When you&#8217;re aiming a gun, you&#8217;re looking at three objects: the front sight, the rear sight, and your target. However, it&#8217;s not possible to focus simultaneously on all three objects. One of the objects will inevitably be blurry when you&#8217;re aiming. When you have a correct sight picture, your front and rear sight appears sharp and clear and your target appears to be a bit blurry.\n \nRemember that further away your target is, the greater the need for a clear focus on the front sight.\n\n[B]Trigger Management\n[/B]\nMost missed shots are trigger related so trigger control is extremely important.\n\nTo fire a gun properly, you don&#8217;t actually want to pull the trigger, but rather press it in a controlled fashion so you don&#8217;t disrupt your sights. \nThings to remember:\n\n1. Press, don&#8217;t pull. Instead of pulling the trigger, press the trigger straight to the rear. Apply constant, increasing reward pressure on the trigger until the weapon fires. Ensure that you&#8217;re only applying pressure to the front of the trigger and not the sides.\n\n2. Take the slack out of the trigger. Squeeze the trigger to the point you start feeling resistance.\n\n3. Surprise yourself. Keep pressing the trigger straight to the rear until the gun fires. Don&#8217;t anticipate when the gun will fire. You sort of want to surprise yourself as to when the gun actually discharges. \n\n[B]Breath Control\n[/B]\nTry to break the shot on your natural respiratory pause.

It''s my favorite citrus, though a bit to the sourer side.\n\nI really don''t want to entrust the befooling roadside nurseries around with this investment, since this may involve hundreds of trees and these people just make you nurture, caress plants for years which later on turn out to be fakes and all hard work, efforts go down the drain. \n\nTherefore requiring some sincere suggestions on the best type of sweet orange trees/red blood to have planted and guidelines on from where to purchase these in Punjab with a guarantee stamp, that it''s genuine stuff and no "clone work".\n \nBest would be if some helpful fellows here could assist the acquisition personally or at least arrange it through very personal friends, so that I can get the right stuff in. And rest assured, there''ll be a van full sent directly to the door every year, God willing!\n\nKindly provide info also on how many trees to plant on 3-4 acres of land, as I''ve guesstimated it to be in the proximity of 5-7 hundreds, can''t say, got no prior experience.\n\nInputs would be highly appreciated since plantation season is around in a couple of months and I may do a Punjab visit soon.

(490791, ' [QUOTE=ninefourtwo;328874][B]Four Safety Rules of Firing a Handgun:\r\n\r\n[/B]\r\nThe very first thing is the four rules of firing a hand gun, if followed strictly, will keep you and others safe.\r\n\r\n1. Always treat every firearm as if it were loaded. No ifs, ands, or buts. Even if you know the gun is unloaded.\r\n\r\n2. Always keep the firearm pointed in a safe direction, a direction where a negligent discharge would cause minimum damage and zero physical injury. \r\n\r\n3. Always keep your trigger finger off the trigger and outside the trigger guard until you have made a conscious decision to shoot.\r\n\r\n4. Always be sure of your target. You want to be aware of what’s in your line of fire. \r\n\r\n[B]Grip\r\n[/B]\r\nThe Two-handed grip is a must! Sorry but gangsta style won''t do you any good!\r\n\r\n1. The gun hand (your dominant hand) should grip the gun high on the back strap .  This gives you more leverage against the weapon which will help you control recoil when you fire the gun.\r\n\r\n2. Place your support hand (your non-dominant hand) so that it is pressed firmly against the exposed portion of the grip not covered by the gun hand. All four fingers of your support hand should be under the trigger guard with the index finger pressed hard underneath it. \r\nYou should place your support hand as high as possible on the grip with the thumb pointing forward, roughly below where the slide meets the frame. \r\n\r\n[B]Stance\r\n[/B]\r\nStand with your feet and hips shoulder width apart. Take your reaction leg and put it slightly forward not extremely forward so that there is no wasted movement. Avoid hyper-extension. It allows you to fire the weapon with stability and mobility. Raise the weapon toward your target. \r\n[B]\r\nSight Alignment and Sight Picture[/B]\r\n\r\nUse your dominant eye. \r\n\r\nAlign your sights.  Aim at your target and align the top of the front sight so that it lines up with the top of the rear sight. There should also be equal amounts of empty space on both sides of the front sight.\r\n\r\nSet your sight picture. The sight picture is the pattern of your gun’s sights in relation to your target. When you’re aiming a gun, you’re looking at three objects: the front sight, the rear sight, and your target. However, it’s not possible to focus simultaneously on all three objects. One of the objects will inevitably be blurry when you’re aiming. When you have a correct sight picture, your front and rear sight appears sharp and clear and your target appears to be a bit blurry.\r\n \r\nRemember that further away your target is, the greater the need for a clear focus on the front sight.\r\n\r\n[B]Trigger Management\r\n[/B]\r\nMost missed shots are trigger related so trigger control is extremely important.\r\n\r\nTo fire a gun properly, you don’t actually want to pull the trigger, but rather press it in a controlled fashion so you don’t disrupt your sights. \r\nThings to remember:\r\n\r\n1. Press, don’t pull. Instead of pulling the trigger, press the trigger straight to the rear. Apply constant, increasing reward pressure on the trigger until the weapon fires. Ensure that you’re only applying pressure to the front of the trigger and not the sides.\r\n\r\n2. Take the slack out of the trigger. Squeeze the trigger to the point you start feeling resistance.\r\n\r\n3. Surprise yourself. Keep pressing the trigger straight to the rear until the gun fires. Don’t anticipate when the gun will fire. You sort of want to surprise yourself as to when the gun actually discharges. \r\n\r\n[B]Breath Control\r\n[/B]\r\nTry to break the shot on your natural respiratory pause. I was taught to use the B.R.A.S.S technique: \r\n[B]\r\nB[/B]reathe. [B]R[/B]elease halfway and hold. [B]A[/B]im. [B]S[/B]queeze. [B]S[/B]hoot.\r\n\r\n[B]Follow Through[/B]\r\n\r\nIt is actually the end of the cycle.  It is at this point, after you have fired a round, that the everything begins all over again. Resetting the trigger, obtain a proper sight alignment and sight picture, and then you need to begin asking yourself do I need to take another shot? and If I do, will I hit my target?\r\n\r\nContinuing to do everything that was being done at the time the shot was fired. Follow through prevents any unnecessary movement before the bullet exits the barrel.\r\n\r\nThese are the firearm safety and fundamentals explained briefly.[/QUOTE]\r\n\r\nVery well explained, will benefit to all of us brothers of the PG  family.

(490798, ' Bro I carry the TP9. You have very valid point in there not being a safety. However, the biggest safety built in is the DA trigger which is heavy enough to not result in an "accidental" squeeze. If you want to carry it chambered, then (since there is no safe action trigger like the Glock or Caracal) it better be decocked. Other than that, gun safety is derived more from the person using the gun rather than the gun itself. I''ve seen and read off people shooting themselves with guns that had safeties too. Since I dont need to these days, I''m not carrying chambered these days mostly so I''m also taking another risk out of the equation.\nGo with the gun setup YOU are comfortable with.

What most semi auto user do is that simply press the trigger and relieve the tension of the hammer spring. Hammer strikes the firing pin thats it. You are not dry firing it where the hammer strikes the firing pin multiple times in a row. Dont worry you wont damage anything.\n\nRegards.[/QUOTE]\n\nThank you very much @12GAUGE sir. I am also worried that by storing the hammer in cocked position will weaken the spring. There is also no problem in "dry firing" when the gun is assembled. But when the barrel is dis-assembled from the reciever, there is following caution in that case. [B]"If the bolt is released forward with the barrel removed, the cartridge stop will hit the front of the receiver and cause damage."

This releases the tension on the recoil spring but hammer still remains cocked. Now at this point I am worried to release the hammer by just pressing the trigger since bolt is already not at its place and is loose.

Since you are not planting it for commercial production, you may grow 2 acres of Kino and 2 acres of Mosaami. \n\nThe plant is planted at the distance of 20 feet from each other. As dimension of an acre is 200 x 220 feet, you can plant 100 plants in one acre. You will need 400 plants in total.\n\nThe best place to buy plants is from Bhalwal. There is a village just near to Bhalwal (District Sargodha, Punjab), named Chak 10 Shumali. They prepare best nursery of Citrus Fruits.

I personally think that the long, heavy pull of the DA trigger in itself is a safety against any ND''s; hence I mentioned earlier that I feel that a decocker is more practical than an external safety. When I started CC-ing, I used to do so with the safety on as well, but gradually I realized that the external safety is somewhat redundant if your first shot is going to be in DA mode.\n\nThe decocker is certainly an excellent safety measure in a DA/SA gun (like the TP-9).[/QUOTE]\n\n+1.

(490956, ' 7mm Mauser (7x57mm)\r\n\r\n    Developed as a military cartridge by Mauser and introduced in 1892, the 7mm Mauser was adopted by the Spanish government and chambered in a limited quantity of Model 92 Mauser bolt-action rifles, which were a modification of the Belgian pattern 89. In 1893, Spain adopted a new model Mauser in this same caliber. This rifle has been called the Spanish Mauser ever since, although it was also adopted by Mexico and a number of South American countries. Remington chambered their rolling block and Lee rifles for the 7mm about 1897, and later the Model 30. The Winchester Model 54 and 70 also chambered it. Currently, the Ruger Model 77 and Winchester Featherweight bolt action, plus the Ruger Number One single shot offer the 7mm as standard among American-made rifles. However, most British-and European-made bolt-action rifles and combination guns chamber the 7mm Mauser, as do many custom-made rifles each year.\r\n\r\n    Although originally a military cartridge, the 7x57mm Mauser has proven itself as one of the best all-around sporting rounds ever developed. It is particularly useful in lightweight rifles because it delivers good killing power with moderate recoil. It has been used successfully on every species of big game on earth, including elephant. However, it is no elephant cartridge in the true sense of the term and its success is due largely to the hunting conditions and ability of the hunters who have used it. Ballistically, it is only less powerful than 270 Winchester or the 280 Remington. It is adequate for most American big game, but is perhaps on the light side for Kodiak bear or moose unless used by an experienced hunter. The 7mm Mauser was discontinued in American-made rifles about 1940 due to lack of popularity. Since the end of WWII, it has become increasingly common due to the influx of surplus 7mm military rifles for several years after the war. The wide selection 7mm bullets now available for handloading has also contributed to an increase in popularity.', ''),

(490958, ' 243 Winchester\r\n\r\n    The 243 Winchester was introduced by Winchester in 1955 for their Model 70 bolt-action and Model 88 lever-action rifles. The 243 was quickly adopted by Savage for their Model99 lever- and Model 110 bolt-action rifles. All or the British and European manufacturers began chambering bolt-action rifles for this round, including BSA, FN, Sako, Husqvarna, Mannlicher-Schoenauer and others. In fact, even Remington, who developed their own 6mm, had to recognize the popularity of the 243 and start chambering their rifles for it. The 243 (6mm) Winchester is nothing more than the 308 Winchester case necked-down. Original development and publicity was due largely to the efforts of gun writer, the late Warren Page, who along with other wildcatters worked out a similar version before Winchester. The 243 is probably chambered in more different rifles than any other cartridge, except possibly the 308 Winchester.\r\n    The 243 Winchester represents a successful effort to develop a varmint-to-deer class rifle that could hold its own with the various high-velocity 22s for extremely long-range use on small targets and still be adequate for the larger animals. The 243 does this job so well that it has taken a lot of play away from the 222 Remington and all the rest of the 22 cartridges. It eliminates the need to own two different rifles for anything from small game and pests right up to and including deer, antelope or black bear. The 80-grain bullet is intended primarily for varmint and medium-sized game and the 100-grain bullet for deer -size animals. The 257 Roberts and the 250-3000 Savage are supposed to cover the same range and certainly do. However, the 25-caliber bullets don''t have quite the sectional density for long-range varmint shooting until bullet weights gets up around 120-grains, and then the velocity falls off badly. All in all, the 6mm does a better job in covering the intended range of game and shooting conditions.', ''),

(491079, ' [QUOTE=Bhatti1965;326283]hello members, \n  One question has always buggered my mind. What is the legal aspect of making a shooting range on your own property. I mean we all wish at some stage of our enthusiasm that we had more places to shoot our guns. I just want to know if there are any legal restrictions or regulation or paper work that needs to be done, or one can just go ahead get a bulldozer to make a soil hill in front of a wall, put targets in front of it and shoot away. Any help on the matter will be much appreciated. I am only talking about a personal range nothing open on a commercial level for everyone. A range built on ones own property in a rural area which is not a business but just a private range. If anyone can give me any help in that regard will be much appreciated.[/QUOTE]\n\nI think, 500 meters from main roads and populated area is the restriction. Secondly, no harassment to a nearby resident. No aerial firing. It would be good to inform local police station about the activity.', ''),

(491257, 'Shotgun Gauge Thank You for the very informative post. I have a little more information on Gauge.\n\nThe Gauge is a measurement used to express the inside diameter of a shotgun barrel. Gauge is determined from the [U]weight[/U] of a solid sphere of lead that will fit the bore of the shotgun, and is expressed as the number of such spheres that it takes to weigh one pound. Thus it takes 12 lead spheres the size of a 12 gauge shotgun bore to weigh one pound, or another way to say it is that a [SUP][SIZE=2]1[/SIZE][/SUP]&#8260;[SUB][SIZE=2]12[/SIZE][/SUB]th pound ball fits a 12 gauge bore. It follows that there are ten 10 gauge or twenty 20 gauge balls per pound. \n\nThe term is related to the measurement of cannon, which were also measured by the weight of their iron round shot. An 8 pounder would fire an 8 lb (3.6 kg) spherical cast iron ball (with a bore diameter of about 91 mm (3.6 in).', ''),

Moreover, it is made &#8203;&#8203;in China Tokarev Tokarev many of the smuggled into Japan is said to be a "formula pistol 54", it will be only those that are the color of the iron cold, too. However, the same as I used in favor of the pistol that was shining shiny Mafia and outlaw of the United States, would not there be something that is chrome-plated nickel or even Tokarev was in the hands of the yakuza in Japan. \r\nI think Hudson was also issued a silver model of the Tokarev (made of chrome-plated ABS) in 1993, and I was not the image of a real gun like that I''m sure. Indeed, it is what really gives up the image look good on that it is a military gun. The first, was released as (¥ 16,000) specification cart dummy has led next ignition specification (¥ 14,800), and then to the present. By the way, the model presented here is a dummy specification cart, cart had with those for firing. \r\nWell, I think the model is made &#8203;&#8203;by Hudson in the past there were many that care has not been distributed to the mark of the body, in this model it is assumed that a real gun is relatively faithfully reproduced. So, the bottom three photos I tried to understand a stamped copy left frame, rear upper surface slides, right grip. In particular, it has been interesting to bend the string representation seems to be a real gun serial number of the frame, with a real gun and probably would have happened.', ''),

(491520, ' Assuming "without rule of law" means "collapse of the government", the problem likely won''t be lack of law, but rather way more law than you want, as different factions and groups jockey for power.\r\n\r\nA common scenario is for a government to fracture into two or more competing pieces or revolutionary governments.  Sometimes the army or police go their own way, as do some provinces and cities.  It''s also a time when cultural, racial, religious, or language groups become more of an issue.\r\n\r\nIt''s not unusual to have half a dozen different police, armies, and governments proclaiming themselves the One True Authority and promising retribution to anyone who doesn''t agree.  And they''re likely to all have way more men and guns than you can do anything about.\r\n\r\nWhen such "authorities" are trying to consolidate their power, "disarming the populace" is usually a high priority, to prevent other groups from inciting the populace to resistance.  Police and militia units are usually consolidated near government buildings and possibly electric or water works; this leaves a local power vacuum.\r\n\r\nIn theory a local power vacuum shouldn''t matter much.  In practice, it may attract gangs, organized criminals, or organized crazies.\r\n\r\nFor medium-term survival in such a situation, you need to be able to provide your own solution to the power vacuum.', ''),

(491438, 'restoring Walther P5 and over and under. i recently checked few posts on pak guns in which members restored old weapons which were not in good share. Well i had these two weapons which were special to me, and i believe classics as they aint common here in pakistan. the weapons were 9mm Walther P5 and V. Bernardelli Over and under 12 gauge. Both of these performance wise are excellent weapons. Now before i upload the pictures, for walther i learned from pak guns that bluing is a process in which gun metal is fixed. its a difficult process.. i believe a proper gunsmith can do it only... so yeah for a moment i was dishearten on the fact that nothing could be done. then i thought to giving the parts to polish to a proper painter and polisher, but it had the risk of destroying the cause i cant risk these. Finally i thought why not try brasso. yap... so i went on and purchased a bottle worth 340rs. on it, it was stated that it could be used on steel, chrome , brass and few other metals, Now i took and old vest and applied it smoothly on metal parts... and after i rubbed it well, blackish layer was coming off... i spent 2 hours ( yap it is tiring and u need to spend time on it) but the results were pretty good. \r\n\r\nNow my shotgun is pretty good, as i wanted it to be shinny and clean. (Just want to add from better front sights). Please advice where can i get them from pindi/islamabad.\r\n\r\nfor the pistol, little bit back ground it is give to my father by pakistan army. and he carries it regularly as he really likes it, along with Pb. The metal on gun has scratches on it.... i polished it. but u will notice it still not up to the mark. further more, i am thinking to add ruber grip, please advice where i can get that...

(491523, ' [QUOTE=TRX;329649]Assuming "without rule of law" means "collapse of the government", the problem likely won''t be lack of law, but rather way more law than you want, as different factions and groups jockey for power.\n\nA common scenario is for a government to fracture into two or more competing pieces or revolutionary governments.  Sometimes the army or police go their own way, as do some provinces and cities.  It''s also a time when cultural, racial, religious, or language groups become more of an issue.\n\nIt''s not unusual to have half a dozen different police, armies, and governments proclaiming themselves the One True Authority and promising retribution to anyone who doesn''t agree.  And they''re likely to all have way more men and guns than you can do anything about.\n\nWhen such "authorities" are trying to consolidate their power, "disarming the populace" is usually a high priority, to prevent other groups from inciting the populace to resistance.  Police and militia units are usually consolidated near government buildings and possibly electric or water works; this leaves a local power vacuum.\n\nIn theory a local power vacuum shouldn''t matter much.  In practice, it may attract gangs, organized criminals, or organized crazies.\n\nFor medium-term survival in such a situation, you need to be able to provide your own solution to the power vacuum.[/QUOTE]\n\nIn Pakistan we have  edge since clan/tribes still matter here.

(491525, '30-06 Springfield The 30-06 Springfield is a United States military cartridge adopted in 1906 for the Model 1903 Springfield service rifle, which was based on the Mauser bolt-action system. The 30-06 is actually a slightly-modified version of the original 1903 cartridge, which was loadedwitha 220-grain round-nosed bullet at a muzzle velocity of 2300 fps. Because of cartridge developments in Europe, it was considered advisable to change to a 150-grain bullet at an increased velocity of 2700 fps, and at the same time the case neck was shortened by 0.7-inch. This improved round was designated the " Ball Cartridge, caliber 30, Model of 1906" but in practice, nomenclature was shortened to 30-06. The 30-06 version can be chambered and fired in any rifle made for the original 1903 round, but the reverse is not always true because of the difference in case length. For many years both the 1903 and 1906 loadings and case configurations were loaded by sporting ammunition manufacturers. Shooting the ''06 in the ''03 chamber reportedly gave poor accuracy. Old catalogs list both rounds, and occasionally the 1903 version is called the 30-45 because the original loading used 45 grains of smokeless powder.\r\nAgain, because of military developments in Europe, the Army switched to a 172-grain bullet with a 9-degree boat-tail in 1926, the new round being designated the "Ball, caliber 30, M1." Muzzle velocity, originally the same as the 150-grain load of 2700 fps, was later reduced to 2640 because of difficulty maintaining pressure specifications at the higher velocity. In 1940, the 150-grain flat-base bullet was re-adopted as the "Cartridge Ball, caliber 30, M2". The return to the lighter bullet came about, at least in part, because of difficulties adopting the then-new Garand semi-auto rifle to handle 172-grain loading.\r\nThe rimless 30-03 and the later 30-06 replaced the older rimmed 30-40 Krag as the official U.S. military round. The 30-06 has, in its turn, been superseded by the 7.62mm M59, also known as the 7.62 NATO or, in its commercial version 308 Winchester. As a sporting cartridge, the 30-06 is one of the most popular and widely-used big game numbers ever developed.  In Europe it is known as 7.62x63mm. Every manufacturer of standard length bolt-action sporting rifles in the western world chambers the 30-06.\r\nThe Winchester Model 1895 lever-action appears to have been the first sporting rfle chambered for the new 30-03. The cartridge was added to the line of available calibers in 1904-1905, the modified 1906 round in 1908. The Remington bolt-action Model 30, introduced in 1921, and the Winchester bolt-action Model 54 brought out in 1925 both offered the 30-06, among other calibers. The savage bolt-action Model 40 and 45 Super-Sporter rifles were also chambered when introduced in 1928. At present, in addition to the many bolt-action rifles, the Remington Model Six slide action and Four semi-auto, as well as the Browning and Heckler & Koch semi-auto, include the 30-06 as standard calibers. The Ruger Number One single shot rifle is also offered in 30-06.\r\n\r\nThe 30-06 is undoubtedly the most flexible, all-round big game cartridge available to hunter. For many years it has been the standard by whch all other big game cartridges have been measured. To say that a cartridge is in the 30-06 class means it is suitable for any game in North America. The secret of success when using this cartridge is to be sure and select the right bullet for the game and hunting conditions at hand. The lighter bullets of 100 to 130 grains be used only for varmint hunting. While these bullets can be driven at impressive velocities, starting out at over 3000 fps, they  are made to expand rapidly on small animals and will not penetrate properly on large game. For deer, antelope, goat, sheep, black or brown bear, under most hunting conditions, the 150- or 165-grain bullet is proper. For heavier game such as elk, moose or the big brown bear, the 180-,200- or 220-grain bullet is the best choice. These are also considered best for woods or brush hunting, regardless of the quarry. Many experienced hunters consider the 180-grain bullet the most satisfactory all-round loading for the 30-06 because it can be used effectively on anything from deer-sized animals to the heaviest varieties under almost any hunting conditions. When hand-loaded with the 250-grain bullet, the 30-06 practically duplicates the performance of the British 318 Rimless-Nitro, popular in many parts of Africa for shooting plains game. As a matter of fact, the 30-06 will give a good account on all but the heaviest or most dangerous African or Asiatic species under average hunting conditions. The 220-grain bullet is generally recommended for African game although the 180-grain also has a good reputation there. With the proper bullet, this cartridge can be adapted to any game or hunting situation in North or South America, whether in the mountains, plains, woods or jungles.', ''),

(491538, '30-40 Krag The 30 U.S. Army, or 30-40 Krag, the first United States small-bore military cartridge, was developed in 1892. The cartridge was developed for the American-modified, Norwegian-invented, Krag-Jorgensen bolt-action rifle. The Remington-Lee Bolt-action, Remington rolling block, Winchester Model 95 lever action and high-wall single shot chmbered the 30-40 Krag. No commercial rifles used the cartridge from about 1936 to 1973. The Winchester high-wall single shot was the firdt commercial rifle in the U.S. produced for a small-bore, smokeless powder cartridge. This happened when the 30-40 Krag was added to the available calibers during 1893. The first smokeless sporting cartridge ( 30-30 ) didn''t arrive until 2 years later. From 1973 until 1977 Ruger No. 3 single shot was chambered for the 30-40 Krag, thus stimulating a renewed interest in the cartridge.\r\n\r\nThe 30-40 Krag has retained a degree of popularity because the Krag military rifles and carbine fairly widely distributed. Some very fine sporting rifles have been built up by altering and restocking the old Krag. It has one of the smoothest working actions of any bolt-action rifle ever made. Although not as powerful as the 30-06 or even the 308 Winchester, the 30-40 has nevertheless been used successfully on all species of North American big game animal. It is an accurate cartridge and easy to reload, but pressure must be kept down to the 40,000 psi level. On big game, best results are usually with the 180- or 220-grain bullet. No better deer and elk cartridge s available than the 30-40. When fired in a strong action, such as the Ruger No. 3, the performance of the 30-40 can be improved substantially.', ''),

(491703, ' [QUOTE=Leon;329747]Whenever, I used to read this review, the above highlighted comments of Respected 12GAUGE mounted me in the head that why an expert in Guns said this. Anyhow, I tried to find the answer easy way by asking the questions to 12GAUGE, but I did not receive any reply. I felt like the same as I used to feel at the start of my career, my instructor and mentor used to adopt same kind of silence which meant "Find it yourself". I am novice in Firearms, and again I was repeating the mistake by trying to find the answers easy way. [QUOTE=Leon;315241]@ 12 Gauge! Your comments regarding durability of Aluminum receiver, recoil and pattern of the gun.[/QUOTE]\r\n\r\nBro, I am truly sorry for not answering you earlier. believe me it was never my intention to give any silent treatment. I must have overlooked your question in a hurry. anyways, we are always here to learn and help each other out.\r\n\r\n[QUOTE=Leon;315241]@ 12 Gauge! Your comments regarding durability of Aluminum receiver, recoil and pattern of the gun.[/QUOTE]\r\n\r\nBro, I cant say much about aluminum''s durability as it is a pretty soft metal and highly prone to galling. what manufacturers do is that they re-enforce high wearing areas with steel and similar materials to prolong their life. so... in theory this gun should have a long useful life.\r\n\r\nrecoil again is a very subjective matter. to be honest, this gun did recoil a little on the higher side but it was not anything that wasn''t expected from a light weight shotgun. light weight shotgun do recoil more. its a necessary evil if you want a light weight and fast swinging shotgun.\r\n\r\nI am sorry I could not do a pattern test of the shotgun as there wasn''t enough time plus to be very honest, I couldn''t force the guy any longer for lending this shotgun to me for a little more time. I did fire a couple shots on the ground just to feel where pellets lands and everything felt quiet alright to me. although I admit that shooting on the ground is not the safest and surest of ways to determine pattern performance.\r\n\r\nRegards.', ''),

(491788, 'Review: Fleece Shooting Jacket [B]AoA Everybody[/B]\r\n\r\nWaterfowl hunting has always been a chilly affair for me. To some, this type of hunting means bringing a tasty game bird to dinner table but to me it has always been associated with flu, fever, body aches and severe chest infection. \r\n\r\nFor some, waterfowl hunting brings the early morning thrill, elevated adrenaline levels, heightened sense of achievement and finally the tingling of the taste buds. Unfortunately for me, after every trip, I only dreadfully looked forward to the lack of erection that follows a healthy dose of Panadol (Cold n Flu).\r\n\r\nSo, why its such a horrible experience for me? Well&#8230;. stuff that I use to protect my fragile existence against the elements is either too thin to offer any protection to begin with or it ends up being too thick, borderline impractical as far as free body movement is concerned. plus thick winter jackets also mess up your gun fit.\r\n\r\nFor me it was always the decision that commanded such a high price. The decision to go thin for a rapid gun mount and free body movement but at the cost severe repercussions or to go thick at the cost of significantly restricted body movement that always seemed to attract bad mounting like a magnet.\r\n\r\nNot anymore gentlemen as I have finally found what I was looking for in a winter shooting jacket. I wanted something warm, light weight and of reasonable thickness at the same time which doesn''t effect gun fit. I wanted something that offers enough room for free body movement, aiding in a proper gun mount. Anyways, without excessive foreplay, kindly allow me to introduce my newly acquired Winter Shooting Jacket. \r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i998.photobucket.com/albums/af103/12gauge-pakguns/Winter%20Shooting%20Jacket/Pic01.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\nIt has everything that I have been longing for in terms of a proper shooting jacket for hunting in the morning full of wintery chill.\r\n\r\nDetails:\r\n\r\nIts made out of Water Repelling Bonded Fleece which is both light weight and offers superb protection against cold by being remarkably insulating. It is also soft which everyone likes (unless you like to wear a black leather outfit and have a huge collection of shiny handcuffs). I got this piece for a mere sum of PKR3,500 from a reputable Sialkot based [URL="https://www.metasco.com/"](Metasco International)[/URL] manufacturer and exporter of Hunting and Sport Shooting apparel and accessories.\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i998.photobucket.com/albums/af103/12gauge-pakguns/Winter%20Shooting%20Jacket/Pic02.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\nEverything about this jacket speaks high quality, both in terms of materials and construction. All panels are double stitched with over-locked edges. The zipper too seems of a higher quality. I guess the manufacturer must have considered heavy yanking/pulling by frozen hands when designing this thing. The ambidextrous shooting jacket sports full length suede panels on both sides to aid a proper gun mount for both right and left handed shooters.\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i998.photobucket.com/albums/af103/12gauge-pakguns/Winter%20Shooting%20Jacket/Pic03.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\nThe bellowed front pockets are fairly wide and easily accommodate a standard box of cartridges. The top covers of the pockets can be permanently opened by using the attached Velcro patches. \r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i998.photobucket.com/albums/af103/12gauge-pakguns/Winter%20Shooting%20Jacket/Pic04.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\nThe two side pockets are also there to warm icy hands incase they feel too cold and too stiff for comfort. \r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i998.photobucket.com/albums/af103/12gauge-pakguns/Winter%20Shooting%20Jacket/Pic05.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\nAll high wearing spots have been reinforced with high strength and water proof material. I am guessing that it is some kind of parachute type stuff.\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i998.photobucket.com/albums/af103/12gauge-pakguns/Winter%20Shooting%20Jacket/Pic06.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\nThe collar closes fully to retain the body heat from getting out. the collar itself is a surprise. It has a hidden pocket in it that houses a full size parachute hood to cover one''s head, a simple and ingenious solution.\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i998.photobucket.com/albums/af103/12gauge-pakguns/Winter%20Shooting%20Jacket/Pic07.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\nBoth cuffs have Velcro straps that are used to close down the cuffs. Another useful feature if insulation and retention of body heat is a primary concern.\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i998.photobucket.com/albums/af103/12gauge-pakguns/Winter%20Shooting%20Jacket/Pic09.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\nThe back has an elastic strap/belt to give the jacket shape and to keep it close to the body. Good feature for a shooting jacket.\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i998.photobucket.com/albums/af103/12gauge-pakguns/Winter%20Shooting%20Jacket/Pic08.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\nTo me this jacket is surprisingly comfortable to wear. It is super light and I hardly notice that I am wearing something extra. On top of that it is super warm and the ease it offers in shouldering a gun serves as icing on the cake. so... from waterfowl to upland, this is now my new favorite hunting companion.\r\n\r\n[B]Regards.[/B]', ''),

According to the tradition/custom, in vogue, while estimating about the barrel of a firearm, as to how much has it been previously used, they inserted the projectile of the cartridge by holding it from the base/ primer side of the cartridge into the muzzle. A new, less or moderately used firearm''s barrel/muzzle would not let the projectile, completely sink into it.\n\nWhether less credible a criterion to gauge the barrel usage or not, I did the same to my newly acquired PT 1911, not a single cartridge shot from it yet, and to my surprise the .45 projectile fully sunk into its muzzle. \n\nI request the worthy 1911 owners in .45 and seniors to first do the same with the muzzles of their handguns, and please shed some light on the matter! Whether it happens with all 1911s in .45 or not? If yes, why?\n\n[B]Secondly[/B], what do we mean exactly by the barrel to slide fitting? Yes, it should be tight, especially in match grade barrels, yet what about an out of the box, standard PT 1911? Should the barrel locking lugs and the semi circular recesses on the upper side of the slide interlock, really tightly, that means not allowing even the slightest of movement [B]or[/B] there may be a slight play, most probably for better locking/unlocking, every time a fire is shot and the slide has to cycle for the extraction and ejection of the empty case and reloading of a fresh cartridge in the chamber? \n\nI have observed that upon locking the slide back, there is a slight ([I]to and fro[/I]) movement of the barrel. If so, is it normal and a natural feature of the barrel locking lugs / Browning mechanism or that the barrel should not have a play, even slight, at all? \n\nRegards!', ''),

(491898, '300 H&amp;H Magnum The 300 H&H Magnum was introduced in 1925 by the Brithish firm of Holland & Holland and called "Hollands Super 30." The Western Cartridge Co. the first American company to load this round commercially, offered it  here about the latter part of 1925. No American-made commercial rifles were chmabered for the 300 H&H until  some 12 years after its introduction. However, Griffin & Howe and othe rcustom rifle makers turned out rifles for it almost as soon as the British. In 1935, Ben Comfort won the 1000-yard Wimbledon Cup Match with this cartridge and overnight it became the new sensation. The Model 70 Winchester was chambered for the 300 H&H in 1937, and the Model 721 and succeeding Model 700 Remingtons were also available in this caliber. Most Euoropean bolt-action rifles chambered it as standard.\r\n\r\nSince about 1935, the 300 H&H has enjoyed a limited, but increasing popularity in the U.S. Many American hunter & other shooters insist it is not enough better than 30-06 to be worth bothering with. Regardless of which side one favours, this is quite an accurate cartridge and is certainly adequate for any North American big game. Its most useful range is from elk on up, but it is also a very fine long-range cartridge for antelope, sheep or goat. It is very popular in Africa as an all-round caliber for plains game. Its popularity has suffered considerably from competition with the 300 Weatherby and Winchester Magnums plus a host of 30-caliber wildcats, most of them based on some variation of the 300 H&H case.', ''),

(491901, '308 Norma Magnum The 308 Norma Magnum was introduced in 1960 by A.B. Norma Projektilfabrik of Amotfors, Sweden, through their American representative, Norma Precision. In its original form, This cartridge was something of a semi-wildcat, because only un-primmed brass cases were available and no commercial rifles were chambered for it. Several European manufacturers chamber the round as standard or on order, and Kodiak ( now out of business ) offered their M158 in this caliber.\r\n\r\nThe 308 Norma Magnum is practically identical in shape to the wildcat 03-308, which is the 338 Winchester Magnum necked-down to 30-caliber (or the 264 Winchester necked up). However, the two cases are not inter-changeable due to a difference in body length. Almost any standard- length 30-06 or 308 Winchester rifle can be re-chambered to take the 308 Norma cartridge. This cartridge is also similar to a number of 30-caliber wildcat magnums based on the blown-out and shortened 300 H&H case, and known collectively as the 300 short magnum group. The 30 Luft, 300 Apes and Ackley short 30 Magnum are representative of this class. Needles to say, the 308 Norma Magnum is adequate for any North American big game and should also do very well on African plains game. Powder capacity is only a hair greater than the 300 H&H but the shape of the case is radically different. This is really a proprietary cartridge for the American market and sold through an American dealers setup.', ''),

(491904, '300 Weatherby Magnum The 300 Weatherby Magnum is undoubtely the most popular and well-known cartridge of the Weatherby line, and at the same time, one of the most controversial. It was developed in 1944 and was actually the last of the necked-down or improved Weatherby developments based on the 300 H&H case.  Commercial ammunition has been available since about 1948, under the Weatherby label. The Weatherbys were the only U.S. rifles chambered for this round on a commercial basis, but it is a popular among custom rifle makers, and in 1989 Remington offered their 700 Classic in 300 Weatherby. The cartridge cases were originally made by Norma to Weatherby''s specifications.\r\n\r\nThe 300 WM is a commercial version of the full-length, blown-out or improved 300 H&H Magnum, of which some half-dozen modifications have been kicking around for years. It may not be any better than some of its wildcat cousins, but it is certainly every bit as good as the best of them and has the advantage of being available in factory loads or empty commercial brass. It is one of the most powerful 30-caliber commercial cartridges available today. It has been used successfully on every species of big game found in North America, Africa or Asia.It probably comes closer to being adequate and adaptable for anything, from gophers to elephants, than any other commercial cartridge. If you hand-load it, you can duplicate the performance of any 30-caliber made. However, these large magnum cases are not well-suited to very light loads and the 300 WM should be considered as primarily a big game cartridge. For the man who wants to hunt all over the world and carry only one rifle, this might be the logical choice but best check local game laws when going after dangerous game, as some countries have caliber size restrictions', ''),

I obtained all this information from the representative at Taurus USA as i called him to verify my serial number as well.\n\n2. Yes you can get universal box from your local gun shop, they come in Silver Aluminum or Black Hard Plastic ranging from Rs. 1,500 to 10,000.\n\nps: kindly update your location for us to assist you better in future\n\njazakAllah Khair', ''),

We cannot say what the minimum RKA value is for every animal and distance at which we hunt because it can never be predicted before. We can say that the RKA values are a way of measuring the ability of different cartridges and bullet weights at the different distances of a well placed shot. \nNow that the concept of RKA has been explained it will be applied to popular hunting calibers below:\n[B]SMALL BORE[/B]\n[B].22 RIMFIRE[/B]\n[TABLE="width: 100"]\n[TR]\n[TD]Bullet weight[/TD]\n[TD]35 grain[/TD]\n[TD]RKA / 50m[/TD]\n[TD]10.0[/TD]\n[/TR]\n[TR]\n[TD]Muzzle velocity[/TD]\n[TD]1150 ft/sec[/TD]\n[TD]RKA / 100m[/TD]\n[TD]6.0[/TD]\n[/TR]\n[/TABLE]\nThe .22 rim fire cartridge is a wonderful calibre for target shooting, varmint and all small plague animals such as rats and many more. It is also used for culling in boma’s with a silencer and sub sonic ammunition. It is the caliber most people in Africa learn to shoot with because of the inexpensive ammunition, low sound noise and accuracy.\n \n[B].22 WINCHESTER MAGNUM[/B]\n[TABLE="width: 100"]\n[TR]\n[TD]Bullet weight[/TD]\n[TD]40 grain[/TD]\n[TD]RKA / 100m[/TD]\n[TD]24.5[/TD]\n[/TR]\n[TR]\n[TD]Muzzle velocity[/TD]\n[TD]2000 ft/sec[/TD]\n[TD]RKA / 200m[/TD]\n[TD]15[/TD]\n[/TR]\n[/TABLE]\nThe .22 Winchester Magnum rim fire round is bigger in diameter with a longer case than the .22 long rifles. It can be used on birds, rabbits and culling at short distance shooting head shots.

Even though it has been used as a big game hunting caliber in Africa in the past it is not a true big game cartridge but very successful on small and medium game at short distances. It is not a good flat shooting long distance cartridge because it lacks the required velocity.

The RKA of the different bullet weights differ so much that it is hard to believe that it is from the same caliber. The main reason for that is the 150 grain bullet is almost useless and inaccurate while the 220 grain bullet with that the excellent sectional density is a real killer with the RKA of 647. The 150 grain bullet will usually loose much of its weight on impact while the 220 grain bullet will retain most of its original weight when hunting African game. The 30-06 when shooting a 180 grain bullet is a medium African Hunting caliber but when shooting 220 grain bullets it becomes a big game African hunting caliber. The 30.06 has never been a successful caliber for hunting of African plains game but is outstanding for the hunting of game in the African bushveld with the heavier bullets.\n[B]300 WIN MAG and 300 HOLLAND+HOLLAND[/B]\n[TABLE="width: 100"]\n[TR]\n[TD]Bullet weight[/TD]\n[TD]180 grain[/TD]\n[TD]RKA / 100m[/TD]\n[TD]428[/TD]\n[/TR]\n[TR]\n[TD]Muzzle velocity[/TD]\n[TD]2950 ft/sec[/TD]\n[TD]RKA / 200m[/TD]\n[TD]440[/TD]\n[/TR]\n[/TABLE]\n \n[TABLE="width: 100"]\n[TR]\n[TD]Bullet weight[/TD]\n[TD]220 grain[/TD]\n[TD]RKA / 100m[/TD]\n[TD]658[/TD]\n[/TR]\n[TR]\n[TD]Muzzle velocity[/TD]\n[TD]2650 ft/sec[/TD]\n[TD]RKA / 200m[/TD]\n[TD]651[/TD]\n[/TR]\n[/TABLE]\nAs these cartridges are so close together their calculations are regarded as the same. \nWith the 300 Magnums we come to true African big game hunting cartridges.

The problem with that was the ability to penetrate at the black powder velocity of while the large frontal area was very poor. These big bores are usually used to stop a charging animal after it being wounded while hunting in Africa. Very often the hunter of the big five in Africa has to shoot a few shots in a very short period of time in order to stay alive. In Africa with the tough game you must have the right caliber for the job or come short. Even if you have the caliber strong enough for the operation and the bullet is not well placed having a doubled barrelled rifle with a second shot, is your insurance policy.', ''),

I played in 5 events: Free Pistol (50 meter shooting), 10 meter AirPistol, Rapid Fire Pistol, Standard Pistol, Center Fire Pistol.  Managed three bronze and three silvers.  I LOVED this event and am definitely looking forward to the next one... with a lot more practice.  Anyways, here are some pictures I managed to scrounge up.

(492527, 'Revolver availability in Karachi ????? Dear Friends,\n\nI am looking for a good quality (excellent make/finish/performance) revolver in .22 mag/lr. My 2nd option is for .357 mag.

However I am unable to find detailed recommendations on PG since most are 9mm fans or shotgun users. \n\nI dont want to spend on a very expensive revolver but has to be a decent one (and there are not many options to my knowledge).

(492531, ' Since good News about MOI Licenses are coming, I decided to accelerate the process of gun selection. On Monday (December 24th), I tried Winchester Model 101 at Baksh Elahi & Sons, Lahore (had tried before as well). I had not tried Marocchi and Beretta yet. Since, I am spending this weekend in Rawalpindi and had nothing to do, I went to Badaruddin today. First I tried Marocchi and then Beretta Xplor Unico. Both are outclass weapons.\n\nI found Winchester Nose Heavy as the balance is on forward side (I shared this info before) even though it has steel receiver. But I found Marocchi quite balanced despite its Alloy Receiver. I had not tried one before. It is of really very impressive quality. I think gun fits me well but I will need help of senior member to declare that. I found Mr. Mustafa very cooperative. He quoted Rs. 145K. When I asked if the price is negotiable, he smiled and said when you will come to buy this, we will discuss.\n\nThen I tried Xplor. No doubt it is very well balanced and light. And its swing is also better. It is one hell of a weapon. My only reservation is regarding it''s (rather every semi-auto''s) lenght which to me is bit longer than O/U. The other is regaring fitting for which I will again seek help from seniors (12GAUGE, Sir, You Live In Rawalpindi). Mustafa quoted Rs. 264K.\n\nSince I have yet to arrange funds which will take about a month time or so, I will at least try all these guns twice again.\n\nMan!

I love the ugly looking beast but is is really a true robust beast ?

(492562, '303 Savage Originally developed as a potential military cartridge in 1895, the 303 Savage aws later introduced commercially as one of several calibers for the popular Savage Moel 1899 lever action. Savage discontinued the caliber when rifle production was resumed after WWII. In England it is known as the 301 Savage. No rifles are chambered for this round at the present time. The current Winchester loading uses the original 190-grain bullet weight. \r\n\r\n\r\nThe 303 Savage is not actually a 303 caliber at all, bur is really a 30-caliber and uses .308-inch bullets. It is very similar to the 30-30 in size, shape and oerformance, but the two are not inter-changeable. With the 190-grain bullet, many old woods hunters swore by it a a brush cartridge. With the relatively heavy bullet at moderate velocity, it gave good penetration on deer-size animals. However, it isn''t any more powerful than the 30-30 and its use should be restricted to deer at short ranges. Although still loaded, it is rapidly becoming obsolete.', ''),

(492568, '303 British The 303 was the official military rifle cartidge of England and the British Empire from its adaption in 1888 until the 7.62 NATO came along in the 1950s. Original loading was 215-grain bullet and a compressed charge of blackpowder-smokeless powder became the prpellant in 1892. Manufacture in the U.S. began about 1897. Remington chambered their lee bolt-action magazine rifle for this cartridge and Winchester did likewise in their Model 95 lever action. \r\n\r\nThe 303 British has, or course, always been popular in Canada and other parts of the British Empire. In the U.S. it has never been widely used because of its performance similarity to the 30-40 Krag. However, since the end of WWII, the importation of large numbers of British Lee-Enfield military rifles has altered this situation. At the present time, the 303 is probably as popular as the 30-40 Krag and just as widwly distributed. Norma imports 130- and 150-grain loads that greatly increase the flexibility and usefullness of this cartridge for the American hunter. The 215-grain bullet has always had a good reputition for deep penetration and has killed lots of  moose and caribou in the Canadian backwoods. The 303 is suitable for anything the 30-40 Krag is in the way of game. In Australia, a number of popular sporting cartridges are based on necking-down and/or reforming the 303 British.', ''),

From camp fire to liquid fire. we were wondering which qualities those fortunate persons had which we lacked and were not given such facilities. we asked some servants as to who these dignitries were and we come to know that some of them were sardars and nawabs of other tribes, some were MNAs and MPAs , some were AIGs, DIGs and SPs and some were commissioners, deputy commissioners and assistant commissioners. we returned to uur kind hosts who kept us comfortable more than themselves and with them we saw the fireworks . we had breakfast with our nobel hosts and went to competition but this treatment from the admin made us so disappointed that i dindt fire and left,  as the first phase of the competition ended and our hosts see off us. we than came to know through media that a son od peer of bharchoondi (MNA) won the event', ''),

(492588, 'Tangent Sight - CZ 452 22LR Shooters that get to know the CZ 452 22LR rifle fall in love with its craftsmanship and accuracy. Another feature that many like is the tangent sight that is available on some variants of the CZ 452 - just move the slider of the tangent sight to desired distance and shoot. Initially you have to zero the rifle by adjusting the front sight. After the initial zero calibration, you are set to go for any distance that is marked on the tangent sight.\n \nI have a CZ 452-2E ZKM. The tangent sight of this model is calibrated in 25-meter increments from 25 to 200 meters. How do I skip the 25-meter leaps and move the tangent sight in smaller increments?\n \nWith a metric ruler I measured the length of the markings between &#8220;25&#8221; and &#8220;200&#8221; on the tangent sight. This distance is 35 millimeters. The number of 25-meter segments between &#8220;25&#8221; and &#8220;200&#8221; is seven (25 to 50, 50 to 75, etc). Each 50-meter distance mark on the tangent sight (25 to 75, 100 to 150 etc.) is 10 millimeters in length. This means that the tangent sight distances can be resolved down to 5-meter intervals (50/10=5) with each millimeter movement of the tangent sight.\n \nThe tangent sight distance markings of CZ 452 start from the rear of the rifle (25 meters) and run towards the muzzle end (200 meters) in 25-meter intervals. As the slider is moved forward (towards the muzzle to increase the distance) the lower end of the scale falls under the slider and thus becomes hidden. If you want to resolve (for example) a distance of 40 meters, you need to move the slider up by 3 millimeters from the 25-meter marking (3*5=15M; 25+15=40M). As the slider is moved upward, the 25-meter mark gets hidden under the slider. What is the solution? There is an answer.\n \nWorking from the next visible tangent marking above the slider (50 meters) I moved the slider 2 millimeters down from this mark (50-40=10M; 10/5=2mm). This gave me the same result as moving the slider 3-millimter upward from the 25-meter mark.\n \nWith four small (1, 2, 3, and 5 millimeter) metric thickness gauges, I am able to set the tangent rear sight of the CZ 452 to any 5-meter increment from 25 meters to 200 meters. Let us say I want to set tangent sight to a distance of 130 meters. The nearest distance marking above the slider is 150 meters. I need to go down 20 meters (150-130=20M) from this mark to reach the intended distance of 130 meters. Since each millimeter on tangent sight scale represents 5 meters, I need move the slider down 4 millimeters (20/5=4mm) from the 150-meter mark on the tangent scale. By using combination of 3 and 1 millimeter thickness gauges (1+3=4mm; 4*5=20M; 150-20=130M) I am able to accurately arrived at my intended distance of 130 meters on the tangent rear sight of the CZ 452. I could have a used a mini 0-10-millimer ruler (less than 0.4 inch in length) to do this measurement.\n \nCZ 452 is a marvel of craftsmanship. This model is no longer in production. At my end some dealers still have it in stock. Market for used CZ 452 is almost dried up as people that do have it, do not want to part from their treasure.', ''),

(492641, ' [QUOTE=Leon;330660]Since good News about MOI Licenses are coming, I decided to accelerate the process of gun selection. On Monday (December 24th), I tried Winchester Model 101 at Baksh Elahi & Sons, Lahore (had tried before as well). I had not tried Marocchi and Beretta yet. Since, I am spending this weekend in Rawalpindi and had nothing to do, I went to Badaruddin today. First I tried Marocchi and then Beretta Xplor Unico. Both are outclass weapons.\r\n\r\nI found Winchester Nose Heavy as the balance is on forward side (I shared this info before) even though it has steel receiver. But I found Marocchi quite balanced despite its Alloy Receiver. I had not tried one before. It is of really very impressive quality. I think gun fits me well but I will need help of senior member to declare that. I found Mr. Mustafa very cooperative. He quoted Rs. 145K. When I asked if the price is negotiable, he smiled and said when you will come to buy this, we will discuss.\r\n\r\nThen I tried Xplor. No doubt it is very well balanced and light. And its swing is also better. It is one hell of a weapon. My only reservation is regarding it''s (rather every semi-auto''s) lenght which to me is bit longer than O/U. The other is regaring fitting for which I will again seek help from seniors (12GAUGE, Sir, You Live In Rawalpindi). Mustafa quoted Rs. 264K.\r\n\r\nSince I have yet to arrange funds which will take about a month time or so, I will at least try all these guns twice again.\r\n\r\nMan! I had sort of selected Winchester for buying but Marocchi and Xplor have made me to think again. I am in a fix.

Then your review on Marocchi got my attention and itch for shotgun surfaced again. And then issue of Aluminum receiver came up. During the process, MOI process stopped and Respected Mian-50 introduced Winchester. So, all resulted in confusions and I decided to ask for help. Which by the way was very much provided.

(492727, '8mm Mauser (8x57mm JS) The 8mm or 7.92 Mauser was the German Military rifle cartridge through both World Wars. It was officially adopted in 1888 with a bullet diameter of 318-inch. In 1905, the bullet diameter was increased to .323-inch. In Europe, the 8mm Mauser and several other 8mm cartridges are available in both sizes. The larger size is always designated as S or JS bore. Beside Germany, a great many other European and some South American countries used the 8mm Mauser as a military round. It is widely chambered in European sporting rifles, bur American gun-makers have not adopted it as a standard sporting caliber, although the Model 54 Winchester was so chambered  for short time, according to one year''s catalog.\r\n\r\nThe 8mm Mauser has not been very popular in the U.S. but number of obsolete, surplus 8mm military rifles sold here since the end of WWII has increased its use substantially. American cartridge companies only put one loading, the 170-grain bullet at 2470 fps or so, much like the 30-40 Krag. As imported by Norma and also loaded by other European companies, such as RWS, it is in the same class as our 30-06. It is adequate for any North American big game if the proper bullets and full loadings are used. Many American owners of 8mm Mauser rifles prefer to have then re-chambered for the wild-cat 8mm-06, which is the 30-06 case with the neck expanded to take .323-inch bullets. However, no factory loadings are made in this caliber and it is strictly  a hand-loading proposition. a large variety of good .323-inch bullets is now available for the individual hand-loader, and this has increased the use fullness of the 8mm Mauser for the American shooter.', ''),

So the westerners and canadian gun nuts who fire thousands of round yearly should be , theoritically , in a better position to assess the shortcomings of gun but i have red countless forums and didnt found any thing showing their displeasure on such changes . but we here in Pakistan hardly cross hundreds and are restless about such changes . beside i have never seen any frame crack issue in viking mp 446 poly in  any country other than pakistan . may be a bad lot came in Pakistan but i think the cracked frame pistols to be the clones and every one know that we are making just original like clones of turkish , chinese and brazillian pistols so why cant we make russian pistols clones', ''),

As he walks down the street carrying his bronze rat, He notices that a few real rats crawl out of the alleys and sewers and begin following him down the street. This is disconcerting; he begins walking faster. But within a couple of blocks, the herd of rats behind him grows to hundreds, and they begin squealing. He begins to trot toward the Bay, looking around to see that the rats now numbered in the MILLIONS, and are still squealing and coming towards him faster and faster.\r\n\r\nConcerned, even scared, he runs to the edge of the Bay and throws the bronze rat as far out into the Bay as he can. Amazingly, the millions of rats all jump into the Bay after it, and are all drowned.\r\nThe man walks back to the curio shop.\r\n"Ah ha," says the owner, "You have come back for the Story?"\r\n\r\n"No," says the man, I came back to see if you have a statue of an "INDIAN POLITITIAN" in bronze!!', ''),
(492836, '8mm Remington Magnum A Remington development announced in 1978 for their Model 700 BDL bolt-action rifle. The 8mm Magnum is something of a departure from the usual belted, short magnum configuration favored by Remington in the past, a design which will work through the standard-length bolt-action. The 8mm Magnum is based on the full-lengthv375 H&H case blown out, thus requiring a .375-inch longer bolt travel than the standard 30-06 length action. At present, only the Remington 700 Safari grade and the A-square Caesar and Hannibal rifles are available in 8mm Magnum caliber, the extra-long bolt throw required probably inhibiting other companies from adopting it.\nAgain, this is not an entirely original design since it was preceded by similar developments in years past. The 8x68mm (S) Magnum, for example, originated in Germany around 1940 or earlier, and a number of 8mm wildcat magnums such as the 8mm Ernst, 8x62 Durham, 323 Hollis, 8mm PMM, etc., date back to the late 1950s and early 1960s. However, this is the first commercial 8mm magnum cartridge introduced by as American company. Remington offers two loadings: a 185-grain bullet at a muzzle velocity of 3080 fps and a 220-grain at 2830 fps. There is a good selection of 8mm (.323-inch diameter) bullets available for hand-loading, something that increases the flexibility of this cartridge, although those bullets have been intended for the 8x57mm, which might lead to over-expansion at magnum velocities. Bullet makers have, however, supplied proper magnum bullets. This is an example of a fine cartridge that failed to catch on.\n\nThe 8mm, one of the popular and standard calibers in Europe, has never been widely accepted in the U.S. The reason si due probably to our enchantment or preoccupation with the 30-caliber. Remington did not have a 30-caliber magnum in their cartridge lineup, and anything they produced would simply be a duplicate of the 300 Weatherby or Winchester Magnums. It made good sense, therefore, to opt for the 8mm, which offers something a little different. Also, the 220-grain .323-inch diameter bullet starting out at 2830 fps sustains its velocity beyond the 200-yard range better better than the 220-grain bullet from the 300 Winchester Magnum (about 100 fps at 500 yards.) This is not really a tremendous advantage, and there would not be a great deal of difference in killing power between the 8mm Remington Magnum and the various 30-caliber Magnums. The 8mm Magnum would be adequate for any North American big game and probably most African species, too. It should be considered as primarily a big game cartridge rather than something also suitable for varmint hunting. Certainly the 8mm Magnum is an excellent choice for the hunter whose primary interest is big game hunting and who wants sustained killing power out to the maximum practical range. For African hunting, a 250-grain bullet would make sense and Remington should consider this.', '');

To get a “feel” of the CZ 452’s distance meter-markings on the tangent sight, I wanted to relate those to yardage numbers that are very much familiar to me.\n \nIn my earlier post on the CZ 452, I described how the 25-incremental markings could be resolved into more refined segments of 5 meters. Now I describe how a small metric 35-millimeter ruler can be used to achieve the same goal. In addition, I have prepared a conversion table for myself and for those interested in dealing with yards instead of meters.\n \nHere is how I use the metric ruler and the conversion table. Measurements are taken between the front of the slider and the 200-meter mark. Move the slider to the 25-meter mark. Place the 35millimter edge of the ruler against the front edge of the slider of the tangent sight. Consult the table and move the slider to achieve the desired distance.

(492856, '22LR &amp; Year 2013 Resolve to get a 22LR rifle. If one or more are already in the collection, adding another will only add to more fun in life. A 22LR in hands of a sportsman is like a new toy in the hands of a kid - fun and joy. Unlike a kid’s toy, a 22LR rifle - with minimal care, can outlast many generations.\n \nShooting and hunting need not be expensive. Initial expense is the firearm itself.  A ton of money can be saved by selectively buying a good used rifle. If you don’t know much about guns and want to go the saving-money route, ask a friend or relative who is already in this his hobby. Take him along to see and check out the used offerings. Stick to the well known established brands. Your friend or relative that is into guns can be your best guide. After inspection and satisfaction that the gun selected is in good condition, let your accompanying friend or relative do the price dickering.\n \nOnce you get your 22LR, you can shoot-hunt all day long and not worry much about what is left in your wallet. Of all the ammunition on the market - 22LR is the cheapest metal cartridge you can buy. If you do hunt big game, you can hone your shooting skills with the 22LR during the off-season. When the big game opening day arrives, you will be better prepared for that one shot you have been looking forward to.\n \nWith each passing day, life gets shorter by an additional day. Forget about the days already gone and look forward to the days in front of us. Get a 22LR and enjoy life to the', ''),

(492863, '338 Winchester Magnum Announced in 1958, the 338 is another of the series based on the 458 Winchester necked-down. Initially available only in the Winchester Model 70 "Alaskan" bolt-action rifle, Remington adopted it for their 700 Series bolt action for a time, and some of the European rifle makers also chamber it, as does Ruger for their Model 77 and many custom and semi-custom rifles. Browning''s auto-loader chambers it.\r\n\r\nDesigned to cover the heaviest of North American big game, the 338 has also done very well in Africa on the larger varieties of plains game. Although slightly less powerful than the time-proven 375 H&H Magnum, the 338 is probably better suited for North American hunting conditions and game. It is a well-balanced cartridge for anything from elk through moose and grizzly bear under almost any situation. It could also serve very well for deer or antelope, even though it is needlessly powerful for this class.  Like the 300 WM, the 338 Winchester would make an excellent one-gun cartridge for the worldwide hunter who has to travel light. The 338 is automatically barred in some African countries on some species, those in which the 375 is the minimum caliber. Check with local authorities before attempting to use it.', ''),

(492868, '340 Weatherby Magnum The growing popularity of the 338 Winchester Magnum for elk and larger game undoubtedly influenced the development of the 340 Weatherby. First announcement of the new caliber came in 1962, although most gun writers were aware of the development a year or so prior to official release. John Amber had one of the first 340 WM rifles and reported 100-yard groups of 2 inches or less, quite good for such a heavy-caliber hunting rifle.\r\n\r\nWith its larger case, the 340 Weatherby develops higher velocity with any given bullet weight than the 338 Winchester. Velocity of 3210 fps with the 200-grain bullet and 2850 with the 250-grain is impressive. This means around 4550 fpe with either bullet. This should be quite deadly on African game. A 210-grain Nosler bullet loading is also available with an MV of 3165. All of these figures derive from 26-inch barrels. The cartridge is suitable for all North American big game and most African species as well.', ''),

(493093, '35 Remington Introduced with the Remington Model 8 semi-auto rifle in 1906, the 35 Remington was later also chambered in the Remington Models 14 and 131 slide action, the Model 81 semi-auto, Model 30 bolt-action, and for a short time, in the Winchester bolt-action Model 70. At one time, the Marlin 336 lever, Mossberg 479 lever and savage 170 slide-action rifles were offered in 35 Remington. Currently, only the Marlin is still available in rifles, the Remington XP-100 and T/C pistols are chambered for the 35 Remington.\r\n\r\nThe 35 Remington is the only one of the Remington rimless line of medium-powered cartridges still alive. It has proven itself over the years as a good, reliable short-range woods cartridge on deer or black bear. It actually has far better knockdown power than the 30-30 under practically any conditions and at any range, the velocity and energy figures are not very different from the 30-30, but the larger, heavier bullet has greater shock and makes a more severe wound. The 200-grain bullet is the only one that should ever be used on big game. the 35 Remington, with its moderate recoil, is a good cartridge for light rifles or carbines. It was originally the Remington counter to the much more powerful 35 Winchester, and is based on a shortened version of the 30-06 case.', ''),

(492996, '348 Winchester Developed by Winchester for their Model 71 lever-action rifle and introduced during 1936, the 348 is actually a modernized version of the 33 Winchester. No other rifle has ever been commercially available for this cartridge and the Model 71 was discontinued in 1958. In 1987, Browning marketed a limited number of re-production Model 71s that were made in Japan. At this writing, only Winchester loads the 348, and the 200-grain bullet load is the lone survivor.\r\n\r\nOne of the more powerful rimmed cartridges available for the lever-action rifle, the 348 was made obsolete by the newer 358 Winchester and the more modern Model 88 lever-action rifle (now discontinued). The 348 is an excellent woods and bush cartridge for almost any North American big game. Due to the flat-point bullets required by the tubular magazine of the Model 71 rifle, it is not particularly good long-range cartridge. The 150-grain bullet has very poor ballistic properties due to its short, flat shape, and the 200- or 250-grain bullets are preferred for anything beyond 100 yards or so. Winchester dropped the 150-grain and 250-grain loads in 1962 and offer only a "commemorative" 200-grain loading. Remington no longer loads it. It is close to being discontinued.', ''),

(493022, '351 Winchester Self-Loading Introduced in 1907 to replace the 35 SL as a more powerful round for the improved Model 1907 Winchester auto loading rifle. This cartridge has always had a certain popularity with police and guard work. It was used to a very limited extent in both WWI and II by the french. The rifle was discontinued in 1957. However, due to demand, American companies are loading the 351 again and the British and Canadian also continue to load it.\r\n\r\nThe 351 SL dosen''t have very much to offer, even though it is an improvement over the older 35. It won''t qualify as a suitable deer cartridge, although it has been used with indifferent success for that purpose. It is a good medium-game cartridge for coyote,mountain lions or animals in that class, but is really too powerful for small game. It is expensive, not accurate enough and too limited in range for varmint shooting. It has been rather popular for Latin American jungle hunting, because at the short ranges involved it has sufficient power for the game encountered there. It has been used quite a bit from low-flying, light aircraft in the western United States for pest control. Like the 35, the 351 SL is semi-rimmed and the principal difference is in the .24-inch longer case of the 351.', ''),

(493081, '357 Magnum (Rifle) The 357 Magnum was introduced in 1935 as a revolver cartridge for the smith & Wesson heavy-frame Model 27 revolver, but it was only a few years various experimenters begun chambering rifles for it. Most 357 Magnum rifles put together by gunsmiths were based on either the Model 1892 Winchester lever-action repeater or some single shot action. With the advent of WWII, interest in such rifles waned, but after the war, numbers of the small Greener Martini-action Australian cadet rifles were imported and many were re-bored and chambered for the 357 Magnum. Interest in rifles of this caliber was revived, particularly as a companion or matched-caliber arm for 357 Magnum revolvers. The first commercial rifle to chamber the 357 was the Marlin Model 62 Lever-matic in 1963. A four-shot, box magazine, lever-action repeater, it was discontinued after only a few years. Universal offered a 357 Ferret semi-auto carbine. Currently, several rifles are offered in 357 Magnum chambering. The Rossi Lever-action and Uberti Rolling Block Baby Carbine were introduced several years ago, and in 1978 the Marlin Model 24-V combination gun in 1979. Obviously, the 357 Magnum must be treated as both a rifle and hand gun cartridge. Any 357 handgun load can be used in rifles, but some rifle loads are much hot to be used in a revolver. When fire in rifle barrels of 18 inches and longer, the 357 develops initial velocities of 1800 to over 2000 fps, depending on bullet weight and load.\r\n\r\nAs a rifle cartridge, the 357 Magnum is a fine, economical, general purpose small game and varmint cartridge, and in a pinch will even do for deer at short ranges. The author has taken wild goat, feral pigs and even mule deer with 357 rifles and found them quite effective if the range is not over 100 to 125 yards. This is not to recommend the 357 as a deer cartridge, but rather to point out that it is quite capable of humane kills on deer if one uses the right bullet and load and ir the range is short. As a matter of fact, the 357 Magnum revolver was for many years after its introduction considered a perfectly adequate deer and bear gun, and a number of such animals have been taken with it by good stalkers. The revolver, of course, develops much less velocity and energy than the same cartridge fired from a rifle, some 600 fps less muzzle velocity, in fact. In a rifle, the 357 Magnum can be loaded with bullets from 110-grains up to 200-grains. The 357 is in general more useful rifle cartridge than the 44 Magnum, although certainly the 44 is much more effective on deer-size animals.', ''),

(493152, '358 winchester Introduced in 1955 by Winchester for their Model 70 Lightweight bolt-action and Model 88 lever-action rifles, the 358 Winchester is based on 308 Winchester case necked-up. It is known in Europe as the 8.8x51mm, and many European rifle makers chamber the round. In the U.S. only the Browning BLR lever action is currently chambered for this cartridge.\r\n\r\nThe 358 Winchester is easily one of the best commercial (non-magnum) 35-caliber cartridges turned out by any American manufacturer. It is a big improvement over the 35 Remington , slightly more powerful than the old 35 Winchester, and certainly more useful than the 348 Winchester, which it more or less parallels. As the 308 Winchester is a shortened and scaled-down 35 Whelen. With its spitzer pointed bullets, the 358 should be a good medium-to long range cartridge with capabilities out to 225 or possibly even 350 yards on big game. Although a good woods number, it is definitely out of the short-range, deer-only class. In fact, the 358 is adequate for any North American big game, and, with the 250-grain bullet, might be a little better than the 30-06 on the heaviest types in thick cover. The 358 in a bolt-action rifle with a good scope sight is about as accurate as any hunting cartridge available. Performance can be improved a little by hand-loading.', ''),

(493130, '356 Winchester The 356 Winchester is a rimmed cartridge developed concurrently with the 307 Winchester for the Winchester Model 94 TXR Angle eject lever-action carbine. Development of both cartridges began in 1980, public announcement was made in December, 1982, and guns and ammunition were available on the market early in 1983. Marlin introduced their lever-action Model 336ER in 356-caliber at about the same time as the Winchester hit the market, but do not catalog it now. The Winchester Model 94 TXR is a beefed-up version of the original Model 94 lever action to allow the use of higher pressure cartridges, and the angle-eject feature is an additional modification to eject spent cartridge cases out to the side instead of straight up. This feature allows the proper center mounting of a scope sight, something not possible with the original 1894 action. This was accomplished by repositioning the extractor and ejector and lowering the right side wall of the receiver slightly.\r\nThe 356-caliber designation is to avoid confusion with the similar rimless 358 Winchester. In fact, the 356 is little more than a rimmed 358 and uses the same diameter bullets. the 356 and the 358 are not absolutely identical since the 356 not only has a rim, but also the bullet is seated deeper to reduce the overall length and the case is made heavier. It''s impossible to chamber 358 cartridges in 356 rifles, but firing them is an unsafe practice that could lead to damage to the gun and possible injury to the shooter.\r\n\r\nThe ballistics of the 356 are slightly below the older rimless 358 because the heavier case combined with the deeper bullet seating reduces the case capacity by about 6 to 7 percent. However, the 356 delivers performance superior to the old and popular 35 Remington by a significant margin. Factory-published ballistics data show that the 35 Remington 200-grain bullet has a muzzle velocity of 2210 fps, whereas the 356 Winchester delivers 2460 fps with the same bullet weight, both from a 24-inch barrel.\r\nWhile 35 Remington is largely a short-range woods or brush cartridge for deer or black bear, the 356 Winchester would be adequate for larger game up to elk and at longer ranges. One should consider though that both the Winchester and Marlin lever-action carbines with their short 20-inch barrels are intended primarily as light, handy guns for use heavy brush or timber and they have achieved their great popularity for that purpose. A hunter armed with one of the 356 carbines could probably take on just about anything likely to be countered in the continental U.S. at short to moderate ranges. The 358 Winchester has never achieved great popularity, and it will be interesting to see how well the 356 is received over the next decade or so.', ''),

By the same token, I doubt very much that you are brave enough to take on the challenge.\n \nThe 22LR was not designed to kill elephants and lions but it has. Let us be candid. The 22LR is a small game animal that is ideal for rabbits, birds and the like. It is perfect for learning and teaching the art of marksmanship. Newcomers enjoy the 22LR as it does not knock them off their feet when they pull the trigger.\n \nBullet weight and bullet velocity are the two elements that determine the bullet energy. Doubling the weight of a bullet with given velocity, doubles the bullet energy. Keeping the bullet weight the same but doubling the velocity results in quadrupling of bullet energy. If the target is at a distance from the muzzle, shape of the bullet will determine the drag and thus the velocity and the energy of the bullet at time of impact.\n \nHere are some links that demonstrate the penetration and destructive power of the 22LR cartridge at various ranges and at various objects. Conclusion of the all these tests clearly shows that the 22LR is not a plaything - it is lethal.

(493252, ' @ ALL..... \n\nThere is a little query, regarding the barrel of PT 1911. According to the tradition/custom, in vogue, while estimating about the barrel of a firearm, as to how much has it been previously used, they inserted the projectile of the cartridge by holding it from the base/ primer side of the cartridge into the muzzle. A new, less or moderately used firearm''s barrel/muzzle would not let the projectile, completely sink into it.\n \nWhether less credible a criterion to gauge the barrel usage or not, I did the same to my newly acquired PT 1911, not a single cartridge shot from it yet, and to my surprise the .45 projectile fully sunk into its muzzle. \n\nI request the worthy 1911 owners in .45 and seniors to first do the same with the muzzles of their handguns, and please shed some light on the matter! Whether it happens with all 1911s in .45 or not? If yes, why?\n \nSecondly, what do we mean exactly by the barrel to slide fitting? Yes, it should be tight, especially in match grade barrels, yet what about an out of the box, standard PT 1911? Should the barrel locking lugs and the semi circular recesses on the upper side of the slide interlock, really tightly, that means not allowing even the slightest of movement or there may be a slight play, most probably for better locking/unlocking, every time a fire is shot and the slide has to cycle for the extraction and ejection of the empty case and reloading of a fresh cartridge in the chamber? \n\nI have observed that upon locking the slide back, there is a slight (to and fro) movement of the barrel. If so, is it normal and a natural feature of the barrel locking lugs / Browning mechanism or that the barrel should not have a play, even slight, at all? \n\nRegards!', ''),

(493255, '350 Remington Magnum The 350 Remington Magnum first appeared in the 1965 Remington catalog concurrently with the Model 600 Magnum Bolt-action carbine that chambered it. However, information on the rifle and cartridge had been aired in various gun magazines a year earlier. The original carbine had an 18-inch barrel and in 1968 this was lengthened to 20 inches as the Model 660 Magnum carbine. By 1971, the Model 600 and 660 Magnum carbines had been discontinued, but the 350 Magnum was continued as a standard chambering for the Ruger Model 77 bolt-action rifle until 1974. For a short time, the Ruger Model 77 bolt-action rifle was available in 350 Magnum. At the present time, no factory rifles are regularly chambered for this cartridge, but ammunition is still loaded and probably will be for a good many years. The cartridge is unique in having a somewhat short, fat-belted case with the same capacity as the 30-06. This allows for its use in short-action rifles that can be made a bit lighter and handier than those based on the standard-length bolt action.\r\n\r\nIn order for the 350 Magnum cartridge to feed and function properly through the short Model 600 and 660 actions, the bullet must be seated rather deeply. The reason for this is so the overall length will not exceed a maximum of 2.8 inches. This deep seating requirement reduces the powder capacity and reduces the performance somewhat. The Remington Model 700 and the Ruger Model 77 bolt actions have longer magazines and will permit the hand-loader to seat bullets farther out of the case and use slightly increased powder charges within the farther limitation of the chamber throat. The 350 Magnum will duplicate the ballistics of the popular 35 Whelen wildcat in similar barrel lengths and is adequate for any North American big game at short to medium ranges.', ''),

(493291, '35 Whelen The 35 Whelen was developed in 1922 by James Howe, of the firm Griffin & Howe, and named after the famous writer, hunter and gun authority, the late Col. Townsend Whelen. The cartridge is based on the standard 30-06 case-necked up to 35-caliber without any other change. There is also an improved version made by necking-up the Ackley 30-06 Improved case. In 1987, Remington Arms adopted the 35 Whelen and introduced it as a standardized commercial cartridge chambered in their Model 700 Classic bolt-action rifle, and also their Model 7600 slide-action rifle. In the past, the cartridge has always been chambered in bolt-actions and many shot-out 30-06 barrels were re-bored to 35 Whelen. It was originally developed to provide a medium-bore cartridge that would work through the standard-length bolt action.\r\n\r\nRemington has been very astute in adding popular wildcats to their line of commercial cartridges, and the 35 Whelen should be another winner. The hunters has had considerable past experience with the 35 Whelen, and it is an excellent cartridge for any North American big game and most African species as well. A slide-action rifle of this caliber increases the potential of this type of rifle for those who favor medium bores for North American big game. There is a large variety of 35-caliber bullets available to the hand-loader, ranging from 110 to 300-grains in weight, and 30-06 brass is still easy to come by as a more economical way to load your own. Practically all of the reloading tool manufacturers furnish a 35-caliber neck expanding die, and cases are easy to make. The popularity of the 35 Whelen has waxed and waned over the years, reaching a peak during the 1920s and again shortly after WWII. It would not be surprising to see many of the other makers of bolt actions being offering it.', ''),

(493312, '358 Norma Magnum Developed by Norma and introduced in the U.S. in 1959, at the start no rifles were chambered for the 358 Norma Magnum and only empty brass cases or loaded ammunition were available. However, the Schultz & Larsen Model 65 and the Husqvarna Mauser-type bolt action were made available in this caliber early in 1960. No American manufacturer chambers the cartridge. Like the 308 Norma Magnum, it is something of a proprietary cartridge and perhaps should be listed under European cartridges. However, it was designed for the American market and, as a compromise, it is there.\n\nThe 358 Norma Magnum is a short, magnum-type cartridge intended to work through standard-length actions. It is also nearly identical to the wildcat 35 Ackley belted, short magnum that it can be fired in most rifles so chambered. It is also nearly identical to the wildcat 35-338, which is the 338 Winchester necked-up to 35-caliber, the difference in this instance being mainly in the slightly greater body length of the 358 Norma Magnum (about .51-inch).\nThe 358 Norma Magnum delivers the same performance as the slightly larger 375 H&H Magnum and would be suitable for the same range of game. It is somewhat overpowered for most North American big game, but would be good life insurance against the big Kodiak bears. However, it is another good all-round number for the man who wants to be prepared for hunting anything, anywhere, at any time, whether or not rifles are in production.', ''),

No.  Preparing for the match was more a chore than fun.  Still wanting to have fun - today I was called on by Glockcohlic about the same thing... FUN.  Sooo, we packed up our things and took off to the range, some of us carrying more packed stuff than others.  \nWhen we got to the range, it was empty and available all to ourselves.  So I could see the excitement on Glockcohlic bro''s face as all he wanted to do was teach those nasty 6 plates a lesson, and as he will again be departing in two days I let him have the fun for today.\nI decided to do something else, try Precision Shooting at 25 meters (27 yards), Single Handed, 25 rounds per gun.  The results have been posted below.  I would like to add a note: my shooting didn''t go sooo well due to the continuous sounds of plates being shot over and over hence distracting me... plus I was tired... LOLZ!\nP.S.

(493344, 'Winchester Will Unveil Game-Changing Rimfire Cartridge Winchester Will Unveil Game-Changing Rimfire Cartridge\nBy: Ron Spomer\n\nIf you think the 300 Win Mag is a significant improvement over the .30-06, wait until you shoot the new ground-breaking rimfire cartridge from Winchester. I''m not allowed to disclose its name or caliber yet, but it''s scheduled to storm the market in 2013, beginning as soon as early or mid-March. Its performance exceeds current cartridges in its class by a wider margin than the 300 Win. Mag. over the .30-06.\n\nI don''t say this based merely on rumor or manufacturer hype. I''ve shot the new round. It does everything Winchester says it will. The bullets fly from the muzzle 500 fps faster than any other rimfire cartridge I''m aware of. At 250 yards, they retain nearly double the energy of the next-best round in their class. During my testing off sand bags from a portable bench, five bullets clustered just over 1 inch at 100 yards in light but variable winds. A single four-shot group went into a .39-inch spread, and one 300-yard four-shot group fell inside of 2.5 inches. All this was accomplished with a prototype bolt-action rifle so unrefined that cartridges had to be hand fed and extracted from the chamber with a knife blade. \n\nBallistic coefficient and velocity of the bullets are so high that this new round should hold a Maximum Point Blank Range of 250 yards on an 8-inch target. This means you aim at the center of the 8-inch target and hit it at any and all distances out to 250 yards. Last but not least, the new rounds should cost within 10 percent of currently available rimfire rounds in their class, or about a third less than some centerfire rounds with similar ballistic performance.\n\nBecause dimensions of the round are significantly different from any others currently made, at least one gun maker is reportedly building newly designed bolt-action rifles to fire it. Two more are reportedly working on additional models. Whether those are bolt actions, break actions, levers, semiautos or something else remains to be revealed.\n\n&#8220;New&#8221; cartridges are a tried and sometimes true method for ramping up sales in the shooting industry, but most of them provide only incremental improvements over existing rounds. This new cartridge from Winchester is more than that. Much more. It should be a game changer.\n\nReference: Blog Entry at North American Hunter Website\n\nLink: [url]http://www.huntingclub.com/blogs/articletype/articleview/articleid/14630/winchester-will-unveil-game-changing-rimfire-cartridge#.UMd-l2d2PTo[/url]', ''),

(493442, ' 22LR - Exchanging Gifts & 22 Long Rifle Ammo\n \nWe are all too familiar with the tradition of exchanging gifts. There is a certain joy in giving and receiving gifts. In the same spirit, how about exchanging 22LR ammunition? A nutty idea? Hold your horse before passing judgment on this thought.\n \nLet us go on the assumption that you have one or more 22LR rifles. With the 22LR ammo you have, you get perhaps mediocre, good or excellent results. Regardless, you endeavor to improve your accuracy. How can you achieve this goal or try to achieve it without breaking the bank account to buy yet another 22LR rifle?\n \nJust as there are no two fingerprints alike - in the same fashion, there are no two 22LR rifles alike. Yes, two rifles of the same make and model may bear consecutive serial numbers. Due to the tooling and machining tolerances, reaming of the chambers and the rifling, the barrels will bear unique “internal signatures.” Just because your friend’s 22LR rifle and ammo combination gives him exceptional accuracy does not mean that you will get the same results with your rifle and ammo combination.  You and your friend went together to a gun shop and you both bought the same make and model of rifles along with the same type of ammunition. Yet, the accuracy of your gun differs from that of your friend. You can negate “operator error” by having your friend try your rifle-ammo combo and you can try his rifle-ammo combo. Each rifle may require different type of ammo to achieve the optimum results.\n \nInstead of stocking new 22LR ammo that may give you even inferior results, why not exchange some of your ammo with friends who may not have the same types that you do. The more exchanges you make, the better your chances of achieving or trying to achieve the ideal goal. In this ammo exchange idea, you will also be helping your friend achieve his goal for accuracy.\n \nStill think that exchanging 22LR ammo is nutty idea?', ''),

(493517, '375 Holland &amp; Holland Magnum Originated by the British firm Holland & Holland and introduced in1912, this is one of the original belted, rimless, magnum-type cartridges and has been used as the basis for numerous wildcats and some of the Weatherby cartridges. H&H furnished it in a magnum Mauser action and Griffin & Howe chambered rifles for it beginning about 1926. The Western Cartridge Company offered it in 1925 and, at present, Remington and Winchester load the 375. The first commercial rifle of American make to chamber the round was the Model 70 Winchester in 1937, Weatherby rifles were at one time available in 375 H&H, on order, as was the Remington Model 725 "Kodiak". At present, several American manufacturers list the 375 H&H as standard.\r\n\r\nLong considered the best all-round African caliber, the 375 H&H is perhaps a bit overpowered for North American big game. However, many Alaskan hunters and guides prefer it for moose and grizzly bear. It isn''t a very flexible cartridge for the American hunter unless he expects to hunt the heaviest species and perhaps spend some time in Africa or Asia. John Taylor, in his very fine AFRICAN RIFLES AND CARTRIDGES, Georgetown, South Carolina, 1948, rates the 375 as the best of the medium bores for African hunting. It is his candidate for the most effective, "all-round" cartridge.', ''),

(493537, '378 Weatherby Magnum Another development by Roy Weatherby dating back to 1953, it is an original design and not based on any other existing cartridge. It was first field-tested in the spring of 1953 by the late Roy Weatherby who downed an elephant with it, using a single round for the job. The Federal Cartridge Company No. 215 primers did not properly ignite the large quantity of powder used in this rather sizable case. Only the Weatherby line of rifles is commercially chambered for this round.\r\n\r\nAccording to the Weatherby catalog, the 378 WM was designed for deep penetration on heavy, thick-skinned game. It is also intended to furnish an extra margin of insurance when facing dangerous game such as Rhino, Cape Buffalo, Elephant or Lion in thick cover. Field reports indicate that it certainly lives up to these expectations. However, for proper performance at the velocities developed, it is necessary to use bullets with a very heavy jacket. Although considerably overpowered for any North American big game, it is nonetheless a fine cartridge for the man who requires optimum stopping power. Recoil of these "super magnum" cartridges is extremely  uncomfortable, so one should be sure such power is really needed before selecting anything in this class.', ''),

(493552, ' [QUOTE=isk;331627]I was just wondering that official trophy hunting prices are well beyond  the reach of an ordinary salaried person living in Pakistan, If one can  afford official trophy hunting prices then I really doubt he/she would  be worried about ammo bill, yet there are people out there who keep  looking for ''budget'' hunting rifles every now and then. \n\nThen  what and where exactly do these budget shooters hunt? is community based  hunting really working or nurturing what they call ''poaching'' on  sidelines as well? they say population of Markhors, Urials, etc has  shown a growth then how is that possible. Maybe the biggest threat to  the population of games were locals themselves who have stopped hunting  and now are engaged either legally or illegally in inviting hunters from  urban jungles, which means that a sizeable portion of revenue is not  being channeled through official route. Maybe the money eventually ends  up in the community either way but the entire episode takes place in low  voice. Going illegally also means no check and balance on the size catch. \n\nI could be wrong here but if its true then a lot of  people are deprived of taking on the great activity of hunting who can''t  find a legal way out as it is too expensive or they dont have the right contacts or may be I am too oblivious of the actual facts being new in this arena  \n\nSorry for taking out the frustration but I see no rationale behind the phenomenal increase in rifle prices, just look at some old threads, where is all this demand coming from, why are customers willing to pay double prices in just a matter of year or two, I dont think paper targets are  tastier then a mountain goat.[/QUOTE]\n\n+1... \n\nI heard from a a reliable source that in salt range, many people consider it, a symbol of pride to cook Urial meat in their marrige functions.\nIts true, no space for a hunter who wish to do a legitimate hunt.

By the Grace of ALLAH, I have Sigs and Glocks as they are EXCELLENT guns and are my FAVOURITE...!!! There are three types of Sigs: 1) All made in Germany... 2) Frame made in Germany & Slide made in USA... 3) All made in USA... I can''t say that German Sigs are superior than American Sigs... Its just that Sig guys have put a plant in Exeter, USA and thats why the frame says "Exeter, USA"... German Sig will be difficult to find and even if you do, it won''t be new... If you want a new Sig, then its American... I''ve kept and shot all three sorts of Sigs and trust me, as far as shooting and handling is concerned, I don''t see any difference... I use to have a Sig P220 and a Sig P226 (without rail models) but got rid of them as both caught rust VERY easily which REALLY disappointed me as I could never expect that from Sig...!!! Anyway, new Sig models are rust proof and also have a wear resistant finish... :-) Now I''m a proud owner of a Tac Ops and a regular P226... :-) So if you want a polymer framed pistol go for a Glock otherwise its Sig... TacOps is around 300K-325K, a regular P226 should be around 250K-270K and a Glock 17 would be somewhere between 290K-310K...!!! One can''t go wrong with a Sig or a Glock...!!!', ''),

(493588, '375 Winchester Developed by Winchester, the 375 was announced in 1978 as  a new cartridge for their Model 94 Big Bore lever-action carbine. The gun is a reinforced or strengthened version of the standard Model 94 action and can be distinguished by the beefed-up rear quarter of the receiver, as opposed to the flat sides of the regular Model 94. The  cartridge is based on the shortened (about 1/10-inch) 38-55 case, although the 375 Winchester brass is heavier and stronger than that of the 38-55. Two carbines were initially available in this caliber, the Winchester Model 94 Big Bore and the Ruger Number 3 single shot. It is a rimmed case and not well suited to Mauser-type bolt actions. Two bullet weights are offered: a 200-grain at 2200 fps muzzle velocity and a 250-grain at 1900 fps, as advertised by Winchester and very probably chronographed from a 24-inch barrel. The 20-inch barrel of the Model 94 TXR actually delivers from 50 to 100 fps less muzzle velocity than these figures.\r\n\r\nThe 375 Winchester fills a gap in the line of cartridges available for the very popular Winchester Model 1894 lever-action series. Many hunters who live in heavily-wooded areas like a large- or medium-caliber rifle firing relatively heavy bullets as the best combination for their particular hunting environment. Such a combination was not available for the Winchester Model 1894, and the 375 helps to meet the competition offered by lever actions chambered for the 35 Remington and the 444 Marlin. Comparisons will be made between this 375 and the other popular woods or brush cartridges such as the 35 Remington, 44 Magnum, 444 Marlin and the 45-70. Basically, the 444 Marlin with its 240-grain bullet and 2400 fps muzzle velocity has the edge on all the others in the group. However, all of these cartridges have one common failing, and that is that they are used in lever-action rifles with tubular magazines. This, in turn, requires a flat-nose bullet as a safety factor in the magazine so that under recoil, one cartridge won''t set off the one ahead of it. These blunt-point bullets have very poor aerodynamic from and offer high air resistance so that no matter what the initial velocity, they all slow down rapidly. The result is that at around 200 yards or less they all end up with about the same energy, which varies from 1000 foot pounds to a bit over 1100 foot pounds. All of these brush cartridges, then, are at their best ranges of 150 yards or less.\r\nCertainly the 375 Winchester is a fine deer or black bear cartridge and would probably also do well on heavier game such as moose or brown bear, within its range limitations. It would also serve as a good meat-getter on thin-skinned African species. The 375 cartridge can be chambered in 38-55 rifles, but must never be fired in any rifle except those specifically marked for it because it develops much higher pressure than the older 38-55, and to fire it in any of the old black-powder rifles would almost certainly result in a wrecked gun and possible injury to the shooter or bystanders.', ''),

(493629, ' 22LR - Cleaning Rod Accuracy Deficiency Culprit? \n \nIf you bought your 22LR rifle new, you may well know if you abused the bore in your activity to clean it. If you used a steel cleaning and you inserted it in the barrel from the muzzle end without any bore guide, you very likely may have damaged the bore by rubbing the metal rod against the precision cuts that made of lands and groves in the barrel. If you bought the rifle used, damage to the rifling is even more suspect as you lack knowledge how it was cared for by prior owner(s).\n \nIf you are getting poor results on the range, the culprit could be the crown of the barrel. Crown of the barrel refers to the land and groves of the barrel as they come to an end where the bullet leaves the barrel. It is important that the muzzle of the rifle be perpendicular to the bore. There is a very good reason for this essential symmetry. The rear end of the bullet need to exit the barrel such that the gunpowder gases behind it escape evenly from all around the bullet. If gases do not escape evenly, the flight path of the bullet start to depart from the intended direction. This could leads of lack of accuracy.\n \nA quick way to check the barrel crown is to examine it a under magnifying glass. The lands and groves at the muzzle end need to be sharp and crisp. If you find the condition deficient, barrel re-crowning may be in order. Unless the muzzle in real bad shape, putting it back in shape is not a very big deal. Even if you have to cut a bit of the barrel and re-crown it, the task is not too difficult. Here are two links that show you how you can accomplish this.\n\nRe-crown:  [URL]https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OorpZlG28fI[/URL]\nCut barrel & re-crown: [URL]https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b43odFm0mrI[/URL]', ''),

(493732, ' [QUOTE=Umair Bhaur;222196]Dear All,\n\nNice pics. I want to share some of the draw backs of Diana 54 airking. Its a costly gun and I feel that all should know the negative points of this gun before going into purchase it. \n\nPlease note that I mention these points with complete confidence and surety.\n\n1. Its heavy for some one who wants to shoot it from standing position.\n\n2. Its very accurate but to find all the potential accuracy you would have to scope it. And this is the most difficult thing to do. This gun is hardest on scopes. Even most of the airgun rated scopes do not last long on it. Many Leupolds fail. It is recoil less to the shooter but has the heaviest recoil on scope.\n\n3. The recoil on scope is even greater than Webley Patriot.\n\n4. Even costly scopes fail after a few hundred or few thousand shots.\n\n5. This gun and 48/52/56TH have the shortest spring lives among all Diana airguns. The average spring life is 4000 shots. Some last for just 1000 and some last for 7000 thousand. So when you buy this gun, be ready to acquire an extra spring.\n\n6. The best accuracy with this gun is in bench rest position. When you take a sharp angle, you would have to adjust the power of recoil less system.\n\n7. There is a sleeve of metal on the barrel. This sleeve needs to be kept tight. But some times it becomes loose which creates problem with accuracy.\n\n8. Peep Sight is the only best option for longer range targets. Sadly most of us in Pakistan dont use Peeps.\n\nI hope this much will help. I am always here to give as much information to all as I can.\n\nRegards,[/QUOTE]\n\nGood thoughts, brother. You have rightly pointed out the drawbacks. And these can be generalized to all high power air guns. I have been using air guns since my child hood. It''s been now more than 30 years. And from my personal experience I can second your observations. We should not expect power of a firearm from an air gun. Every technology has a limit. And these higher powered air guns are at upper end of the limit of this technology. To enjoy air gunning one should buy low or medium powered air guns like Diana 28 or 27. I prefer even Diana 24. They are light, easy to shoot, accurate, last longer, good for scope use, easy to maintain, have low noise, and safe. The above advantages of medium/low powered air guns are the very reasons one should opt for air gunning. If you want more energy then go for .22 rimfire rifles. People buy air guns and expect to kill deers or wild boars with them which is not the reality.', ''),

(493775, '38-55 Winchester &amp; Ballard Like the smaller 38-40, the 38-55 was originally a Ballard-developed target cartridge. The present commercial versions was introduced in 1884 as one of the calibers for the Ballard Perfection No. 4, which was originally chambered for the 38-50 Everlasting. According to Satterlee in his CATALOG OF FIREARMS, 2nd ed, DETROIT, 1939,the Union Hill No. 8 and 9 were also chambered for the 38-55 Ballard in 1884. The external dimensions of the 38-55 Everlasting and the 38-55 Winchester & Ballard are nearly identical, but the heavier, thicker Everlasting version was a hand-loading proposition. The implication in Saterlee''s book is that the original Everlasting case was introduced when Marlin Fire Arms Co. took over Ballard in 1881. The 38-55 Everlasting is nothing more than a 1/10-inch longer case than the 38-50 that Ballard introduced in 1876. The Marlin Model 93 and Winchester 94 lever-action repeaters were available in 38-55. Colt new Lightning slide action, Stevens, Remington and Winchester single shot rifles and also the Savage Model 99. No commercial rifles after Winchester dropped the 38-55 from the Model 94 list of calibers about 1940. However, the cartridge has been reintroduced by Winchester in several versions of the Model 94 in recent years. The 375 Winchester is based on the 38-55 case.\r\n\r\nThe 38-55 built up a reputation for fine accuracy at ranges out to 300 yards, it also developed a modest popularity with deer and black bear hunters, mostly in the woods and at moderate ranges. It gave good knockdown on deer-size animals with the 255-grain bullet at velocities of over 1500 fps. At one time, factory-loaded cartridges were available with the 255-grain bullet at a muzzle velocity of about 1700 fps. At these higher velocities, it is actually a better deer cartridge than 30-30. Present factory loading more or less duplicates the old black-powder ballistics and only by hand-loading can the full potential be developed. In the old Ballard and Stevens single shot rifles, it is not safe to use loads developing velocities over about 1500 fps. Discontinued in 1970, the 38-55 is again listed in Winchester ammunition catalogs. Proper bullet diameter for cast bullets is .379-inch.', ''),

The barrel fitting yes the tighter the tolerance of the slide to frame and the barrel lugs to the frame and slide the better the accuracy; however, one must then take into account the consideration of ftf due to fouling or dirt, this is why most combat handguns are loosely fitted ESPECIALLY THE WORLD RENOWNED AK47.

(493909, '38-40 Winchester The 38-40 developed by Winchester as a companion cartridge to their popular 44-40 case necked-down to what is actually 40-caliber (.401-inch). It was originally a black-powder cartridge chambered in the Winchester Model 73 lever action. Shortly after it came out, Colt began chambering revolvers for it. It was later offered in the Remington Model 14 1/2 slide action, Winchester 92 and Marlin 94 lever actions, plus a number of single shot rifles. No rifles have been chambered for the 38-40 since about 1937.\r\n\r\nThe 38-40 was at one time a fairly popular medium-power cartridge. Winchester used to load a high-velocity rifle version with a 180-grain bullet at 1775 fps. This was considered a pretty good short-range deer number, but was not intended for black-powder rifles or revolvers, and was discontinued because it caused a lot of trouble for people who never read labels. The present factory loading is strictly for revolvers, and it is necessary to hand-load in order to realize the full potential in a rifle. With proper load and bullets, the 38-40 can be used on small game, varmints, medium-size game or even deer at short range. Rifle loads should not be used in revolvers as they develop pressures beyond safe limits.\r\nThe 38-40 is bit much for most varmint and small game shooting and really not adequate for deer-size animals, and in any event , quite limited in its effective range on whatever you happen to be using it for. This lack of enthusiasm notwithstanding, the 38-40 enjoyed a certain popularity from its inception until about 1920, after which it declined in sales volume and was finally discontinued in 1937, or thereabouts. Actually, there is no great difference in performance between the 38-40 and the 44-40. although some considered the 38-40 a better cartridge for a woman or young boy because it had somewhat less recoil. Honestly, neither one has any great recoil.\r\nThe 38-40 probably made a better revolver cartridge than it did a rifle cartridge. The present factory load with the 180-grain bullet at 1160 fps (Winchester) can not be considered adequate for deer, and only by hand-loading can one achieve acceptable performance for much of anything.', ''),

(493950, ' Hi Guys,\r\nThe Intrepid Hunter!\r\nFrank was excited about his new rifle and decided to try bear hunting. He travelled up to Alaska, spotted a small brown bear and shot it. Soon after there was a tap on his shoulder, and he turned around to see a big black bear.\r\n\r\nThe black bear said, ''That was a very bad mistake. That was my cousin. I''m going to give you two choices. Either I maul you to death or let me have my lusty way.'' After considering briefly, Frank decided to accept the latter alternative. So the black bear had his way with Frank. Even though he felt sore for two weeks,\r\n\r\nFrank soon recovered and vowed revenge. He headed out on another trip to Alaska where he found the black bear and shot it dead.\r\n\r\nRight after, there was another tap on his shoulder. This time a huge grizzly bear stood right next to him.\r\nThe grizzly said, ''That was a big mistake, Frank. That was my cousin and you''ve got two choices: Either I maul you to death or let me have my lusty way.''\r\n\r\nAgain, Frank thought it was better to cooperate with the grizzly bear than be mauled to death. So the grizzly had his way with Frank. Although he survived, it took several months before Frank fully recovered.\r\n\r\nNow Frank was completely outraged, so he headed back to Alaska and managed to track down the grizzly bear and shot it. He felt sweet revenge, but then, moments later, there was a tap on his shoulder. He turned around to find a giant polar bear standing there. The polar bear looked at him and said…\r\n\r\n''Admit it Frank, you don''t come here for the hunting, do you?''!!!!', ''),

(494028, '416 Remington Magnum Officially announced in November, 1988, the 416 Remington is the first dangerous game cartridge introduced since the 458 Winchester Magnum back in 1956. Rifles and ammunition were not actually available in local gun stores until 1989. The 416 is based on the 8mm Remington Magnum necked-up to 416-caliber. It was initially available with either a 400-grain pointed soft-point or a 400-grain solid bullet loaded to a muzzle velocity of 2400 fps and a muzzle energy of 5115 fpe. The company says that the 400-grain solid is exactly that, turned from solid brass, and not a lead core with a heavy jacket. The cartridge is available in the Remington Model 700 Safari bolt-action rifles. It should prove to be a fairly popular cartridge.\r\n\r\nThere has been a persistent call by those who hunt dangerous game for a cartridge to fill the gap between the 375 H&H Magnum and the 458 Winchester. The 416 Rigby accomplished this rather well, but both rifles and ammunition became increasingly difficult to obtain. This problem was then solved to some extent by a number of wildcat cartridges such as the 416 Taylor, 416 Hoffman and the 425 Express. These cartridges all more or less duplicate the performance of the 416 Rigby, and the 416 Remington does pretty much the same thing. However, the Remington version has one great advantage in that is available as a commercial loading in a proven commercial rifle. The combination will be much easier and less expensive to come by than a custom rifle and wildcat or proprietary cartridges.\r\nAlthough the 416 bullet is 100 grains lighter than the 458 Winchester, it starts out with almost 300 fps higher velocity. That combined with better sectional density and a superior aerodynamic shape gives it certain ballistic advantages. It not only has a higher initial velocity, but it also increases its retained velocity over the 458 as the range increases. According to the factory figures, it has an 11 percent advantage in muzzle energy, and this increases to 18 percent at 100 yards and 30 percent at 200 yards. The 416 Remington should be ideal for any dangerous game including Cape buffalo, Elephant, Lion and North American brown bears. It would also do well on moose and elk, although possibly somewhat overpowering for most North American hunting requirements. The 416 Remington has a trajectory very similar to the 375 H&H and is better long-range cartridge than the 458 Winchester for use against soft-skinned game. For the man who has to travel light, the 416 Remington would be a good one-gun cartridge choice for use in Africa.', ''),

In the game of cartridge one-upmanship, the Weatherby version was bound to be somewhat more powerful than an ordinary factory 416. 416 Weatherby push a 400-grain bullet at a muzzle velocity of 2700 fps, which generates 6476 fpe.\r\n\r\nThe 416 Weatherby has over 300 fps higher initial velocity than the Remington with the same bullet weight, and so is a more powerful cartridge. How useful this will be in the field is difficult to assess, because both cartridges are adequate for the intended purpose, which is to dispatch large and/or dangerous game with minimum of fuss. On the other hand, Weatherby rifles carry a certain prestige and there is nothing wrong with having a little extra power when the moment of truth arrives. The choice between the two will probably be a matter of personal preference.', ''),

What is important that you should be a Pakistani national i.e. should have an NIC, than you can have a gun license.\n\nGetting a license through a dealer is advisable as it is easier. But if you have some reliable contact inside the ministry than it can be done directly also. Doing it yourself without an inside contact will be a big hassle as the process is too complicated.\n\nThere are cheater dealers out there but there are reliable dealers also. Whenever you decide to go for your license check the forum, consult senior members & you will be guided to some one who will not cheat you. You see there are big names in gun market of every major city who will not cheat a prospective client as they value their market repo. more. As for the cost, you should ask this question when you finally decide to come, who knows what will be the cost of a license in say 5 or 10 years.\n\nWho told you that MOI licenses does''nt need to be renewed. Every type of license has a specific expiry date and on reaching that date you will have to renew it. What you can do is get them renewed for multiple years, say 3 years or 5 years or whatever period you fancy. This option is available in both MOI & provincial licenses (other than MOI card type license, its renewal is still a big confusion). By the way MOI will cost couple of k''s more than provincial.\n\nAt the moment in 60 k''s you can have different Turkish variants as well as Russian & Chinese. If you increase around 10 to 15 k than you will have Taurus as well as Stoeger option available also. But i would suggest that you should ask that question at the time of your return as who knows where dollar will be in 5 or 10 years & what will be the prices of handguns than.\n\nHave fun', ''),

There are laws regarding the number of birds one can shoot, but one net (with the tape recorder) can wreak havoc with the local bird population in the immediate area. I think conservationists should focus more on prohibiting such inhumane activity rather than on banning autoloader shotguns and such like policies. After all, how many birds can one take down in a day if you are giving the bird a fair chance to take flying shots.\r\n\r\nAlso, what are your kind opinions on the ETHICAL number of birds hunted? Personally I think one should only shoot enough to cater to the meal of the hunting party and some spare change, and not devastate the entire populace. \r\n\r\nSince we are responsible members, I think we should also undertake efforts to restore the population numbers of the game, else our children will have nothing left at this rate. \r\n\r\nComments/Opinions?', ''),

(494149, ' 22LR - Rifle Scope\n \nCustomarily, rifles come from the factory with iron sights. Some makers offer their rifles with no sights for those buyers who do not care to have iron sights but do want to equip them with optical sights.\n \nIron sights offer one key advantage over all other types of rifle sights - wider filed of view. Field of view is the width of the area you see in front of you as you aim the rifle at your target at a given distance. This field of view differs from one person to another. Some shoot with both eyes open but with one eye aiming at the target. A “double-eye” shooter will have a wider view than the same shooter with one eye at the target and the other eye closed.\n \nAn optical sight with magnification (some optical sights offer no magnification) makes the target appear closer as compared to the naked eye. This is a definite advantage to the shooter. Another advantage is that the shooter does not have to align three points in the same plane - the target, front sight and the rear sight. With a scope-equipped rifle, the shooter simply aims the crosshair on the target and shoots. The big handicap of scope is that the magnification takes away the wider field of view that iron sights offer. For a given scope, as you increase the magnification, the filed of view becomes narrower. Most scope manufacturers state the field of view in the number of feet at 100 yards or in the number of meters viewed at 100 meters.\n \nAfter considering the pros and cons of iron an optical sights, you may be in favor of equipping the your rifle with a scope. There are countless makes and models available in the marketplace with differing features. A key consideration is the budget limit. In general as the price goes up, so goes the quality and features of the scope.\n \nBe fully aware that with some scopes as you increase the magnification, you also increase the width of the reticle (crosshair). These scope are called the first focal plane type. A good example in this category is the Bushnell Elite Tactical scope - model ET6245F. With the second focal plane scopes the reticle retains the same thickness regardless of the magnification setting. An example in this category is the Bushnell Elite 6500 - model 654305MD.\n \nMany shooters are attracted to the Mil-Dot style of reticle scopes. Mil-Dot is an angular measurement  - one meter at a distance is 1,000 meters. Not all Mil-Dot scopes are true Mil-Dots. True Mil-Dot scopes have the reticle and the elevation and wind adjustment knobs/turrets calibrated in Mil-Dots. The Bushnell Elite Tactical model ET6245F is a true mil-dot-Mil-Dot scope. Other Mil-Dot scopes offer the reticle calibration in Mil-Dots but the elevation and wind adjustment knobs/turrets are calibrated in MOA - or minute of angle. One example of this type is the Bushnell 6500, model 654305MD. For relative reference, one MOA is about 1.047 inch at 100 yards. One Mil- Dot at 100-yard distance is about 3.6 inches.\n \nA rifle equipped with a scope encourages the shooter to reach out farther than with iron sights. If shooting paper targets, feel free to shoot as far as you like as long you have a safe backdrop. On the other hand if you are hunting with a 22LR, keep in mind what ethics dictate - shoot only at a distance where you are confident to kill the game and not simply injure it. All rifles have limitation and the 22LR is no exception. Keep your hunting distance within reason.', ''),

(494158, '44-40 Winchester This was the original cartridge for the famous Winchester Model 1873 lever-action repeating rifle. Shortly after its introduction, Colt was offering revolvers in 44-40 caliber. At one time or another, just about every American arms manufacturer has offered some kind of gun chambered for this cartridge. The Colt-Burgess lever-action rifle of 1883 was made for the 44-40 and so was the 1885 Colt Lightning slide-action rifle. The Remington Model 14 1/2 slide-action used it, as did the Winchester 92 and Marlin 94, both lever-action repeaters. Most of the single shot rifles made in the U.S. had a 44-40 model at one time or another. In Spain, they manufactured a copy of Winchester Model 92 in 44-40 caliber for police and civil guard use. No American-made rifles have chambered the round since 1937, but Colt revolvers retained it until 1942. Several foreign-made replicas of the Henry Carbine and the Winchester Model 66 and 73 are currently available in 44-40 caliber.\r\n\r\nThe 44-40 is one of the all-time great American cartridges. It is said that it has killed more game, large and small, and more people, good and bad, than any other commercial cartridge ever developed. In its original black-powder loading, it was the first effective combination in rifle or revolver, and was a great favorite in the early days of the American West.\r\nWith the 200-grain soft-point bullet at a muzzle velocity of around 1800 fps, it is a far better short-range deer cartridge than the 30-30, particularly in heavy brush. It was made obsolete in the revolver by the 357 and 44 Magnums, and in the rifle by 30-30 and similar cartridges that have a flatter trajectory at ranges beyond 100 yards. Present factory loads by Remington and Winchester are intended for revolvers and it is necessary to hand-load in order to get top performance from the rifle. Many 44-40 rifles have been re-barreled to the 44 Magnum, but this destroys any collector value the gun may have.', ''),

(494181, '221 Remington Fire Ball The cartridge was introduced early in 1963 for the Remington XP-100, a single shot pistol of modern bolt-action design based on a shortened, lightened version of the 700 series rifle action. The pistol has a streamlined nylon-plastic stock, ventilated sight ramp and adjustable sights. This is the first handgun made by Remington since the 41-caliber double derringer and their pocket automatic were discontinued back in 1935. The Thompson/Center Contender is also available in 221 Remington.\r\n\r\nThe 221 Fire Ball follows the modern design in 22-caliber high-velocity pistol cartridges for small game and varmint hunting at long range. The rimless case is a shortened version of the 222 Remington. The cartridge is well adapted to rifles, but no long arms are on the market for it. The bullet is designed for quick expansion on small animals and is very deadly at all practical ranges. The XP-100 pistol has a 10-inch barrel and is intended for scope use. It is capable of 100-yard groups as small as an inch or less when fitted with a scope and fired from a rest. It is quite a bit more powerful than the older 22 Remington Jet. Gas leakage and various extraction problems have plagued efforts to develop high-velocity revolvers, and the result has been the design of single shot types with a completely sealed breech. Proper bullet diameter is .224-inch of this cartridge.', ''),

It is also accepted in Africa as the minimum for dangerous game (elephant, buffalo, lion, leopard etc). Loaded with 220/230grn bullets flat shootin;. with 300grn good for dangerous species if you do your bit.\n\nOn short/medium/long range - based on my experience I would say that if 300m is ''short'' range then the majority of people would not be able to hit a target consistently on a regular basis - I know very few hunters who would take such shots on quarry as a huge part of ''the game'' is to use your skills (read the wind, use cover etc) to get as close as possible to the quarry to ensure a clean (one-shot) kill. .........and yes there are plenty of ''open spaces'' on the ''small island'' called the UK..............but we still strive to minimise the distance.\n\nL[/QUOTE]\nAbsolutely correct. Though the choice varies from person to person, for hunting reasons I consider upto 100m as short range, 100 to 300m as medium range and beyond 300 m as long range.', ''),

(494302, '7mm Nambu Manufactured for the Japanese "Baby" Nambu Semi-auto pistol, which was introduced about 1920. It was not an official Japanese military cartridge, but was specially made for high-ranking officers required to purchase their side-arms. The 7mm Nambu pistol is more or less a scaled-down version of the original model Nambu, which was developed about 1904. The 7mm Nambu pistol was something of a mystery until after WWII, when quantities were brought back by returning soldiers. The 7mm Nambu cartridge is still largely a collector''s item and the pistols are also scarce.\r\n\r\nBy Western standards, the 7mm Nambu would not be considered an adequate combat or self-defense cartridge. For sporting use, it would be effective on small game or birds only. The pistol, which resembles the German Luger, has a seven-shot magazine, 3 1/4-inch barrel, weighs only 16 ounces, and is extremely well made of good material and finish. The 1963 (17th) edition of GUN DIGEST includes an article by Roy D. Strengholt that covers the 7mm Nambu pistol and cartridge in considerable detail. The ammunition can be made by cutting off and reforming 30 M1 Carbine brass. The bullet is Lyman #280468 with the mould blocks milled down to the front grease groove to provide a shorter, lighter bullet. Charge is 1.8 grains of Bullseye. Any 7mm (.283-inch) bullet of 50 to 60 grains weight can be used.', ''),

(494315, '44 Magnum (Rifle) The 44 Magnum was originally introduced in 1955 as a handgun cartridge for the heavy-frame Smith & Wesson Model 29 revolver. Its potential as rifle cartridge was recognized almost immediately, and many Model 92 Winchester lever-action rifles and carbines were privately re-barreled and altered to handle 44 Magnum. The first commercial rifle to chamber the round was the Ruger Model 44 semi-auto carbine announced in 1961. Universal created the slide-action Vulcan on an M1 carbine receiver for the 44 Magnum. A few years later, the Marlin Model 336 lever-action was available in 44 Magnum, and in 1967 Remington brought out their Model788 bolt-action in the same caliber. Both of these rifles were discontinued after only a few years due to poor sales records. Winchester briefly offered the Model 94 in 44 Magnum. At the present time, there are only three 44 Magnum rifles available: the Marlin Model 1894S, the Rossi Model 92 SRC, both lever-action repeaters, and the Thompson/Center Contender Carbine. Factory ammunition is loaded to handgun pressure levels, but most companies offer jacketed soft- or hollow-point bullets for use in rifles. When fired from a revolver, the 240-grain 44 Magnum bullet develops a muzzle velocity of 1470 fps (depending on barrel length), but in a rifle it will leave the barrel at around 1800 fps.\r\n\r\nThe 44 Magnum rifle has established a good reputation as deer and black bear cartridge, and many hunters consider it superior to the 30-30 at ranges of 100 yards or less. It is a good brush or timber cartridge, and its popularity is due in part to the short, light, handy carbines that constitute the principal arms that chamber it. A number of daring souls has taken grizzly bear, polar bear, elk, moose, etc. with the 44 Magnum revolver, and anything the revolver is capable of. The rifle will do somewhat better because of increased velocity and energy. Despite this, the 44 Magnum rifle is primarily a short-range deer and black bear cartridge. There is good variety of bullets available for hand-loading, and when loaded with the lighter bullets of around 180 to 200-grains, the 44 Magnum rifle will double as a very effective short-range varmint gun. It is popular for Western coyote or bobcat hunting in which the average range dosen''t exceed 125 to 150 yards. With a scope sight and a good single-shot or bolt-action, the 44 Magnum is capable of excellent accuracy.', ''),

(494319, 'Here u got Loki Bro. 375 Holland & Holland Magnum\r\n\r\n    Originated by the British firm Holland & Holland and introduced in1912, this is one of the original belted, rimless, magnum-type cartridges and has been used as the basis for numerous wildcats and some of the Weatherby cartridges. H&H furnished it in a magnum Mauser action and Griffin & Howe chambered rifles for it beginning about 1926. The Western Cartridge Company offered it in 1925 and, at present, Remington and Winchester load the 375. The first commercial rifle of American make to chamber the round was the Model 70 Winchester in 1937, Weatherby rifles were at one time available in 375 H&H, on order, as was the Remington Model 725 "Kodiak". At present, several American manufacturers list the 375 H&H as standard.\r\n\r\n    Long considered the best all-round African caliber, the 375 H&H is perhaps a bit overpowered for North American big game. However, many Alaskan hunters and guides prefer it for moose and grizzly bear. It isn''t a very flexible cartridge for the American hunter unless he expects to hunt the heaviest species and perhaps spend some time in Africa or Asia. John Taylor, in his very fine AFRICAN RIFLES AND CARTRIDGES, Georgetown, South Carolina, 1948, rates the 375 as the best of the medium bores for African hunting. It is his candidate for the most effective, "all-round" cartridge.', ''),

(494321, '7.62mm Russian Nagant Revolver The military revolver cartridge adopted by Russia in 1895 and used in the Nagant and Pieper revolvers, which were both seven-shot guns as opposed to the usual chambers of American and British revolvers. The Nagant design is unique in that when the hammer is cocked, the cylinder moves forward and the chamber extends over the barrel to form a gas seal. the gain in velocity from this arrangement is small and no other revolver ever used the system.\r\n\r\nRussian Nagant revolvers have been sold in moderate quantities at various times, but are more a collector''s itme than a practical weapon. Ammunition in shooting quantities is difficult to find, but can be made from 32-20 WCF cases, which are very similar. Power and effectiveness are about the same as the 32 S&W Long. Some versions of the cartridge have the bullet seated completely inside the case mouth. Velocity of the 108-grain bullet in the Nagant revolver is about 1100 fps, but the conventional Pieper revolver delivers only 725 fps. Bullet diameter is .295-inch and the Lyman #311441GC (115 grains) can be used for loading in front of 2.5 grains of 231 powder. This develops about 750 fps.', ''),
(494322, '30 (7.63mm) Mauser Developed by American gun designer Hugo Borchardt for the first successful commercial, automatic pistol. The Borchardt pistol was made by Ludwig Loewe & Co. (later DWM) of Berlin, Germany. Both pistol and cartridge were introduced in 1893. The Borchardt automatic pistol was later re-designed and emerged as the well-known Luger pistol. This cartridge was used by Paul Mauser for his Model 1896 pistol and than increased in power for his more rugged design. It has been used mainly in the Mauser military automatic pistol and various imitations or copies manufactured in Spain and China.\r\n\r\nUntil the 357 Magnum revolver cartridge came along, the 30 Mauser was the high-velocity champion of the pistol world. It has a flat trajectory that makes long-range hits possible, but lacks stopping power on man or heavy animals because of the light, full-jacketed bullet. However, it has been used successfully for hunting small to medium game and varmints at moderate pistol ranges. If hand-loaded with soft-point or hollow-point hunting  bullets, its performance can be improved a good deal. It has never been a very popular cartridge in the U.S. due to the clumsy Mauser pistol and the high cost of ammunition.', ''),

(494339, '444 Marlin News and data on the 444 Marlin round was released to the public in June, 1964. However, as is usual in such cases, the rifle and ammunition were not available in sporting goods stores until some months later. the cartridge was designed for the Marlin Model 336 lever-action rifle. Initially, the rifle was manufactured with a 24-inch Micro-Groove barrel, two-thirds magazine and recoil pad. The straight-grip stock has a Monte Carlo cheek-piece. Original ammunition made by Remington and the head is marked "444 Marlin."\nThe 444 Marlin is amazingly similar to the 44 Van Houten Super. The 44 VH was developed by E.B. Van Houten and "Lucky" wade of Phoenix, Arizona. It was made by necking-up 30-4- Krag brass, trimming it to 2 inches and turning down the rim slightly. It was designed for the 336 Marlin or 94 Winchester actions. It predates the Marlin round by at least 3 years. Ballistics of the two rounds are nearly identical.\n\nThe 44 Magnum revolver cartridge achieved a certain popularity as a rifle round. Although it makes a good brush buster, anyone using it discovers quite quickly that it has a rather high trajectory, and its killing power on the heavier game such as elk or moose is not always up to what some writers claim. Consequently, there was need for a somewhat more powerful version. The 444 Marlin will extend both the effective range and killing power inherent in the 44 Magnum. The new round fires the same 240-grain soft-point bullet, but at a reported 2400 fps as compared to 1850 for the average 44 Magnum rifle. The 444 Marlin is substantially more powerful than the old 30-30 or the 35 Remington at short ranges. It develops about the same energy as the 348 Winchester and slightly more than the later 358 Winchester. However, with its larger diameter bullet it should provide better knock-down power. It is a short- to medium-range cartridge and should be effective for any North American big game. It would also be effective on most thin-skinned African game, except dangerous varieties. Its advantage over the above-named cartridges is all at ranges out to about 150 yards. Beyond that, due to better bullet shape and sectional density, they all catch up to and finally surpass the 444 in retained velocity and energy.', ''),

Why not do a good deed and introduce them to your 22LR and the hobby of sports shooting. Once they get the introduction, they may want to venture into 22LR hunting. If they show such interest, by all means take them out in the field with the 22LR.\n \nYour friends are likely to catch the &#8220;22LR virus&#8221; when you give them the sermon When critical time arrives, be prepared to answer their questions about capabilities of the 22LR, monetary investment required to acquire a 22LR rifle and cost of ammunition. Save your own reputation by doing your homework in gathering the needed information. If the make and model of your 22LR has given you satisfaction, suggest this make model to your new convert. Stay away from &#8220;crazy&#8221; futuristic-look 22LRs. Stick to suggesting well-established brand names that have a reputation of quality and reliability. Bolt-action design should be the recommended choice. If you are called upon to name names, feel free to recommend Brno and CZ. These two makes have reputation beyond question.\n \nIf budget is a factor, suggest a used 22LR over a new one. A good condition, quality-built 22LR would be a better choice over a new one that carries an &#8220;iffy&#8221; brand name. If your friends are looking to save money by buying used 22LRs, make sure you do a thorough job of inspection and selection for them. Your name is stake in your endavour to move their thinking to not only your side but also to the sides of all of us that have a relationship with the 22LRs. Please do no let us down.\n \nGo forth into this world and preach the 22LR sermon to friends and relatives alike. And, one last word - do not forget to give our hearty welcome to the new converts.', ''),

(494512, '45-70 U.S. Government Adopted by the U.S. military in 1873 with the single shot "Trapdoor" Springfield rifle, it continued as the official service cartridge for 19 years, and then was replaced in 1892 by the 30-40 Krag. It was also a popular cartridge for sporting use and many repeating and single shot rifles ere chambered for it-- the Remington rolling block, Remington Keene, Remington-Lee, Marlin Model 81, Winchester Model 86 and Hotchkiss, plus many others. Rifles of this caliber were discontinued in 1930s, but are currently available again. Though the Krag officially replaced the 45-70 in 1892, all volunteer Spanish-American war regiments-- with the reported sole exception being TR''s Rough Riders-- were equipped with the Trapdoor 45-70. Many state militias were armed with the 45-70 Springfield''s well beyond 1900. the Minnesota National Guard is reported to have reported to have disposed of almost 1000 45-70 rifles in or about 1940. American companies dropped the 45-70 a s a rifle caliber in the early 1930''s. However, it has major comeback in popularity, and currently Marlin, Ruger and Browning chamber rifles for the 45-70. Indeed, there are also handguns in 45-70 these days.\r\n\r\n"Old soldiers never die" and apparently neither do old military cartridges. the 45-70 has been with us for over 100 years and is still very much alive. as a short-range woods or brush cartridge for anything from deer to grizzly bear, the 45-70 will still hold its own with most of our more modern developments. Its greatest fault is in the matter of a rather curved trajectory that makes it difficult to place shots beyond about 150 yards with any certainty. Unfortunately, the U.S. Springfield and most of the other Black-powder rifles won''t stand pressures over 25,000 psi or so, and this prevents the use of heavy loads of smokeless powder. In late Model 86 Winchester or other smokeless powder rifles, the 45-70 can be loaded to deliver very impressive knock-down on our heaviest species of big game.', ''),

(494540, '458 Winchester The 458 Winchester was introduced in 1956 for a dressed-up version of the Model 70 rifle called the "African." The Remington 700 Safari is available in 458 and so are many other American- and European-made rifles such as the A-Square , Dakota76, BRNO and the Ruger 77. The 458 has become a world standard and many factories and individual makers provide hunting arms for it. Ruger also chambers the 548 in their No. 1 single shot rifle.\r\n\r\nWith the increasing number of American sportsmen making the trek to Africa, and with the Weatherby Magnum line of cartridges selling rather well, Winchester decided to get into the act. The result is the fine 458, a load perfectly suitable for any of the most dangerous game in the world. This cartridge has been tested rather thoroughly in Africa and has proven itself adequate for the toughest game found there. It is actually as powerful as most of the over-sized English big-bore elephant cartridges. Although overpowered for North American big game, it has nonetheless found favor with many hunters as a woods and brush cartridge when re-loaded with lighter than standard factory charges. With the 300- 350- or 405-grain bullets, it can be loaded to duplicate the 45-70 at any level, and to cover a wide range of game and hunting conditions. As factory loaded, it is not much good for anything but the biggest and toughest, but then that is what it was intended for.', ''),

(494591, '7.63mm (7.65) Mannlicher This, a straight rimless cartridge, was used in the model 1900, 1901 and 1905 Mannlicher military automatics. They were manufactured by Steyr in Austria and were also made in Spain. Those made in Austria are well made and finished, but the Spanish types are sometimes of doubtful quality. These pistols have been sold in military surplus stores and some dealers also had ammunition.\r\n\r\nThe 1900 and slightly-modified 1901 and 1905 Mannlicher pistols operate on the delayed blow-back system.  The magazine is in the handle or grip and holds eight (1905, 10) rounds. However, they are loaded from the top by means of a special charger, after retracting the slide. The magazine is not detachable. The 7.63 cartridge is only slightly more powerful than the .32 ACP, and its use in the field would have to be confined to small game or birds. There is also a locked-breach Model 1903 Mannlicher auto pistol that fires a cartridge similar to the bottle-necked 7.63 Mauser, only not so heavily loaded. The standard Mauser cartridge must not be fired in these Model 1903 pistols, as that will quickly damage the action.', ''),

Standing in lines or in crowded areas, someone will notice you have a gun, then try to grab it from its holster and run.\n\n If you could maintain the required distance, at least they couldn''t shoot you or any others nearby with the gun.  It wouldn''t be of any use until someone took it apart and disabled the interlock.\n\n Any interlock system would have to default to "fire" if it failed or the battery ran down, though.

(494680, ' Salam All,\nSir, basically on the net you will find many ideas regarding checking of barrel use.  I am NOT a follower of any. I basically when purchasing a weapon look down the barrel to see if there are any rust pits and to see if there are any lands or grooves chipped or worn away to a point where the bore looks smooth and thats it.  Scratches UNLESS very deep (called gouges) do not matter to me.  Buldges in the barrel though very uncommon because the gun will not really cycle is another thing.  If you can remove the barrel, remove it and check the link area for dents, dings, breaks or cracks or chips - same applies to the locking top lugs.  Nothing else, if the barrel is rusty on the inside and no visible pits I may fire the weapon to get rid of the rust.  There really is no formula in MY book for this; just proper observation and guesstimation.  \nDos and Don''ts...  lolz, another subject which does vary in care of the Taurus over the other old colt style 1911s.  The Taurus 1911s have some disadvantages to them by my standards.  For one, most 1911 dropin accessories do not fit it, like the hammer, or the rear sight, the manufacturing process of the frame....   soooooo, don''t drop the gun on the frame, don''t change parts, keep it oiled LIGHTLY, and enjoy as its a great range gun with a lot of the doodads which I order and then get put on on other 1911s.  \nIn the world of 1911s, there is SOOOOOOOOOOOO much more; I will say this welcome to the club - you will NEVER be leaving it.', ''),

(494719, '460 Weatherby Magnum This big, potent load was brought out in 1958 for the avowed purpose of providing the world''s most powerful commercial rifle cartridge. It was developed by necking the 378 Weatherby case up to 45-caliber. Rifles and ammunition are available only through Weatherby, Inc, on a commercial basis, but custom-made rifles based on Mauser-type bolt actions are occasionally chambered for this round.\r\n\r\nThe 460 WM, actually 458-caliber, has taken over the title of the world''s most powerful commercial cartridge formerly held by the British 600 Nitro Express. The 460 WM develops 8245 foot pounds of muzzle enrgy while the 600 Nitro churns up a mere 7600. The big 460 has no sensible use for any North American big game, but it does provide that ultimate bit of insurance against the dangerous African or Asiatic varieties under adverse conditions. It would, of course, be preferable to be caught slightly over-gunned than to be eaten by a Lion or trampled  by an Elephant. In any event, for the man who insists on the biggest and the most of everything, the 460 WM is definitely the most powerful. Two wildcat cartridges, the 450 and 475 Ackley, and possibly one or two others, are in the same class as the 460 WM insofar as energy is concerned, and the 475 A&M Magnum reportedly develops a muzzle energy of 10,000 foot pounds.

(494737, '30 (7.65mm) Luger Introduced in 1900 by Deutsche Waffen, Munitions Fabriken in Germany. The 7.65mm was the original cartridge for the Luger automatic pistol, a modification of the Borchardt, designed by the American with that name. The cartridge is still used chiefly in the Luger pistol, although some SIG, Beretta M951 and Walther P .38 pistols are chambered for this round.\r\n\r\nThis is another rimless, bottle-necked cartridge, similar to the 30 Mauser, but shorter and not quote as powerful. It is not noted for great stopping power because of the small-diameter, light-weight, full-jacketed bullet. It is used occasionally for small game hinting and will do a fair job on rabbits and the like, provided the bullets are properly placed. For self defence, it leaves much to be desired because a man can absorb quite a few poorly-placed bullets without being put out of action.', ''),

As per my studies of that book the both chapters contains hunting calibers, though, MILITARY RIFLE CARTRIDGES is another chapter, that I think would be not allowed to discuss on the forum. So, now your suggestion required, that may I start another threads for the 2 above mentioned "Sporting rifle cartridges" or should I carry on with this thread.\r\nWaiting for your reply.\r\nRegards.', ''),

(494740, '7.65mm MAS (French) A  military cartridge used in the French Model 1935A and 35-S auto pistols and Model 1938 sub-machine gun,. It was replaced in 1950 by the 9mm Parabellem (Luger) cartridge and an improved pistol. However, it is still used to a limited extent in both military and police work. Quite few of these pistols have been sold as war surplus. They are of Colt-Browning-type design, but do not have the grip safety.\r\n\r\nThe 7.65mm French MAS pistol cartridge must not be confused with the Luger or Browning cartridges of similar caliber designations. It has an elongated, straight case, actually a copy of the 30 Pederson round. It is slightly more powerful than the 32 ACP, but not sufficiently so to make it anything but a small game number for field use. For self defense, it would be a little better than the 32 ACP, but not any better than the 380 ACP or as effective as the 9mm Luger. For loading, any 30-caliber bullet of up to 100 grains can be used.', ''),

(494795, '7.65mm Roth-Sauer The 7.65mm Roth-Sauer originated in 1901 as one of the calibers for the Frommer pocket-type auto pistol. About 1905, the Roth-Sauer pistol was adopted to a somewhat reduced loading of the Frommer cartridge. Due to the popularity of the Roth-Sauer pistol, the name became attached to the cartridge. Winchester loaded the round during the 1920s, but it has been obsolete since about 1930.\r\n\r\nThe eight-shot Roth-sauer pistol was of the pocket-, or self defense, type. Despite the low power of the cartridge, the pistol had a complicated long-recoil locked breech. Its 7.65mm cartridge looks like the 32 ACP, but has a shorter case and a bullet of slightly smaller diameter, (.301-inch). The 70- to 74-grain bullet has a muzzle velocity of 1070 fps, which means it develops a bit more energy than the 32 ACP. Regardless, both are in the same class and there isn''t enough difference to get excited about. It is possible to make 7.65mm R-S ammo from 32 ACP cases by turning down the rim, shortening and reforming. 2 grains of Bullseye constitutes a proper load.', ''),

(494830, '32 Smith &amp; Wesson Designed for the Smith & Wesson Model 1 1/2, hinged-frame, single-action revolver introduced in 1878, the 32 S&W is an old and very popular cartridge, widely used in the U.S. and in Europe for low-priced, pocket-type revolvers. Originally a black-powder cartridge, it has been loaded with smokeless powder exclusively since about 1940. In the U.S., Colt, Harrington & Richardson, Hopkins & Allen, Iver Johnson, Smith & Wesson and others have made various light revolvers for this cartridge. In England, Webley & Scott made revolvers for it and in Europe the Bayard and Pickert revolvers, plus many odd brands, chambered it.\r\n\r\nThe 32 S&W probably ranks along with the 32 ACP in general popularity, and for the same reason. It is rather low powered and adaptable to small, light, cheap, pocket-type handguns. Ballistically it is not quite as good as the 32 ACP, but it is about equally effective because of the lead bullet used. It is very similar to the 32 Short Colt, but the two are not interchangeable due to a difference in bullet and case diameter. Like the 32 ACP, the 32 S&W is about the minimum caliber for serious self defense and is considered inadequate for police work. It is used occasionally for hunting birds and small game at very short ranges, but is too under-powered for consideration as a sporting cartridge.', ''),

It was the first used in the Webley revolver, but later a number of other British and European pocket-type weapons chambered it. The 320 served as the inspiration for the 32 short Colt, and some 320 revolvers will accept the Colt round. At last check, it was still loaded in Europe. At one time, it was also manufactured in the U.S., but discontinued in the late 1920s.\r\n\r\nThe 320 Revolver is so nearly identical to the 32 Short Colt that what has been said about that round will serve here too.

(494847, 'Review of UTAS 15. (the ugly beast) My new addition to the arsenal UTAS 15. before i go on the review of this shotgun, i saw two threads its been discussed here. some members have seen at zamzama store, and found it very expensive for a shotgun. As it was said to be sold i guess for 250k :O... nop man, this is for 150k max. \n\nThe specs are as:\n\nCaliber\n12 Gauge, 3” / 76mm chamber\n\nType\nManually operated, pump action\n\nOverall length\n720 mm\n\nBarrel length\n470 mm\n\nWeight, empty\n2.8 kg\n\nMagazine capacity\n7 + 7 (70mm shells) or 6 + 6 (76mm Magnum shells)\n\nthe gun is now internationally recognized as the designer is from USA, it is much appreciated in US aswell, and 15 12guage shells is massive firepower for home or self defence. I support polymer and carbon firearms from glocks to Czs... this beast is also in fiber and polymer and very high grade material is used to reduce the weight and the balanced gun. \n\nthe best feature i love about this gun is pump action, it smooth and very light, semi auto in my experience jam at some stage or an other esp with local shaheen rounds. it has a built in laser system. one push button. and yes there is leaver on top of the gun, which gives three modes, you can change to which magazine you want to use. e.g u can put 7 buckshots in right and in left you can put 7 slugs. you have the option to choose manually or bring that leaver in center and now the gun with throw mix shells, means combination of buckshots and slugs.... massive POWER!! \n\nthe iron sights are pretty good, but it also have rail for mounting tactical scopes. Also comes with extended barrel which is pretty good for hunting bores and stuff....Also comes with a very nice bag.  and most of all its different in look which is a pretty good change. I found its external hardware and frame solid and balanced. \n\nWhat i dont like about the gun?\n-its still expensive as its a Turkish gun. \n-the designs shows its some AA12 kinda shit, but one gets disappointed when you come to know this is even not semi auto. \n-Mag capacity cant be increased as in Saiga 12 (drum mag)\n- there is no place designed for tactical light. Only laser is built in and scope of any sort could be mounted. \n\nSince its a shotgun there is no put giving a range report lol. and using hotspot watch this review on youtube:(Shows shooting of this gun aswel)\n[URL]http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_o3YsUVAyQ[/URL]', ''),

(494997, '308 Winchester Introduced by Winchester as a new sporting cartridge in 1952, the 308 is nothing more than the U.S. T-56 or the NATO 7.62x51mm military round. This was a very smart move, to tack the Winchester name on what was sure to become a popular sporting number. Unfortunately, American manufacturers don''t always exhibit this much imagination. Practically all American and European high-powered sporting rifles are chambered for the 308 since it will work through the medium- or standard-lenght action. The Model 70 bolt-action and 88 lever-action Winchester were the first American sporting rifles chambered. It was adopted as the official U.S. military rifle cartridge in 1954, although weapons for it were not ready until 1957. It is used in the M14. However, it has been replaced by the 5.56mm NATO as the official U.S. military cartridge.\r\n\r\nIn power, the 308 Winchester is superior to the 300 Savage and almost equal to the 30-06. It delivers about 100 fps less muzzle velocity than the larger 30-06 with any given bullet weight. The factories used a special ball-type powder in loading the 308, and it was difficult for the hand-loader to equal factory ballistics with the powders then available. However, Winchester-Western Ball powders are now available in canister lots; shotshell and pistol powders have been on the market for some time. Most authorities consider the 308 suitable for most North American big game, although it''s on the light side for moose or big brown bear.', ''),

(494966, '222 Remington Magnum The 222 Remington magnum was originally developed as an experimental military cartridge in a cooperative effort between Remington and Springfield Arsenal, for use in lightweight semi- and full-automatic combat rifles. Since it was never adopted by the military, Remington introduced it as a sporting round in 1958 as one of the calibers for their Model 722 bolt-action rifle, and also for a time in the later 700 series bolt-action rifles. At present, no Remington rifles are available in this caliber. None of the major American sporting arms manufacturing companies offer 222 Remington Magnum among their choice of calibers. However, a few of the European manufacturers will chamber it on order, as will the makers of custom rifles.\r\n\r\nIn comparison to the 222 Remington, the magnum version has about 20 percent greater case capacity, and consequently delivers 100 or so fps higher muzzle velocity and an effective range of between 50 and 75 yards greater than the 223 Remington and the performance of these two is very nearly identical. The 222 Magnum is nearly 1/10-inch longer than the 223 in overall case length and it is also slightly longer in body length. As a result, the two are not inter-changeable, and although the 223 can be chambered in a 222 Magnum rifle, a dangerous head-space condition exists and case rupture is certain to occur if the round is fired. The 222 Remington Magnum is every bit as accurate as the standard 222 or 223 and is certainly adequate for anything up to, but not including, deer. It never achieved the popularity of the standard 222 and has been largely superseded by the 223 Remington. It is, nevertheless, a very fine long-range varmint cartridge.', ''),

(494982, '223 Remington The 223 Remington first appeared in 1957 as an experimental military cartridge for the Armalite AR-15 assault rifle. In 1964, it was officially adopted by the U.S. Army as the 5.56mm Ball cartridge Ma93. It is used in the selective-fire M16 rifle, which is based on the original AR-15 design. The cartridge was actually the work of Robert Hutton, who was technical editor of GUNS & AMMO magazine and had a rifle range i n Topanga Canyon, California. One of the requirements for the cartridge was that the projectile have a retained velocity in excess of the speed of sound (about 1080 fps at sea level) at 500 yards, something you couldn''t get with the 222 Remington. Working with Gene Stoner of Armalite, Bob Hutton developed a case slightly longer than the 222 and also had Sierra make a 55-grain boat-tail bullet. This combination met the design requirements. All this was documented in the 1971 issue of the GUNS & AMMO ANNUAL. However, this author was not aware of this and has stated in previous editions that he didn''t believe that this information had ever been published. Originally an alternate military cartridge, the 223 (5.56mm) is now the official U.S. and NATO round, but we should note here that NATO forces, including the U.S., have standardizes a new 5.56mm round with a heavy bullet and the M193 is no longer standard.\r\nShortly after the military adopted the cartridge, Remington brought out the sporting version, which has largely replaced the 222 Remington Magnum in popularity. Practically every manufacturer of bolt-action rifles has at least one model chambered for the 223. In addition, there are a large number of military-type semi-auto rifles available in this caliber and at one time the Remington Model 760 slide-action was available in 223.\r\n\r\nThe 223 is nearly identical to the 222 Remington Magnum, the only difference being that the 223 has a slightly shorter case. The two are not inter-changeable, although the 223 will chamber in a 222 Magnum rifle. The result, though, is to create a gross head space problem, and the 223 case will rupture if fired in the 222 Magnum chamber. The 223 has proven to be an effective military cartridge for fighting in jungle or forested areas and for close-in fire support, and has been improved lately by NATO with heavier bullets fired through fast-twist (1 in 7-inch) barrels. As a sporting round, it is just as accurate as any of the other long-range, center-fire 22s. Military brass cases are usually heavier than commercial cases and maximum loads should be reduced by at least 10 percent and approached cautiously, because the reduced case capacity results in a higher loading density and increased pressure with the same powder charge. The 223 Remington can be classed as an excellent medium-range varmint cartridge at ranges out to around 250 yards.\r\n\r\nEDITORIAL NOTE: In 1979, SAAMI cautioned shooters that 5.56mm military chambers and throats differ from 223 sporting rifle chambers, and therefore military ball ammo may produce high chamber pressures in sporting rifles. At least one manufacturer, Ruger, harumphed that its 223 chambers would handle military 5.56mm with no problems.', ''),

We really don’t get this kind of deals every day, its your jackpot.\n\nSo, today I went for target shooting with my TT instead of dumping it with the adjustment of a pin behind the trigger.  The problem of stuck trigger is resolved 100%.  Now comes with the 2[SUP]nd[/SUP] and 3[SUP]rd[/SUP] problem of double feed in chamber and stuck round in chamber.  This I also resolved by changing the spring behind the ejector.  I have put a hard spring so this also resolved the problem. The weak spring failed to hold the round so that was causing the problem.\n \nDuring target shooting I again faced a huge problem, during firing 4[SUP]th[/SUP] round I felt something on my face, I didn’t bothered but when I fired 5[SUP]th[/SUP] round I feel that thing again but with more force.  When firing 6[SUP]th[/SUP] round I noticed huge back fire of the primer from the behind the firing pin where hammer strikes.  When closely inspected I found that the firing pin is too long so I have to shorten the firing pin by half millimeter and this also resolve the issue. And after that I fired 6 more rounds and I am satisfied now that every thing is ok.  Still have to test more round.\n \nConcerning to the shaheen round I didn’t feel any doubts when fired 25 rounds.  May be I get problems after firing 300 to 500 rounds so I will strictly stick with shaheen ammo.\n \nAgain the local stuff (ammo + weapon) need to be tested again and again till you fire at least 500 rounds and if all the problems are resolved then this is the reliable weapon.\n \nToday was my 2[SUP]nd[/SUP] day of shooting and I was practicing for target shooting and to get my self familiarize with my TT but these problem ended my target practice and through in testing the gun again.\n \nTill now I have just fired 25 rounds and I have saw a post of senior member that you cant familiarize your self until you shot 300 to 500 rounds so I have plant to sick with this local TT until I am ready to target shoot perfectly and familiarize with .30 cal TT.\n\n\nby the way the target shoot result was 50% in 15 shots and they are my first 15 shots (485 shots are remaining till my perfection hopefuly) :P', ''),

(495044, ' 22LR - Do You Know Your Distance to Target?\n \nKnowing the distance to the target or to the game is a key to a successful shot. This need comes about as there is no rifle or cartridge on earth that delivers the bullet with no drop. At a gun range we usually know the distance to the paper target. If not, we ask the rangemaster for this information. In the filed we also need to know the distance to the game. We acquire this information by using a device such as rangefinder, a range-finding riflescope or use some method of estimation.\n \nSome people have riflescopes with reticles (crosshairs) that aid in estimating distance A few have rangefinders that calculate the distance. Even if you do not have a riflescope or range-finding device, no doubt your rifle has a front sight of some sort. Your front sight can also be used to estimate distance. You can determine what the width of the front sight represents on the target at a given distance. For the sake of simplicity, let us say that distance is 50 yards.\n \nOn a white sheet of paper draw a bold straight horizontal line about 6-10 inches in length. Place vertical marks one inch apart on that line. Now place this paper at a distance of 50 yards from the shooting position. From this spot you aim the rifle at that paper. The width of the front sight will cover a certain number of inches on that paper line. Count these inches. This becomes your reference. Let us say that the width of front sight in this case cover six inches. Later you go out in the filed to hunt rabbits. You aim the rifle at a rabbit. You discover that the width of the front sight cover one half the width of the rabbit that is twelve inches in length. From the information you have gained, you know that the rabbit is at a distance of about 50 yards away. If the front sight cover the body of the rabbit more or less, you can make distance-to-target adjustments accordingly.', ''),

(495046, '32 Long Colt----32 Short Colt Introduced by Colt in 1875 with the New Line model revolvers. This was originally a black-powder cartridge and used a 90-grain outside-lubricated bullet. There is also a 32 Short Colt which is identical except for case length (.650-inch). In England and Europe, this is known as the 320-caliber revolver. The 32 Short and Long Colt cartridges are actually obsolete, having been displaced by 32 S&W Short and Long. Colt is about the only company that used this cartridge to  any extent in the U.S. It was more popular in Europe, where a number of black-powder revolvers were made.\r\n\r\nThe 32 Colt cartridge was originally of the outside-lubricated type used a bullet of .313-inch diameter. Later this was changed to an inside-lubricated type which necessitated a bullet of .299-inch diameter so the lubricating grooves would fit inside the case. The bullet weight was reduced from 90 to 80 or 82 grains in the inside-lubricated type and this also shortened the overall length a little. In power and usefulness, the Colt cartridges are about the same as the 32 S&W Short and Long, but not nearly as accurate.', ''),

(the ugly beast)[/url]\r\nForum: ShotGuns\r\nAssigned Moderators: N/A\r\n\r\nPosted by: [url=http://www.pakguns.com/member.php?3976-Mawa]Mawa[/url]\r\nOriginal Content: [quote]My new addition to the arsenal UTAS 15. before i go on the review of this shotgun, i saw two threads its been discussed here. some members have seen at zamzama store, and found it very expensive for a shotgun. As it was said to be sold i guess for 250k :O... nop man, this is for 150k max. \n\nThe specs are as:\n\nCaliber\n12 Gauge, 3” / 76mm chamber\n\nType\nManually operated, pump action\n\nOverall length\n720 mm\n\nBarrel length\n470 mm\n\nWeight, empty\n2.8 kg\n\nMagazine capacity\n7 + 7 (70mm shells) or 6 + 6 (76mm Magnum shells)\n\nthe gun is now internationally recognized as the designer is from USA, it is much appreciated in US aswell, and 15 12guage shells is massive firepower for home or self defence. I support polymer and carbon firearms from glocks to Czs... this beast is also in fiber and polymer and very high grade material is used to reduce the weight and the balanced gun. \n\nthe best feature i love about this gun is pump action, it smooth and very light, semi auto in my experience jam at some stage or an other esp with local shaheen rounds. it has a built in laser system. one push button. and yes there is leaver on top of the gun, which gives three modes, you can change to which magazine you want to use. e.g u can put 7 buckshots in right and in left you can put 7 slugs. you have the option to choose manually or bring that leaver in center and now the gun with throw mix shells, means combination of buckshots and slugs.... massive POWER!! \n\nthe iron sights are pretty good, but it also have rail for mounting tactical scopes. Also comes with extended barrel which is pretty good for hunting bores and stuff....Also comes with a very nice bag.  and most of all its different in look which is a pretty good change. I found its external hardware and frame solid and balanced. \n\nWhat i dont like about the gun?\n-its still expensive as its a Turkish gun. \n-the designs shows its some AA12 kinda shit, but one gets disappointed when you come to know this is even not semi auto. \n-Mag capacity cant be increased as in Saiga 12 (drum mag)\n- there is no place designed for tactical light. Only laser is built in and scope of any sort could be mounted. \n\nSince its a shotgun there is no put giving a range report lol. and using hotspot watch this review on youtube:(Shows shooting of this gun aswel)\n[URL]http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_o3YsUVAyQ[/URL][/quote]', ''),
(495073, ' [QUOTE=Aquarius;332314]Congrats once again on a very nice shotgun mk753 bro.. so you have got the short version with overall length 977mm.. why didnt you remove the pin which makes it unable to fire when the butt stock is folded.. honestly speaking IMHO I did''nt understand this option offered when there already exists an axternal manual safety.\nI have a larger version of it with overall length 1057mm and it can fire with folded stock.. you should also consider this option because in a scenario of very quick and urgent withdrawal and firing, you will have to unfold the stock first which will certainly waste your very precious time before firing at a Zombie or a BG.. my two cents otherwise everyone has its own preferences.\n\nRegards.[/QUOTE]\n\nI agree with you Aquarius bro. next time when I goto Pesh., I''ll show it to the dealer and see if his technician is there.

Ak47 sir, its in my room... lol, not in pindi. I am not sure that its on retail in pindi as yet either. i did little research on price and stuff.. its sold for $1200 all around the world. Its not gona come below. that atleast 1 lac cause then the importer would go in loss. and i think 1 lac is decent price for this. \n\nits bit different from other Turkish made stuff, here is a bit of history from world guns:\n The story of the UTS-15 shotgun began in around 2006, when famous American company Smith & Wesson decided to expand its line of shotguns with some new and preferably unorthodox tactical weapon. At that time Smith & Wesson did not manufactured shotguns in house; instead they used OEM process, stamping their name on shotguns made for them in Turkey by a well established manufacturer UTAS Makina, which also made quality shotguns for other famous US brands like Savage-Stevens and Kimber. After some considerations it was decided to start with highly unorthodox design of the South African Neostead shotgun and try to improve it. Following this decision, UTAS obtained patent rights and samples of the Neostead shotgun from its designers. After initial evaluation it was decided to redesign weapon completely, retaining its basic bullpup configuration and dual over-the-barrel magazines but create everything else from the ground up. All development work was carried out at the UTAS facility in Turkey, under the leadership of the noted American small arms expert Ted Hatfield. In around 2008 Smith &Wesson withdrew from this project due to its internal problems, and UTAS continued development of its new weapon under its own name. This shotgun, designated as UTS-15 (which stands for Urban Tactical Shotgun 15-rounds), was first displayed to the public at IDEX 2011, and at the moment of this writing (summer of 2011) it is entering production at two factories belonging to UTAS - one in Turkey (to supply guns to Europe, Asia and Africa) and another in USA (to supply to American markets). It must be noted that UTAS company has plans to expand its product line and to introduce semi-automatic version of their shotgun, followed by some more weapons like rifles and grenade launchers, all based on the same patented platform.\n\n Now i dont get the clone part ? because the video i posted of Hichock 45, who gives one of the best reviews of guns on youtube, tested the same gun given to him by his Turkish friends to test. Please watch that video.  I mean is this weapon copied? :O but from where there aint anyother source. \n\nRegards.', ''),

(495094, 'Cz75 P07 Duty - Bashfest Gents!\n\nIts been a month since I bought my duty and what an sweet weapon it is! I wanted to relish the feel of it myself for sometime and get the hand of the weapon before I started posting reviews on it.\n\nHave taken it through its paces. The gun has seen about 500 - 600 rounds through it, no malfunctions. I clean it after every outing. I am not putting my candy through any stress tests. The Serial number starts from "B" and I would recommend everyone not to buy anything below "BXXXXX". No issues with polymer, magazine drops free. The mag spring is a little too tight but 16 bullets is virtually impossible to fit in the mag. It takes only 15 uptil now, maybe after the springs get lighter.\n\nCoin sized groups at 7 and 10 yards. And decent groups at 15 and 25 yards. The shooting is instinctive, specially at 25 yards when you can barely make out the target beyond your front sight. The shot lands surprising closer than you expected it to. Its like the gun wants to be accurate and you really have to work hard to miss. Its very easy to locate your mistakes, I was shooting low left (no surprises here - amateur shooter) I fixed the problem by isolating the trigger finger and avoided jerking the grip at every shot. And hey presto, accuracy to rival the Navy SEALS :lol:\n\nThe best part is the recoil, next to nil. There was a definite muzzle flip, but not enough to throw you off and just \nperfect so that you barely notice! After sometime, it really gets harder to notice and you catch yourself asking did the gun actually recoil this time or no. Its not magic, the gun has a very low bore axis and a natural grip, the recoil feeds into your palms and you actually feel like managing it.\n\nBought mine from Guns and Accessories for 95K on the first week of December. Bought another one from Abbas (HM Traders) at 97K not three days ago because G&A in their wisdom, decided that the rates of duty changed overnight to 110k and they arent selling for below that at all. I think Abbas has got a couple more and probably might be willing to sell for cheaper because me and my friend dont exactly make for hard bargainers.\n\nOh yeah and thats a custom made holster from Muhammadi Saddlers.', ''),

I noticed the perfect bench rest shooting stance so kudos to Tareen Sr. for excellent training.[/QUOTE]\n\nThank you Denovo87 brother. Junior did read all the appreciations from all the uncles and was highly pleased & thankful. \n\n\n[QUOTE=AK47;333076]Nice, interesting post from top to toe with Junior walking alongside the canal.\n\nGreat, appropriate and timely initiative of putting young blood into action and that too with a Diana!\n\nMy Junior was given a Diana over the weekend, and honestly it was pretty hard to put off the options of the 54 or 350 Magnum only due to the weights of both. So had to choose something lighter, coz unlike your good, leisure-time hunting self, I personally won''t be using the stuff any much myself.\n\n[I]Technically[/I] speaking, your post with a perfect bench rest was a great idea. I somehow regret having put off the heavier options.\n\nAnd[I] technically [/I]speaking, you also proved that these [I]neeli tankies[/I] indeed are TUFF by nature! \n\nInshallah, Junior will soon get to the[I] 5 shots in a hole happiness [/I]! \n\n\nRegards.[/QUOTE]\n\nThank you so much AK47 brother for the joyful & encouraging input as always.\n\nWhile we are on the subject, I take this opportunity to add a few points to it. A while back, I got a Diana 35 or 36 with T06 trigger (looked similar to me as 350 magnum) for him from Dubai to start with but after a few shots from benchrest it was obvious that the recoil & vibration was taking his mind off the actual thing. He seemed more concerned to balance the gun after the shot and expected flinch. \n\nSo I let that rifle go and let him shoot Diana 54. That saves him from worrying about recoil. With apparently less noise its an inherently accurate platform to train a youngman to learn trigger & breath control and other basics of this discipline and not worry about recoil, blast & weight at this stage. Ideally, I would love to get him a PCP. Insha Allah.\n\nShooting the [I]neeli tanky[/I] got me three results; :smile:\nONE - there are some types that sure are strong. Had it been summer, it would have stopped even more pellets. \nTWO - I was disappointed with the power of Shaheen #6 at just 25 meters. May be I am unconsciously comparing it with .22lr even out to 100 meters!!!\nTHREE - I realized why I was unable to drop crows recently from the same distance as before. I forgot to change chokes after last partridge shoot.\n\nAnd for the 5 shots happiness, dearly loved your spot on reference. Amazing eyes wired to an even wonderful memory. :smile: :smile: :smile:\n\n[QUOTE=Cool Hunter;333099]very nice shooting[/QUOTE]\n\nThank you brother.\n\n[QUOTE=Avais;333121]Very nice shooting by junior Tareen (MashAllah) under the guidance of perfect instructor.[/QUOTE]\n\nThank you Avais bhai.

I don''t think its a good pattern but then again, I know next to nothing about technicalities. It seems, its time to start learning about shotgun patterning in a technical way to know what my specific gun is doing at what distance.

(495543, ' 22LR - Your Money Back\n \nI say investing money in a 22LR rifle is a better proposition than purchase of a rifle of any other caliber. Let us say that you are new to the hobby of shooting. You have not yet acquired your first gun. As a newcomer you are pondering a thought - &#8220;what if I don&#8217;t like this hobby, will I be able to recoup the money I put into the weapon&#8221;? Your caution and apprehension are justified.\n \nYou want to do financial analysis of the proposed 22LR rifle acquisition versus a rifle of any other caliber. Your total investment in this hobby will be money to acquire the rifle and the cost of the ammunition you expend.\n \nWhat is your budget for the rifle?  What kind of rifle can you buy with this amount of money? What about the budget for ammunition? How many 22LR cartridges can you buy with the ammo budget? How about the other caliber - how many cartridges can you buy for the same amount of money?\n \nLet us say that that at the moment you are not sure if you will want to do any hunting with the rifle. If your interest leans in this direction, do you have any idea what you want to hunt? Being new in the hobby, you want to ask around if the game you are interested in hunting can be ethically shot with a 22LR. Is your hunt going be once-a-year affair or more frequent? Will you hunt locally or will it involve greater distances requiring more out-of-pocket expense?\n \nAfter your &#8220;trials&#8221; you conclude that shooting sport in not for you. Now we come to the bottom line. If you are not happy with this sport, how much will you be able to get back by selling your 22LR or rifle or any other caliber. Ask around. What you will hear more often than not - as percentage of purchase price, you will get back more by selling the 222LR rifle than the &#8220;other caliber&#8221; rifle. \n \nI expect to get 100% of my money back from sale of any one of my 22LRs - be it one year from now or decade from now. I am a selective buyer. You can also &#8220;hone&#8221; your buying skill and be on the path of getting 100% of your money back. If you do buy a 22LR - thinking of selling it would be the last thing on your mind.', ''),

(495327, 'PWLD Shooting(Hunting) Licence Booklet Conservation and Hunting Association of Pakistan (CHAP) feels proud and privileged to announce the completion of its first project and that is educating the Hunters about Wildlife Laws, Wildlife Species and Code of Conduct through devising a new Shooting Booklet with the Punjab Wildlife and Parks Department (PWLD).\r\n\r\nA few months back CHAP proposed PWLD the idea to develop an enhanced Shooting Licence Booklet which should entail all the said features and offered to bear all the expenses for its development and printing in required numbers. After initial approval, CHAP in collaboration with Punjab Wildlife & Parks Department started working on Content Development and finally the Printing of this new Shooting Licence Booklet.\r\n\r\nOn December 29, 2010, in a small ceremony held at Punjab Wildlife and Parks Department, CHAP President Mr. Azam Hayat Noon handed over the desired number of new booklets to Director PWLD Mr. Abdul Qadeer Mehal. Director PWLD appreciated the efforts of CHAP and expressed hope that this new booklet shall be a guiding tool for hunters and shall result in improvements in conservation of wildlife in the Province of Punjab.\r\n\r\nAfter the delivery of these booklets, PWLD requested CHAP to provide additional copies for future requirements. CHAP fulfilled this requirement and handed over the second batch of Shooting Licence Booklets to Director General Punjab Wildlife & Parks Dept., Dr. Zafar Nasarullah on March 25, 2011.\r\n\r\nThe new Shooting Licence booklet contains Hunting Rules and Regulations from Punjab Wildlife Act 2007, Code of Conduct, Shotgun Safety Instructions, Lists of wildlife species with local names etc and contact information of PWLD officials in all tehsils of Punjab, in both English and Urdu. This booklet shall not only educate Hunters but shall also give a new outlook to PWLD. These new shooting licence booklets are available in all Licence Issuing Offices of PWLD throughout Punjab.\r\n\r\nIt sure is a marvelous start for what CHAP hopes to be something that brings change in the behavior of us shikaris and indeed game management. The booklet should prove to be a great guide for us all and was the need of the hour with game diminishing fast.\r\n\r\nTo view the scanned pages of different sections of the new PWLD Shooting Licence Booklet, see the below Posts,\r\n\r\nCode of Conduct & Safety\r\nRegulations & Wildlife Act\r\nCitizen Watch Program\r\nList of Wildlife 1st, 2nd, 3rd & 4th Schedules\r\nPWLD Officials Contact Info\r\n\r\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]16895[/ATTACH]\r\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]16896[/ATTACH]\r\n[URL="http://www.chap.org.pk/lic_booklet.php"]Link[/URL]', ''),

(495370, ' [COLOR=#000000][FONT=Arial]One should carry hollowpoint ammunition in a defensive handgun. Hollowpoint ammunition has much better stopping power than full metal jacket or round-nose lead and stopping power is what you need when being assaulted.\n\n[/FONT][/COLOR]\n[COLOR=#000000][FONT=Arial]The point is not to wound or kill the adversary, the point is to stop him in his tracks and make him cease attacking you. Stopping power (sometimes called "knock-down power") refers to a particular bullet''s ability to incapacitate an attacker; the greater that ability, the less chance that your attacker will be able to continue shooting, stabbing, or beating you after you have shot him.[/FONT][/COLOR]\n[COLOR=#000000][FONT=Arial]Handguns are not death rays. Despite what you see in the movies, the vast majority of people (over 80%) shot with handguns survive. Handguns are weak compared to rifles and shotguns and you want every edge you can get. Great ammunition is no more expensive than mediocre ammunition, so carry the best. Rifles and shotguns have stopping power to spare; handguns do not. Thus, you must select your handgun load very carefully and the detail of the handgun ammunition section reflects this.\n\n[/FONT][/COLOR]\n[COLOR=#000000][FONT=Arial]Hollowpoint ammunition is NOT more lethal than ball (full metal jacket) ammunition. You may have seen media hype about "killer dum-dum bullets," but this is nonsense. Hollowpoint bullets usually expand and stop in the human body and thus the attacker absorbs much more of the bullet''s kinetic energy than if the bullet had merely zipped through him and left two small holes. Hollowpoint ammunition is also safer for all parties concerned.\n\n[/FONT][/COLOR]\n[LIST]\n[*]You are safer because your attacker is more likely to be incapacitated after one or two shots and thus unable to fire back, stab you, or whatever. The decreased likelihood of your attacker dying from hollowpoint bullets saves you the moral and legal complications and expense you will experience from killing a man.\n[*]\n[*]Innocent bystanders are safer because hollowpoint bullets are less likely to exit the attacker''s body and go on to injure anyone else. The ricochet danger is also much lower than that of ball ammunition, and hollowpoint bullets are less likely to penetrate walls or doors and strike uninvolved third parties. Furthermore, if your foe is incapacitated quickly he won''t be spraying wild bullets around, endangering uninvolved third parties.\n[*]\n[*]Lastly, your attacker is safer because he is far less likely to die from one or two hollowpoint bullets than the five or six round-nose slugs you would have had to fire to put him down. Most gunshot deaths occur from shock and loss of blood and ball rounds tend to make entry and exit wounds, whereas hollowpoints go in and stay put. An attacker shot twice with ball ammo will probably have four holes in him rather than two and is thus in far greater danger of death from blood loss. If you can avoid killing your attacker you should, for both moral and legal reasons.\n[*]\n[/LIST][COLOR=#000000][FONT=Arial]There are some exceptions to the "carry only hollowpoints in a handgun" rule. Some older or cheaper automatic pistols will jam with hollowpoint rounds. With these guns, one must use ball rounds (or "full metal jacket" rounds - the terms are synonymous) and I specify some "reliable with ball only" models by caliber. It is crucial for you to test your pistol to make certain it is reliable with specific loads; don''t rely on my advice. My life will never depend on the reliability of your handgun. Your life may.\n\nRegular Bullet Ball is round-nosed, full metal jacketed ammunition. All military pistol and rifle ammunition uses full metal jacket bullets. Synonyms for ball include FMJ ("full metal jacket"), MC ("metal case") and TMJ ("totally metal jacketed," a term used only by the ammunition maker CCI). Ball rounds do not expand and are always the worst choice in a defensive round. The military uses ball because it feeds well (i.e. rarely jams) and penetrates well, but mostly because the military is required to use ball ammo by the Geneva Convention. Fortunately, you are free to choose better ammunition and should use ball for practice only.\n\n\n"Wadcutter" (WC) and "semi-wadcutter" (SWC) are lead, sharp-shouldered revolver bullets with an odd cylindrical or truncated cone appearance. True wadcutters are very low power rounds used for target shooting. Like all lead, bullets, they leave lead in the barrel''s grooves after use. Unless you own a .38 or .357 revolver, forget about these.\n"Jacketed soft-points" (JSP) are jacketed bullets with exposed lead at the tip. These make poor defensive rounds for handguns, but may be effective for rifles, due to the latter''s high velocity. Never use JSP rounds in a handgun for self-defense, unless your only alternative is hard ball.\n\n\n"Jacketed hollowpoints" (JHP) are usually the best choice for handguns and most rifles. JHP rounds have a hollow cavity in the nose and usually expand (and stop) in the body of your attacker, transferring all their kinetic energy for maximum stopping power. They are the safest and best bullets available.\n\n\n"Round-nose lead" (RNL) are generally revolver bullets without any metal jacket around the bullet. These are worthless for self-defense, and I don''t even use them at the range. If you come upon a bargain lot of RNL ammo, feel free to buy it for target practice. You will be scrubbing out your barel until the wee hours, however, as lead bullets scum up barrels something fierce. Use Flitz metal polish to scour out the grimy residue.\n\n[B].22 LR[/B]\nYou should really be using something bigger than a .22 for self-defense, but even a .22 beats nothing. There are some really nice .22 pocket autos and NAA mini-revolvers, and they make sense for women reluctant to tote a bigger gun around. Choose any Federal, Remington, Winchester or CCI copper-plated 37 grain (or lighter) high velocity hollowpoint round. I recommend CCI "Stinger" 32 grain or Remington "Yellow Jacket" 33 grain hollowpoints, as they have been very reliable in my Beretta 21A and Walther TPH pistols and have the highest stopping power ratings.\n\n\nShoot a lot of rounds through your self-defense .22, the ammo is cheap and you want to be sure to pick a reliable round. If high-velocity solids don''t cycle reliably, try standard-velocity. There is little difference in power but it may improve your gun''s reliability (e.g. Jennings J-22 pistols are more reliable with standard-velocity solids). Marksmanship is crucial with such a tiny gun, so practice drawing your .22 and firing it rapidly into a melon at ten feet or so. Also, keep your .22 autoloader meticulously clean; these tiny guns cannot function reliably with gunk in them. If you carry your .22 in a pocket, purse or ankle holster, inspect it daily and brush off any dust or grit with an old toothbrush. Lubricate it properly. This is very important. \n\n\n[B].22 WMR[/B]\nMuch better than the .22 LR and perhaps better than most calibers smaller than .35. 40 grain JHP loads are the traditional choice, with Winchester''s 40 grain JHP load scoring highest in 4" and longer barrels. The recently introduced Speer 40 grain GDHP-SB load was tailored for use in mini revolvers with 2" and shorter barrels.\n\n\n[B].25 ACP (6.35mm)[/B]\nThe best .25 load is the Hornady 35 grain XTP-HP round. If it jams, use any Federal, Remington, or Winchester 50 grain ball round. Winchester has an odd 45 grain "Expanding Point" round that should be okay, if it is reliable in your gun (it seems to work fine in Beretta 950 pistols, for example), but don''t expect any improvement in performance over the 50 grain ball rounds. The excellent Walther TPH .25 should be loaded with ball.\nThe Hornady 35 grain JHP should be used only if it is 100% reliable in your pistol. Fire 200 rounds through your gun to verify. Ed Sanow recommends the MagSafe 22 grain "Defender" and Glaser 40 grain Safety Slugs.\n\n\n[B].32 ACP (7.65 mm Browning, 7.65x17mm)[/B]\nUse the Winchester 60 grain Silvertip Jacketed Hollow Point (X32ASHP),provided it is reliable in your gun. Most of the common .32 autos on the market are only reliable with 71 grain ball: Llama, Walther PP and PPK, Czech CZ-24 and CZ-70, Davis P-32, Mauser HSc, etc.\n\n\n[B].32 Smith & Wesson Long[/B]\nThe best defense load for this obsolescent revolver caliber is the Federal 98 grain lead wadcutter (32LA). Shoot carefully.\n\n\n[B].32 H&R Magnum[/B]\nFederal 85 grain Jacketed Hollow Point (C32HRB).\n\n\n[B].327 Magnum[/B]\nFederal Premium 85 grain Hydra-Shok Jacketed Hollow Point.\n\n\n[B]7.62x25mm (a.k.a. 7.63mm Mauser)[/B]\nIf you''re using this obsolescent communist caliber I can only assume that you have an old CZ-52 or Chinese Tokarev. Only 87 grain ball ammo is available, so leave the cheap Chinese military stuff for practice and carry Fiocchi 7.63 Mauser ball in your gun.\n\n\n[B].380 ACP (9mm Short, 9x17mm, 9mm Kurz)[/B]\nNow we''re getting into some decent stopping power. The three or four best .380 JHP rounds have better stopping power than ANY bullet fired out of 2" barrel .38 Special snub-nose. All of the Big Five make good hollowpoints for this caliber. The Remington 88 grain JHP is the most reliably-feeding hollowpoint, but slightly less effective than the Hydra-shok or Cor-Bon. Reliability is crucial, and thus you must test the rounds before carrying.\n\n\n[/FONT][/COLOR]', ''),

(495438, '297/230 (Morris) Short &amp; Long These two cartridges are listed together because the only difference between them is length and powder charge. They were introduced about 1880-82 as target or practice rounds to be fired in a barrel insert for the 577/450 Martini-Henry Service rifle. The idea originated with Richard Morris and was adopted by the army. Some models of the 303 Enfield rifle used an insert for the Morris cartridges also. In addition, barrel and chamber inserts were available for the Webley & Scott 450 and 45 revolvers. European-made single shot pistols and rifles were occasionally found chambered for the Morris cartridges. Although quite popular at one time, they are largely obsolete at present. They were listed in Eley-Kynoch catalogs as late as 1962. B.S.A. made Martini action rifles of this caliber.\r\n\r\nThe 297/230 Morris cartridges were used for target practice and small game shooting. Power is about the same as the standard 22 rimfire. They lost adherents because 22 rimfire ammunition is cheaper, even though the center-fire Morris cartridges can be re-loaded. They were originally black-powder numbers, but late issue ammunition used smoke-less powder. Bullets were of lead in solid or hollow-point types. The long cartridge has a longer neck than the Short, but other dimensions are the same. These cartridges have never been commercially loaded in the U.S. and are all but unknown there.', ''),
