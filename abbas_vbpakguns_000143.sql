I treat all PakGuns friends as family and even though an explanation of things is never required from my end I like to offer one willingly to increase the brotherly spirit on our forum. To start off with P.G never was and will never be bias towards anyone. \n\nP.B items are still banned at PakGuns and if you see any pictures/discussions of auto weapons please report them by clicking the report button under every post.\n\nAs for the big-wig, I assume you''re talking about the youngish guy hunting Ibex? If so he was banned from Pakguns and all his photo''s removed. Also we have no way of verifying if someone had a valid hunting permit or not. We can only request.\n\nThe Jeep ad was posted by Sohail by special permission from me. He''s a big part of PakGuns and has done a lot for the P.G family. If he had asked me to post an ad for his house even then I would have happily obliged. \n\nP.G is not class specific and as for old members not being active, it happens on all online forums. No one except management can be active all the time.\n\nI have also requested the mod to adjust your ban to 7 days instead of permanent.\n\nTake care and wish you all the best,\n\nAbbas', ''),

(366956, ' [QUOTE=mujtabakhan;205635]Well Guys,\n\nIn my personal opinion, it is very good news that Govt. is seriously taking initiative to regulate the weapon licencing system in Pakistan. Like the NADRA ID card this system has its own merits. After getting into this system, all the weapon related data will be at central place and it will be easy to get arm licence from anywhere in Pakistan. Another point is, after converting into computerised system, there will be only One MOI licence for the public. There will not be distinction between Provincial Arm Licence and All Pakistan Arm Licence. \n\nThis conversion of book licences into computerised card is very healthy sign for the peace loving citizens of Pakistan. As our ID card is valid for all Pakistan, our one Arm Licence should be for all Pakistan.\n\nGovt. should announce a reasonable time frame and procedure for such conversion.[/QUOTE]\n \nIf it will be happened as you stated, it will be very good that all arms licenses will be valid for the whole country. My point of view is this that all licenses should be all Pakistan despite of the fact they are made from any region or city. I wish it will be done.', ''),

(367074, ' [QUOTE=mujtabakhan;205635]Well Guys,\n\nIn my personal opinion, it is very good news that Govt. is seriously taking initiative to regulate the weapon licencing system in Pakistan. Like the NADRA ID card this system has its own merits. After getting into this system, all the weapon related data will be at central place and it will be easy to get arm licence from anywhere in Pakistan.

Houbara has three different subspecies. The subspecie that comes to Pakistan region is the Asian Houbara and it breeds in Central Asia. I have hunted in countries like Tajikistan, Iran and Kazakhstan so I know this information first hand. You can also see this in the following link: \r\n\r\n[url]http://www.alshindagah.com/janfeb2003/houbara.html[/url]\r\n\r\nfrom which I quote:\r\n\r\n[I]The houbara is the most common bustard in the world and has the widest distribution. Of the three major subspecies, the one that occurs in Asia , and therefore in the UAE, is MacQueen''s Bustard (Chlamydotis undulata macqueenii). This bustard is mainly migratory, wintering in the region from Pakistan to Arabia and breeding in the northern regions of Turkmenistan , Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan . Some houbara wintering in the UAE travel several thousand kilometers from their breeding grounds. During migration they stop regularly to feed and often walk many kilometers, trotting or walking with the typical bustard gait and leaving distinctive tracks. It is this behaviour that is part of the cause of the decline of their numbers as they are poached during their migration to be used as training birds for falcons, or for food.[/I] \r\n\r\nUnquote.\r\n\r\nAnd by the way I have also hunted the North part of Central African Republic i.e. Sub Sahara region in January (winter). I have seen both Bustard and Quail in great number there. So the population that you are talking about maybe migrating from North Africa to Sub Sahara Africa but it is definitely not the one coming to Pakistan.', ''),

They watched their computer screens as information on the bird''s flight was continually updated. The bird traveled initially along the coast of the UAE and Oman and then across the Straits of Hormuz and into Iran where it stopped over for approximately three weeks. Just as the NARC researchers were beginning to think that the male would remain in Iran for the breeding season, the bird once more took off to fly to the border region of Turkmenistan, Kazakhstan and Uzbekhistan. Signals were received from this position until the battery life ended. By the end of this migratory journey, the male houbara had flown an impressive 2, 765 kilometres.\r\n\r\nThis study led to an international agreement between the UAE and Kazakhstan which allowed NARC researchers to travel to Kazakhstan in the springs of both 1995 and 1996 during the houbara breeding season. Collaborating with researchers from the Institute of Zoology, in Almaty, the teams was able to capture nine houbara in the east of the country and five in the west.

(367130, ' [QUOTE=Skeeter60;205782]If you want a pistol go with a G 19 or 17 what ever. If you want a drawing room show off  pistol then have the barrel full of holes. You will never be able to shoot without ear muffs and if you shoot it without muffs you lose your hearing and start flinching. The fire balls rising out of the ports will ruin your night vision after the first shot. Your pistol ammo will lose about a 100 ft or more in muzzle velocity. The only gain is a slight reduction in felt recoil and muzzle jump. Make your choice. It will also be less reliable with lighter ammo and you pay more for having your pistol messed up.[/QUOTE]\n \nnice thats really convincing', ''),

They watched their computer screens as information on the bird''s flight was continually updated. The bird traveled initially along the coast of the UAE and Oman and then across the Straits of Hormuz and into Iran where it stopped over for approximately three weeks. Just as the NARC researchers were beginning to think that the male would remain in Iran for the breeding season, the bird once more took off to fly to the border region of Turkmenistan, Kazakhstan and Uzbekhistan. Signals were received from this position until the battery life ended. By the end of this migratory journey, the male houbara had flown an impressive 2, 765 kilometres.\r\n\r\nThis study led to an international agreement between the UAE and Kazakhstan which allowed NARC researchers to travel to Kazakhstan in the springs of both 1995 and 1996 during the houbara breeding season. Collaborating with researchers from the Institute of Zoology, in Almaty, the teams was able to capture nine houbara in the east of the country and five in the west.

(367168, ' "Birds generally begin migration when they have a favorable tailwind. Once started however, only very bad weather will stop them. Many birds fly high when migrating because of prevailing winds at higher altitudes and also because the cold at these altitudes helps them disperse heat being generated by their flight muscles.\r\nTiming of migration is a mix of internal stimulus which results in a feeding binge to put on fat to survive the journey and then the tendency to aggregate into flocks. Once the pre-migration flock is gathered, the feeding continues while the birds wait for suitable weather conditions. Thus while the birds'' internal clock probably releases the hormonal triggers at a fairly accurate date each year, the availability of food and the presiding weather conditions decide when the migration starts and hence when we see the first spring migrants arrive and the last autumn ones leave.For geographical reasons, i.e. mountains, coasts and rivers, many migrating birds travel certain general flyway or routes. Migratory routes are not fixed and in some species part of the population follows one route and part another. In India, the winter migrants from central Asia and Siberia are thought to use two main flyways; one in the west along the Indus valley and the other in the north-east along the river Brahmaputra. Some migrants fly very long distances. Some arctic terns fly 15,000 km each way. Most flights occur at between 600 and 5000 ft above sea level with an average height of 1525 ft. However, mountains may mean greater heights are needed and heights over 10000 ft are not uncommon.\r\nLittle is known about how birds navigate. Experiments show that most migratory birds have a built-in sense of direction and know innately which direction they need to travel. First year Starlings in Europe kept in a covered cage and away from birds which have already migrated once or more, still move to the correct side of the cage when the time comes for them to migrate. Some birds appear to use landmarks and obviously at a height of several thousand feet they can see a considerable distance. A number of elegant experiments involving and/or displacing birds to different geographical regions have shown that many birds use the sun, at least during the day, as a cue to direction when migrating or homing.\r\nBirds of prey, Swallows and Crows migrate by day. Thrushes, Warblers, Cuckoos and Woodpeckers migrate by night. Wildfowl migrate both day and night. Most songbirds migrate at night. There is believed to be some hormonal stimulus to migrate, resulting, at least in the spring, in the development of the gonads. Other stimuli appear to involve temperature, daylight/darkness ratios and an internal clock.\r\n \r\nReference: [url]http://www.birding.in/bird_migration.htm[/url]', ''),

(367244, 'REVIEW: TAURUS PT 1911, A Sleek Beautiful Monster! Salams! The 1911 handgun has yielded quite some attention here on PG lately, with quite a number of member acquisitions during past few months and this not for no reasons at all, something you&#8217;ll have a feel of only after taking the darn beast into your bare hands, which coincidentally happens to be more popular now than it was a 100 years back and with  a popularity momentum on the gain, still.\n\nMost post-WW2 weapons today have become antique and collection items only, whereas this predator from WW1 still lasts and seems to be retaining it''s worth as a choice HD/SD/Combat weapon.\n\nYes, we&#8217;ve had quite some discussion on the weapon before and in numerous threads here, covering all the goods and bads of the 1911 John Browning original, yet I must say, despite of all grey shades, the handgun by itself has such a charm and charisma to it, that once you grab it firmly in your hands, the first impression and instantaneous feeling you get is inevitably: " This is a REAL gun, a toy from the "Men&#8217;z" department", lolz! \n\nI really had scruples about posting my recent addition here on the forum, partly coz the handgun has been portrayed numerous times before and discussed at length, and partly because I do not favor posting a weapon here for display only, without a brief or general firing review for the benefit of our readers, which I&#8217;m sadly hindered from doing this month, due to the lasting Ramazan peace, and that too with very &#8220;itchy&#8221; fingers, trust me, lolz!\n\nInshallah a full fledged review shall follow at earliest convenience and I intend to check it out for both deliberate firing accuracy, as well as for target re-acquisition during instantaneous rapid firing on multiple distance targets, and shall be back here in this thread with an in-depth range report later.\n\nSo far, allow me to sneak in here, have really been missing the forum during my 3 months long vacations, nice to be back again, have totally forgotten how to operate a PC, lolz!\n\nA pre-Ramazan Lahore flash visit brought me home this Taurus PT 1911 beauty with latest Matte Finish.

I chose to put a pair of the only original Taurus PT 1911 manufactured grips by Raascogrips.com on mine. I love the texture of these grips.\n\nThe grooved inlays by Pearce really secure a very firm hold on the gun, and though Taurus original texture on the gun frame itself gets hidden away with these fitted on, I''d still recommend them for both the outlook of the gun, yet primarily for the much stabler hold of a heavy recoil caliber. Installation is easy, original grip screws cross through for fixture. \n\nTaurus really did a great job with the "finish" of this gun, everything is so [I]smooth n'' silk[/I], the ambi safety is a pleasure to use and employs/deploys very smoothly.\n\nThe trigger Taurus uses is a proprietary part that needs no adjustment even though it does have an adjustment screw. On a couple of dry-fires, I noted a complete "stand still" of the gun in hands with the hammer drop, the best feel of hammer release that you could have, excellent! With a trigger like this and the 5" long barrel, I expect it to behave well in my hands.\n\nThe best feature of my personal preferences with the 1911 is the manner by which the safety is employed. It just can''t be employed without a cocked hammer, hence with live firepower only! This basically manifests that this weapon is and was meant as a pure combat weapon and is the fastest weapon out into action with one in the pipe, from the[I] cocked n'' locked[/I] status.\n\nWeighing in at above a Kg, all loaded, it''s heavy metal indeed, but somehow, I''ve never been able to distinguish much before 850-900 grams and a 1000 of same, so no issue here, it''s primarily an HD weapon, but with a comfortable shoulder holster, I do intend to winter carry it for SD occasionally.\n\nThe Grip safety ensures the gun only fires when intentionally held in the hands to do so, and I just can''t wait to shoot it out!\n\nFinally, before I leave to re-appear here with the range report - anytime during this month - let me use the opportunity to express my gratitude to[COLOR="red"] Notorious bro[/COLOR], a member of PG and dear friend in Canada, who so diligently pursued all my customization requirements and secured me the add ons above. We really have lots to thank Chief for, in terms of such nicely knit brotherhood that we''re all part of, all around the world. Thanks once again Notorious bro, your nick really did justice to the gun itself, lolz! And you''re a gem of a friend at personal level, owe you a dinner and much more, anytime you step onto Pakistani soil.\n\nSee you all in part II, Inshallah.\n\n\nRegards.', ''),

My prefrence and recommendations, extend an appropriate lead to the bird so that the bird gets its line of flight, use IC (however i preffered M) and 8 no. cartridge. Hopefuly you will be getting good results. Now there is a debate on C, IC and M. Most of the shots with C and IC, wings the bird and if you dont have a good retriever or the the place is with full of thorny bushes, you lost the birds most oftenly, thats why i preffer M which gives you clean kill. On the other hand if the field is plain or is a wheat or cotton early crops C and IC equally works better.', ''),

I prefer skeet loads due to their low recoil and noise. otherwise any combination of 9-7 shot with C to M choke is good enough for quail.\r\n\r\nsince most of my quail shots are with 10-15 yards distance therefore I never felt to the need to use anything else other than skeet cartridges. a friend of mine uses trap load#7 1/2 with skeet chokes and delivers amazing results. so,........in the end its a matter of preference mostly.\r\n\r\nRegards.', ''),

Normally, both doors of gallery are open at night (one door in my parents room and the other door is in my younger brother room). Few days back, I reach home at around 01:30 am and went into my room. After some minutes, I heard some sound and feel that there is some body out side. I got out of my room and checked my brothers room, the light was on and door of his cup board was also opened. I am afraid and checked every where (inside wash room, gallery, parents room, drawing room, kitchen etc) but there was no body. I closed the light and go to sleep. \r\n\r\nThat was my story, now the scenarios.\r\n \r\n1- If some body climb into my house from the gallery, what should I do? His direct access will be my parents room or my brother''s room and in both cases, I think I will be bound. \r\n\r\n2- If I am home alone and found somebody climb inside, what should I do?\r\n\r\nAgain pray from Almighty Allah to save all of us.\r\n\r\nRegards,[/QUOTE]\r\n \r\nNo permissions required. You have all the right over this thread as much as I do brother. First of all I would highly recommend that you get an aluminium cage or grills fixed in your balcony. I you do not intend to do that then get those sharp grills fixed in small patches in areas from which entry for an intruder is of ease.\r\n\r\nNow lets say that you see an intruder face to face already present in your parents room. Analyse the situation in terms of the number of intruder, weapons they have and then make a decision of giving up or fighting back as if it is only a charsi then you are the king. I would suggest that if he is armed and present in your house already then no point in fighting back.  Still pondering on scenario number 1, if there is only one intruder and is unarmed in case of a charsi then shoot him in the leg !!!!\r\n\r\nFor scenario number 2, the same example as above would apply but this time you will have more options as the life of your family would not be in jeopardy.', ''),

Thus IC choke would very well cover it all....\r\n\r\n#8 regular Shaheen (pellets 510, charge 31gms) Versus #9 Skeet load (pellets 480, charge 25gms). Former has advantage but when ranges are very close i.e. flushes are very close, then #9 skeet load is fine rather very good but it messes up semi-autos badly. All blackened mechanism within minutes with cartridge residue. At longer (quail) ranges of 25-35 yards, I have had bad experiences with this cartridge (hitting wise). Only advantage is lessened punch (recoil) of #9 & does not tire your shoulders during heavy gunning. \r\n\r\nMod choke will almost always burst the quail in air at close distances 5-15 yards  as Mod choke with 8# regular cartridge is kind of destructive (lethal) at close ranges for quail (though for partridge it is perfect); when the shooter is a quick firer and centers targets too, this poor bird will surely be wasted. So in that context, as Avais bro is kind of a ''easier'' firer (''let the bird take its flight'') a mod choke suits him. Second advantage with the Mod choke on quail is 3rd and 4th shots from semi-autos are effective when firing at coveys as the 3rd & 4th shots can easily fetch one around 35yards range; but though IC choke can get bird at 35 yds too, the small target would need denser pellet pattern for clean kills, and hence the advantage of a ''Light Mod'' (Skeet2) or ''Mod'' choke. But for quick firers, either change timing (i.e. delayed fire) or change choke to IC.', ''),

These pistols are broadly based on the famous and well-proven design of the Czechoslovak CZ-75 pistol, and are made from quality materials (mostly forged steel; manufacturer states service life for this pistol for at least 25,000 rounds) and with fine workmanship.  Sarsilmaz K2-45 pistols are full-size, service-type pistols which are most suitable for police and security use, self-defense (although the pistol is somewhat big and heavy for concealed carry) and other uses such as practical shooting.\nSarsilmaz K2-45 pistols are short-recoil operated, locked breech semi-automatic pistols that use modified Browning-type action with tilting barrel. The barrel is locked to the slide by a single lug, which engages the ejection port. Frame and slide are manufactured from forged steel, and available in a variety of finishes. Trigger is of traditional double action type, with exposed hammer and automatic firing pin block safety. Manual safety lever is conveniently located on the frame, above the pistol grip, and locks the hammer and sear in lowered or cocked positions. Sarsilmaz K2-45 pistols use double stack, single-feed high capacity magazines which hold 14 rounds, magazine release button is located at the base of the trigger guard. K2-45 pistols are usually produced with fixed front and adjustable rear sights which are dovetailed to the slide. Front part of the frame is shaped to provide integral Picatinny rail for accessories such as laser aiming modules or tactical flashlights.', ''),

The [B]average[/B] take off distance of this bird from shooter is 5 to 10 yards and soon after the burrrrrrrs, our reflexes consentration and gun mounting time gives a further lead of almost 10 yards to the bird.

Not giving folks a chance to sort that out, we have yet another choke for the Prevail and the A400: the Optima Choke HP.\nThe Optima barrel sets for Beretta O/Us are lighter, for the 391 they are heavier. It all makes perfect sense. \nAs to the omnipresent question of patterning, there is no tangible difference between Mobilchoke and Optima barrels that I can discern. Shotguns remain individuals and you can expect more difference based on precise shell and precise choke combination in an individual gun than anything that can be shown as related to bore inside diameter of a barrel as a standalone effect on patterns."\n\nIt got me thinking again.... that it does not make any real life difference; the only difference it makes is switching different LOADS & CHOKE combinations. For example, with same choke (e.g. Imp Cyl) Shaheen #8 regular (31g) will perform differently than say Victory or Eley (UK) in same gram and same load.

For example CZ 999 barel is cold forged whereas the barrel of a Springfiled Armory XD is a 5.25"Match Grade Select Fit Steel, melonite" fully supported ramp. Glock might be using something else. Do not confuse the price tag with the barrel life. A lot of factors play role in the barrel life 1. Kind / type of ammo used during the pistols lifetime 2. Methods of firing that is whether one shoots 100 rounds without giving the barrel break to cool off and amongst other things 3. The way one maintains / cleans the barrel after shooting and during storage periods.[/QUOTE]\r\nIts quit logical as explained by Furrukh and maintenance plays an important role in in barrel life but still the "Shelf Life" is a factor should not be neglected.', ''),

Heart is small in size and many vital shots by hunters may not hit the heart. The focus of the shot should be the vital area so that even if you miss the heart, you are able to hit the lungs.[/QUOTE]\r\n\r\nNice Croc picture. The animal is surely a great one & fairly large sized.\r\n\r\nBrother, your recom for a heart+lung shot is right for Halal animals like deer/wild goat/antelopes (incl Nilgai Antelope) hunting here as that saves the meat and greatly slows down the animal or makes him dead on spot depending on shot placement and very much so on the BULLET type.\r\n\r\nBut... in my opinion, in wild boar hunting, it is a bit different than that here owing to fact that we don''t kill it for meat (it is shot/hunted here as a pest). Therefore strategy changes. We need to kill it on spot; and since it is very thick skinned/tough, we need to hit it right dead-on at the front shoulder to drop it at spot. Otherwise it will take the 130-150gr bullet & fall deeper in the forest after running away from spot many of the times, as it has much energy to carry it over long distances before lung shot bleeds him fatally.\r\n\r\nThe shoulder shot though very effective to drop the deer/goat etc immediately, will render that meat waste and that is a fair sized chunk. So SHOT PLACEMENT i.e. Heart/Lung Vs Shoulder Shot ... its for you to decide whether you want to take a chance with the trophy or not. The latter shot (spot-on at center of shoulder) will always be deadlier though!!!', ''),

Standing boar should always be shot in the head but that shot is difficult when the animal is running.\r\n\r\nAs far as halal animals are concerned, the front legs don''t carry too much meat so loss of meat is not much of an issue. Though if you by mistake hit the back legs then you lose more meat and may be the animal too.\r\n\r\nSecondly, if you are using the right caliber for the desired animal then even if the bullet misses the vitals it still gives a blow to the nerves and tissues inside the body resulting in taking down the animal instantly due to shock.', ''),

(367901, ' IMHO following is the comparison of both:\r\n\r\nMetal Frame:\r\nSteels are for accuracy, lower felt recoil since the polymer frames have too much flex. The additional weight and size help stabilize the pistol for longer shots, it places the center of gravity lower in hands.  Steel Frame Shot feels so smooth as compared to the Polymer. Perfect for competition shootings etc.\r\n\r\nPolymer Frame:\r\nPolymers buried, dipped in mud, gone swimming and they still can function properly and get the job done before you worrying about field stripping them before the pitting and rusting starts. For CCW, polymer frames are preferred they cut out a lot of weight, and allow the frame. There is also the resistance to corrosion/rust, its manufacturing cost is much lower than the metal molding.. These are best for ccw.\r\n\r\nConclusion: Steels for competition and Polymers for CCW.\r\n\r\n\r\nRegards,', ''),

You will get a branded stuff from a gun store with a limited bargain however you may also get the copy of that stuff with a huge bargain from a road side shop. For example on my previous trip i bought a bag type holster for PKR 300 for .357 revolver from there where as the same was procured by a friend from lahore @ PKR 2000. There is also a Glock shop there. You may find all the stuff related to Glock at one stop. Remember try to first get your required stuff from a corner shop and bargain hard. If not succeded then try the show room there. As per my experience people are very friendly there not like the dealers in pakistan who sometime dont bother to answer the Salam. \nDo let me know if you need any further information.[ATTACH=CONFIG]3451[/ATTACH]', ''),

An over and under shotgun is pretty much useless for HD purposes so, I would suggest that either give up HD criteria or give up O/U.\r\n\r\nif you give up O/U then I can only suggest Baikal MP153 because whatever it lack in finish and looks it more than makes up in sheer durability (field and clays) and Hatsan Escort Combo because whatever it lacks in durability it more than makes up for it in terms of finish and lots and lots of options such as an extra shorter barrel for HD.\r\n\r\nhowever if you give up HD criteria then a world of break-open double barrels shotguns open up. be it side by side or over and under. now  you must decide if you would be hunting more or playing skeet more.\r\n\r\nif you hunt more and plan on playing skeet on purely occasional basis then Hatsan might serve you good.\r\n\r\nhowever if you plan on shooting the hell out of your shotgun then you would definitely be served with a Baikal. regular or sporting, take you pick based on whatever tickles your fancy.\r\n\r\nI wish I could recommend you a single shotgun for hunting, skeet, HD, drive you to office, wash you car, recharge your cell phone''s battery, wash your dishes, cook, clean, shave and cut your hair but I just cant. ;)\r\n\r\nRegards.', ''),

While other birds come from far away lands like Siberia and northern territories , this bird with couple of others (Cranes i.e) travel to South Asian  Planes from a very close Tibetan plateau where they breed and raise there young''s.\r\nOne might also find it interesting that Bar headed geese is the Highest flying bird in the world which crosses the Great Himalayan ranges to enter Tibetan plateau right across the border in china  .\r\nthis is a very brief info about the bird ,\r\n\r\n[B]The reason no 1 ) :- [/B]\r\n\r\n As many of the hunters and wild life enthusiast already know about the great marshes and national park of Kaziranga India for new comers here is the easiest  link([url]http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaziranga_National_Park[/url]) kaziranga''s wetlands have helped 1000s of species of birds to grow and prosper in perfect condition''s and every year new species of birds head to that area for spending the winters , this same national park has seen increased number of Bar headed geese coming there every year because of the safety and other luxuries it provides to the birds , which has in fact given the Bar headed geese the much needed energy and rest for there very unique and stress full journey back home . \r\n\r\n[B]Reason no 2) :-[/B]\r\n\r\nIn simple words the same reason which has seen the increase monsoon rains is the reason for increase number of bar headed geese to successively complete there journey to Tibetan  plateau , more numbers reach the breeding grounds and more number of chicks being born then the cycle is again repeated with more number of birds again being able to pass the dreaded Himalayan ranges . \r\n(Please Note that  this part of my research is still not complete)  .\r\n\r\n[B]Reason no 3) :-[/B]\r\n\r\nThe people of Tibet specially Buddhist Monks and there  communities  have always been friend of nature and its inhabitants but for many decades the bar headed geese was used to be hunted mercilessly in there breeding grounds my Chinese poachers , thankfully in last couple of years the poaching has been brought down with the effort of Tibetan monks , the communities now even throw seeds and other food for the birds and give them a perfect environmental to breed and raise there chicks in relevant safety and ease , also here to mention is as sad reason that  the poaching of Tibetan wolf and foxes (who are the main predators the bird faces)  have also helped in increase the number of chicks which reach the adult hood . \r\n\r\nSo here are the three Main reason for the increase number of bar headed geese seen in last couple of years.\r\n\r\n [B]References:-[/B]\r\n This research has mainly been based on the finding of BBC Planet Earth , wwf , wetlands of south Asia, and Range office of Kaziranga .\r\n\r\nP.s i have tried the simplest of explanations possible so in any question please feel free to ask or add any info .[/QUOTE]\r\n Great effort arsalan bro....................looking forward for your input on @gunner''s query...................', ''),

(368445, ' @Punjtani5, bro, does the 22 mag com with the extra barrels? If so, that is a very good price. The so called pistol pacs, that is, the extra barrels and grips sets go for about $1000 used. \n\nJust wondering if you''ve used one of their target revolvers. I think your opinion would change.\n\n"An unforeseen benefit of this system was that it produces superb accuracy. The way it works is that the barrel is a threaded tube which fits into a shroud. Both ends of the rifled tube are threaded so that one end screws into the front of the frame while the other end is tightened against the end of the shroud with a recessed nut. An unforeseen result of this system is that the barrel tube is pulled tightly and put under tension. This barrel tube under tension is tuned like the string of a guitar to always vibrate the same way when fired. The guns swept long range pistol matches after their widespread adoption in the seventies, and continue to do so today. They could (and still can) out shoot any revolver or semiauto at distance. The only real competition for the Dan Wessons comes from single shot or bolt action pistols chambered for rifle cartridges, all of which are larger, heavier, harder to shoot, and have a much slower rate of fire.

While other birds come from far away lands like Siberia and northern territories , this bird with couple of others (Cranes i.e) travel to South Asian  Planes from a very close Tibetan plateau where they breed and raise there young''s.\r\nOne might also find it interesting that Bar headed geese is the Highest flying bird in the world which crosses the Great Himalayan ranges to enter Tibetan plateau right across the border in china  .\r\nthis is a very brief info about the bird ,\r\n\r\n[B]The reason no 1 ) :- [/B]\r\n\r\n As many of the hunters and wild life enthusiast already know about the great marshes and national park of Kaziranga India for new comers here is the easiest  link([url]http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaziranga_National_Park[/url]) kaziranga''s wetlands have helped 1000s of species of birds to grow and prosper in perfect condition''s and every year new species of birds head to that area for spending the winters , this same national park has seen increased number of Bar headed geese coming there every year because of the safety and other luxuries it provides to the birds , which has in fact given the Bar headed geese the much needed energy and rest for there very unique and stress full journey back home . \r\n\r\n[B]Reason no 2) :-[/B]\r\n\r\nIn simple words the same reason which has seen the increase monsoon rains is the reason for increase number of bar headed geese to successively complete there journey to Tibetan  plateau , more numbers reach the breeding grounds and more number of chicks being born then the cycle is again repeated with more number of birds again being able to pass the dreaded Himalayan ranges . \r\n(Please Note that  this part of my research is still not complete)  .\r\n\r\n[B]Reason no 3) :-[/B]\r\n\r\nThe people of Tibet specially Buddhist Monks and there  communities  have always been friend of nature and its inhabitants but for many decades the bar headed geese was used to be hunted mercilessly in there breeding grounds my Chinese poachers , thankfully in last couple of years the poaching has been brought down with the effort of Tibetan monks , the communities now even throw seeds and other food for the birds and give them a perfect environmental to breed and raise there chicks in relevant safety and ease , also here to mention is as sad reason that  the poaching of Tibetan wolf and foxes (who are the main predators the bird faces)  have also helped in increase the number of chicks which reach the adult hood . \r\n\r\nSo here are the three Main reason for the increase number of bar headed geese seen in last couple of years.\r\n\r\n [B]References:-[/B]\r\n This research has mainly been based on the finding of BBC Planet Earth , wwf , wetlands of south Asia, and Range office of Kaziranga .\r\n\r\nP.s i have tried the simplest of explanations possible so in any question please feel free to ask or add any info .[/QUOTE]\r\n \r\nwhat a shot brother!\r\nimpressive,i am waiting for the complete/detailed info (obviously when u get free from obligation of your institution)\r\nregards', ''),

Arslan tareen has put excellent input in resolving of this mystery and most aspect of this myth. \n\n  The reason I observed about heavy migration of this gigantic bird may be strange for most of the attendees here and everyone has right to differ my speculations.\n\n  This bird initially started visiting our region in smaller numbers and mostly seen in good numbers around maraala, tarbella and mangla since ever but after 2000 it started declining in considerable numbers.\n  However, started increasing considerably in Mian Ch&#8217;s mentioned areas. This bird mostly approaches first to Maraala Head travelling right over River TAVI from Himalayas and scatters, but now its priorities have changed.\n\n  WHY??? \n\n  This was the question which always has no reason for us but gradually I observed its behavior deeply and reached a speculation.\n\n  Since eighties I am a regular visitor of border belt especially starting from Shukargarh to Bhawalnagar. This bird has been reported since decade in these areas in normal number but their migration has increased in significant number since 2000. The times when we were regular visitors of Mian ch specified areas most of the areas where barren, full of bellas, wetlands and uncultivated but since last decade this situation has entirely changed and almost all these areas are fully cultivated and hardy any lands available barren. \n\n\n  Wheat fields are the paradise for this huge bird and they die for it. Since they start migrating in our region from early November the wheat cultivation has been done. This bird love to eat wheat plants of early age maximum upto six inches. Since border belt has been banned since 2005 for any kind of game so there&#8217;s hardly any interruption in their activities. So geese are free to ruin fields of the formers and many friends reported about their catastrophic visits. They change their fields when wheat plant reach to certain height and move to next field.\n\n  The specified areas under rangers control have become paradise for this bird due to wheat cultivations and they have started moving in greatest numbers every year and rampant migration is being observed. I am sure this migration will increase every year and we will see the authorities will consider for some special permission kind of things soon or oblige their concerns otherwise wheat fields will be distraught. \n\n  \nLast year few parties allowed to visit these areas especially from maraala, sharakgarh and norowal sectors and they scored mammoth bags because geese were not familiar with such a heavy interceptions since years in these rangers&#8217; occupied areas and enjoying ruining the wheat fields. \n\n  This bird migrate back from these areas after January because all wheat field (Pachettari etc.) also reaches to the safe height which they dislike easting. However, a considerable quantity then reaches dadyal where late cultivated land (Pachaitri wheat) plans area available for them for final encounter and back to Himalaya&#8217;s.    \n\n  I have heard that lot of landlords of area requested rangers about this menace and claimed they were damaging their crops more than boar so please allow them to shoot. These reports reached to DG who allowed some parties for some remedial measure but they killed the birds in hundreds which is totally unethical to some extent. \n\n  This is my personal observation in addition to arsalan tareen&#8217;s excellent investigations and may totally wrong.', ''),

More seasoned experts here may have a word on it. Mag release screw is separate.\n\n3) I trust harms of dry-firing are not 1911 specific, but general.

If a person knows what he/she is doing than there is nothing wrong using a soft mallet/hammer to seat a bullet. The most important step is the amount of charge (gun powder) used. Over charging is very dangerous since it produces dangerous pressures while under charging result in a weak cartridge. Subsonic rounds are reasonably undercharged but that is a whole different topic. \r\nSee the video below, it is normal for hand loaders to use a mallet to seat bullet.

(368776, 'My Saiga 12 So Far... Okay, so this is a work in progress; my Saiga 12 shotgun.\n\nI''ve converted this from a standard "sporting" configuration to the original pistol grip it was intended to have.  It was surprisingly easy to do, even for someone who has little experience with gunsmithing.  A dremel tool w/ grinding attachments, a hammer and punch, and a screwdriver I think were all it took.  Thanks to the Russians for making it so easy that I could convert this on my front porch!  Also, before installing the new fire control group, I was sure to polish the all the parts that would contact one another with the dremel tool polishing head.  This cuts down on friction, making the gun''s action more reliable, and gives a smoother trigger pull.\n\nAs it is shown in the picture, the S12 is outfitted in a Polish Beryl folding stock, standard Russian RPK pistol grip, and FAL heavy barrel foregrip.  However, this picture is months old and I''ve removed the folding stock, as it is too small.  I''ll keep it maybe in case of emergencies (zombies), but I really prefer a larger fixed stock anyway.  Right now the whole thing has been torn down to pieces and is being refinished.  More on that when it is done.\n\nI took it out to test it a few months ago.  I was a little nervous as these guns have sometimes been known to either fail to feed or eject, for a number of different reasons.  As it turns out, mine worked just fine, feeding from a variety of magazines and a 20 round drum without failure or complaint.  Of course, I was only shooting 00 buck and slugs, so I don''t know how well it functions on the weaker target loads.  I''ll try that next time, but I''ve bought a US-made adjustable gas plug that should make it eat anything I want to feed it.  We have a variety of very good aftermarket parts available for these guns that are better than what it originally came with.\n\nAfter I ran it through it''s rounds to make sure it would hit the broadside of a barn, it was time for fun: rapid firing.  I could empty a 10 rd mag so fast that I really couldn''t believe I''d just fired that many!  However, the proof was in the shredded targets.  Amazing, even ridiculous firepower. :) \n\nYes, a very fun gun.  Okay, maybe my shoulder didn''t think it was so fun as the padding was really insufficient for the amount of rounds I put downrange in a very short time, but I didn''t let that get in the way of a great range day with a good firearm.', ''),

(368788, ' [QUOTE=Topak;207449]good gun.people say its ammu sensitive, what you think ?[/QUOTE]\r\n\r\nMy understanding is the Russians designed this thing as a military/police gun that would only need to fire combat loads, 00 buck and slugs.  It''s gas ports are restricted for these heavy pressures, and it was only after it was released for the civilian market that they realized the need to open the gas flow up a bit for lighter loads.  That is why the ones we buy have the adjustable gas plug, which can be set for target rounds.  From my discussions with many others on this, most S12s will shoot okay with target loads when the gas is adjusted, and those that don''t can usually be fixed fairly easily to do so.  It might be best to assume these guns are "projects" that will require a bit of tuning-up to get them shooting perfectly, but they will do so with a bit of attention.\r\n\r\nSadly, there are a small number of individual S12s that have a bigger problem, what we call "Vodka Specials" after the presumed state of drunkenness of the worker at the factory.  Gas ports that aren''t drilled properly, parts that aren''t machined to the proper tolerances, etc.  Its a small quality control problem there, but it doesn''t happen to often.  Still, if you get a Vodka Special, you may have a problem getting it to run properly.  It can be fixed, but with more work.', ''),

This S12 will be no exception when I''m done.\n\nYes, the S12 is an extremely popular shotgun in the US, for a few reasons, but one over all: because it is I think our first commonly available detachable box magazine fed shotgun.  Box magazine fed plus semiauto means a huge amount of sustained firepower.  We had a few semi-auto shotguns in the US for a long time (such as the SPAS 12 you mention), but they all fed from a tube mag which is limited to the length of the barrel.  So while the SPAS is very well built quality wise, at the end of your 9 rounds, you have to stop and load it all back up by hand, one shell at a time, taking several seconds even if you are fast.  When my Saiga is done with 9 shots, well, if I''m shooting from a drum I still have another 11 shots to go.  And when I''m done with those, I pull the drum out and slap in another; in about 3 seconds I''m firing again.  For a shotgun, the capacity is just mind boggling compared to what we''ve been used to.  Of course, there is possibly a price to be paid in reliability compared to the SPAS'' ability to switch to pump action as with any semi-auto, but once it is tuned-in, the S12 is still pretty reliable.  Also, as the magazine no longer relies on barrel length, you can chop this barrel down to amazingly small size to make a very maneuverable and concealable short-barreled shotgun without having any negative effect on capacity.  Some guys have made Krinkov style S12s that are maybe 18" overall with the stock folded.  Can''t do that with a tube-fed gun without ending up being able to shoot only 3 shots. \n\nAlso, until recently the basic S12 has been pretty cheap here, in the $500US range, give or take $50, which had made it very accessible to most people.  This has changed as of several months ago when the ATF, our government agency that regulates firearms, made gestures as if it were going to ban the importation of these, and stopped issuing import permits.  Suddenly there was a run at the gun store of people trying to buy them up while they could.  Prices almost doubled within a week.  However, shortly after this the ATF found itself with some very seriously bad publicity due to some ugly actions it took in regard to US weapon smuggling into Mexico (google "project gunrunner" and "operation fast and furious" for details), and in the wave of public anger that followed has maybe decided to not kick the S12 hornet''s nest right now. So the ban many of us expected has not happened.  Still, prices have not gone down to their original low levels, but the ban threat only seems to have introduced more people to the gun and it is as popular as ever.  \n\nWith the success of the S12, gun makers have discovered the new US appetite for large-capacity shotguns, and so we''ve recently started building or importing the MKA-1919, the KSG 12, the SMR, and maybe the importation of the UTS-15.  It looks to be a very good next couple of years for us in the combat shotgun department here!', ''),

On the other hand, if I had to choose a personal handgun for the range or home defense, the M1911 would be near the top of my list.\n\nSlightly obsolete or not, a man doesn''t carry a M1911 because it is objectively the best handgun for all purposes.  But then a man who drives a classic Jaguar sportscar doesn''t do so because he needs transportation from points A to B, and isn''t worried that there are cars made today that might have better mileage, performance, etc.  A man who drives that car does so because he is someone who admires a classic form, and presumably knows how to get the best out of it.  I think a man who prefers an M1911 is someone who also appreciates tradition as well as function, something that is lacking in a world full of plastic receivers and newfangled features.\n\nDon''t be discouraged from owning a M1911 just because it isn''t the cutting edge of today''s technology.

(369038, ' To all the hutners\n\nA.A\n\nFor the information of barheaded geese:\n\n\nThe summer habitat is high altitude lakes where the bird grazes on short grass. The species has been reported as migrating south from China, Kazakhstan, Mongolia and Russia before crossing the Himalaya. The bird has come to the attention of medical science in recent years as having been an early victim of the H5N1 virus, HPAI (highly pathogenic avian influenza), at Qinghai. It suffers [URL="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Predation"]predation[/URL] from crows, foxes, [URL="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raven"]ravens[/URL], sea eagles, gulls and others. The total population may, however, be increasing[[I][URL="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed"]citation needed[/URL][/I]], but it is complex to assess population trends as this species occurs over more than 2.5 million square kilometres.\n The Bar-headed Goose is thought to be one of the world''s highest flying birds, having been heard flying across Mount Makalu (the fifth highest mountain on earth at 8,485 metres (27,838 ft)) and apparently seen over Mount Everest (29,029 feet (8,848 m), although this is a second hand report with no verification).[URL="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bar-headed_Goose#cite_note-1"][2][/URL] This incredibly demanding migration has long puzzled physiologists and naturalists: "there must be a good explanation for why the birds fly to the extreme altitudes &#8230; particularly since there are passes through the Himalaya at lower altitudes, and which are used by other migrating bird species" quoted from Black & Tenney (1980).[URL="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bar-headed_Goose#cite_note-2"][3][/URL] In fact bar-headed geese have never been directly tracked (using GPS or satellite logging technology) flying higher than 6,540 metres (21,460 ft), and it is now known that they apparently do take the passes through the mountains. The challenging northward migration from lowland India to breed in the summer on the Tibetan Plateau is undertaken in stages, with the flight across the Himalaya (from sea-level) being undertaken non-stop in as little as seven hours. Surprisingly, despite predictable tail winds that blow up the Himalayas (in the same direction of travel as the geese), bar-headed geese spurn these winds, waiting for them to die down overnight, when they then undertake the greatest rates of climbing flight ever recorded for a bird, and sustain these climbs rates for hours on end[URL="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bar-headed_Goose#cite_note-3"][4][/URL].\n The bar-headed goose is known to be well equipped for this incredibly challenging migration. It has a slightly larger wing area for its weight than other geese, which is believed to help the goose fly at high altitudes.[URL="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bar-headed_Goose#cite_note-4"][5][/URL] Studies have found that they breathe more deeply and efficiently under low oxygen conditions[URL="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bar-headed_Goose#cite_note-5"][6][/URL] The [URL="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemoglobin"]haemoglobin[/URL] of their blood has a higher oxygen affinity than that of other geese.[URL="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bar-headed_Goose#cite_note-6"][7][/URL]\n The Bar-headed Goose [URL="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird_migration"]migrates[/URL] over the [URL="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Himalayas"]Himalayas[/URL] to spend the winter in parts of [URL="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India"]India[/URL] (from [URL="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assam"]Assam[/URL] to as far south as [URL="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tamil_Nadu"]Tamil Nadu[/URL].[URL="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bar-headed_Goose#cite_note-7"][8][/URL] The winter habitat of the Bar-headed Goose is cultivated fields, where it feeds on barley, rice and wheat, and may damage crops. Birds from Kyrgyzstan have been noted to stopover in western Tibet and southern Tajikistan for 20 to 30 days before migrating further south. Some birds may show high wintering site fidelity.[URL="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bar-headed_Goose#cite_note-8"][9][/URL]\n  [URL="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Bar-headed_Geese_%28Anser_indicus%29_with_Glossy_Ibis_%28Plegadis_falcinellus%29_at_Bharatpur_I_IMG_5647.jpg"][IMG]http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e4/Bar-headed_Geese_%28Anser_indicus%29_with_Glossy_Ibis_%28Plegadis_falcinellus%29_at_Bharatpur_I_IMG_5647.jpg/220px-Bar-headed_Geese_%28Anser_indicus%29_with_Glossy_Ibis_%28Plegadis_falcinellus%29_at_Bharatpur_I_IMG_5647.jpg[/IMG][/URL]  [URL="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Bar-headed_Geese_%28Anser_indicus%29_with_Glossy_Ibis_%28Plegadis_falcinellus%29_at_Bharatpur_I_IMG_5647.jpg"][IMG]http://bits.wikimedia.org/skins-1.17/common/images/magnify-clip.png[/IMG][/URL]\n \n The bird is pale grey and is easily distinguished from any of the other grey geese of the genus [I][URL="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anser_%28genus%29"]Anser[/URL][/I] by the black bars on its head. It is also much paler than the other geese in this genus. In flight, its call is a typical goose honking. The adult is 71&#8211;76 centimetres (28&#8211;30 in) and weighs 1.87&#8211;3.2 kilograms (4.1&#8211;7.1 lb).\n It has sometimes been separated from [I]Anser[/I], which has no other member indigenous to the Indian region, nor any at all to the Ethiopian, Australian, or Neotropical regions, and placed in the [URL="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monotypic"]monotypic[/URL] [URL="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genus"]genus[/URL] [I][B]Eulabeia[/B][/I].\n They nest mainly on the Tibetan plateau. Intraspecific brood parasitism is noticed with lower rank females attempting to lay their eggs in the nests of higher ranking females.[URL="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bar-headed_Goose#cite_note-9"][10][/URL]\n The Bar-headed Goose is often kept in captivity, as it is considered beautiful and breeds readily. Records in [URL="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Britain"]Great Britain[/URL] are frequent, and almost certainly relate to escapes. However, the species has bred on several occasions in recent years and around five pairs were recorded in 2002, the most recent available report of the Rare Birds Breeding Panel. It is possible the species is becoming gradually more established in Great Britain. The bird is sociable and causes no problems for other birds.[[I][URL="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed"]citation neede[/URL][/I]] The "wild" population is believed to be declining in Great Britain due to over-hunting.[[I][URL="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed"]citation needed[/URL][/I]]\n\n[URL="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c3/Bar-headed_Geese_%28Anser_indicus%29-_Preening_%26_resting_at_Bharatpur_I_IMG_5672.jpg"][IMG]http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c3/Bar-headed_Geese_%28Anser_indicus%29-_Preening_%26_resting_at_Bharatpur_I_IMG_5672.jpg/800px-Bar-headed_Geese_%28Anser_indicus%29-_Preening_%26_resting_at_Bharatpur_I_IMG_5672.jpg[/IMG][/URL]\n\n\n[URL="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5a/Bar-headed_Geese_%28Anser_indicus%29_Scape_at_Bharatpur_I_IMG_5651.jpg"][IMG]http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5a/Bar-headed_Geese_%28Anser_indicus%29_Scape_at_Bharatpur_I_IMG_5651.jpg/800px-Bar-headed_Geese_%28Anser_indicus%29_Scape_at_Bharatpur_I_IMG_5651.jpg[/IMG][/URL]\n\n\n[URL="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/60/Bar-headed_Geese_%28Anser_indicus%29_at_Bharatpur_I_IMG_5666.jpg"][IMG]http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/60/Bar-headed_Geese_%28Anser_indicus%29_at_Bharatpur_I_IMG_5666.jpg[/IMG][/URL]\n[URL="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/56/Bar-headed_Geese_%28Anser_indicus%29_at_Bharatpur_I_IMG_5637.jpg"][IMG]http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/56/Bar-headed_Geese_%28Anser_indicus%29_at_Bharatpur_I_IMG_5637.jpg/800px-Bar-headed_Geese_%28Anser_indicus%29_at_Bharatpur_I_IMG_5637.jpg[/IMG][/URL]\n\n\n[URL="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/6f/Bar-headed_Geese-_Bharatpur_I_IMG_8337.jpg"][IMG]http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/6f/Bar-headed_Geese-_Bharatpur_I_IMG_8337.jpg[/IMG][/URL]\n[URL="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/95/Bar-headed_Geese-_Bharatpur_I_IMG_8335.jpg"][IMG]http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/95/Bar-headed_Geese-_Bharatpur_I_IMG_8335.jpg[/IMG][/URL]\n\n[URL="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f2/Ba-_headed_Geese-_Bharatpur_I2_IMG_8254.jpg"][IMG]http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f2/Ba-_headed_Geese-_Bharatpur_I2_IMG_8254.jpg[/IMG][/URL]\n\n[URL="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/74/Bar-headed_Geese_%28Anser_indicus%29_in_beautiful_formation_at_Bharatpur_I_IMG_5653.jpg"][IMG]http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/74/Bar-headed_Geese_%28Anser_indicus%29_in_beautiful_formation_at_Bharatpur_I_IMG_5653.jpg[/IMG][/URL]\n\n\n\n[URL="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e3/Bar-headed.goose.slimbridge.arp.jpg"][IMG]http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e3/Bar-headed.goose.slimbridge.arp.jpg/800px-Bar-headed.goose.slimbridge.arp.jpg[/IMG][/URL]', ''),

(629614, 'A day out at the Rangers Shooting &amp; Saddle Club I am rather new to the professional gun community of Pakistan, having possessed a weapon for a period of long time, i have never had the chance to use a civilian gun range previously.  The forum has been really helpful in narrowing down my choices, so i decided to share my experience with fellow members regarding the  Rangers Shooting & Saddle Club. \n\nFirstly the range is really easily accessible, in terms of getting their from my house which is located near Karachi University , compared to the other places, including the airmen club and Arabian sea club, which are both rather far away from my house and also are not really located in areas which are considered very safe, both the airmen club and Arabian sea club facilities are located in very volatile areas, where some thing or the other goes wrong every now and then.\n\nAnother huge factor is that when you are going to the  Rangers Shooting & Saddle Club, you have to cross the toll plaza and both side of the road is covered by different LEA officials, we were pulled over by rangers officials on our way back to home, after spending a leisurely morning at the range, however, once we informed the officials we were members at the club, we were treated very professional and courteously. \n\nFirst impression:\n\nThe minute you enter the cool shade of the club''s admin block, even when you are making arrangements (paying charges for using the range etc) you will witness the military proficiency of the staff, out of no where, emerges a bus boy with a glass of "CHILLED" mineral water, served on a tray and a Doyle, call me a snob, but WHOA!!!! that made me feel really good, the staff at the range is extremely courteous, honest and very very helpful, from the admin to the range, the staff was the high point of my day, every one was constantly checking whether you wanted tea, water or any other refreshment. The instructors at the range even helped me set my gun sights, reload my magazines and offered their advise and assistance in ensuring i had a perfect stance and grip for using my guns. Being my first experience at a Civilian gun range in Karachi, i must say, the 25 meter pistol range is pretty decent, i am not going to compare it with any other places abroad, however, it was far better then the one i have seen at the Arabian Sea Club and airmen club, i cannot give my opinion about the Karsaz range, because i am yet to visit that.\n\nThe Showdown:\n\nThe 25 meter pistol range has 6 shooting stalls, each equipped with its own target display system, however, the display system did need a lot of effort on my part and later on the staff to adjust it for me, that was the only turn off realistically i had in the entire trip. \n\nThe shooting range staff under a Major Maaz of the Sindh rangers, has made sure that strict safety procedures are opted, and the instructors were very professional and polite but at the same time tolerated no horseplay whatsoever, that seemed made me feel really good, that these guys are very serious about safety.\n\nAlso to my surprise the club had ear muffs available (since i had forgotten my entire bag at home containing the ear muffs, eye protection and some extra ammo) also the range has ammo available at subsidised rates for Rifle, pistol and shotgun. \n\nThe club also features a rifle range, designed for any kind of rifle shooting and it could facilitate  a shot set out at 270 meters.\n\nThe Skeet shooting range also is pretty darn decent, again the staff was very helpful and cooperative. Considering the fact that these facilities are used for competitive shooting tournaments, my humble opinion about the facilities is very good and i can easily compare it with any budget shooting range in the US or Canada.\n\nThe membership process is also fairly simply and less problematic , unlike the Karsaz shooting range that requires tons of paper work, the Rangers Shooting & Saddle Club only need basic paper work like copy of CNIC and licenses. The membership cost itself is rather cheap comparatively, the club has defined 2 packages, one will cost a life time fees of 200,000 and then 3000 p/m for maintenance and the 2nd being  a life time fees of 180,000 and then 5000 p/m for maintenance.\n\nThe club members have access to their own lockers and it also houses a changing area, a cafeteria and a souvenir shop.  the cafeteria isn''t much but does have a really nice "KARAK" cup of tea. Also i know this will sound really cheesy, but the bathrooms at the joint were clean and well maintained. \n\n\nI shot around 90 round of my CF-98, 30 rounds of 5.56 and 30 rounds of a 12 gauge and it was a really nice experience all together. \n\nI hope this basic review of one of the facilities was helpful for members.\n\nCheers!', ''),

But then a man who drives a classic Jaguar sportscar doesn''t do so because he needs transportation from points A to B, and isn''t worried that there are cars made today that might have better mileage, performance, etc.  A man who drives that car does so because he is someone who admires a classic form, and presumably knows how to get the best out of it.  I think a man who prefers an M1911 is someone who also appreciates tradition as well as function, something that is lacking in a world full of plastic receivers and newfangled features.\n\nDon''t be discouraged from owning a M1911 just because it isn''t the cutting edge of today''s technology.  The "cutting edge" continues to move forward all the time, and whatever new-designed gun you buy will eventually be outdated in some respect anyway.  But a time-tested design like the M1911 is beyond the reach of passing fashion.[/QUOTE]\n \nYou sir have hit the nail with this post , a very clear point perfectly presented , M1911 and Browning Hi power , 2 hands guns that will clearly fail on many fronts when facing more modern lighter and advanced designs , but will beat hands down any hand gun on personal choice and Classic notes .\nI have never met a gun lover who knows a thing or two who does not already owns or have these two (specially M1911) on his wish list , One is the most Iconic hand gun the second is the most trusted and used  by the world militaries .', ''),

You have started a nice thread.......\n\n"Raiin" or " The Goral/ The Grey Goral" is a Goat definitely...... a very beautiful animal once roamed  commonly in most parts of the Hazara Division.... usually it is found from 1000 to 4000m altitudes.. both in lower mountainous terrain of Haripur to the alpine forests of the Kaghan Valley.It is relatively a small sized animal that''s why commonly locals call it a '' BAKRI" OR "TEDY BAKRI" along with its common name of "RAAIIN" through out the region, and  undoubtedly like any other goat it has some remarkable climbing and running skills on the slopes.\n\nOnce it was in good numbers on the bordering mountainous range of Tarbela Dam along with many other bird species like seesee and chakors, but all these three are nearly vanished due to relatively easy approach and lot of hunting/poaching. In my limited knowledge still few groups are surviving in Khanpur range which is bordering the Margalla Hills.\n\nIn Kaghan valley a moderate population is surviving in Shogran range and specifically the "Malakandi Forest". In summer mostly it is not hunted, because of  many reasons but most obvious is that it remains in very difficult slopes or areas of the jungle. In winter locals usually hunt it in a party formation after heavy snow fall. The "ustaads" locate good passing spots on specific tracks in snow on which these animal move after heavy snow.Few hunters are placed on these spots and a good climber drives the animals from difficult area to that track and when the animals pass across any sitting hunter he takes his chance with mostly single barrel 12g shot gun having No.4 "wallaity cartoos" or SG.\n\nThe meat of the  harvested animal/animals is equally distributed among the party and the skin is dried and used mostly used as "Massalla/Jai-Namaz".\nIn Azad Kashmir the numbers of this animal is on higher side, two major factors one is due to presence of army in most of its habitat, where locals have some restrictions. secondly due to some good conservation work for the "MUSK DEER" which is also benefiting this specie.\n\nLast month we visited "Moji Game reserve" in leepa valley near "Dao khun" on an excursion trip. our host mentioned few road side spots for "Raaiin hunts" during winter.\nin Azad Kashmir locals use same hunting method and guns for this animal. Rifle shooting is only possible when one or more animals are trapped in a"Nalla"  or under a "Parrhi" (big rock) after an overnight heavy snow, but in this case it is very difficult to reach the spot within 200-300 yards for a shot and if done by any means retrieving the animal is another big task.........\n\nin the end one most important thing that =\n" hunting Raaiin is not legally authorised" so:frusty: .............', ''),

(369287, ' In the 1800s, people began to realize the advantages of rifling and started to make weapons with rifled barrels. The problems with rifling were, a Large bullet was difficult to insert into a rifle and a small bullet would escape gases around the bullet and decrease its range.\r\n\r\nConical Expanding Bullets discovery was due to Captain John Norton of the British 34th regiment, which was stationed in South India in the early 1830s. Captain Norton had observed that some of the tribes in South India used blow-pipes,he noticed an interesting fact that the base of these darts were made of an elastic pith (pith is the soft spongy wood found in the center of tree trunks). When the tribesman blew in the pipe, the pith base would expand and form a tight seal, thereby preventing air leaks and increasing the range of the weapon. Captain Norton decided to copy the same principle for bullets as well and invented a cylindrical bullet with a hollow base in 1832.\r\n\r\nA few years later in 1836, Mr. William Greener, a well-known London gunmaker, improved on the Norton bullet by making a design known as the conoidal expanding bullet.', ''),

(369351, ' [QUOTE=M.ASIF KHAN;207951]In the 1800s, people began to realize the advantages of rifling and started to make weapons with rifled barrels. The problems with rifling were, a Large bullet was difficult to insert into a rifle and a small bullet would escape gases around the bullet and decrease its range.\r\n\r\nConical Expanding Bullets discovery was due to Captain John Norton of the British 34th regiment, which was stationed in South India in the early 1830s. Captain Norton had observed that some of the tribes in South India used blow-pipes,he noticed an interesting fact that the base of these darts were made of an elastic pith (pith is the soft spongy wood found in the center of tree trunks). When the tribesman blew in the pipe, the pith base would expand and form a tight seal, thereby preventing air leaks and increasing the range of the weapon. Captain Norton decided to copy the same principle for bullets as well and invented a cylindrical bullet with a hollow base in 1832.\r\n\r\nA few years later in 1836, Mr. William Greener, a well-known London gunmaker, improved on the Norton bullet by making a design known as the conoidal expanding bullet.[/QUOTE]\r\n \r\nThanks for your input Asif brother.

(369353, ' I remember I used to use cheap Desi pellets in my first airgun, a Chinese break-barrel which I bought about 8 years ago at the age or about 7. Till 2 years ago I sticked to these pellets and sometimes Chinese ones. From then onwards I used Irani and Afghani pellets  in cheaper airguns and recently started using good quality imported pellets in my 350 magnum. Back then, I used to get Desi pellets by the name of ''Tiger'',''peacock'','' shaheen'',''diamond'', etc. I used to get budget packs of 450-500 pellets for Rs 50/- from Sports shops in Jinnah Super Mkt Islamabad. I remember out of a box of 500 pellets, about 250-300 would either be too large to fit in the chamber of my China .22 or either slipped down the barrel while reloading. I extensively hunted with that rifle at a young age and went to various areas of Punjab and used to shoot doves and small birds very easily with the airgun and pellets. I even remember my bro killed a mongoose with it. At that time, accuracy was not a issue as the game-bag depended on my confidence and aim.. To supplement my passion for hunting, my dad got me a Diana model 22 in .177cal for about 11k rupees about 5-6 years ago but that was a bad experience and the airgun is down till now. This was accompanied by many Chinese/ Desi airguns till 1.5 months back when I got a RWS Diana 350 magnum. Now I am using no other pellets than Gamo pro-magnum, Crosman''s, H&N''s etc.....\nI also remember 2 years back I got 4 tins of H&N competition pellets (500 pellets in each tin) for Rs 500/- each from Shabbir Bro''s Sahiwal......

Endurance testing demonstrated a service life of over 30,000 rounds of +P ammunition. To meet the reliability requirement, the pistol had to demonstrate a minimum of 2,000 mean rounds between stoppages (MRBS) with both M1911 ball and +P ammunition. All pistols exceeded the 2000 MRBS with an average of 6000 MRBS. In more than 450 accuracy test firings from a precision firing fixture at 25 meters, MK 23 pistols far exceeded the government requirement, averaging 1.44 inches, with 65 groups of less than one inch.

(369442, ' What Is A Shotgun Choke?\r\n\r\nA choke is simply a tapered constriction of the gun barrel’s bore at the muzzle end. The exit end of the choke is smaller by some dimension than the actual bore of the barrel. This difference is the amount of constriction. For example if the bore of the barrel is .730 and the exit dia of the choke is .710 you have a constriction of .020. The amount of constriction for a given degree of choke will also vary between manufacturers but as a general rule for standard chokes the total range will be between .000 and .045 thousandths of an inch. In the case of special purpose turkey chokes it can be as much as .100  or 1/10th of an inch. The length of the choke can vary as well. Most, but not all chokes will have an overall length of between 1.5 and 4 inches.\r\n\r\nThey can be grouped in 3 general types:\r\n\r\n1-  Fixed chokes- They are made as an integral part of the barrel and cannot be readily changed except by a gunsmith and any alteration is considered permanent.\r\n\r\n2-     Interchangeable chokes- These can be of the ‘screw on” style which is externally attached or the “screw in” which is recessed into the barrel. To change the degree of constriction you simply remove and replace with a choke of a different diameter.\r\n\r\n3-     Adjustable chokes- This style of choke is adjustable throughout the entire range by turning a sleeve, which collapses or allows a collet to expand thus changing the exit diameter. A popular choke of this type is the Polychoke.\r\n\r\nThe internal design of chokes can also be broken down into three main groups:\r\n\r\n1-     Conical Parallel- They have a cone that blends into a parallel section which helps to stabilize the shot charge as it leaves the choke.\r\n\r\n2-     Straight Conical- This has a cone only. Where the cone stops is the point where the shot exits the choke.\r\n\r\n3-     Wad Retarding-They do not have the constriction in the same manner as either of the above designs but instead use bumps or projections to alter the shot pattern. \r\n\r\nThe most common design in use is the conical parallel. All Trulock Chokes are of this design.\r\n\r\nShotgun Patterns\r\n\r\nPatterns are normally expressed as a percentage such as 50%, 60%, 70% ect.  This is the commonly accepted method comparing pattern density. In a 50% pattern ½ of all the pellets contained in the shell will strike inside of a circle of 30 inches in diameter. To find the percentage of any given load divide the number of hits inside the circle by the total number of pellets contained in the shell. You can obtain the approximate number of pellets any given load will have from a shotgun shell reloading book or you can open a couple of shells and actually count the pellets. All pattern testing is done at a distance of 40 yards with the exception of cylinder and skeet 1 chokes in all gauges and all chokes for the .410 bore which are normally measured at 25 yards.\r\n\r\nThe purpose for this is to allow you to select a choke that will throw a pattern that is as large as possible without having the pellets so far apart that the target can escape multiple hits. For shooting both game and clay targets you want a pattern that is perfectly even in pellet distribution over the 30-inch circle. Having said that, and after looking at thousands of patterns over a span of 25 years I could count on my fingers the number that I would call perfect and if these were measured close enough they would not have qualified. In this instance “very close” is good enough. Two exceptions to the preceding would be buckshot and turkey patterns. With both of these you are looking for a tight center cluster of pellets.\r\n\r\nOne thing to remember –The only thing that is consistent about shotguns is that very few things are consistent. Identical guns with the same degree of choke and using the same shell may not pattern the same. The same load between various brands of shells can pattern differently. Patterns will change when changing from  hard to soft shot. Patterns can change when anything in the shell changes such as different wads, powders or primers. What I am trying to get across is that when you change anything such as brands, shot size, or components you will need to check the pattern as it could have changed, sometimes by an extreme amount.\r\n\r\nOnce you find a choke/shell combination that gives you the pattern you want it should remain reasonably consistent as long as nothing is changed. I am satisfied as long as the percentage stays within a 5% plus or minus deviation.\r\n\r\nThe chart shows the relationship between the degree of choke, the percentage and constriction based on lead shot. Keep in mind that the percentages are a guide only. What you actually want is a pattern that is dense enough to insure multiple hits on your target at the distance you normally shoot.\r\n\r\nChoke	Constriction	Percent\r\nCylinder	.000	40 at 40 yds.\r\n70 at 25 yds\r\nSkeet 1	.005	45 at 40 yds.\r\n75 at 25 yds.\r\nImproved  Cylinder	.010	50\r\nSkeet 2 (light Mod.)	.015	55\r\nModified	.020	60\r\nImproved Modified	.025	65\r\nFull	.030	70\r\nExtra Full	.040	73\r\nTurkey	.045 plus	75 plus\r\nKeep in mind that this chart should be used as a starting point only. Select the choke and pattern it. Change chokes or loads as needed to get the pattern you want. If you do not pattern your gun please feel free to accept this chart as being infallible.\r\n\r\nHow To Pattern\r\n\r\nI like to use paper that measures 4 feet square. Paper this size may be hard to find locally.\r\n\r\nIf it is not available try taping several sheets of butcher paper together. The reason for the large paper is that if your gun does not shoot to the point of aim part of your pattern could be off of the target with a small paper and you could confuse this with a bad pattern. If it helps you, mark the target center for use as an aiming point. I prefer to use a rest when shooting. If you do make sure the gun is not touching any hard object. The reason for using a rest is that it helps remove some of the variables. From the correct distance shoot at the center of the target.  I would do this a minimum of  5 times on different targets with each shell or choke that is being tested. You will need to draw a 30-inch circle around the most dense portion of the pattern on each target. Count the pellets inside of the circle. Divide this number by the total number of shot contained in the shell and you will have your percentage. Average your percentage by the total number of shots fired with the particular shell or choke to obtain your overall average. Sounds like a royal pain doesn’t it? It is, but there are no short cuts if you really want to know what your shotgun is doing.\r\n\r\nAfter you have finished look carefully at each pattern for holes that are big enough to let your intended target slip through. You want a dense enough pattern to ensure multiple hits.\r\n\r\nSteel Shot/Waterfowl Chokes\r\n\r\nMuch has changed over the years with steel loadings. The quality and consistency of the shells has been greatly improved. However, the fact that steel shot exerts much more stress on choke tubes has not changed. The problem is that steel shot is much harder than lead. It will transmit much more energy to the choke when it strikes the conical portion and if the tube is not of sufficient strength it will cause it to deform. This is known as “choke creep”\r\n\r\nOver a period of time choke creep can lock a choke in the barrel so that it is next to impossible to remove. All Trulock Chokes are rated for use with steel shot from cylinder bore through improved modified with the exception of the Tru-Choke S.D. which are not recommended for any shot other than lead. In addition our Super Waterfowl Choke was designed especially for steel and all other environmentally friendly shot.\r\n\r\nIt is strongly suggested that you use our Extended Precision Hunter style choke for steel shot as they normally give a superior pattern over the flush style chokes.\r\n\r\nClose Range –approximately out to 30 yards  - Skt 1= pattern percentage of about 55% Medium range- approximately out to 35 yards-Skt 2 [light mod] =pattern percentage of 65%\r\n\r\nLong Range-35yards and further- Improved Modified =pattern percentage of 75%\r\n\r\nExtreme Range= Super Waterfowl series\r\n\r\nThese suggestions should be used as a starting point and should not be taken as a substitute for patterning your shotgun.\r\n\r\nAlternative Alloy Shot- These are recommendations for Trulock Chokes only\r\n\r\nTungsten Iron- Treat this shot the same as steel\r\nTungsten Polymer- Treat this shot the same as lead\r\n|Hevi-Shot- Treat this shot the same as lead\r\nBismuth –Treat this shot the same as lead\r\n\r\nTurkey Chokes\r\n\r\nWe make a wide assortment of chokes that fall under this heading. No one choke works well in all guns with all loads but one thing has to be consistent, the shot shell. You will have to shoot premium factory loads or assemble your hand loads with the best components available in order to get good dense patterns at long range. While this basically holds true for all shotgunning it is especially so when hunting turkeys. You have a very small kill zone even when the bird is up close and it is imperative that you know exactly what your shotgun and shell is capable of doing. In testing different shells we have found that as a rule, two combinations work very well, factory loaded Hevi-Shot and factory loaded shells with buffered high antimony plated shot. These two loads normally work better than anything else, but patterning is needed to see which load your gun likes the best.\r\n\r\nTo get a dense pattern with a tight center you will need the Precision Hunter style choke. Our three most popular chokes have exit diameters of .670, .665 and .660. Although some shotguns like a .680 generally one of the above ends up working better. We also make a.650 and .640 but these are better suited to card shooting and not live bird hunting as they like smaller shot #8 better. The smallest exit diameter does not always give the most dense pattern. We find that the smaller the exit diameter the more erratic the patterns. Normally one particular load will pattern considerably better than the rest. Let me repeat that you will be wasting your time to shoot a cheaply made or promotional type shell. We have patterned Hevi-Shot and have really good results with their #6 shot in the .670 turkey. In fact we had several patterns going 60% at 70 yards with  #2 shot.\r\n\r\nSuggested turkey chokes and shot size\r\n\r\n.670 #4 lead and #6 Hevi-Shot\r\n.665 #5 lead\r\n.660 #6 lead\r\n\r\nChoke Cleaning\r\n\r\nIdeally chokes should be cleaned each time the gun is used. Plastic fouling and powder residue will build up in screw in chokes much faster than in fixed choke guns. Powder fouling will also work between the choke and the choke counter bore in the barrel. Remove the choke and clean with a toothbrush using some sort of solvent. We use and suggest Choke Shine as a cleaner. Simply, drop the choke into the solution for a short time and it will come out with the fouling dissolved. Clean the inside of the barrel with a cleaner/lubricant such as Clenzoil (1-800-OIL-IT-UP) making sure the threads do not have any residue, lightly wipe the choke with oil and reassemble.\r\n\r\nRemember that rust can occur in the barrel and freeze a choke in place even if the choke is made from stainless steel. Waterfowl hunters should pay particular attention to keeping the choke and barrel clean.\r\n\r\nChoke Tightness\r\n\r\nAlthough this seems like a no brainer we believe that there is a proper way to install a choke tube. When changing a choke in the field or at the range, wipe the choke with a clean rag to keep grit, dirt, ect. from being ground into the threaded area of the choke/barrel. Finger tighten and then use a wrench that properly fits the tube to finish tightening using a moderate amount of pressure. This will help keep the choke from loosening up when in use. The wad can hang on the rear edge of a choke that is loose and cause damage to both choke and barrel. Most chokes will loosen up if they are left finger tight. A perfectly clean, dry choke installed in a clean, dry barrel and moderately tightened with a wrench should not work loose. Most shooters are better off to make sure that there is a light coating of oil on the choke before installing as this will help prevent rust in the barrel. All choke should be checked occasionally for tightness.', ''),

(369452, ' [QUOTE=M.ASIF KHAN;207951]In the 1800s, people began to realize the advantages of rifling and started to make weapons with rifled barrels. The problems with rifling were, a Large bullet was difficult to insert into a rifle and a small bullet would escape gases around the bullet and decrease its range.\n\nConical Expanding Bullets discovery was due to Captain John Norton of the British 34th regiment, which was stationed in South India in the early 1830s. Captain Norton had observed that some of the tribes in South India used blow-pipes,he noticed an interesting fact that the base of these darts were made of an elastic pith (pith is the soft spongy wood found in the center of tree trunks). When the tribesman blew in the pipe, the pith base would expand and form a tight seal, thereby preventing air leaks and increasing the range of the weapon. Captain Norton decided to copy the same principle for bullets as well and invented a cylindrical bullet with a hollow base in 1832.\n\nA few years later in 1836, Mr. William Greener, a well-known London gunmaker, improved on the Norton bullet by making a design known as the conoidal expanding bullet.[/QUOTE]\n\n\n@ Asif \n\nNice work again ............

(369457, ' [QUOTE=M.ASIF KHAN;208106]What Is A Shotgun Choke?\n\nA choke is simply a tapered constriction of the gun barrel’s bore at the muzzle end. The exit end of the choke is smaller by some dimension than the actual bore of the barrel. This difference is the amount of constriction. For example if the bore of the barrel is .730 and the exit dia of the choke is .710 you have a constriction of .020. The amount of constriction for a given degree of choke will also vary between manufacturers but as a general rule for standard chokes the total range will be between .000 and .045 thousandths of an inch. In the case of special purpose turkey chokes it can be as much as .100  or 1/10th of an inch. The length of the choke can vary as well. Most, but not all chokes will have an overall length of between 1.5 and 4 inches.\n\nThey can be grouped in 3 general types:\n\n1-  Fixed chokes- They are made as an integral part of the barrel and cannot be readily changed except by a gunsmith and any alteration is considered permanent.\n\n2-     Interchangeable chokes- These can be of the ‘screw on” style which is externally attached or the “screw in” which is recessed into the barrel. To change the degree of constriction you simply remove and replace with a choke of a different diameter.\n\n3-     Adjustable chokes- This style of choke is adjustable throughout the entire range by turning a sleeve, which collapses or allows a collet to expand thus changing the exit diameter. A popular choke of this type is the Polychoke.\n\nThe internal design of chokes can also be broken down into three main groups:\n\n1-     Conical Parallel- They have a cone that blends into a parallel section which helps to stabilize the shot charge as it leaves the choke.\n\n2-     Straight Conical- This has a cone only. Where the cone stops is the point where the shot exits the choke.\n\n3-     Wad Retarding-They do not have the constriction in the same manner as either of the above designs but instead use bumps or projections to alter the shot pattern. \n\nThe most common design in use is the conical parallel. All Trulock Chokes are of this design.\n\nShotgun Patterns\n\nPatterns are normally expressed as a percentage such as 50%, 60%, 70% ect.  This is the commonly accepted method comparing pattern density. In a 50% pattern ½ of all the pellets contained in the shell will strike inside of a circle of 30 inches in diameter. To find the percentage of any given load divide the number of hits inside the circle by the total number of pellets contained in the shell. You can obtain the approximate number of pellets any given load will have from a shotgun shell reloading book or you can open a couple of shells and actually count the pellets. All pattern testing is done at a distance of 40 yards with the exception of cylinder and skeet 1 chokes in all gauges and all chokes for the .410 bore which are normally measured at 25 yards.\n\nThe purpose for this is to allow you to select a choke that will throw a pattern that is as large as possible without having the pellets so far apart that the target can escape multiple hits. For shooting both game and clay targets you want a pattern that is perfectly even in pellet distribution over the 30-inch circle. Having said that, and after looking at thousands of patterns over a span of 25 years I could count on my fingers the number that I would call perfect and if these were measured close enough they would not have qualified. In this instance “very close” is good enough. Two exceptions to the preceding would be buckshot and turkey patterns. With both of these you are looking for a tight center cluster of pellets.\n\nOne thing to remember –The only thing that is consistent about shotguns is that very few things are consistent. Identical guns with the same degree of choke and using the same shell may not pattern the same. The same load between various brands of shells can pattern differently. Patterns will change when changing from  hard to soft shot. Patterns can change when anything in the shell changes such as different wads, powders or primers. What I am trying to get across is that when you change anything such as brands, shot size, or components you will need to check the pattern as it could have changed, sometimes by an extreme amount.\n\nOnce you find a choke/shell combination that gives you the pattern you want it should remain reasonably consistent as long as nothing is changed. I am satisfied as long as the percentage stays within a 5% plus or minus deviation.\n\nThe chart shows the relationship between the degree of choke, the percentage and constriction based on lead shot. Keep in mind that the percentages are a guide only. What you actually want is a pattern that is dense enough to insure multiple hits on your target at the distance you normally shoot.\n\nChoke	Constriction	Percent\nCylinder	.000	40 at 40 yds.\n70 at 25 yds\nSkeet 1	.005	45 at 40 yds.\n75 at 25 yds.\nImproved  Cylinder	.010	50\nSkeet 2 (light Mod.)	.015	55\nModified	.020	60\nImproved Modified	.025	65\nFull	.030	70\nExtra Full	.040	73\nTurkey	.045 plus	75 plus\nKeep in mind that this chart should be used as a starting point only. Select the choke and pattern it. Change chokes or loads as needed to get the pattern you want. If you do not pattern your gun please feel free to accept this chart as being infallible.\n\nHow To Pattern\n\nI like to use paper that measures 4 feet square. Paper this size may be hard to find locally.\n\nIf it is not available try taping several sheets of butcher paper together. The reason for the large paper is that if your gun does not shoot to the point of aim part of your pattern could be off of the target with a small paper and you could confuse this with a bad pattern. If it helps you, mark the target center for use as an aiming point. I prefer to use a rest when shooting. If you do make sure the gun is not touching any hard object. The reason for using a rest is that it helps remove some of the variables. From the correct distance shoot at the center of the target.  I would do this a minimum of  5 times on different targets with each shell or choke that is being tested. You will need to draw a 30-inch circle around the most dense portion of the pattern on each target. Count the pellets inside of the circle. Divide this number by the total number of shot contained in the shell and you will have your percentage. Average your percentage by the total number of shots fired with the particular shell or choke to obtain your overall average. Sounds like a royal pain doesn’t it? It is, but there are no short cuts if you really want to know what your shotgun is doing.\n\nAfter you have finished look carefully at each pattern for holes that are big enough to let your intended target slip through. You want a dense enough pattern to ensure multiple hits.\n\nSteel Shot/Waterfowl Chokes\n\nMuch has changed over the years with steel loadings. The quality and consistency of the shells has been greatly improved. However, the fact that steel shot exerts much more stress on choke tubes has not changed. The problem is that steel shot is much harder than lead. It will transmit much more energy to the choke when it strikes the conical portion and if the tube is not of sufficient strength it will cause it to deform. This is known as “choke creep”\n\nOver a period of time choke creep can lock a choke in the barrel so that it is next to impossible to remove. All Trulock Chokes are rated for use with steel shot from cylinder bore through improved modified with the exception of the Tru-Choke S.D. which are not recommended for any shot other than lead. In addition our Super Waterfowl Choke was designed especially for steel and all other environmentally friendly shot.\n\nIt is strongly suggested that you use our Extended Precision Hunter style choke for steel shot as they normally give a superior pattern over the flush style chokes.\n\nClose Range –approximately out to 30 yards  - Skt 1= pattern percentage of about 55% Medium range- approximately out to 35 yards-Skt 2 [light mod] =pattern percentage of 65%\n\nLong Range-35yards and further- Improved Modified =pattern percentage of 75%\n\nExtreme Range= Super Waterfowl series\n\nThese suggestions should be used as a starting point and should not be taken as a substitute for patterning your shotgun.\n\nAlternative Alloy Shot- These are recommendations for Trulock Chokes only\n\nTungsten Iron- Treat this shot the same as steel\nTungsten Polymer- Treat this shot the same as lead\n|Hevi-Shot- Treat this shot the same as lead\nBismuth –Treat this shot the same as lead\n\nTurkey Chokes\n\nWe make a wide assortment of chokes that fall under this heading. No one choke works well in all guns with all loads but one thing has to be consistent, the shot shell. You will have to shoot premium factory loads or assemble your hand loads with the best components available in order to get good dense patterns at long range. While this basically holds true for all shotgunning it is especially so when hunting turkeys. You have a very small kill zone even when the bird is up close and it is imperative that you know exactly what your shotgun and shell is capable of doing. In testing different shells we have found that as a rule, two combinations work very well, factory loaded Hevi-Shot and factory loaded shells with buffered high antimony plated shot. These two loads normally work better than anything else, but patterning is needed to see which load your gun likes the best.\n\nTo get a dense pattern with a tight center you will need the Precision Hunter style choke. Our three most popular chokes have exit diameters of .670, .665 and .660. Although some shotguns like a .680 generally one of the above ends up working better. We also make a.650 and .640 but these are better suited to card shooting and not live bird hunting as they like smaller shot #8 better. The smallest exit diameter does not always give the most dense pattern. We find that the smaller the exit diameter the more erratic the patterns. Normally one particular load will pattern considerably better than the rest. Let me repeat that you will be wasting your time to shoot a cheaply made or promotional type shell. We have patterned Hevi-Shot and have really good results with their #6 shot in the .670 turkey. In fact we had several patterns going 60% at 70 yards with  #2 shot.\n\nSuggested turkey chokes and shot size\n\n.670 #4 lead and #6 Hevi-Shot\n.665 #5 lead\n.660 #6 lead\n\nChoke Cleaning\n\nIdeally chokes should be cleaned each time the gun is used. Plastic fouling and powder residue will build up in screw in chokes much faster than in fixed choke guns. Powder fouling will also work between the choke and the choke counter bore in the barrel. Remove the choke and clean with a toothbrush using some sort of solvent. We use and suggest Choke Shine as a cleaner. Simply, drop the choke into the solution for a short time and it will come out with the fouling dissolved. Clean the inside of the barrel with a cleaner/lubricant such as Clenzoil (1-800-OIL-IT-UP) making sure the threads do not have any residue, lightly wipe the choke with oil and reassemble.\n\nRemember that rust can occur in the barrel and freeze a choke in place even if the choke is made from stainless steel. Waterfowl hunters should pay particular attention to keeping the choke and barrel clean.\n\nChoke Tightness\n\nAlthough this seems like a no brainer we believe that there is a proper way to install a choke tube. When changing a choke in the field or at the range, wipe the choke with a clean rag to keep grit, dirt, ect. from being ground into the threaded area of the choke/barrel. Finger tighten and then use a wrench that properly fits the tube to finish tightening using a moderate amount of pressure. This will help keep the choke from loosening up when in use. The wad can hang on the rear edge of a choke that is loose and cause damage to both choke and barrel. Most chokes will loosen up if they are left finger tight. A perfectly clean, dry choke installed in a clean, dry barrel and moderately tightened with a wrench should not work loose. Most shooters are better off to make sure that there is a light coating of oil on the choke before installing as this will help prevent rust in the barrel. All choke should be checked occasionally for tightness.[/QUOTE]\n\n\n   i think i have seen u somewhere Asif brother ....... hahahahahaha\n   \n     nice interpretation ... of chokes', ''),

Over/ F, Under/M\n\n  1-  2.75 " slug  with bead sight at 50 yards, 28 " barrel, M choke no worry.

A really hard shot.  [under barrel]\n\n i Assume its the maximum utility [ 70 yards ] with a smooth bore\n\n Modern slugs[rifled slugs like federal, fiochhi , Rottweile] are not  dependent upon old IC or C choke concept .... type of slug and rifling  tolerance on slug body decide it for specific choke.... i have observed  results from a full choke ... yes it effects accuracy[3" to 4" left of  bulls eye] but not ruins at 50 yards ..  i have mentioned target  deviation as well \n\npractice and gun control might improve above readings\n\n So bottom line ...

(369533, 'Firearms: A Material Possession with Generational Value When we assess our material possessions, or think in terms of passing them on to the next generation, it escapes our reasoning that often times, the possessions we value will not be valued by our offspring or beneficiaries in the same way we value them. For those of us that value our arms, it becomes evident that the physical properties of the arm itself are not entirely what strike at our core; it’s the associated feeling of liberty and free will that transcends our present state.\r\n\r\nFirearms are one of the few material possessions in existence that have the capacity to be used to liberate the oppressed, free the captive and prevent the deprivation of life when it is threatened by mortal harm. In essence, firearms owners have the capacity to prevent the depravation of life, as well as ensuring the preservation of liberty and free will. Therefore, it can be asserted that firearms have a concurrent value; by preserving a life of free choice and preventing the deprivation of your mortal existence.\r\n\r\nThe ownership of firearms is more than a material possession. It is more than being appreciative of the inherent value of the components and it is more than the enjoyment of recreational shooting; it is the knowledge that our free will and our present state can be preserved should the need arise.\r\n \r\n[url]http://www.chuckhawks.com/column57_generational_value.htm[/url]', ''),

There are products out there to oxidize aluminum to a black dull finish but it doesn''t last.  Hence the proper method is Anodizing for frames or Hard Anodizing - the finishes may be called various names however, in the end its some sort of anodizing.  The slide is blued with oxidized finish.  The barrel is also oxidized blued.  The barrel should not be touching any sides of the slide during cycling especially not where I see the wear marks on your pictured barrel.  you should also try and feel the trigger let off this is difficult if you are a novice.  Then there are the machining marks on the slide where the safety sits; i have never seen them on the real thing however anomalies do happen.  Also, original Beretta magazines have thick aluminum base plates - yours seem to be plastic sooo if nothing else the magazines are fake thats for sure.  The grips seem to be almost accurate but are not crisp in checkering plus the corners seem out of round (improper shape).  You should know that a company like Beretta does NOT allow for aesthetic mistakes.\nLastly there is the price issue - if you paid under 120k for the pistol - then its probably either stolen or a fake.... remember NOTHING in life is free.', ''),

Nice to see Naveed sharpshooting from 70 mtrs, excellent hits, no doubts. Impressive!\n\nNow, a bit of "technicalities". Whether relevant to the topic discussed or not, would you kindly let know the specifics of proof testing of DSA slugger? Is proof testing of our local shotguns of this type below or above 1200Kg/sq.cm? If at par or above this level, what made you leave out the Hatsan Slug Auto?\n\nFurthermore, if MV is not seriously affected by use of these slugs in 24 gr skeet loads, it would be great to see you accomplish crimping that one too, as I feel it would allow occasional use of these slugs in most shotguns without any harms, as usually feared by shotgun owners.\n\nOnce again, a great teamwork there in Sialkot, excellent!\n\n\nRegards.', ''),

(369617, ' Respected Prince Sb,\r\n\r\nYou exactly explained the reason which was in my mind and this might be a misconception but this is so far the strongest opinion according to me. However I really respect the very logical and authentic reasons explained by Mr. Arslan Tareen.\r\n\r\nWhat i think is that Bar Headed Geese love the wheat fields and love their buds when they are just growing. These buds seems very soft and full of proteins. And geese can easily eat these low height buds and also can easily digest this energetic food. And this food is very easily available to them. When it grows up to their heads, it becomes tough and also difficult for geese to eat as they eat from the top of the grass.\r\n\r\nAnd according to me, wheat have very particular fragrance which attracts these birds towards our border areas. I can relate this with the observation that i have several times seen Hog Deer crossing the Chenab River and coming towards Pakistan''s posts just to eat this lavishing food. These Deer also face some danger and disturbance but still they prefer eating low height wheat crops.\r\n\r\nNow coming back to geese, this year i observed that when they listen to any firing sound, they just fly away as expected but at the same moment, they just cross the zero line and starts seeing you on the other side of zero line and once you step back, they just come back and start eating wheat buds. Here i must explain that the place where i observed this movement was full of wheat buds on Pakistan side but was marshy area and no wheat was grown on the other side of the Border.\r\n\r\nThis is my small observation and my opinion is based on my personal experience. This is an addition to the reasons said by Mr. Arslan Tareen. And i am just elaborating the point added by Prince Sb.\r\n\r\nWith Best Regards,\r\n\r\nHaris Bin Rafique,', ''),

(369697, ' [QUOTE=Haris Bin Rafique;208279]Respected Prince Sb,\n\nYou exactly explained the reason which was in my mind and this might be a misconception but this is so far the strongest opinion according to me. However I really respect the very logical and authentic reasons explained by Mr. Arslan Tareen.\n\nWhat i think is that Bar Headed Geese love the wheat fields and love their buds when they are just growing. These buds seems very soft and full of proteins. And geese can easily eat these low height buds and also can easily digest this energetic food. And this food is very easily available to them. When it grows up to their heads, it becomes tough and also difficult for geese to eat as they eat from the top of the grass.\n\nAnd according to me, wheat have very particular fragrance which attracts these birds towards our border areas. I can relate this with the observation that i have several times seen Hog Deer crossing the Chenab River and coming towards Pakistan''s posts just to eat this lavishing food. These Deer also face some danger and disturbance but still they prefer eating low height wheat crops.\n\nNow coming back to geese, this year i observed that when they listen to any firing sound, they just fly away as expected but at the same moment, they just cross the zero line and starts seeing you on the other side of zero line and once you step back, they just come back and start eating wheat buds. Here i must explain that the place where i observed this movement was full of wheat buds on Pakistan side but was marshy area and no wheat was grown on the other side of the Border.\n\nThis is my small observation and my opinion is based on my personal experience. This is an addition to the reasons said by Mr. Arslan Tareen. And i am just elaborating the point added by Prince Sb.\n\nWith Best Regards,\n\nHaris Bin Rafique,[/QUOTE]\n\nA.A\n\nI want to ask that there in Wazirabad is one accossiation of hunters and i recieved many invitations i remember it by seeing your location is now there any accossiation \nthere are many of my friends in it.', ''),

(369700, ' A.A\n\n\n\nFor information of all hunters\n\n\n\n\nThe [B]Himalayan Goral[/B] ([I]Naemorhedus goral[/I]), also known as the [B]Gray Goral[/B], is a small, ]rough-haired, cylindrical-horned [URL="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruminant"]ruminant[/URL] native to the [URL="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Himalayas"]Himalayas[/URL]. In the past, it was also known as [I]Urotragus goral[/I]. The [URL="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IUCN"]IUCN[/URL] classifies the Himalayan Goral as "Near Threatened".\n [B]Appearance[/B]\n\n The Himalayan Goral is typically 95-130 cm (37"-53") in length and weighs 35-42 kg (77-92 lb.). It has a gray or gray-brown coat with tan legs, lighter patches on its throat, and a single dark stripe along its spine. Males have short manes on their necks. Both males and females have backward-curving horns which can grow up to 18 cm (7") in length.\n In addition to certain peculiarities in the form of the [URL="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skull"]skull[/URL], [URL="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goral"]gorals[/URL] are chiefly distinguished from the closely-related [URL="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serow"]serows[/URL] in that they do not possess a [URL="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gland"]gland[/URL] below the [URL="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eye"]eye[/URL], nor a corresponding depression in the skull.\n [B]Ecology and distribution[/B]\n\n The Himalayan Goral is found in the forests of the [URL="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Himalayas"]Himalayas[/URL] and [URL="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindukush"]Hindukush[/URL], usually between 1000 and 4000 m in elevation. Groups of animals typically occupy a territory of about 100 acres (0.40 km2). The Himalayan Goral can live for 14 or 15 years. The female gives birth after a gestation period of 170-218 days, usually to a single offspring. The young are weaned at 7 or 8 months of age and reach sexual maturity at around 3 years.\n The Himalayan Goral often forms small bands of four to twelve individuals, although it is also known to pair off or, especially in the case of older males, be solitary. The animal is [URL="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crepuscular"]crepuscular[/URL], being most active in the early morning and late evening. After a morning meal, it often drinks and then rests on a rock ledge through the day. It feeds on leaves and associated softer parts of plants, mainly grasses[URL="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Himalayan_goral#cite_note-2"][3][/URL]\n The Himalayan Goral is very agile and can run quickly. Due to its coloration it is very well camouflaged, so that it is extremely difficult to sight it, especially since it spends much of the day lying still. However, it is hunted by various predators. When threatened, the Himalayan Goral will vocalize with hissing or sneezing sounds.', ''),

But at same time, Inertia semi autos require much much less maintenance and are much less messier ; thats why they are very popular in West (US) but have zero preference here.. & for a valid reason - Shaheen shells. Gas semi-autos are softer shooting than inertia guns. For our cartridges (Shaheen), best gas system is the GAS OPERATED / SELF ADJUSTING MECHANISM. For example, Remington 1100 Vs 11-87\nBeretta A303 Vs A390/391 ... where Rem1100 and BerA303 are NOT self adjusting gas mech but at same time classics at performing with standard loads 31-32 grams (like Shaheen). \n\nIf you use skeet loads of 25grams or above a certain power (say 34g or 36g), Rem 1000 and Ber A303 models would become defected after a certain time. People did not know that before and destroyed their repeaters here with such varying intensity loads. Hence now almost all popular guns here: Baikal MP153, Hatsan Escort, Beretta A390/391/A400, Remington 11-87, Browning maxus .... having same thing in common i.e. gas oper & self adj mech; hence are more popular. Otherwise if living abroad with access to all types of good shells, #1 choice in semis might well be Inertia driven guns (like Benelli etc).[/QUOTE]\n\nFrancolino +1 Bro!', ''),

I have myself used A303 Sporter model 28" barrel for good 10+ yrs and fired about 6-8 cartons per year with it in field and at skeet (at skeet though though less frequently)  with 31g Shaheen load. Also avoid above 32grams with it. And as you might know it is only marked 2-3/4" chamber so only 70mm length cartridges are to be used. You can confirm from Beretta company about 36g loads (Shaheen Super OR Eley or Victory in 36 grams; maybe they say yes, but the Shaheen Super is different than imported 36grams, its not of as high quality as imported varieties). But in your place, I would try any cartridge from 28-32 grams in that gun. This gun model is even better than the latter or previous models for hunting purpose, though I use both A303 and AL391 Teknys Stonecoat currently.... still I always rate very very high the handling and patterning (somehow) of A303.  \r\n\r\nTry: 8 regular Shaheen for skeet, trap and upland (all)\r\n6 regular for ducks (& for close in birds even 8#)\r\n4 regular for geese (avoid BB, its not needed)\r\nTrap and Skeet: As a 2nd option,use 28g Victory any series such as Sonic V1 for those.\r\n\r\nAND do FULL gun cleaning every every few shoots (opening the trigger assembly as well). People don''t open trig assemblies of such guns and their guns malfunction and become defected after a certain time. Just follow the manual''s cleaning (assembly and dissambly) instructions with minute details. It is then good to go for a life time.\r\n\r\nYou asked about whether to purchase INERTIA gun here..... just forget it simply.

So is there any option other then Baikal & Turkish shotguns in 100k range.[/QUOTE]\r\n \r\nBro, shotgun for hunting is not something one changes every season or every quarter. It is basically a life long weapon. Once selected and bought with care and R&D, goes a long way. It then becomes a part of you - so to speak. And that is exactly the time one enjoys it truly in field...centering targets: Dazzz....& the bird is a stone-dead hit!!! My opinions might be different than what you may have in mind or what somebody else may suggest. My favs in this range would be: Remington 11-87, Beretta A303/304/390, Browning Gold. A friend bought just a few shells fired A303 last year for 110,000. And that had a spare barrel 26" too with four chokes in the package. So, even if some deal of a very sparingly used gun is found, brands and specific models do count. There are two other semi-auto Franchi gas models (maybe 612 etc) and one (semi-auto, gas) Lanber by Spain. These can be found in your range I think. You can ask for opinions about their prices further from your sources or here. But Pindi / Lahore / PSW dealers will have to be contacted on phone for that. All I can recommend is - just have 2 factors in mind "self adjusting gas mechanism" and "gas operated system", the first one is very important in case you plan to shoot 24-25grams skeet or trap loads as a binding factor in local/club etc competitions.', ''),

At least not for those who do not have target/range shooting as daily/weekly/monthly routine, but just wanna ensure "crisis time" stock.\n\nI''d divide it into further sub-categories of the ammo I hold NPB weapons of as per below:\n\n[COLOR="blue"]Cal. 45: 1500 rds. [/COLOR]\n\n[COLOR="blue"]9mm : 1000 rds (quality/imported)[/COLOR].\n\n[COLOR="blue"]12 Gauge: 500 (Imported)[/COLOR]\n\n[COLOR="blue"]30-06 : 300 rds.[/COLOR]\n\n Everything here in our country is "circumstantial specific" and I trust this is no "wish list" query but actual quota based and "realistic purchase specific". I''m at about 50% only of above and with licensed quota''s. Once I manage full stock, I still won''t stop purchasing anymore, but would keep the level fixed and purchase the quantity additionally that I shoot out now and then, always keep the basic stock "afresh".\n\nThe higher number of .45 rds above has not been set because I use it more, but because it''s a very "variable" supply, and I always strive to purchase it more than the 9mm, which will always be available, so would local POF 12G ammo, hence the numbers set above is the absolute minimum "crisis time stock", otherwise I''d gladly rent for myself a spatial "warehouse" building, it''s simply the best "shine" out there, lolz!\n\n[B]PS[/B]. Btw, I had to "edit" the numbers above a couple of times, lolz!\n\n\nRegards.', ''),

And that is exactly the time one enjoys it truly in field...centering targets: Dazzz....& the bird is a stone-dead hit!!! My opinions might be different than what you may have in mind or what somebody else may suggest. My favs in this range would be: Remington 11-87, Beretta A303/304/390, Browning Gold. A friend bought just a few shells fired A303 last year for 110,000. And that had a spare barrel 26" too with four chokes in the package. So, even if some deal of a very sparingly used gun is found, brands and specific models do count. There are two other semi-auto Franchi gas models (maybe 612 etc) and one (semi-auto, gas) Lanber by Spain. These can be found in your range I think. You can ask for opinions about their prices further from your sources or here. But Pindi / Lahore / PSW dealers will have to be contacted on phone for that. All I can recommend is - just have 2 factors in mind "self adjusting gas mechanism" and "gas operated system", the first one is very important in case you plan to shoot 24-25grams skeet or trap loads as a binding factor in local/club etc competitions.[/QUOTE]\n \nThanx again.

(369939, ' Dear Sir, I am reproducing an article that elaborates the game size vs caliber in detail.\r\nCourtesy: Chuck Hawks\r\n\r\nHunting Bullet Guide\r\nPart One: Caliber and Weight\r\n\r\nBy Chuck Hawks\r\n\r\n\r\nIntroduction\r\n\r\nI have decided to approach the question of hunting bullet selection by dividing it into two general topics. This article is Part One of the "Hunting Bullet Guide," and addresses big game hunting bullets by caliber, weight, and application. Part Two addresses the bullet designs of the various major manufacturers.\r\n\r\nThe purpose of these articles is to assist the reader in choosing an appropriate jacketed, expanding bullet for hunting medium and large game animals. For our purposes, "big game" starts at animals weighing perhaps 80 pounds and goes up from there to animals as large as pachyderms.\r\n\r\nVarmint bullets are frangible and should not be used for hunting big game animals; they are not included in the Hunting Bullet Guide articles. Neither are non-expanding practice, match, and military (FMJ) bullets. These are usually illegal for hunting big game, at least in North America, and should not be used. They are not designed for proper expansion and cannot be modified to expand reliably. For hunting big game animals, buy bullets specifically intended for the purpose.\r\n\r\nA special class of hunting bullets is the "solids." These are typically round-nose or flat tip bullets specifically designed to provide maximum penetration on the largest (CXP4 class) dangerous game animals, principally African rhinos and elephants. These special purpose bullets are also largely beyond the scope of the Hunting Bullet Guide.\r\n\r\nI use Winchester''s "CXP" (Controlled eXPansion) scale to describe the various classes of game animals, so if you are not familiar with it, please read the article "The CXP Rating System for Hunting Cartridges." I have previously written fairly extensively about the subject of hunting bullets, and most of those articles can be found in the same place, the Ammunition, Bullets and Ballistics index page of the Rifle Information Page here on Guns and Shooting Online. Links to all of the bullet makers mentioned in this series are provided on the Guns and Shooting Online Links Page.\r\n\r\nFortunately, the big name ammo manufacturers (Winchester, Remington, Federal, Hornady) basically know what they are doing and provide bullets adequate for the caliber and purpose in their factory loaded ammunition. Some of the specialty ammo companies (Stars and Stripes Custom Ammunition, for example) are also competent, able to provide information and advice, and are willing to create custom loads for specific purposes. Some are not, though, and seem more interested in selling some proprietary bullet or theory of killing power than addressing the customer''s actual needs, so buyer beware. Usually, if you pick a suitable caliber and bullet weight in a factory load for the game you intend to hunt, and put that bullet into the heart/lung area of the animal, the bullet will do its job satisfactorily.\r\n\r\nA good rule of thumb for selecting an appropriate weight bullet within any given caliber is that lighter bullets are usually intended for the smaller species of game appropriate for that caliber, and the heavier bullets are intended for the larger appropriate species. The lightest bullets in calibers below 8mm are generally intended for varmint shooting, not big game hunting. Here are some general guidelines concerning suitable bullet weights for the popular hunting rifle calibers.\r\n\r\n6mm caliber (.243" diameter) bullets weighing less than about 85 grains are almost always varmint bullets, not intended for big game hunting. 85-87 grain bullets may be either varmint or big game bullets. Bullets of 90-99 grains are usually intended for small to medium size CXP2 game, such as pronghorn antelope, Colombian blacktail deer, and whitetail deer. Bullets in the 100-110 grain range are normally intended for the largest species of CXP2 game, such as wild sheep, mule deer, and caribou.\r\n\r\n.25 caliber (.257" diameter) varmint bullets usually weigh 87 grains or less. The 100 grain bullets are usually for small to medium size CXP2 game. 115 to 120 grain bullets are usually the best choice for all-around use on CXP2 game, with the long 120 grain bullets generally preferred for the largest species, such as caribou and black bear.\r\n\r\n6.5mm caliber (.264" diameter) bullets of less than 100 grains are usually varmint bullets. 100 grain bullets are often designed for the smallest species of "big game," such as European chamois and the smallest African antelope. The 120-130 grain bullets are usually a good choice for medium size CXP2 game, such as pronghorn antelope, most deer species, wild sheep and goats. The 140 grain bullets are the all-around bullets, suitable for all CXP2 and the smaller species or CXP3 game, while the heavy 156-160 grain bullets are usually intended for CXP3 game on the order of Scandinavian moose.\r\n\r\n.270 caliber bullets (.277" diameter) bullets weighing 110 grains and less are usually varmint bullets. The new 115 grain Core-Lokt Ultra bullet designed by Remington for the 6.8mm SPC cartridge is a CXP2 game hunting bullet.\r\n\r\nThe popular 130-150 grain slugs are useful for a wide variety of CXP2 and CXP3 game, depending on the individual bullet''s design, in the standard .270 Winchester cartridge and the .270 Magnums. I generally recommend 130 grain bullets for all CXP2 game, the 140 grain bullets for mixed bag CXP2 and CXP3 hunts, and the 150 grain or heavier bullets primarily for CXP3 game.\r\n\r\nI also tend to prefer 130-140 grain bullets in the standard .270 Winchester and 140-150 grain bullets in the .270 Magnum calibers. But I would be the first to admit that controlled expansion 130 grain .270 bullets have been used successfully on the largest antlered game all over the world for decades, from both standard and magnum caliber rifles.\r\n\r\n7mm caliber (.284" diameter) bullets weighing less than 120 grains are usually varmint bullets, while 130-140 grain bullets are normally suggested for CXP2 game. 139-140 grain bullets are a good all-around (CXP2/CXP3 game) choice in the standard 7mm calibers, as are 150-160 grain bullets in the 7mm Magnum calibers. The 175 grain bullets are usually reserved for use on the very largest or dangerous game.\r\n\r\n.30-.303 caliber (.308"-.312" diameter) bullets weighing 125 grains and less are usually varmint bullets. The following remarks apply to cartridges on the order of the .30-30 and .303 Savage or larger.\r\n\r\nBullets in the 130 grain range are normally intended for use on light CXP2 game. Bullets in the 150-155 grain range are intended for a broad spectrum of CXP2 game, such as most deer, antelope, sheep, and caribou. The heavier 165-180 grain bullets are typically the all-around bullets for mixed bag CXP2 and CXP3 game hunts. These are the bullets most commonly chosen for most elk and moose hunting, for example. The heavy 200-220 grain bullets are generally reserved for use on very large and/or dangerous game, such as Alaskan moose and brown bear.\r\n\r\n.32/8mm caliber (.321-.323" diameter) bullets are generally intended for hunting medium and large game. As with the .30-.303 calibers, to which the .32''s are quite similar in bullet weight and application, bullets weighing less than 125 grains are often varmint bullets. Hunting bullets in the 150 grain range are usually good CXP2 game bullets, while the 170-180 grain numbers are the all-around bullets most suitable for mixed bag hunts. The comparatively heavy 195-220 grain bullets are generally reserved for the largest CXP3 game, with the 220 grain bullets favored for use on dangerous game.\r\n\r\n.33 caliber (.338" diameter) marks the beginning of the medium bore calibers. In general, most .338 cartridges are primarily intended for use on CXP3 hoofed game and large, dangerous predators such as lions, tigers, and bears.\r\n\r\n180 grain bullets are usually recommended only for CXP2 class game, such as caribou and black bear. The 200 grain bullets are generally the combination CXP2/CXP3 game bullets, and very popular with elk hunters. The 225-250 grain bullets are recommended for large CXP3 game and dangerous predators. Deep penetrating 250 grain bullets are the ticket for use on CXP4 game, as well as the largest and most dangerous predators.\r\n\r\n.35 caliber (.358" diameter) bullets weighing 150-160 grains are best reserved for practice or small to medium size CXP2 game. Their poor sectional density (SD) severely limits penetration. From 180 grains on up, the bullet weight recommendations for the high intensity and magnum .35 calibers are basically the same as those for the .338 calibers. The .35''s offer greater bullet diameter and the .338''s offer better SD. In terms of killing power, it seems to pretty much balance out.\r\n\r\nNaturally, the smallest .35 caliber rifle cartridges such as the .35 Remington do quite will with 180 grain bullets. The .358 Winchester is probably at its best with 180-200 grain bullets. The medium size cases such as the .35 Whelen and .350 Rem. Mag. seem to be most efficient with 200-225 grain bullets, while the biggest cases, such as the .358 Norma Magnum, are tremendously potent with 250 grain bullets.\r\n\r\n9.3mm caliber (.366" diameter) rifles are seldom seen in Australia and the New World, but they are reasonably popular in Europe and Africa as an alternative to .375 caliber rifles. Bullet weights typically run in the 250-300 grain range. The lighter weight bullets are for CXP3 game, and the 270 grain and heavier bullets are usually for large, dangerous predators and heavy hoofed game. Controlled expansion 285 grain (and heavier) bullets designed for deep penetration are suitable for CXP4 game.\r\n\r\n.375 caliber (.375" diameter) marks the upper limit of what are normally described as medium bore rifle cartridges. 200-235 grain bullets are loaded to moderate velocity for hunting CXP2/CXP3 game. Starting in power with cartridges on the order of the .376 Steyer and going all the way up to the most powerful of the .375 Magnums, the most common CXP3/dangerous predator bullet for full power loads weighs about 270 grains. The heavy 300 grain bullets are the recommended choice for CXP4 game.\r\n\r\n.416 caliber (.416" diameter) gets us into the area of big bore cartridges intended for CXP4 game, principally buffalo, rhino, and elephant. For such massive creatures bullets must have exceptional SD (typically over .300) for deep penetration. The choice of bullets in .416 caliber centers around 400 grains, soft points for lung shots on CXP4 game and to break down the largest and most dangerous predators, and solids for brain shots on elephant.\r\n\r\n.44 caliber (.429" diameter) rifle bullets are used primarily in the .444 Marlin cartridge. The standard .444 factory load uses a 240 grain soft point pistol bullet. This is fine for deer and most other CXP2 game, but for larger animals something more is needed. Hornady was the first to offer a bullet designed specifically for the .444 cartridge, a 265 grain FP InterLock. This bullet is designed for use on CXP2 and CXP3 game, with the emphasis on the latter. Subsequently, other companies have offered controlled expansion bullets of 270-300 grains that are also recommended for CXP3 game in the .444 Marlin.\r\n\r\n.45 caliber (.458" diameter) rifle cartridges generally fall into two classes, traditional North American buffalo (bison) cartridges, and elephant cartridges. The .45-70 is the best known of the former, and the .458 Winchester Magnum is the most common of the latter, although there are others to be sure. For CXP4 game, bullets weighing 450-500 grains are the best choice in either type of cartridge, with the 500 grain bullet being the most common.\r\n\r\nBoth of these cartridges can also handle reduced loads, making them suitable for other purposes, such as hunting North American antlered game. For CXP2 game the 300 grain HP bullets commonly factory loaded for the .45-70 are a good choice. For CXP3 game, 350-405 grain soft point bullets are a good choice in either bison or elephant cartridges. The tougher versions of these bullets are also excellent for large, dangerous predators such as lion and the great bears.\r\n\r\nComments\r\n\r\nAll of the recommendations given above are, of course, generalizations--not hard and fast rules. But they are pretty useful generalizations, particularly considering the paucity of information provided by most of the bullet and ammunition manufacturers, who seem to assume that everyone already knows these things.', ''),
(369940, ' Part two: By Manufacturer\r\n\r\nIntroduction to Part Two\r\n\r\nHunting bullets are the focus of the Hunting Bullet Guide articles. This article is Part Two of the series, and addresses big game hunting bullets by manufacturer and bullet design or type. Part One addresses the subject by caliber, bullet weight, and application.\r\n\r\nThe purpose of this series is to assist the reader in choosing an appropriate jacketed, expanding bullet for hunting medium and large game animals. For our purposes, "big game" starts at animals weighing perhaps 80 pounds and goes up from there to animals as large as pachyderms.\r\n\r\nI use Winchester''s "CXP" (Controlled eXPansion) scale to describe the various classes of game animals, so if you are not familiar with it, please read the article "The CXP Rating System for Hunting Cartridges." I have written fairly extensively about the subject of hunting bullets, and most of those articles can be found in the same place, the Ammunition, Bullets and Ballistics index page of the Rifle Information Page here on Guns and Shooting Online. Links to all of the bullet makers mentioned in this series are provided on the Guns and Shooting Online Links Page.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, there are so many hunting bullets from so many manufacturers, in so many calibers and weights, that is it is simply impossible to deal with every bullet individually. Due to limitations of space and time, only bullet designs from widely known and distributed manufacturers can be included. These are A-Square, Barnes, Federal, Hornady, Nosler/Combined Technology, Remington, Sierra, Speer, Swift, Winchester and Woodleigh. Among reloaders, Sierra, Speer, Hornady, and Nosler are generally considered to be the "big boys" among the bullet makers.\r\n\r\nAll hunting bullets are designed for limited purposes and to perform properly over a finite range of velocities. Some factory load ballistics tables indicate the class of animal for which each load is intended (principally Winchester) and most do not. At least one bullet manufacturer (Hornady) provide specific velocity range and application (intended game size) information in their reloading manual, but most do not. However, most of the bullet makers'' reloading manuals at least indicate the general purpose of each of their basic bullet designs. The ammunition manufacturers'' catalogs and the bullet makers'' reloading manuals are usually the best sources of information about their various bullets.\r\n\r\nHunting Bullets by Manufacturer and Type\r\n\r\nA-Square Bullets\r\n\r\nA-Square offers three bullet lines of unique construction. A-Square calls this their "Triad" of bullets and offers all three types in diameters from .338" to .620".\r\n\r\nThese three types of bullets are the Monolithic Solid, Dead Tough, and Lion Load. All A-Square bullets are of round nose design with parallel sides. They may be interchanged (as long as the caliber and bullet weight remains the same) without changing the point of impact. Thus the same rifle could be used with three different types of bullets for large predators, heavy hoofed game, and pachyderms on the same safari.\r\n\r\nThe MONOLITHIC SOLID is just that. It is a leaded bronze alloy bullet that does not expand even when fired into the largest and toughest animals. Its purpose is extreme, straight-line penetration on dangerous CXP4 animals.\r\n\r\nThe LION LOAD soft point is the opposite approach, a specialized bullet designed to debride (fragment) on impact, thus creating maximum stopping power when used in frontal or broadside shots on big cats. Its effect has been likened by A-Square to pressing the muzzle of a 20 gauge shotgun against the animal and pulling the trigger. A special brittle jacket and core are responsible for this bullet''s performance.\r\n\r\nThe DEAD TOUGH is the A-Square bullet of interest to most hunters. It uses a tapered, inner belted, jacket and a bonded core to insure controlled expansion and deep, straight line penetration over a 1400 fps range of impact velocities. The impact velocity range is approximately 1500-2900 fps. A-Square claims that the Dead Tough is suitable for taking animals ranging is size from small deer and impala to Cape buffalo. \r\n\r\nIn addition to the calibers served by the full Triad of bullets, A-Square offers monolithic solids in .284", .308", and .323" diameters as well as a 180 grain Dead Tough .308" bullet. A-Square bullets are available to reloaders, in A-Square factory loads and in selected Stars & Stripes factory loads.\r\n\r\nBarnes Bullets\r\n\r\nBarnes is primarily known today as the manufacturer of the all copper X-BULLET projectiles. The basic Barnes X-Bullet, originally a spitzer/flat base design with a small hollow point to initiate expansion, has expanded into different lines. The basic version today is the Triple Shock X-Bullet (TSX).\r\n\r\nThe TRIPLE SHOCK is basically an X-Bullet with three driving bands around its circumference. This also reduces friction on the bullet''s trip down the bore and gives the copper displaced by the rifling lands somewhere to go. The TSX line has basically replaced the original X-Bullet and XLC lines. Barnes Triple Shock X-Bullets are offered in Federal, Weatherby and Cor-Bon factory loaded ammunition as well as to reloaders.\r\n\r\nOne of the friendly tech reps at Barnes Bullets once informed me that all X-Type big game hunting bullets, regardless of caliber or weight, are designed to initiate expansion at impact velocities of 1600 fps. Effective expansion will occur at impact velocities in excess of about 1800 fps.\r\n\r\nHere is a quotation from the FAQ on the Barnes web site regarding the terminal performance of X-type bullets:\r\n\r\n"When the Triple-Shock X-Bullet was developed, the X-bullet cavity was redesigned to create triple-shock terminal performance. The X-shaped tip begins opening immediately on contact with game, delivering an initial transfer of energy to the animal''s nervous system. As the bullet penetrates another inch or two, the four copper petals continue opening. The expanding bullet explosively compresses trapped air and body fluids, transferring a second shock to the nervous system. After penetrating another three to six inches, the bullet fully expands to more than twice its original diameter--further compressing trapped air and body fluids to deliver a third massive shock to the animal''s system. The improved cavity design has proven so successful it has since been adapted to other Barnes X-Bullets."\r\n\r\nBarnes still produces a line of SOLID (non-expanding) and ORIGINAL (lead core, copper jacketed expanding) bullets. These tend to be in relatively heavy weights for their caliber. All Barnes Originals, except for a pair of unusual .45/70 spire points, are round nose or flat point bullets. They have a good reputation where deep penetration is required, due to their thick jackets and high sectional density. Like the X-Bullets, Barnes Original bullets are designed to begin expansion at impact velocities in excess of 1600 fps and are at their best at impact velocities in excess of 1800 fps.', ''),
(369941, ' Federal Bullets\r\n\r\nFederal Cartridge, like Speer a subsidiary of ATK, manufacturers some of their own bullets. Others they purchase from various specialty bullet makers. Federal''s principal proprietary bullet is the Jack Carter designed "Trophy Bonded Bear Claw," to which Federal purchased the rights years ago.\r\n\r\nThis design is the exact opposite of the later Winchester Fail Safe bullet. The Trophy Bonded looks like the rear of a Barnes X-Bullet grafted to the front portion of a Swift A-Frame bullet. The front core is protected by a tapered jacket, to which it is fusion bonded. There is no rear core, just a solid copper alloy bullet shank. The front part of the bullet expands, the rear cannot.\r\n\r\nThis design is reputed to retain about 95% of its original weight and is noted for deep penetration. It is recommended for CXP2 and CXP3 game, including the largest dangerous predators in suitable calibers. Trophy Bonded bullets are available to reloaders under the Speer brand name.\r\n\r\nFederal''s newest bullet, at this writing, is the "Fusion." This bullet is a lower cost alternative to the premium bonded core bullets. Its lead core is electro-chemically fused to a jacket of uniform thickness (not internally tapered) by a proprietary process said to give results mimicking those of bonded core bullets. The jacket extends all the way to the tip of the bullet, reminiscent of the Speer Mag-Tip.\r\n\r\nThe specific application of Fusion bullets is CXP2 game. This bullet was designed primarily for deer hunting, although I have heard of good results on elk from Fusion bullets of adequate caliber and weight. The Fusion bullet is available in its own, separate, line of ammunition.\r\n\r\nHornady Bullets\r\n\r\nHornady is a major supplier of bullets to reloaders and offers several lines of bullets. The hunting bullets that concern us here are the InterLock, SST, InterBond and Flex-Tip. Hornady also offers these bullet in their various lines of factory loaded ammunition and Hornady bullets are also used in other brands of ammunition, including Stars & Stripes, Remington and Weatherby.\r\n\r\nThe Hornady Handbook of Cartridge Reloading specifies the application (medium game, large game, and dangerous game), as well as the appropriate muzzle velocity range for every Hornady hunting bullet. Rather than duplicate pages of copyrighted material, I refer you directly to the source. The Hornady Handbook is available in most gun shops, sporting good stores, and book stores as well as online from various sources including the Hornady web site.\r\n\r\nThe INTERLOCK is their basic soft point type bullet. It incorporates a tapered gilding metal jacket, cannelure and Hornady''s InterLock ring that attempts to mechanically lock the jacket and lead alloy core to prevent core slippage during expansion.\r\n\r\nMost InterLock bullets come with a Spire Point and a flat base, but there are round nose, flat point and boat-tail versions available where applicable. This has been a very successful and versatile hunting bullet design suitable for CXP2 and CXP3 game in appropriate calibers and weights. It is basically the bullet that made Hornady''s reputation. InterLock bullets have been offered in Weatherby factory loads for many years, as well as in Hornady Custom and Light Magnum factory loaded ammunition and, of course, to reloaders.\r\n\r\nThe SST is an InterLock type bullet with a plastic tip and a boat-tail base. It is a quick-expanding bullet with a very high ballistic coefficient (BC) for long range shooting, yet it incorporates a cannelure and the internal InterLock ring. It is offered in Hornady factory loads as well as to reloaders. Remington uses a similar Hornady produced bullet that they call "Accu-Tip" in selected Remington factory loads.\r\n\r\nHornady''s premium bonded bullet is the INTERBOND. The InterBond is similar to the SST and A-MAX in form and there is no cannelure. The core is chemically bonded to the jacket to positively prevent core/jacket separation. This bullet is intended to combine rapid initial expansion with high weight retention for deeper than normal penetration. InterBond bullets are available in selected Hornady factory loads and to reloaders.\r\n\r\nThe latest Hornady bullet as of this writing is the Flex-Tip. This is a boat-tail spitzer bullet reminiscent of the SST with a softer plastic tip that can safely be used in the tubular magazines of traditional lever action rifles. This dramatically expands the MPBR of the affected calibers compared to the flat point bullets traditionally loaded in these cartridges. At present, Flex-Tip bullets are offered exclusively in Hornady factory loaded "LEVERevolution" ammunition in .30-30 Winchester, .308 Marlin Express, .35 Remington, .444 Marlin, .45-70 and .450 Marlin calibers.\r\n\r\nNosler Bullets\r\n\r\nNosler manufacturers bullets in Bend, Oregon and has grown to be one of the largest premium bullet makers in the industry. Most famous for their Partition bullets, Nosler also offers their very successful line of Ballistic Tip bullets and a new line of bonded core, plastic tipped bullets called AccuBond. Their popular priced bullet is the Solid Base, a soft point spitzer bullet with a boat-tail.\r\n\r\nNosler also manufacturers bullets for Winchester Ammunition under the Combined Technology (CT) name. These include the Partition Gold, Ballistic Silvertip and recently discontinued Fail Safe. (The Fail Safe is being replaced in the Winchester line by their proprietary XP3 bullet.) Nosler bullets are available to reloaders and are featured in many brands of factory loaded ammunition including Nosler, Black Hills, Federal, Norma, Stars & Stripes, Weatherby and, of course, Winchester.\r\n\r\nNosler bullet jackets are manufactured by a more expensive impact extrusion manufacturing process, creating bullet jackets from copper alloy (gilding metal) slugs, rather than the cup and draw method used for most bullets. This is required to manufacture the jackets for the dual core Partition bullet, but is also applied to the Ballistic Tip and other Nosler bullets to create their internally tapered jackets.\r\n\r\nBALLISTIC TIP bullets took the market by storm. These popular spitzer projectiles use colored plastic tips to initiate the rapid expansion of their lead alloy cores. Impact extruded, tapered gilding metal jackets and a solid boat-tail base control expansion and support the resulting mushroom. Ballistic Tip hunting bullets from .30 caliber down are designed for CXP2 game (maximum weight 400 pounds). Ballistic tip bullets in calibers over .30 are designed with a heavier jacket intended for reliably harvesting CXP3 class game.\r\n\r\nIn all calibers Ballistic Tips boast high BCs and are considered long range bullets. They are also usually very accurate bullets. The CT Ballistic Silvertip is essentially a Ballistic Tip bullet with a black Lubalox exterior coating. Layne Simpson, writing the section of the Nosler Reloading Guide, fifth edition, entitled "Hunting With Nosler Bullets" states that Ballistic Tip bullets will expand satisfactorily at impact velocities as low as 1700 fps. No other specific velocity/expansion data is provided.\r\n\r\nSOLID BASE bullets are essentially Ballistic Tip bullets with an ordinary lead tip instead of a plastic tip. Actually, it is the other way around, as Solid Base bullets preceded the introduction of the Ballistic Tip by several years. When a plastic tip was added to the old Solid Base, boat-tail spitzer bullet the Ballistic Tip was born and marketing history made. The popularity of the Ballistic Tip resulted in the disappearance of the Solid Base from the Nosler line for many years, but now it is back as a lower cost alternative to the Ballistic Tip. Solid Base bullets are recommended for the same range of game as the Ballistic Tips.\r\n\r\nACCUBOND bullets combine the high BC, accuracy and rapid expansion of the Ballistic Tip with a bonded core to retain 60-70% of their initial weight. These white tipped bullets are suitable for a wide variety of CXP2 and CXP3 game in appropriate calibers and bullet weights, including the largest and most dangerous predators.\r\n\r\nPARTITION bullets are really two bullets in one. There are two lead alloy cores separated by a solid partition of gilding metal jacket material. The front core is encased in a relatively thin tapered jacket to insure that adequate expansion is initiated when the bullet strikes even the smaller species of CXP2 game. The internal partition positively prevents the bullet from opening beyond that point, retaining the rear core for deep penetration even in heavy CXP3 game. Recovered Partition bullets retain about 60% of their initial weight regardless of how violently the front part of the bullet expands. The Partition bullet has earned an outstanding reputation in the field as a killing bullet.\r\n\r\nCT PARTITION GOLD bullets have heavier partitions set a little farther forward (about midway in the bullet, rather than 2/3 of the way back) to contain a larger base core for greater retained weight and somewhat deeper penetration than the standard Partition bullet. There is also a steel cup below the partition to further protect the lead alloy core of this extremely complicated bullet. Available with or without a black Molybdenum Disulfide external coating.\r\n\r\nThe CT FAIL SAFE is a flat base, moly-coated bullet design that resembles a Barnes X-Bullet drilled out to accept the rear core of a Partition Gold. Like the X-Bullet, the penetration and expansion characteristics are determined by the hollow point in the solid copper alloy front half of the bullet. However, the Fail Safe includes a rear lead alloy core, protected by a steel cup, similar to that in a Partition Gold Bullet. Unlike the Partition Gold, there is a heel closure disc to protect the base of the bullet from hot powder gasses. The Fail Safe has garnered a reputation as a very deep penetrating bullet with limited expansion. It is best reserved for CXP3 and CXP4 game and is in the process of being discontinued as I write these words in the Fall of 2007.', ''),
(369942, ' Remington Bullets\r\n\r\nRemington has long been one of the most creative of the big ammo companies in terms of its bullet designs. In addition to offering a number of specialty bullets procured from other manufacturers (Swift and Hornady in particular), Remington produces their own original bullet designs. Some of these have been extremely successful.\r\n\r\nThe CORE-LOKT is probably the most famous Remington bullet. It is factory loaded in a great many calibers for the Remington Express ammo line. Core-Lokt bullets are also available to reloaders in consumer bulk packs in calibers from .243 to 8mm.\r\n\r\nIt is an outstanding flat base, soft point design that features a tapered gilding metal jacket that is thin at the tip and thickest around the middle of the bullet. This "inner belted" design controls expansion and retains a good portion of the bullet shank for deeper than normal penetration, yet allows nearly 2x diameter expansion of the front part of the bullet for maximum tissue destruction. Core-Lokt bullets also have a cannelure to allow crimping and help retain the core.\r\n\r\nCore-Lokt bullets come in Pointed, round nose, flat point, and hollow point styles, depending on caliber and intended application. They are suitable for CXP2 and CXP3 game in appropriate calibers and weights.\r\n\r\nThe CORE-LOKT ULTRA is a newer variation on the Core-Lokt theme. It is a bonded core bullet with a heavy Core-Lokt type jacket. The nose is of the Mag-Tip type with no lead exposed. The bonded lead alloy core and heavy, inner belted jacket retains most of the bullets original weight for deep penetration. Remington claims that this bullet expands reliably at all ranges from 50 yards to 500 yards (impact velocities unspecified). Core-Lokt Ultra bullets are available in Remington Premier factory loads in calibers from .243 to .338. They are suitable for CXP2 and CXP3 game, including dangerous game, in appropriate calibers and bullet weights. Core-Lokt Ultra bullets are also available to reloaders.\r\n\r\nThe BRONZE POINT was the first tipped bullet, predating the CIL Sabre Tip and the later Nosler Ballistic Tip by decades. It uses a flat base and a bronze alloy tip to initiate expansion of the lead alloy core. The gilding metal jacket has a cannelure to mechanically help retain the core during expansion. This bullet is designed for CXP2 game and is available in only two calibers, .270/130 grain and .30-06/150 and 180 grain, in Remington Express factory loads.\r\n\r\nACCUTIP is the latest Remington tipped bullet. This is a plastic tipped spitzer bullet with a secant ogive profile made for Remington, I believe, by Hornady. The 140 grain .284" AccuTip is a flat base design; all of the other big game AccuTips are boat tail bullets. (There are also AccuTip varmint bullets, which are similar to Hornady''s V-Max bullet.)\r\n\r\nAccuTip bullets are designed for fast expansion. They use a tapered jacket and a cannelure to help retain the core. Remington specifically recommends AccuTip big game bullets for deer size animals.\r\n\r\nSierra Bullets\r\n\r\nThe last I heard, Sierra was the best selling brand of bullets for reloading in the U.S. They are famous for their match bullets and also make a wide variety of varmint and big game hunting bullets, some of which are offered in Federal and Sellier & Bellot factory loaded ammunition.\r\n\r\nSierra hunting bullets generally have a reputation for excellent accuracy, rapid expansion and quick kills. They are particularly popular with experienced hunters. Sierra Bullets are constructed with tapered gilding metal jackets and lead alloy cores. Sierra varies the jacket thickness, jacket taper and core hardness to control bullet expansion and penetration.\r\n\r\nOf principle interest here are the Pro Hunter and GameKing lines of hunting bullets. These are medium to heavy weight (for caliber) bullets designed for harvesting CXP2 and CXP3 game.\r\n\r\nMost Sierra PRO HUNTER bullets have pointed soft point (spitzer) noses, but where appropriate Sierra offers semi-pointed, flat point, round nose and hollow point styles. These are reasonably priced, flat base bullets with gilding metal jackets that are suitable for a wide range of applications in calibers from .243 to .45-70.\r\n\r\nThe somewhat more expensive GAMEKING bullets all have spitzer points and boat-tail bases for a high BC. GameKing bullets are probalby the closest thing to a Sierra MatchKing bullet that is appropriate for use in a big game hunting rifle. Sierra regards the GameKing as a long range bullet and it is so described on their web site. Available calibers range from .22 to .375.\r\n\r\nThe Sierra reloading manual includes detailed descriptions of all of their bullets and conveniently recommends specific hunting loads for their Pro Hunter and GameKing bullets in every available caliber. Sierra has so far eschewed adding plastic tips or bonded cores to their bullets, maintaining that their bullets perform superbly in their present form.\r\n\r\nSpeer Bullets\r\n\r\nSpeer is owned by the same company (ATK) that owns Federal Cartridge and CCI. Speer bullets are used in many Federal factory loads and Speer is also one of the major bullet makers supplying reloaders. Reloaders can buy Federal produced Trophy Bonded Bear Claw bullets in Speer packaging. In addition to big game hunting bullets, Speer produces varmint, match and special application bullets.\r\n\r\nAside from the premium Trophy Bonded Bear Claw, which is addressed in the Federal section, Speer markets several lines of big game hunting bullets, all of which use gilding metal jackets. These include (in order of construction from lighter to heavier) the Boat Tail, Hot-Cor, Mag-Tip, Grand Slam and African Grand Slam. Point styles include spitzer, semi-spitzer, flat point, hollow point and round nose, depending on application. Most Speer big game hunting bullets are flat base designs, the exception being those in the Boat Tail line. Unfortunately, Speer does not provide specific velocity/expansion information about their bullets.\r\n\r\nThe Speer BOAT TAIL bullet is a conventionally constructed soft point spitzer with a 13 degree tapered heel. It is designed primarily for long range shooting, where velocities have usually fallen off. This bullet uses a tapered gilding metal jacket to control expansion and is the fastest expanding design in the Speer line. It is recommended for the smaller species of CXP2 game in the small bore calibers and non-dangerous game in medium bore calibers.\r\n\r\nHOT-COR bullets are the heart of the Speer line. This bullet is manufactured by pouring the lead alloy core into the gilding metal bullet jacket in liquid form at 900 F degrees. Speer claims that this reduces the possibility of core slippage during expansion. A tapered profile jacket and the specific lead alloy of the core control expansion. Speer recommends their Hot-Cor bullets for animals at the upper end of a given rifle cartridge''s capability, which includes all CXP2 and CXP3 game in appropriate bullet weights and calibers.\r\n\r\nMAG-TIP''s are semi-spitzer bullets manufactured using the Hot-Cor process, but with jacket profiles about 45% heavier in the shank. The inside of the jacket near the tip is serrated to promote reliable expansion at lower velocities and there is a cannelure to help retain the core after impact at high velocity. The jacket protects the bullet''s point all the way to the tip to prevent battering in the magazine. The result is basically a spitzer bullet, but with a small, flat point. Mag-Tip bullets hold together well and yet expand reliably at a wide range of velocities. Most of the Mag-Tip design features were incorporated into the later, premium priced, Grand Slam bullets. Mag-Tip bullets are available in 7mm, .30 and .416 calibers.\r\n\r\nThe GRAND SLAM has been Speer''s premium bullet since 1975, although the Federal Trophy Bonded bullet is now Speer''s top of the line offering. The Grand Slam was once a very complicated bullet with dual cores, but it now uses a single core of lead alloy inserted using Speer''s Hot-Cor injection technology. These are spitzer and semi-spitzer style flat base bullets. The shank of the Grand Slam''s tapered gilding metal jacket is up to 45% thicker than standard game bullets and a cannelure is used to help lock the core in the jacket. To help initiate expansion there are internal flutes in the nose of the jacket. The jacket extends to the tip of the bullet to eliminate battering in the magazines of hard kicking rifles. Grand Slam bullets are appropriate for the larger species of CXP2 and all CXP3 game and have a good reputation as all-around bullets for mixed bag hunts.\r\n\r\nAFRICAN GRAND SLAM soft point bullets are the toughest expanding bullets in the Speer line and are intended for use on CXP4 game. They use a jacket cup machined from a solid bar of gilding metal. This jacket is claimed to comprise almost half the total weight of the bullet and has a very thick shank. Internal serrations help bind the jacket to the lead alloy Hot-Cor when it is injected into the partially drawn cup, which is then formed into its final shape. African Grand Slam soft point bullets are available in .416 and .458 calibers. Speer also offers non-expanding African Grand Slam Tungsten Solid core bullets in .375, .416, and .458 calibers.\r\n\r\nSwift Bullet Company\r\n\r\nSwift makes the premium A-Frame partitioned, bonded core bullet and the Scirocco plastic tipped, bonded core bullet. The former is available in calibers from .22 to .470 in many bullet weights, while the selection of the latter is more limited, ranging in caliber from .22 to .338. All Swift bullets are made with pure lead cores and tapered pure copper jackets. Swift bullets are available to reloaders and are also used in Remington Premier factory loaded ammunition.\r\n\r\nMost A-Frame bullets are semi-spitzers, with point profiles along the lines of the Speer Mag-Tip, although the line also includes at least one round nose and a couple of flat point bullets. The A-FRAME is a tough bullet that features a heavy copper mid-section wall to positively limit expansion. The front core is bonded to the tapered copper jacket for controlled expansion up to 2x diameter and the rear end of the jacket is folded over the back of the bullet to retain the rear core for deep penetration. In ballistic gelatin testing, A-Frame bullets retained up to 95% of their original weight. Swift claims that the A-Frame is, "the bullet that hunters shoot with confidence, at any game, of any size, close up or far off."\r\n\r\nThe SCIROCCO was the first bonded core, plastic tipped bullet and all Scirocco bullets feature a 15 degree boat-tail base and a secant ogive nose to maximize ballistic coefficient. Swift reports that in their testing Scirocco bullets mushroomed effectively at impact velocities from 1440 fps to 3000 fps, retaining an average 70% of their original weight.\r\n\r\nWinchester Bullets\r\n\r\nIn addition the Combined Technology bullets produced for Winchester by Nosler, Winchester continues to offer the traditional Power Point and Silvertip bullets in their Super-X line of ammunition, as well as a moly-coated version of the Power Point called the "Power Point Plus" in their premium Supreme ammo line.\r\n\r\nThe POWER POINT is a flat base, soft point bullet with a tapered gilding metal jacket and a cannelure to help control expansion. There is an exposed lead tip and notches in the tip of the jacket to help initiate expansion.\r\n\r\nIt is available in spitzer, round nose, and flat point styles in Winchester factory loads for a wide variety of cartridges. Power Point bullets are also available in 100 count bags to reloaders in a limited number of calibers and bullet weights, including .224", .277", .284", .308", .308" (.30-30), and .310" (7.62x39).\r\n\r\nThe Power Point is primarily designed for CXP2 game, where it has a solid reputation for quick kills. The heaviest bullet weights in suitable calibers are also recommended for CXP3 game. It has proved a reliable game-getter for decades and is the most popular bullet ever made by Winchester.\r\n\r\nThe SILVERTIP is the long running companion to the Power Point. This is basically a flat base, soft point style bullet with considerable lead exposed at the tip. Except that the lead at the tip isn''t actually exposed. It is enclosed in a thin aluminum alloy nose cap to protect it in the magazine and slightly delay expansion. The Silvertip has a tapered gilding metal jacket and cannelure, much like the Power Point, but lacks the notches in the nose of the jacket.\r\n\r\nWinchester has always promoted the Silvertip as a deeper penetrating bullet than the Power Point. It is mostly loaded for CXP2 game, but in 180 grain .308 Win. and .30-06, 200 grain .348 Win., and 200 grain .358 Win. factory loads it is rated for CXP3 game. The traditional Silvertip bullet has been replaced by the CT Ballistic Silvertip (with which it should not be confused) in many calibers and loads.\r\n\r\nThe XP3 is Winchester''s latest bullet design, intended to replace the CT Fail Safe. The front half of this Lubalox coated bullet is solid gilding metal with a plastic tip, while the rear half contains a lead core. Imagine the front half of a Banes-X with a plastic tip grafted to the rear half of a Nosler Partition. The plastic tip is intended to initiate expansion earlier than the hollow point of the Fail Safe, creating a larger wound channel. The tail of the bullet ends in a short boat-tail. In addition, the rear core is bonded to the gilding metal jacket to prevent core loss even if the bullet turns a complete 180 degrees after impact. This very complicated bullet is available in a new line of Winchester ammunition called "Supreme Elite."\r\n\r\nWoodleigh Bullets\r\n\r\nThese Australian made bullets use heavy, gilding metal tapered jackets and lead cores bonded to the jacket to insure deep penetration and retention of the core. Hence the name Weldcore.\r\n\r\nWoodleigh offers soft point and protected point WELDCORE bullets, and also solid (FMJ) bullets. They are available to reloaders and also loaded in Kynoch (British) factory ammunition, Federal ammunition (USA), and Romey ammunition (Germany). Following is a quote from Briel Jackson, editor of Guns & Game magazine, Australia Published October- December, 1997 Issue No. 16, as reproduced on the Woodleigh web site:\r\n\r\n"I have never used a Weldcore on game or in test medium and not have it expand, nor have I ever used one in either case and had it fail to penetrate adequately. It is recommended that they should not be used when an impact velocity greater than 2900 fps is likely, this would be akin to shooting an animal at 50 yards with a 300 Magnum. I haven''t tried it, but at this velocity I imagine they would expand back to nothing. It is recommended that impact velocity be kept above 1900 fps, though as stated, in my experience, Woodleighs will open up nicely at impact velocities less than this, especially if they hit something solid."\r\n\r\nComments\r\n\r\nI wish that all bullet makers would provide at least the minimum and maximum acceptable impact velocities for their bullets, but very few do. Hornady, alone among the major bullet makers, specifies minimum and maximum muzzle velocity limits as well as recommended usage for all of their bullets.\r\n\r\nWinchester and Federal indicate the recommended usage for their factory loads. Winchester uses the CXP (controlled expansion) system while Federal simply uses the numbers 1 through 4 without the CXP prefix: In either case, CXP1 represents varmints and small game; CXP2 equals medium size big game such as deer, sheep, goats and antelope; CXP3 means large game such as elk and moose; CXP4 is heavy, dangerous game such as buffalo, rhino, and elephant. Practically everyone else comes up short, providing little or no velocity/expansion information about their bullets.', ''),

(369985, ' Looks Italian make to me, though Pietta is not known for shotguns, as you see the website too, they are more of a manufacturer specializing in old (period styled) replicas of 1800''s and expecially of the firearms during civil war in US. Other products they specialize is muzzleloading/cartridge firearms. So, without trying them out or hearing the after usage feedback, is it worth trying the new introduction.\r\n\r\n* What are the Pietta semi-auto 12 gauge shotgun variants this dealer is offering here in Pakistan ... MISTRAL, ZEPHYRUS or GHIBLI? The company Pietta makes three semi autos: one inertia driven (Zephyrus, 12ga) with weight 7lbs-4oz, other gas operated (Mistral, 12ga) with weight 7lbs-2oz (both in 28" barrel, 3" chamber) and last one ''Ghibli'' in 20ga category.\r\n\r\nAmong the models being made by Pietta, I would opt for Pietto MISTRAL model, 12 gauge, 3&#8221; chamber, gas operated, 7lbs 2oz in 28" barrel, ver "Black Nickel Plated" .... if I have to.... after confirming feedback, and certainly not Pietta Zephyrus due to inertia mechanism. I think it says it cylces anything from 28 grams load to 3" magnums high powered ones. So if that is true, I guess 24 grams skeet trap by Wah is out of our options as ammo. In Europe and USA, mostly 28 grams (1 oz) load is used for sporting (clay shooting) purposes. Neverthless, the Mistral as well as Zephyrus are  both though good looking models/guns. Here is a picture of "Mistral - Black Nickel Plated" model which I was talking about above:\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i1225.photobucket.com/albums/ee387/Francolino/PiettaMistral-BlackNickelPlatedmodel-12gaugesemiauto-NEWintro.jpg[/IMG]', ''),

U can also shoot duikers with it.\r\n\r\n[U].308 Win[/U]\r\nI have used this caliber for my entire mountain hunting in Pakistan and abroad. I have shot Ibex upto 420 yards with it and found it adequate (this is if you know the "drop" at that range). I have also shot wildboar, Chinkara, Hog deer and Neel Gai with out any fuss.  The bullet availability in Pakistan makes it my favorite caliber.\r\n\r\n[U]7mm Rem Mag[/U]\r\nI have used it to shoot few mountain animals and the performance is better than .308. I have also used it to shoot lots of African plains game although it works well on the animal but the fast bullet gets easily deflected in slight brush / grass, hence not the ideal caliber for African Plains game. I have shot a huge Leopard using this caliber but I don&#8217;t take it to Africa anymore.\r\n\r\n[U]300 Win Mag[/U]\r\nProbably the best performing and flattest shooting of the popular hunting calibers, it is very good for all type of hunting excluding the big thick skinned animals like Elephant, Buffalo and Rhino. I use it African plains game.\r\n\r\n[U]375 H&H Mag[/U]\r\nThis is the ideal caliber for hunting Africa, if I only take one Rifle for an African hunt, it is .375 H&H Mag. You can shoot duikers with a solid bullet and it will not ruin the animal and you can shoot an Elephant with it without any problem. And yes, all the animals in between Duiker and elephant can also be hunted with this caliber.\r\n\r\nThere are other great calibers like .270 and 30-06 but I have not use them enough so will not comment.', ''),

NADRA receives the documents and sends to MOI for verification of the license. When MOI confirms then NADRA issues a computerised card. NADRA hands over the computerised license to the licensee along with a certification letter from MOI.

(370469, ' First, check your face for any moles, and then look at the diagram below to identify the number(s) that are a closest match to the moles on your face. Usually, the moles only hold meaning for you if they are prominent and they are the only one. If your face if full of spots, acne or &quot;little&quot; moles, they do not count. When you''ve ascertained which position corresponds to the mole on your face, look up the meanings listed by numbers below.\r\n\r\n[B]Position 1 to 3[/B]\r\nAs a child, you are somewhat rebellious and a free spirit. You have an innate creativity and work best when you are given a free hand. Generally, your superiors like your avante garde approach to life. If you have a mole here, you are far better off in business and being your own boss rather than working for somebody. What is promising is that you have the luck to be your own boss.\r\n\r\n[B]Position 4[/B]\r\nYou are an impulsive person, often acting with a flamboyance that gives you charisma and a sparkling personality, but you can be difficult when there are too many opinions. You tend to be rather argumentative, but never to the point of holding grudges. This mole tends to give you an explosive temper and should you decide to remove it, you will find yourself becoming calmer and more at peace with the world.\r\n\r\n[B]Position 5[/B]\r\nA mole above the eyebrow indicates that there is wealth luck in your life, but you will need to earn it and work harder than most people. All the income you make must be carefully kept as there are people who are jealous of you who might attempt to sweet talk you into parting with your wealth. Be wary of those who try to interest you in get-rich-quick schemes. If you have a mole here, it is advisable not to be too trusting of others. Follow your instincts and be cautious. And never allow other people to control your finances.\r\n\r\n[B]Position 6[/B]\r\nA mole here indicates intelligence, creativity and skill as an artist. Your artistic talent can bring you wealth, fame and success. It also indicates wealth luck, but this can only be fully realized if you follow your heart rather than stick to conventional means of making a living. Success will come if you are brave.\r\n\r\n[B]Position 7[/B]\r\nMoles under the eyebrows indicate arguments within the extended family that cause you grief and unhappiness. This will affect your work and livelihood. It is advisable to settle any differences you have with your relatives if you want peace of mind to move ahead.\r\n\r\n[B]Position 8[/B]\r\nThis is not a very good position for a mole. Your financial position will constantly be under strain because of a tendency to overspend. You also have a penchant for gambling. The only thing is you must know when to stop. Meanwhile, someone with a mole here has a tendency to flirt with members of the opposite sex as well as with the same sex. Better be a little discerning where you exert your charms, or you might get into trouble.\r\n\r\n[B]Position 9[/B]\r\nThis mole position suggests sexual and other problems. It is an unfortunate mole and you are well advised to get rid of it. It brings a litany of woes and a parade of problems.\r\n\r\n[B]Position 10[/B]\r\nA mole here just under the nose indicates excellent descendants luck. You are surrounded by family at all times and will have many children and grandchildren. You have the support of those close to you and will be both materially and emotionally fulfilled.\r\n\r\n[B]Position 11[/B]\r\nMoles here suggest a tendency to succumb to illness. It is a good idea to have this mole removed especially if it is a large, dark-coloured mole. Otherwise use lots of foundation to cover it.\r\n\r\n[B]Position 12[/B]\r\nA mole here foretells a successful but also a very balanced life. You are likely to be not just rich, but famous as well. But although you have every opportunity to live the high life, you will have a satisfying home and family life as well. Women with moles here are particularly lucky and tend to be beautiful and glamourous as well.\r\n\r\n[B]Position 13[/B]\r\nYour children will be a big worry in your life. Your relationship with them is not good. There is nothing much you can do about this except to learn some tolerance.\r\n[B]\r\nPosition 14[/B]\r\nA mole here suggests a vulnerability to food which can be a big problem in your life. You may have allergies against certain foods or you may simply be eating too much.\r\n\r\n[B]Position 15[/B]\r\nYou are a person always on the move and constantly renovating and redesigning your house. You like to be introduced to new things and see new places. You are not happy if you remain in one place for long. You enjoy travel and adventure, and have a very observant eye.\r\n\r\n[B]Position 16[/B]\r\nYou need to be careful when it comes to eating, and also when it comes to your sex life. These are your two biggest problems. You tend to have weight issues which can make you depressed. You enjoy romance, sometimes with more than one person, but because you are a person with some morality, you will feel guilty about it and this will cause you much stress.\r\n\r\n[B]Position 17[/B]\r\nYou will be someone of great social prominence. You are active on the social scene and an excellent conversationalist. There is a tendency to become bigheaded about your success, which could lose you your good name. This will affect you deeply because you draw your confidence and self worth from what others think of you.\r\n\r\n[B]Position 18[/B]\r\nYou are a person always on the move. There is a great deal of overseas travel in your life, but you should take extra care each time you cross the great waters, as your mole prefers you to stay at home.\r\n\r\n[B]Position 19[/B]\r\nYou have money luck and many good friends, so this is a good mole to have. Your weakness is that you tend to succumb to the charms of the opposite sex. In your life, it is this that could get you into hot water, so do cool your ardour!\r\n\r\n[B]Position 20[/B]\r\nA mole here can be very lucky or very unlucky. If you have a mole here, you are destined either for extreme fame or infamy. You have great flair for creativity and are also highly intelligent, but your talents can be used for both good and bad. You are not a person to be trifled with for you are no pushover and do not forgive and forget easily. This mole is a mark of someone who will go down in history either as a great or as a tyrant.\r\n\r\n[B]Position 21[/B]\r\nThis is a good mole, as it suggests plenty to eat and drink throughout your life. This mole also brings fame and recognition.\r\n\r\n[B]Position 22[/B]\r\nYour life is always happy and things go smoothly for you. You could well become a sports superstar if you have the passion for it. Moles at the end of eyebrows also suggest a person of authority and power, so if you are the CEO of a company, you will do very well.\r\n\r\n[B]Position 23[/B]\r\nYou have a high IQ, and you are both brain smart and street smart. You have a highly-developed survival instinct and will lead a meaningful and long life. You will be active until a very old age and will have friends and family around you till the very end.\r\n\r\n[B]Position 24[/B]\r\nYou will achieve fame and fortune in your young age and you are advised to use this period to safeguard your old age, as people with moles here tend to have a harderlife as they get older.\r\n\r\n[B]Position 25[/B]\r\nYou will enjoy good prosperity and recognition luck, but do be careful of excesses. Stay traditional in your attitudes and you will have a long and fruitful life.', ''),

It has a cult following and collectors item these days.[/QUOTE]\n\nI was an admirer of the H&K P7 as it will cycle any ammo and it is ideal for silencer use. It has one major problem , it can fire accidently when drawing the gun under stress. It will fire when the grip is pressed and then the trigger squeezed; it will also fire when the trigger is squeezed first ( it is pressure less till grip is squeezed) and then the grip is tightened. \n We were are in Portugal for a Military Olympic Shooting competitions and we would all dote on an army oficer as she was so beautiful and attractive, she was very very proud of her P7 and her career as an anti terrorist operator. She lost her right leg and later died of complications as while drawing her P7 in action against BG she had squeezed the trigger first and then tightend  her grip while drawing her P 7; it fired hitting her thigh and the bullet travelled down to her knee, destroying her femur. This happened in the late 90s and ever since all of the shooters from our team do not want to own one.\nThe H&K P 7 remains a remarkable accurate and reliable hand gun with a unique gas retard locking action but was dropped from the US Police department for similar accidents and is now obsolescent and our SSG has dropped it for Glock 19s and 17s.\nIt is a great collecting item and very accurate and reliable gun, the only distractors being its weight and the problem I mentioned.', ''),

(370403, ' The LifeStraw makes dirty water clean\r\n\r\nMore than one billion people – one sixth of the world’s population - are without access to safe water supply. At any given moment, about half of the world''s poor are suffering from waterborne diseases, of which over 6,000 – mainly children – die each day by consuming unsafe drinking water. The world’s most prolific killer though is diarrhoeal disease from bacteria like typhoid, cholera, e. coli, salmonella and many others. Safe water interventions have vast potential to transform the lives of millions, especially in crucial areas such as poverty eradication, environmental upgradation, quality of life, child development and gender equality. LifeStraw was developed as a practical response to the billions of people who are still without access to these basic human rights.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe aptly-named LifeStraw is an invention that could become one of the greatest life-savers in history. It is a 25 cm long, 29 mm diameter, plastic pipe filter and costs just a few dollars (the manufacturers originally informed us the price was around US$2.00 but the price is now under review and we''ll be posting a new price shortly. The most prolific killer of human beings in developed countries is the automobile, followed by a host of diseases resulting mainly from an indulgent lifestyle.\r\n\r\nMillions of people perish every year because they simply don’t have clean water to drink. Until now, there was not much we could do about this because systems to clean water were costly and required electricity and spare parts and and and … but the LifeStraw now offers a viable means of saving tens of millions of lives every year.\r\n\r\nLifeStraw is a personal, low-cost water purification tool with a life time of 700 litres – approximately one year of water consumption for one person. Positive test results have been achieved on tap, turbid and saline water against common waterborne bacteria such as Salmonella, Shigella, Enterococcus and Staphylococcu.\r\n\r\nIf we (as in the big WE) can find a way of manufacturing and distributing one of these to each human at risk, every year, we could save countless lives (now there’s a noble outcome for the tech blogs and mags of the world to work together to promote this). Each LifeStraw lasts for one person’s annual needs of clean water – a simple straw costing a few dollars will ensure that one at-risk person will not die for a year - now that''s a donation we can all make with a serious kicker!\r\n\r\nThis LifeStraw was designed with special emphasize on avoiding any moving parts, as a sealed unit with no replaceable spare parts, and avoiding the use of electricity, which does not exist in many areas in the 3rd world. But as force (power) is required to implement the filtering, Vestergaard Frandsen chose to use the natural source of sucking, that even babies are able to perform. A brief technical rundown is available at MedGadget, the internet journal of emerging medical technologies.\r\n\r\nVestergaard Frandsen have managed to produce this product at a price that people in this business find hard to believe, but believed it had to achieve a price affordable to the Third World consumer.\r\n\r\nThe original idea was created ten years ago by Torben Vestergaard Frandsen, but over the years in partnersjhip with The Carter Center, Rob Fleuren from Holland and Moshe Frommer from Israel, the Lifestraw emerged from work designed to make water filters capable of safeguarding against Guinea Worm. The invention which emanated from the work, the, LifeStraw, can keep away bacteria and diseases like diphtheria, cholera and diarrhoea.\r\n\r\nWe’ll have more information on LifeStraw in the next week . In the meantime, LifeStraw has been nominated for a prestigious and vitally important INDEX: AWARDS\r\n\r\nINDEX: Awards focus specifically on design that significantly improves life for a large number of people and there’s a lot more information available in their nomination lists on the LifeStraw.\r\n\r\nThe LifeStraw web site is now open. Our suggestion is that if you are involved in a charity or community group, you make your group aware of this invention and its potential to improve the lives of millions of our less fortunate planetary brethren.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, LifeStraw supplied this list of FAQs\r\n\r\nQ1. What is LifeStraw? LifeStraw is a portable water purification tool that cleanses surface water and makes it safe for human consumption. It is just 25 cm long and 29 mm in diameter and can be hung around the neck. LifeStraw requires no electrical power or spare parts.\r\n\r\nQ2. What does LifeStraw do? LifeStraw filters up to 700 litres of water and effectively removes most of the micro organisms responsible for causing waterborne diseases.\r\n\r\nQ3. Which diseases will LifeStraw prevent? LifeStraw kills disease causing micro organisms which spread diarrhoea, dysentery, typhoid, and Cholera.\r\n\r\nQ4. Which disease-causing micro organisms are filtered by LifeStraw? LifeStraw filters bacteria such as Shigella, Salmonella, Enterrococus, Staphylococcus Aureus and E.Coli\r\n\r\nQ5. Are there any tests to prove this? LifeStraw has been tested by independent and qualified research laboratories.\r\n\r\nQ6. How does LifeStraw function? LifeStraw contains PuroTech Disinfecting Resin (PDR) - a patented, extraordinarily effective material that kills bacteria on contact. Textile pre-filters are used in the LifeStraw to remove particles up to 15 microns. Active carbon withholds particles such as parasites.\r\n\r\nQ7. What do the tests and research studies indicate? The studies indicate the following:\r\n\r\nThe level of bacteria in the water will be reduced to levels that will provide water safe for human consumption. ‘Safe’ implies water from which any health risk is minimal. The particulate removal suggests that the number of any parasitic ova in raw water will also be reduced significantly. The released amount of iodine in water treated from LifeStraw is not normally damaging to human health. However, people having thyroid problems and allergic reaction to iodine must seek medical advice before using this tool.\r\n\r\nQ8. What is the life expectancy of the LifeStraw? One year from the start of usage (calculation based on consumption of 2 litre water per day) or 700 liters. Use beyond expiry will not deteriorate existing water quality.\r\n\r\nQ9. What is the required daily water consumption? The WHO default levels for the quantities of drinking water (reference to WHO drinking water quality guidelines Third edition 2004, Annex III), are: For a 10 kg child, 1 litre water per day - thus 700 days tool For a 60 kg adult, 2 litre water per day - thus a 350 days tool\r\n\r\nQ10. Who can use the LifeStraw? Adults and children of any age can use the LifeStraw, provided they have capacity to suck water\r\n\r\nQ11. How should LifeStraw be used the first time? First time users are advised to spit out the first couple of mouthfuls (40 ml) as a small amount of harmless black carbon water will be expelled on initial use. First time users may find it difficult to start sucking. This is because a natural brake on the flow of water has been put into the LifeStraw, as a controlled flow between 100 ml to 150 ml per minute is needed to get the maximum benefit of the bacteria killing effect.\r\n\r\nQ12. How can LifeStraw be effectively utilised? At regular intervals, it is recommended to blow out the last mouthful of water as well as some air through the LifeStraw. This will clean the pre-filters of whatever sand, silt and debris that might have got stuck in the textile filters.\r\n\r\nQ13. Does LifeStraw filter arsenic, iron, fluoride and other heavy metals? No. Q14. What is the impact of saline water on the lifetime of LifeStraw? It is expected that continuously drinking saline water through the LifeStraw would reduce effective life to 350 litres.\r\n\r\nQ15. Can I share my LifeStraw with other people? It is not recommended that you share your LifeStraw with others. Any outside contamination of the LifeStraw will not be compensated by inside purification.', ''),

(370386, 'Pistol Construction Materials [B][U]Pistol Construction Materials [/U][/B] By David Tong\r\n\r\nThe semi-automatic pistol market is possibly the firearms industry’s leading developmental focus. Having studied pistol construction for several decades, I have reached some conclusions about the plusses and minuses of each of the commonly used materials.\r\n\r\nThere are four concerns regarding the strength of materials commonly used in pistol construction. These are usually measured and quantified by the direction of the force applied to a given cross section (wall thickness) of a material. Compressive force is what the part mostly endures from recoil forces. Torsional strength is a twisting motion and can usually only be seen in ultra-high speed photography. Finally, tensile strength is a measurement of the ability of a part to resist stretching or shear forces.\r\n\r\nGenerally, the part is clamped into a machine with jaws that both hold and test the part. The yield point is the amount of stress that a material can withstand without permanent damage. Stress testing allows a manufacturer to test a sample of material in non-destructive as well as destructive ways. The information is usually quantified in pounds-per-square-inch.\r\n\r\n[B][U]Steel[/U][/B]\r\nThe traditional material for firearms construction is high carbon, heat-treated steel. Generally, the Rockwell C scale quantifies the heat treatment runs and usually the frame is not as hard as the operating slide. These figures are approximately RC 30-40 for the frame and RC 40-55 for the slide, because the slide is the primary feed mechanism and serves as the locking abutment for the barrel.\r\n\r\nRevolvers operate in compression as well. Recoil is absorbed by the recoil plate as the forces are applied to that part of the frame. Tensile strength is tested, as the frame is stretched by the same force on the top strap and crane areas, as well as pressure contained by the cylinder and barrel.\r\n\r\nThere is much to recommend steel construction. Steel’s properties are well known and the material itself is durable. While the material can be cast, forged, or fully machined from bar stock, economic production has become far less labor and time intensive due to computer controlled machining centers.\r\n\r\nSteel’s strength also means that relatively thin structural cross sections can be used, compared to other popular materials, and this can play a role in ergonomic fit for people with small hands. Steel can be repaired by welding in some cases.\r\n\r\nA working estimate of the strength of steel can be found in the larger “plastic range” than other materials. This means that it can operate reliably between a nominal yield point and the ultimate tensile failure point and endure deflection over a greater range of stress without damage. This figure can be as much as 40% of the difference between the yield and failure points. A decent hypothetical example would be a nominal yield point of 40,000 psi and a failure point of 65,000 psi. In other words, steel has a great capacity to absorb energy.\r\n\r\nMajor structures such as slides and frames can be made with castings, usually the lost wax or “investment” process. The much greater tensile strength of steel can make up for the amorphous grain structure that casting produces (compared to a forging), although a cast steel part is usually “over built” with thicker cross sections. This can be seen in the older Ruger P-series pistols that are somewhat bulkier than some other popular designs.\r\n\r\nFor smaller parts, the metal-injection-molding (MIM) process can accurately reproduce parts that require little or no finish machining. Most manufacturers, including those who advertise forged construction on major components, utilize MIM to control costs. MIM can create parts with very little shrinkage and high-dimensional accuracy. Good quality MIM parts can rival machined forgings for durability.\r\n\r\nThe weight of steel aids in control and aiming steadiness, although it makes carrying of the arm less comfortable. While advances in the design of mechanisms and understanding of recoil timing through computer aided design and high-speed photography provide advantages to lighter materials, there is no free lunch. An aluminum or plastic framed arm will always recoil more than equivalent steel ones, as mass times velocity equals energy whether delivered on target or absorbed by one’s hands.\r\n\r\nSteel is easily finished. In the past, the standard finishes have been hot dipped bluing, nickel plating and manganese phosphate “Parkerizing.” Nickel plating is attractive and highly corrosion resistant, but not terribly durable. From the 1970''s on, industrial chrome plating has been used to provide greater wear resistance and ease of cleaning, although it is not as corrosion resistant as many might believe.\r\n\r\nStainless steels offer inherent corrosion resistance. They generally have a lower carbon content to make them easier to machine and this can affect susceptibility to rusting. A more accurate description would be "rust resistant steel." A gunsmith I know once stated that most firearm-quality stainless steel tends to be somewhat “stringy” when machined. Stainless steel is harder on tooling and requires different cutting fluids than standard carbon steel, which increases production costs.\r\n\r\nAutomatic pistols made of stainless steel must have differential alloys and/or heat treatment for slide and receiver to avoid galling. The defunct firm Arcadia Machine and Tool used to make a 1911 clone with a very soft grade of stainless. This resulted in poor wear and galling of both slide and frame. Many revolvers have been manufactured of stainless and due to the softer metal alloys generally used, they can lose their cylinder timing under hard use faster, compared to standard carbon steel.\r\n\r\nVarious sprayed-on finishes, such as Brownell’s “Alumahide,” KG “Gun Kote”, Lauer’s “Dura Coat” and the newest process, “Ceracoat,” have been used on less aesthetically emphasized firearms. The latter incorporates a ceramic component that is head and shoulders more abrasion, corrosion and wear resistant than the others.\r\n\r\nSteel’s drawbacks include its weight, its need for some lubrication and protection from corrosion and the issue of comfort at either end of the temperature range in which a firearm may be employed. I have always-preferred steel, believing its attributes outweigh its drawbacks.\r\n\r\n[B][U]Aluminum[/U][/B]\r\nBefore World War II aluminum, though one of the most prevalent metals, was expensive to refine from raw ore and there was a traditional distaste for its use in firearms. The use of aluminum alloys was the industry’s first major post-war development for pistols, particularly for constant carry purposes. Colt introduced the Lightweight Commander in 1949, a slightly shortened and 30% lighter version of the Government Model, as an offshoot of the General Officer’s Pistol program of the era.\r\n\r\nWeight is a big deal to a police officer. Burdened by a Sam Browne belt loaded with accessories that can weigh up to 20 pounds, pistols such as the Colt Commander, Smith & Wesson’s M39 automatic and M12 Airweight revolver lightened the load. An aluminum-framed arm can save between 35%-40% in weight compared to steel and that is important to someone who must pack the weight daily for long hours. \r\n\r\nI do wonder how much this really matters to the civilian concealed carry permit holder when one’s pistol is carried in a well-fitting holster commensurate to your clothing and the weather. (Even more, because it is impractical for the civilian to wear a Sam Browne belt or a separate, wide gun belt to support a heavy pistol''s weight. -Editor.)\r\n\r\nI think it can be reliably stated that aluminum framed arms are not as durable as a steel one of equivalent design and cross section. There is no free lunch. Aluminum does not have the tensile strength of steel. The aluminum alloy must be carefully chosen and as much as 50% thicker in cross section, compared to an equivalent steel part. The cross section of a material becomes important to the pistol shooter, not only because of weight, but also due to ergonomic issues, such as balance and grip width. Aluminum is simply not as capable as steel of handling an auto’s slide recoiling into the frame. An aluminum revolver frame is less resistant to flame cutting and stretching than a steel one.\r\n\r\nAluminum has been a popular alternative to steel for the high-capacity 9mm pistol for decades. This use did have a gestation period, though. Carl Walther Waffenfabrik of Ulm, Germany, remade the P-38 pistol after WWII with an aluminum frame and these frames stress cracked far more frequently than the original steel design. Manufacturers must take into account the need for somewhat greater cross-sections in stress-bearing areas subject to recoil when using aluminum components.\r\n\r\nThe most prevalent surface finish used on aluminum has been some form of hard-anodizing process. Usually only a few mils in thickness, it offers greater corrosion and wear resistance and does not increase weight. The process can produce Rockwell C figures in the 60''s on the wear surface of the metal. Usually the hard coat anodizing is applied over a glass bead blasted prepared surface. This produces a matte finish that is preferred for a non-reflective “social” pistol, although it does not have to be this way. A highly polished hard-anodized surface is possible, though rarer, mostly because of the additional labor costs involved in surface preparation. Aluminum can also be finished in decorative nickel and hard chrome, as well as the sprayed-on finishes mentioned above.\r\n\r\nDrawbacks include greater felt recoil. Some aluminum alloys cannot be welded, including the “Coltalloy” used in the Commander. Repairs are generally not possible if fatigue cracks occur, although this also means that the expected life of the arm has been exceeded. Beretta claims on its website a 30,000 round life for its M9 service pistol. That is roughly one-third to one-half of the life of its steel framed predecessor.\r\n\r\n[B][U]Polymer (plastic)[/U][/B]\r\nThe use of plastics in pistol construction was limited to non-structural items, such as grips and recoil spring guides, until the German firm of Heckler and Koch introduced the polymer framed Model VP-70 in the mid-1970s. While Steyr-Daimler-Puch of Austria made extensive use of polymer for the AUG assault rifle (including its entire trigger group!), the real revolution began with Gaston Glock’s seminal G17 of 1983. Not only did Glock use the material for the frame, he used it for a number of the smaller parts, as well. Anti-gun political zealots of the time attempted to argue that these plastic guns were not metal detectable in security areas. This was an outright lie, as all plastic pistols have a large steel component in other functioning parts. A Glock looks like, well, a Glock as seen on the screen of an airport X-ray machine.\r\n\r\nPlastic components were adopted for multiple reasons. First, and most obvious, is weight savings.\r\n\r\nAnother is manufacturing economy. While the precision injection molds are expensive to produce, once done the molded parts are quickly and cheaply made. This is no small matter for any company concerned with cost savings on metal cutting equipment, legal liability expenses and profit per unit sold at normal retail levels.\r\n\r\nPlastic frame construction has a third benefit, as the arms are very damage resistant due to compressive recoil impact. I have heard one anecdotal report of a range rental Glock 17 having shot over 350,000 rounds and Glock itself has one example that has fired in excess of a half-million rounds. There is no question that the material, at least in that company’s proprietary polymer blend, offers the prospect of generations of hard use capability that can be far beyond the expected life of more traditional construction materials.\r\n\r\nAnother big plus is the thermal neutrality of a plastic frame in one’s hand. Not having a very cold or very hot metal surface to hang onto means greater comfort over a much wider temperature range.\r\n\r\nThe plastic framed pistols that I have owned or tested all functioned reliably, were adequately accurate and were easy to maintain. Their very thin magazine wells allow for the use of large double-column magazines while maintaining a reasonable grip girth. Molded plastic can also allow for substantial ergonomic changes via the use of interchangeable grip panels to accommodate different hand sizes.\r\n\r\nWhile these are all practical reasons for owning and using a plastic framed pistol, and I’d include the avant-garde mixed-construction Ruger LCR in this observation, they are the reasons why I admire them, rather than desire them.\r\n\r\nAs our esteemed Managing Editor, Chuck Hawks, has stated in these pages regarding plastic rifle stocks, polymer pistols engender little pride of ownership. I view them more as tools rather than “objets d’arte.” My conventional aesthetic sensibilities are offended by mould lines, plastic flash on edges and molded checkering or stippling. \r\n\r\nPlastic offers far less tensile strength, making it more susceptible to catastrophic failure than either steel or aluminum. While over-pressure cartridges can damage steel or aluminum framed pistols, there are many more reports of polymer-framed pistols suffering explosive destruction, due to the material itself failing. These instances are relatively rare, considering the sheer number of polymer pistols sold, but the numbers are still significant. Arms manufacturers must take this into their economic calculus when considering legal costs against production savings.\r\n\r\nNaturally, polymer’s very lightweight means that recoil control and aiming stability can be compromised, especially as the magazine runs dry. Though I have never fired one, I suspect that the .357 Magnum chambered version of the Ruger LCR, or the equivalent Smith & Wesson revolvers, would be distasteful to shoot. (David, you are a master of understatement! The LCR is "distasteful" to shoot with .38 +P loads. -Editor.) However, the Ruger LCR revolver is a masterpiece of mixed construction, combining all three of the major materials discussed in this article.\r\n\r\nFor many, plastic is the way to go as it offers corrosion proof construction, light weight, durability and lower acquisition cost when new. The hard-core Bauhausian “form follows function” adherent will discount or ignore aesthetic purity in his or her calculus. I hope that this short article will provide the reader with a balanced perspective for each material, based on the kind of usage one is considering.', ''),

(370419, ' When it comes to &#8220;how much is enough?&#8221; we must first answer, &#8220;enough for what?&#8221; \r\n\r\nThe basic model during times of assured supply is to have enough to carry you through at your current consumption rate until \r\n\r\nresupply arrives. This model is known as &#8220;just in time&#8221; inventory. To practice this, you have to know with relative certainty \r\n\r\nthe time it takes to get resupply of your ammo needs. Legal/quota restrictions are need to be addressed by having more licenses and firearms in similiar calibers and increasing quota from MoI/HD to max possible.\r\n\r\nConsumption of ammo falls into several categories:\r\n\r\n1. Practice ammo. This is the amount of ammo you need per weapon to maintain proficiency. You may have a different level of \r\n\r\neach ammo type under conditions where ammo is plentiful and cheap than you would when it is scarce and expensive. But in any \r\n\r\ncase, you should establish some basic level of ammo usage for practice. During times of real scarcity you may select to idle \r\n\r\nsome guns and allow your proficiency to wane.\r\n\r\n2. Personal defense Ammo. A relatively small amount that you carry or keep near the weapon or in vehicle and in house. In \r\n\r\nmost cases, you never use this ammo so it lasts a long time. I recommend you keep enough to fill your magazines twice (15 x 3 \r\n\r\nx 2 = 90 rounds for handgun plus 30 x 3 x 2 = 180 rounds for rifle). So you can have one large shootout and still not be left \r\n\r\ndefenseless against a real low probability of a second one before you can resupply.\r\n\r\n3. Hunting/Sniping Ammo. If you hunt, I know that you can program a certain amount of ammo each season for confirming the \r\n\r\nzero on your scope, missed shots and filling the freezer. You only need do this for the guns you use to hunt. A One shot kill \r\n\r\nsniping requires atleast 5 boxes of 20 rounds. If in popular military caliber like 308 or 30-06, supply/availability will be \r\n\r\nno problem.\r\n\r\n4. Just in case or SHTF. When the world as we know it ends, you do not want to be standing in line at Nila Gumbad bidding on \r\n\r\nthat last box of ammo. So even in the off event that such a thing might happen, having some around the house is a good thing. \r\n\r\nThis does not have to be enough to kill off the entire Zombie horde on your own, just enough to help protect you when you go \r\n\r\nout for food and to protect what is yours. Rule of thumb is twice the amount you keep for #2 but for each gun. This assumes \r\n\r\nthat resupply is no longer possible except by scavenging.\r\n\r\n5. Trading. Some people like gold as the medium of exchange of last resort. But in the real last resort, there won&#8217;t be \r\n\r\nenough gold to go around. Lead, bundled with small amounts of brass and powder make a very good medium of exchange. If you \r\n\r\nhave an excess of cash and believe it will be lost to inflation, you are probably looking for something to buy that will hold \r\n\r\nits value. I recommend Ammo.\r\n\r\n6. Competition. If you are a shooting sports competitor, you already know how much ammo you need to devote to practice and \r\n\r\ncompeting including when the seasons for this begin and end. Likely you already also plan when and how much to buy for \r\n\r\nupcoming events. But you don''t need to stockpile this unless you are avoiding spikes in costs or supply disruptions. If the \r\n\r\nsupplies are severely disrupted (as by government edict for example) for a long period, these sports will likely languish as \r\n\r\norganized events and stocking ammo for them will also become futile.\r\n\r\n\r\n7. The Revolution. You really don&#8217;t need to stock up a lot for a revolution. Whoever you are revolting against will likely be \r\n\r\nwell supplied with their own ammo and if you have just enough on hand to beat them, you can use them as your resupply. ule of \r\n\r\nthumb is twice the amount you keep for #4. If you practice with those weapons that are fashionable with most militaries/LEAs \r\n\r\nthen you will be prepared for using those weapons when need arises. You don&#8217;t even have to have your own. As with ammo, your \r\n\r\nenemies will bring plenty of weapons. This is the fallacy of the police state versus the unarmed population. If the police \r\n\r\nhave guns, then everyone has access to guns. They just have to take them from the police. Clearly not an impossible task.\r\n\r\nAbove is basic stockpile needed in case. In addition to that I would suggest bare minimum 10,000 .22 LR bullets including 20% \r\n\r\nStinger/Remington Yellow Jackets and 2% shotshells.\r\n\r\nMy target "how much is enough" ammo would be like this;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1. Practice ammo: .22LR Federal = 100, 9mm Russian = 100, 12G S&B =50 anytime casual range shooting/plinking\r\n\r\n2. Personal Defense (SD, HD, VD): CC 9mm HP 124gr = 52 (3 mags + 1 in chamber), CQB Rifle (in vehicle)= 30 x 3 = 90, 12 G \r\n\r\nShotgun SG+LG rounds Federal =  8 x 2 = 16.\r\n\r\n3. Hunting and Sniping ammo: Hunting requirement may be calculated according to 1 year hunting plans. For 308 bolt action \r\n\r\nrifle = 100 rounds any time.\r\n\r\n4. SHTF: .22 LR = 10,000 rounds, Pistol ammo in common calibers (9mm and .30) = 500, .357 = 250, 12 G Defensive ammo = 500 & \r\n\r\nBird Hunting = 500, CQB Rifle = 20 (mags in backpack) x 30 (rounds per mag)x 2(#2) x 2(#4) = 2400, Bolt Action Rifle = 500 \r\n\r\nstored properly as being large caliber only limited supply can be borrowed from this cache anytime. You will need vehile to \r\n\r\nrelocate cache for Shotgun and rifles ammo.\r\n\r\n5. Reinforce all above and below.\r\n\r\n6. Competetion grade ammo is costly so collect as per demand basis and refresh.\r\n\r\n7. 1+2+3+4.\r\n\r\nAnother aspect is to trade or refresh the ammo cache to keep from rust/getting old/primer damage and check SoPs for stocking \r\n\r\nammo.\r\n\r\nAbove is my two cents. Follwoing are some food for thought links, first two are very interesting articles;\r\n\r\n[url]http://akeyboardanda45.blogspot.com/2008/10/how-much-ammunition-is-enough.html[/url]\r\n[url]http://selousscouts.blogspot.com/2009/12/ammunition-how-much-is-enough.html[/url]\r\n[url]http://www.survivalistboards.com/showthread.php?t=119708[/url]\r\n[url]http://thesurvivalpodcast.com/forum/index.php?topic=2141.0[/url]', ''),

(370513, ' A.A\n\nI give you my opinion \ni dont know that you are a young or old hunter but by experience i think that you are a young hunter and i will suggest you that the firearm is a greatest friend and a worst enemy so pick up a senior hunter as your guide and make it by practicals then you came to experience that at what bird you have to shot what cartidge.\n\nFor small birds like starling, quail,dove,pigeon etc the shot number 8 is best for them because they contains a large number of pellets.Besides this it depends upon your distance from the bird you want to hunt and the basic thing is that is the bird in your range or out of range.Always hunt the birds within range never shoot them at out of range i am giving you the talks of high experience so act upon these and make profit of my experience  and if you shoot the bird within range your cartidges never wastes and you do a good hunt. I have seen most hunters that they shoot out of range and it is a knowledge It is a theory and do practicle in the field the exact thing is the field where you want to do the hunt gain these things from experience hunters who mostly do not share i am giving my experience when you becomes experienceable you came to know that at which hunt you need which cartidge.\nWithout the teacher the student fails.\n\nIf someone do not like it then i am sorry because ALLAH likes this.\n\nthanks for the regards', ''),

(370519, ' [B]History of one of the oldest gun manufacturers BERETTA !\r\n[/B]\r\n\r\nBeretta has been owned by the same family for some five hundred years. The Beretta company was established in 1526,[1] when gunsmith Maestro Bartolomeo Beretta[2] of Gardone Val Trompia (Brescia, Lombardy, Italy) was paid 296 ducats for 185 arquebus barrels by the Arsenal of Venice.[3] The bills of sale for the order of those firearms are in the firm''s archives.\r\nIn 1918, the Beretta Model 1918 was the second submachine gun the Italian army fielded. Beretta manufactured rifles and pistols for the Italian military until the 1943 Armistice between Italy and the Allied forces during World War II. With the Wehrmacht''s control of northern Italy, the Germans seized Beretta and continued producing arms until the 1945 German surrender in Italy. In that time, the exterior finish of the weapons was much inferior to both the pre-war and mid-war weapons, but their operation remained excellent.[4] The last shipment of Type I rifles left Venice for Japan in a U-boat in 1942.\r\nAfter World War II, Beretta was actively involved in repairing the American M1 Garands given to Italy by the U.S. Beretta modified the M1 into the Beretta BM-59 rifle, which is similar to the M14 battle rifle; armourers consider the BM-59 rifle to be superior, in some ways, to the M14 rifle, because it is more accurate under certain conditions.[5]\r\nAfter the war, Beretta continued to develop firearms for Italian army and police and for civilian market.\r\nIn the eighties, Beretta enjoyed a renewal of popularity in North America after its Beretta 92 pistol was selected as service handgun for the United States Army under the designation "M9 pistol".\r\nBeretta acquired several domestic competitors (notably Benelli and Franchi) and some foreign companies (notably in Finland) in the late eighties.', ''),

On an other note,  the courts donot provide the jacks of any kind to any one , in particular , we can not say so about  today&#8217;s SC as we know that it is not the &#8220; SAME&#8221; SC that happened to be in the past , in my view , it is simple as that. Besides, so far as I understand from the carefully drafted wording of the order of SC , it has just approved the revalidation process byNADRA only .  Lahore high court still could adjudicate upon the other matters including card system or bar code bearing stickers , facility of entering number of bullets etc etc . supreme court has not sealed or closed all doors of public facilitation neither it has opposed or decided the legal issue of issuance of  gazette notification.

There is Indus, Chenab, Jhelum, Ravi etc and rivers like Kabul etc in your areas I guess ... & the route ducks take to reach the South (i.e. Sind) after crossing from Punjab is NOT clear yet.

I have seen most hunters that they shoot out of range and it is a knowledge It is a theory and do practicle in the field the exact thing is the field where you want to do the hunt gain these things from experience hunters who mostly do not share i am giving my experience when you becomes experienceable you came to know that at which hunt you need which cartidge.\nWithout the teacher the student fails.\n\nIf someone do not like it then i am sorry because ALLAH likes this.\n\nthanks for the regards[/QUOTE]\n \nMian Shab Inshallah , waise hi hoga jaise ap ne bola hai , of course i am do careful bout the gun, gun is something u cant go around jokin with\nyes i am a junior hunter , actually i use to hunt since i was child but then not with guns , i just use to go around with my friends with a gulair in my hand and hunt small local birds , things like that \nthen i got lil occupied with studies and otha things , i just got lil time for myself now , hunting is my passion whenver i get a chance i go on hunt with my pals from village but i dont hunt a big scale i am just a small scale hunting enthusiast.

This is not a commercial site; we are vending only the truth regarding Damascus as best as can be determined. It is very likely that our current fund of knowledge contains errors, and we are continually revising the contents as new information becomes available.

No 1, a gun made in 1866 by Purdey, subsequently converted from pin-fire to central principle, to which new barrels were made last year. Nos. 2 and 3, a pair of central fire breechloaders, made also by Purdey, about 1870, for which I have likewise had new barrels. No. 4, a new gun made by Purdey this year to match the two mentioned above, but with Whitworth steel instead of Damascus barrels. The guns are all 12 bore, with cylinder 30 in. barrels, not choked.\n&#8220;Whitworth steel barrels are not desirable for a heavy day''s shooting. The explosion in them makes quite a different sound from that given off by Damascus barrels: there is more ring about it, and I can imagine that this might prove a serious annoyance to anyone who minds the noise of shooting. Moreover, the Whitworth barrels became hot much more rapidly than the Damascus, and this is a serious drawback...I am replacing them with Damascus as in all my other guns.&#8221; \n \n \n A Brief History of Damascus Steel\n \nThe history of pattern welded shotgun barrels starts about 125 years after Alexander the Great made it to India, where Wootz/ Bulat/ Crucible steel was first forged 200 B.C.E. Etruscan smiths had been laminating blades for 400 years, but Wootz was a vastly superior product and the surface of finished weapons showed a pattern called &#8220;watering,&#8221; &#8220;firind&#8221;, or &#8220;jawhar.&#8221;   \n \nAsadullah Wootz Blade, Persian Safavid Period courtesy of [url]http://www.oriental-arms.com/index.php[/url]\n \n  \n \nPossibly in an attempt to reproduce these patterns, smiths layered thin sheets of iron and steel which were repeatedly folded and hammer welded, then treated with an etching agent (at first citrus juices) to enhance the contrast. By the sixth century, pattern welded sword blades had made their way to Northern Europe and by 1000 were being manufactured from Toledo, Spain in the West to Indonesia (Kris) in the Far East. From 1096-1270, Crusaders returned home from the Middle East bearing both scars and samples of "Damascus" blades.\n \nAbout 1200 the first iron musket barrels were produced by folding a sheet of iron over a mandrel and hammer welding the long edge. At some point pattern welded sword methodology was applied to gun barrel methodology - twisting rods composed of thin layers of iron and steel, wrapping the rods around a mandrel, and hammer welding the edges. By the early 1600s, pattern welded gun barrels were being produced in India and Turkey, and examples exist of mid-1600s Turkish Miquelet barrels clearly showing a Four Iron Crolle pattern.\n \n\n \nIn 1634 Hungarian gunmaker Caspar Hartmann made Damascus barrels for King Gyorgy Rakoczi I and by 1650 Spanish makers produced pattern welded barrels during the reign of Philip IV. With the defeat of Kara Mustafa Pasha by Jan III Sobieski at Vienna in 1683, thousands of gun barrels were available for examination by armourers throughout Western Europe. By 1700, Liege was producing Twist barrels, and Crolle Damascus by about 1750. After Gen. Napoleon Bonaparte&#8217;s expedition against the Mameluks in Egypt and Ottomans in Syria 1798-1799, production of Damascus barrels in St. Etienne and Liege was markedly expanded.\n \nJ. Jones was granted a British patent in 1806 for a method of making barrels from scelps or strips coiled around a mandrel and by 1817 Rigby of Dublin was producing Damascus barrels. &#8220;Damascus iron&#8221; was manufactured in Birmingham by Wiswould and Adams by about 1820 and Charles Lancaster supplied Purdey (and others) c.1811-1826 before establishing his own gunmaking company. The last barrel maker in London was W. Fullard, of Clerkenwell, who ceased operations in 1844. From 1845 to 1855 John Dive''s mill at Birmingham produced large quantities of &#8220;figured&#8221; barrels. John Marshall''s Monway Iron and Steel Works, Staffordshire was a major supplier of gun barrel iron and steel to both the Birmingham and U.S. markets. Damascus and Laminated Steel barrels from Thomas Kilby & Son, Steelhouse Lane, Birmingham were used by several American makers (with both British and Lindner actions) including William and James Donn, George T. Abbey and Edwin Thomas Jr. of Chicago, and Martin F. Kennedy of St. Paul.\n \n \n \nPattern Welded shotgun barrels can be classified into three general categories, all starting with strips of iron and steel, but with different manufacturing methodology: Twist (thin ribbons of layered iron and steel which were NOT twisted before being wrapped around the mandril and hammer forged), Crolle Damascus in many patterns (determined by how the iron and steel were ''piled'' or layered in the billet and the twisting of the rods), and Laminated Steel (a higher ratio of steel to iron mixed together and &#8216;puddled&#8217; before being formed into rods.)\n \n\n               \nIn England, Stub Twist (made from iron horse shoe nail stubs and chopped up coach spring steel), Plain Twist, and an early form of Laminated Steel were used for quality British gun barrels into the 1860s. Crolle Damascus was available in the late 1820s, but large scroll &#8220;English Two Stripe&#8221; was not in general use until the mid-1800s, and along with Three Iron &#8220;Oxford&#8221; and a later Laminated Steel was used c. 1850-1890s. Four Iron &#8220;Turkish&#8221; appeared after 1870, although most ''Best Guns'' used Three Iron. Lower quality English guns used Plain Twist/Skelp into the early 1900s.\n \nWilliam Wellington Greener in The Gun and Its Development admitted that the great majority of unfinished tubes used by both Birmingham and London makers were obtained from Liege but&#8230;&#8220;With the English maker the figure of the barrel is the last thing to be considered when determining the type most fit for the particular purpose, whereas with the foreign manufacturer it is usually the first, and often the only consideration. The English maker takes a barrel that will do best; the foreign maker the barrel that will look best.&#8221; Leopold Bernard (1832-1867) and Rene Leclerc were barrel makers in Paris and responsible for many of the patterns seen on barrels produced in France, Liege, and Ferlach. Ernest Heuse-Lemoine (1834-1926) from Nessonvaux was a major barrel agent and maker in the Vesdre Valley and maintained representatives in London, Birmingham, and New York. He named &#8220;Boston&#8221; and &#8220;Washington&#8221; Damascus (patterns) especially for the American market.\n \n\n \nNO American maker produced pattern welded barrels after about 1880, and the vast majority of rough forged tubes were obtained from Liege. Damascus barrel production ceased in England in 1903 according to Greener, while in 1906 Liege produced 850 tons of Damascus barrels; 100 tons for export. Damascus production ended soon after August 7, 1914 when Liege fell to the invading German army, and resumed only briefly following World War I by Jean-Baptiste Delcour-Dupont. \n \nWhat was the ''Damascus Road'' that carried pattern welded barrel (not blade) technology from the Islamic world to Western Europe; St. Etienne, Liege, Brescia, Suhl, Ferlach, and the British Isles?\nIt is likely there were two main ''highways'': the Moors to Spain and eastward, and the Turks to Hungary and westward (and northeast to Russia.) But the knowledge and material traveled via many pathways with the free, though not entirely voluntary, exchange of military and mercenary, armourers, artisans, merchants, and explorers from the Far East to West Africa. \n \nGuns for the Sultan: Military Power and the Weapons Industry in the Ottoman Empire \n"Between the fifteenth and seventeenth centuries, direct military conflicts, the employment of European military experts and, to a lesser degree, illegal trade in weaponry ensured relatively easy dissemination of up-to-date technologies and military know-how in the Sultan&#8217;s realms. Istanbul was more than a simple recipient of foreign technologies with its Turkish and Persian artisans and blacksmiths, Armenian and Greek miners and sappers, Turkish, Bosnian, Serbian, Hungarian, Italian, German, and later French, English and Dutch foundrymen and military engineers&#8230;(all) adding to their expertise metallurgy techniques of the Islamic East..."', ''),

I think it is unwise to deny a fact and its better we face it. I am sure that all the respectable and old members of PG agree on this that criminals don''t need licenses. Genuine licenses are only sought by those who are law abiding citizens and want to protect themselves in a rightful manner. But unfortunately our government has made it very difficult for us who want it solely for HD/SD and have no bad intentions. You must be well aware of all the problems that you have to face in getting genuine license from authorities. These problems would not have been there if our system supported good and discouraged evil. Good governments, welfare states, help citizens to follow legal ways, and not vice versa. \n\nAnyways, here I am seeking my first NPB Provincial License in legal way.

(370679, ' @ Brig. Azam \n  Sir, \n  I adore your idea but a portable blind concept (over the boat) is really a naive task here. Actually, the crux of your query is regarding saving of time and headache to build a new hide each time.  \n\n  Frankly speaking this is the beauty of duck hunting to make all arrangements on spot. This has become the major reason that many hunters are either using old crawling method, engaged in paid hunting or guests in others blinds to avoid this hectic exercise. \n\n  The concept of blind is not just placing a portable blind before your decoy spread but an art now a days. The surrounding should be matching your hideout and height always matters a lot. An easy footwork is another factor involved & it must be stationary n bla bla bla. Ducks are also smart enough to understand our gimmicks especially for those who are settled in our areas. \n\n  Somehow, I am in favor of portable blind and using since years but not over the boat. \n\nSuch a gigantic formula will be another moment of pleasure and discomfort for the world. Anyhow, if you are interested in portable blind making (grounded), we can exchange views. \n\n\n  @ Junaid bhai,\n  Excellent notion brother but you have correctly mentioned that the birds will love to watch such a mammoth wonder over the water from distance &#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230; Hahahahaha\n\n  Your hideout is awesome junaid bro, I am impressed really. This idea will work marvelous in normal course of life otherwise your hide has placed at outstanding location.\n\n  Both the hideouts below mentioned are not portable in any case. These are fix blinds and surely placed by a hunting club etc. One of them is timberland hunting located hideout which is unusual though. Both of the Hideouts are placed around marshes beside other vegetation&#8217;s for an extra cover, otherwise, such monuments are practically useless in open areas.\n\n  This is purely based upon my poor perception and thoughts which everyone has right to differ.', ''),

They come over the lower Himalayas and also flying over Afghanistan from Africa and Siberia. \nThe Imperials are beautiful birds and in the sandy desert like areas of Kakar Khurasan North East of Quetta these appear in great numbers from end of November till February. The famous areas are Qila Saifullah, Toi Maidan and all of Khurasan including Zhob and comming upto Fort Abbas and Cholistan. These are very gregarious and very large flights are seen, they fly in waves changinging course and utter a typical call while flying.\nThey are very punctual and appear at the same time every day to drink on same  water holes in semi desert and desert areas.\nI used to hide in a blind and at exact same time these would appear each flight making two or three passes before going away due to shooting.\nA rather unsporting method is to chase a covey at fullspeed in a jeep when it takes off and then several guns shoot at the flight. I am not in favour of this as this is just blazing away with no particular bird in sights but every gun blazing in the brown which results in a lot of cripples ( some times shooters are also crippled for life due to overturning of Jeeps).\n I have known people to shoot several hundred Imperial Sand Grouse in this manner after shooting hundreds of cartridges. This practice is followed  by high ups in the civil and military who have the resources and leverage over the residents. Some of these shikaries are un able to walk a couple of hundred yards and have never hunted earlier.\nThe other species of sand grouse do not appear in such large numbers and some are spread only in the south of Pakistan and some in select areas of Punjab including the salt range.

(370881, ' [COLOR=#000000][FONT=Times New Roman][COLOR=black][COLOR=black][COLOR=black][FONT=Times New Roman][COLOR=black][FONT=Times New Roman]The  National Database & Registration Authority (Nadra) has started the  revalidation process of arms licences issued by the Ministry of  Interior.\n\nNadra Deputy Chairman Tariq Malik said that the process  will provide transparency and authenticity of arms licence and proper  data will be available with the Ministry of Interior. He said Nadra will  process arms licences on behalf of Ministry of Interior; however the  approval of each arms license application is the sole discretion of the  ministry. Nadra will only process those applications which have the  approval of the ministry.\n\nHe said original CNICs and original  licences (along with photocopies) are pre-requisite for revalidation  along with application form available at Nadra Centres and Ministry of  Interior website. Nadra would verify the CNICs from its database to  check the genuineness of an applicant while the applicant s credentials  would also be checked by different law enforcement agencies. Card  Renewal fee of Rs1100 for PB (Prohibited Bore) licence and Rs600 for NPB  (Non Prohibited Bore) licence will be charged along with any payable in  respect of Government license renewal fee dues. The original booklet  will be retained by Nadra. \n\nAll original booklets will be  forwarded by Nadra to the Ministry of Interior for post verification. He  said that Nadra has designated 158 centres across the country where a  separate counter in each designated centre has been established to  receive the applications regarding the renewal of arms licences. \n\nHe  shared the figures that 13 NADRA Registration Centres (NRCs) in Multan,  30 NRCs in Quetta, 14 NRCs in Lahore, 10 NRCs in Sargodha, 32 NRCs  Peshawar, 24 NRCs in Islamabad, 11 NRCs in Hyderabad, 10 NRCs in Sukkur,  13 NRCs in Karachi and one centre at Sector G-10 Islamabad for Arms  License Project Site will facilitate the applicants for the Arm  Licences.\n\nHe said Govt. has extended deadline from August 31,  2011 to September 30, 2011, this deadline encompasses all Pakistan for  renewal of arms licences specifically issued by the Ministry of  Interior. However, this project does not cater for computerisation of  manual Arms Licenses issued by the provincial governments. The above  arrangements will facilitate all the arms license holders.\n\nHe  said whole exercise of revalidation and issuance of arms licence would  help government to check illegal weapons in the country while record of  legal arms will be updated on district-wise which will be helpful for  law enforcement agencies.[/FONT][/COLOR]\n[/FONT][/COLOR][/COLOR][/COLOR][/FONT][/COLOR]', ''),

(i read some where that shotgun manufacturers r not using a standard bore through out the word and even bore diameter differs slightly manufacturer to manufacturer) so speaking in this scenario what is the bore diameter on baikal shotguns,do u have any idea or u have measured it? if yes then plz share with us and if not then..........\r\n                          .........then solve this problem as always ;)\r\nwaiting for your reply\r\nregards[/QUOTE]\r\n\r\nBro, you are very right. shotgun bores are not standard and it is a common observation that European shotgun bores run somewhere around 0.720-0.725 inch whereas US bores go all the way up to 0.740 inch. Russian bores are 0.724 inch or 18.4mm in diameter. this measurement is also marked on each barrel.\r\n\r\nyou are also right that ideally, a shotgun''s choke tube should be individually matched to that shotgun''s barrel bore diameter. thats why [URL="http://www.teagueprecisionchokesltd.co.uk/prices.html"][B]Extreme High-End Custom Choke Tube Manufacturers[/B][/URL] always ask you to ship your shotgun''s barrel for examination before selling anything.\r\n\r\nThe aftermarket choke tube suppliers are using the same method of machining a choke tube given a range of bore diameter (say 18.4mm in case of Baikal) against a standardized degree of choke. this setup though not as precise, pretty much gets the job done quit efficiently while offering good results as well pattern wise.\r\n\r\nThey improve upon the pattern not through better individually set constriction but through better finish of the choke tubes over factory supplied tubes and the prices of aftermarket choke tubes manufacturers are dictated by quality, material used and finish applied by each manufacturer.\r\n\r\nthe factory supplied choke tubes are usually plagued with quality issues cause a factory cannot divert more of its resources in creating accessories for their product. it is more profitable to them if they use every available resource in actually manufacturing their products. it is a general observation that accessories are mostly outsourced to smaller factories/units. outsourced to the one that quotes the lowest price per unit. this is when/where the quality diminishes.\r\n\r\nRegards.', ''),

The pro''s and con''s of both types have been discussed here before and at length, if you''d kindly trouble yourself for more details by scrolling through our Shotguns forum.\n\nIn a nutshell, however, let me say, the Pump action has always been more "trusted" than the semi-auto, for HD/SD purposes.\n\nYet with the advent of reasonable quality semi-auto''s and within reasonable price ranges, the semi-auto, of the reviewed makes and models here, is no bad choice at all, hence any make of the US/Italy, and in Turkish the Hatsan Escort Slug-Auto, Germanica, etc.\n\nDenovo87 bro has reviewed the Hatsan Escort semi-auto in full details, you can check his review thread. The Germanica has been reviewed by Naveed PK bro and is due to be reviewed by myself over the next couple of days. In pump action, plenty of guns have been reviewed here also.\n\nIt''s ultimately a personal choice, the pump-action has always been credited more for reliability, but we''ve not heard anything bad about semi-auto''s also, with respect to reliable operation. The plus point with the semi-auto is course better target acquisition/re-acquisition after each subsequent fire and and aiming/ sighting control during operation.\n\nRest, find for yourself.\n\n\nRegards.', ''),

(371001, 'Gun Tests Magazine - June 2000 Issue [B][U]\r\nTaurus PT92AFS[/U][/B]\r\nOur recommendation: Buy it. Copying the Beretta design is a no-brainer—the resulting gun works well. Throw in the Taurus lifetime guarantee plus the option of cocked-and-locked carry, and this $525 pistol is arguably the best value in self-defense 9mm handguns. \r\n\r\nThe AFS is the top of the line for Taurus’s Beretta 92–based pistols. It is two-tone stainless steel, brushed on the top end and bright on the frame. Ours did not arrive with the Brazilian wood stocks, but it did have a rear sight featuring two white dots and adjustment for windage and elevation. The basic pistol in this series, the PT92B, is a blue-steel pistol with fixed sights.\r\n\r\nIn terms of feel, the Taurus front strap is flatter than the Berettas, lacking the flare at the bottom. Also, the grip doesn’t have a channel from the beavertail undercut to the mag release. We are accustomed to rolling a pistol in the hand to connect with the mag release, but the front edge of the grip tends to block such a maneuver. Furthermore, the distance between the apex of the beavertail and the center of the mag release button is 1.9 inches, 0.3 inches more to reach than on its Italian first cousin once removed. While the lines cut into the grip frame fore and aft are mild, they proved to be effective in anchoring the gun in our hands. Weight distribution seems to be toward the shooter, and there is just enough heft to kill recoil, but not overload the hand. The primary difference from the Beretta pistols is the Taurus’s ambidextrous slide safety, which locks the slide and prevents the trigger from operating in both the single and double action mode. The Taurus’s safety lever was available to the strong-hand thumb without a change of grip, even for those with medium-sized hands. We feel this is key to combat readiness. \r\nThe Taurus PT92 was the overall accuracy winner. \r\nFrom the rest, all three pistols handled about the same, are more than accurate for defensive applications, and were 100 percent reliable. This sounds perfect, doesn’t it? But our additional tests for practical accuracy go further in determining what we feel is the true combat readiness of a pistol. In terms of a Bullseye match or static target session. it can be said that the target is known, the target is located and waiting. All that is needed is to mount the gun with the trigger mode of least resistance, hold steady and fire. \r\nIn defensive-gun tests like this one, we try a more Practical approach, requiring our testers to shoot the guns more reflexively under draw-and-fire conditions. For this test, we chose Speer’s 147-grain Gold Dot hollow-point (GDHP) ammo. Our choice of holster was the three-slot pancake design by Old World from Michaels of Oregon. The three slots allow for strong side as well as weak side (cross-draw) carry. A thumb-break snap is included, making it an appropriate universal Beretta/Beretta-clone holster. Drawing and firing from any position made it painfully obvious there was no way either Beretta could defeat the Taurus. Why? Because the Taurus PT92 series pistols may be holstered safely with the hammer back, requiring only a short, single-action trigger press. The Berettas, on the other hand, offer a long double-action pull on the first shot or the challenge of thumbing back the hammer during the draw. While all three guns may be carried with a loaded chamber and hammer down by activating the decocker, only the Taurus PT92 offers a third carry option of hammer back, safety on. \r\nThe Old World holster accommodates this mode with a strap that crosses under the hammer. Would we consider carrying either Beretta with hammer back and rely upon the strap to guard the exposed firing pin. No. Did we consider holstering the Berettas with hammer back to even the odds in the timed draw and fire test? Thought of it, yes, acted on it, no. The whole reasoning behind the decocker and the double action first shot found on so many semi-autos today is to avoid undue liability for an errant or inaccurate first shot. Unless a pistol incorporates a 1911 design, like the Heckler & Koch USP series, or like the PT92 have a thumb-operated safety, we do not feel safe relying upon a device separate from the gun to secure a cocked hammer. However, all three guns fit snugly enough into the Old World holster to preclude the use of the retention strap when additional protection from an accidental hammer fall is not necessary. \r\nOnce each of the pistols was in single-action mode, all three guns shot with about the same feel. The Taurus trigger was noticeably lighter, and the shooter was more aware of the full valance of the trigger. Our Brownells Chatillion gauge registered each Beretta trigger at 6.5 pounds single action, but the take-up and engagement of the 92FS trigger felt more willing than the press offered by the Elite, in our estimation. In a game of draw and fire, shooting five shots at 10 yards over three strings, the best 15-shot group (measuring 4 inches) was delivered by the Beretta Elite, and it only put one shot outside the black. The Beretta 92 showed four shots outside the black for a group of 4.7 inches. The Taurus only showed one shot outside the black, but the group was the largest at 5.5 inches. But there is more. Both the Berettas printed low left. This is a result of a trigger-control problem in which too much finger is left on the trigger after transitioning from double to single action. \r\nWhile the Taurus PT92’s group was largest, it had the bulk of its hits not only in the black but in the X ring. Moreover, each string fired from the Berettas was 0.75 to 1 second slower than any of the strings shot with the Taurus. The loss of time was evident on the draw while carefully lining up the sights during the double action pull and between the first and second shots that transition from DA to SA.\r\n\r\n[B][U]Beretta 92FS[/U][/B]\r\nOur recommendation: Conditional Buy. It’s hard to fault the original, and obviously it carries the tacit recommendation of the armed forces. But in our view, the $691 gun is limited by hammer-down carry. \r\n\r\nChoosing a gun for the way it feels in the hand is important. Based on this criterion alone, perhaps everyone should own a Beretta 92 series pistol. They just feel great. Also, it is hard to argue with its classic styling, which on our FS was heightened by a low-key two-tone stainless-steel treatment wherein the slide is darker than the frame. The slide stop and breakdown levers match the slide, which is further accented with a bold red dot that is hidden when the ambidextrous decocker/safety lever is placed in the safety-on position. This safety disconnects the trigger when the pistol is in the hammer-down position. Activating this lever with the hammer back drops the hammer safely onto a loaded chamber. This gun is unsafe if it is carried with the hammer back in single action, in our opinion. \r\nFrom the driver’s seat we saw a generous rear sight notch that offers plenty of search room for the front sight. The rear sight is windage adjustable only, but it is the front sight that disappoints. The front is the same color as the slide and reflects too much light. On the 0.0112-inch-wide front blade, the engraved and red-painted dot is distracting, but we found neither the front red dot nor the two red dots in the rear sight particularly easy or fast to pick up. We feel a dark, striated front sight with perhaps a white dot that didn’t overtake the edges of the front sight would be a better choice. \r\n\r\nIn terms of maintenance, the 92 series is easy to break down It’s really no wonder this pistol was chosen for battlefield duty. No tools are needed to break it down. Once apart, there are no small pieces that can be easily lost. Its design offers reliability without having to machine-in loose tolerances that can sabotage accuracy. \r\nBut as a civilian weapon, where confrontation is bound to be a surprise more often than on the battlefield, we feel omitting the option of cocked-and-locked carry is a minus. \r\nBeretta Elite\r\nOur recommendation: Conditional Buy. For some extra money ($40), we think some the Elite’s upgrades make owning this pistol more enjoyable than its stablemate. \r\n\r\nAs a combat upgrade, Beretta offers the $732 Elite with some features that are positive, but not entirely worked through. For one, the fully relieved hammer is not only stylish but affords less mass, to speed up lock time. The Elite also comes with full base pads that complete the profile of the grip. This is helpful in protecting the mags when they are dropped repeatedly during reloading drills or combat competition, but are still basically a cosmetic upgrade. The Brigadier slide is tastefully contoured and really makes the gun look special. But, it is no lighter than the standard 92 slide, a modification that can speed cycling, nor heavier for greater durability. The barrel is marginally shorter (about 0.25 inch) making it somewhat more concealable and perhaps faster to point. The upgraded sights did pay off, in our opinion, during the rapid-fire test. \r\nWe were disappointed to note, however, that the Elite’s slide-to-frame fit is no different than on the standard model, and it was actually the least accurate of the three test guns from a sandbag rest. Also, the Elite trigger is still as heavy as the basic factory issue. These are two areas that are crucial to an “upgrade” truly performing better than a stock gun. \r\nGun Tests Recommends\r\nTaurus PT92AFS, $525. Buy it. This pistol should be capable of doing anything the higher-priced Berettas can do. Additionally, the availability of cocked-and-locked carry makes it more appealing. \r\nBeretta 92FS, $691. Conditional buy, if you can live without cocked-and-locked carry. But for all its positive traits, this stainless gun needs a better sighting system. Beretta Elite, $732. Conditional buy. The U.S. Army Marksmanship Unit has spent a lot of money and talent to make the M9 Beretta 9mm fit for the highest levels of competition. Hints of those technical advancements have filtered down to the Elite model, and if we were choosing between it and the FS, we’d spend the dollars for its features.', ''),

(371058, 'Attn: All Members Please Read (August/Sept 2011) Salams, \n\nLately we''ve had quite a few friends join us onboard PakGuns. Also MashAllah our forum has grown and is growing quite a bit with about a 1000 new posts every 3 days. \n\nOur mods are doing such a great job that I don''t have to step in at all but I have noticed one issue that I must address.\n\nIt is a matter of personal pride to me that PakGuns is said to be one of the most polite & friendly gun forums online. Our brotherly culture is so important to us that we''ve mentioned it repeatedly in our rules and at the sign up page. \n\nSome new friends and a few older ones at times forget this. I have instructed the mods to be extremely strict on rude behavior at our forum.\n\nTo avoid any inconvenience Please [U][B]DO NOT DO THE FOLLOWING[/B][/U]: \n\n1). [B]Being rude to fellow members[/B], [B][U]specially the mods[/U][/B] as they take time out from their busy lives to help run this forum. Being rude to them will not be tolerated and I will personally ban anyone who does not understand this.\n\n2). [B]Not respecting others opinions[/B]. Everyone has a right to offer their opinion regardless of how smart / foolish it is. Making fun of them is foolish as everyone''s knowledge is limited and we all learn as we go along.\n\n3). [B]Constant complaining[/B]. We have some "Shikati Tatu''s" at our forum who apparently have nothing better to do with their lives than sending emails to mods/admin complaining about other members all day. Please grow up, this is not kinder garden, it is a forum for mature individuals. If you can''t get along with everyone then perhaps this is not the the place for you.\n\n4). [B]Ganging up on Members[/B]. We have noticed that some friends try to make a group and gang up on otjers. The standard way is one member makes a post and regardless of how good/bad it is and his chum goes "Wah Wah Sir, Kaya Baat hai" or "+10" or "Tusi paida hokay saday teh isaan kitay" etc. These guys then gang up and ridicule anyone that offers a different opinion. \n\nIt''s amusing as we have seen it all before in the past. People like these are eventually kicked out of our forum. \n\nAlthough these things are not wide spread and just a few individuals, I am posting this thread to nip this in the bud. InshAllah, PakGuns will always be an open and friendly forum for everyone and all have the right to ask any relevant question or offer a suggestion regardless of how basic/complicated it is.\n\nRegards,', ''),

(371108, 'Arizona Man Shoots his Privates; Proves We Should All Use Holsters There&#8217;s a story that has been circulating around the Web for weeks now with a rather gruesome headline: Arizona Man Shoots Himself in Privates. It&#8217;s the last thing any firearm owner wants to read about.\n\nJoshua Seto, 27, tried securing his fiance&#8217;s pink handgun in the front waistband of his pants while exiting a local convenience store and the gun fired, striking Seto&#8217;s manhood and continuing through his left thigh. It&#8217;s not a pretty picture.\n\nI know it goes without saying that this readership uses holsters. I would hate to think someone out there gets their tactics from Hollywood or a music video, but I have seen this situation in the article above and keep hearing about this happening. When I was a Police officer in Prince Georges County, Md., I received a call for a gunshot victim that just checked into the local hospital. Upon my arrival, I learned the alleged victim was a guy that actually shot himself while putting a Glock 19 in his waistband.\n\nEven with a holster, if you choose to carry a firearm in what is known as the appendix position, the risk of creating this injury is still present&#8212;especially if you have to draw or holster while sitting. There are instructors and firearms enthusiasts out there that swear by this position, due to its level of concealment and speed of draw. I can respect that, but I do not advocate the position. In most personal defense situations, we have to give up something in order to get something. I do not like the safety trade off for speed and concealment. I may just have mental baggage based on my experiences with these type of injuries, but I feel that under extreme stress we run too high a risk of bobbling something.\n\nAfter it is all said and done, it comes down to personal choice and how you train. I have no doubt the carry position is great with training, but most just do not train enough. I, for one, don&#8217;t want to see anyone shoot themselves in the groin or femoral artery.

(371182, ' Dear Sikander sahib. \nI assume you want to release and shoot phesants.\nShooting pen raised birds are no comparison to the ones in the wild. \nAnyway, birds reared in controlled situations tend to be slow, lazy and less shy of predators(inclusive of humans),thus being less spooky and offer lesser (comparative) resistance to shoot.\nYou would be better off to release them in 4 lots of 50 birds each over 20 days time  in the same area (prior to the shoot/shoots), provided you can hold them there for longer periods.\nRelease should be made in areas with ample undergrowth for them to sit tight,( when threatened ) and adequate moisture to suit their needs.\nPredators like foxes,jackals.magpies,hawks etc.also be controlled in order to make them feel safe.\nMake sure you scatter enough food for them to feed on, a day before each release is made. This helps them to quickly adapt sudden change in environment and conditions.\nA factor in this specific case is the establishment of domain, which can only be done after at least one breeding session in wild, which in this case seems difficult. \nBeware, if a domain is finally established by phesants they might wipe-out other resident population of partridges or vice-versa.This is what the Great Late Rohail uncle used to say.\nAnyway good luck.Brother', ''),

Go through Sahih Bukhari and you can know what I''m talking about. 2. I am under 18 but would  never ever call it the jahalat period. 3. I have not said anything to baby bores and am letting them grow but what i am saying that i wannt to kill one and try to see what my gun is capable of. 4. Plz dont compare airguns of your time with those available now "zameen aasman ka farak hai". Max. fps back then would be 500fps and now they range up till 1750fps (1750 fps is much more than the fps of a shaheen cartridge). What I would like to add is that if killing baby bores with airguns is no fun, killing boars with shotguns is not fun too and all of us shoot bores on jeeps so it''s no fun at all.\nAs far as killing babies is concerned, most of us shoot at a flock/herd of wild boars. Often they just kill one or sometimes 2 and injure another one or two adults and 2-3 babies, DID YOU KNOW THIS ?\n5. I don''t have a shotgun/rifle myself at this age so i cannot kill bores with any of these, as you have mentioned. But we do have 2 expired moi''s and once they are restored, I can have full time shotgun hunting.\n6. Newer airguns have much more purposes than just small-game hunting and i bet you don''t know big bore airguns. In america, people have hunted small deer and other animals such as boars too with airguns. \n7. My passion is not airguns, but rifle and shotguns but i have to stick to airguns for the time being due to being under age..\nHOWEVER, i think when you were young, you had just hunted with airgun and jumped to shotguns recently, BUT I have used and hunted extensively with all kinds of airguns. I have hunted with diana 22 and diana 35, the one you had. In lastest and powerful ones, I have had the pleasure to extensively use my new 350 magnum, and the one of it''s kind Wheirauch HW 80, will soon use the HW100...\n8. I at this age have hunted and used shotguns and rifles owned by my uncle which i think you started recently.\nI have, other than some 10 different airguns, used ppsh 41 (.30 cal rifle), .22 remington, and hunted with/used Turkish (Tomahawk), German and english (holland and holland) shotguns. I have experience of hunting with/using both airguns and shotguns and I know what evrything is like and i am not just a airgun hunter. If I want to, I can go to my uncle anytime in my vacations ( when he goes to his village near pattoki) and can use any of his 25 firearms so don''t think of me as in ''jahalat age'', i never had it and never will.\n\nSorry for making this lengthy and no hard feelings.', ''),

(371443, ' Shotgun Slugs\r\n\r\nBy Chuck Hawks\r\n\r\n\r\nThe first shotgun "slugs" were probably round, lead "pumpkin balls." These were common projectiles for muskets and shotguns--any sort of smooth bore long arm--for a long time. Unfortunately, the accuracy of a lead ball fired from a smooth bore barrel is pretty sad. Hitting the target is problematical and precise bullet placement is nearly impossible except at very close range. Also, a lead ball has a very poor sectional density (SD), and consequently poor penetration. There had to be a better way.\r\n\r\nThe answer, of course, was the rifled barrel. Imparting spin to a projectile to stabilize its flight was a quantum improvement in accuracy. Rifled barrels also made possible the conical bullet, and later the familiar spitzer (pointed) bullets used by most hunters today.\r\n\r\nBut demand remained for some sort of solid projectile that could be fired from a smoothbore gun and used on medium game like deer. Some one-gun families did not own, and could not afford to buy, a rifle. What was needed was an improvement on the lead ball, both in terms of accuracy and penetration.\r\n\r\nFoster type rifled slugs\r\n\r\nThe eventual solution to this problem was the Foster "rifled" slug. This is a short, blunt lead bullet that is solid in front and hollow in the rear, analogous to a badminton bird. And, like a shuttlecock, it is its weight forward balance that allows the Foster slug to fly through the air to its target with reasonable accuracy. Compared to lead balls, this was a big improvement in both accuracy and SD.\r\n\r\nHeavy external "rifling" was cast into these Foster type slugs, allegedly to allow the air they flew through to impart a slow spin that would help stabilize the slug. Like most something for nothing schemes, the rifling proved ineffective, but it did provide some space for some compression if the slug had to squeeze through a tight choke. The name "rifled slug" stuck and is still in widespread use today.\r\n\r\nRifled slugs are offered by most of the major ammunition makers in a variety of shotgun gauges, including 12, 16, 20, and .410 bore. They used to be made under bore diameter to allow safe passage through any degree of choke, from full to cylinder. Cylinder bore guns are usually recommended for shooting slugs, but in some cases a full or modified choke barrel will give better accuracy with the undersize slugs.\r\n\r\nThis may not always hold true these days, however, as Remington advertises that their "Slugger" rifled slugs are made oversize for better sealing against the barrel wall and superior accuracy. Compared to rifle bullets, whose diameter is held to very strict tolerances, Foster type slugs are made to rather haphazard dimensions that vary from one manufacturer to another.\r\n\r\nThe use of slugs is best confined to single barrel shotguns, either single shot or repeaters. Double guns tend to crossfire with slugs due to the regulation of the barrels.\r\n\r\nA smoothbore "slug gun" with rifle sights will usually shoot groups in the 3" (6 MOA) range at 50 yards/meters, making them satisfactory deer hunting weapons at short range. An occasional example will do better, and some do worse. Their effective deer hunting range is limted by their accuracy, but the slug itself is dangerous to other hunters at far greater distances, an important point to keep in mind.\r\n\r\nCompared to practically any big game rifle bullet, rifled slugs are not very accurate. They are a short range (100 yard or less) proposition at best. The ballistic coefficient (BC) and sectional density of rifled slugs is pretty pitiful. The only place they score high numbers is in recoil, where low numbers are desired. Shooting groups from a bench rest with a slug gun is not fun, as the recoil is considerable. If possible, always use a rifle in preference to a slug gun for any kind of big game hunting.\r\n\r\nSome jurisdictions in the U.S. forbid the use of rifles and mandate the use of shotgun slugs for deer hunting, allegedly for "safety" in crowded hunting areas. I am sure that this is what keeps rifled slugs viable as a sporting proposition. (They are also used in police "riot" guns, of course.)\r\n\r\nThis is actually kind of funny in an ironic way, as the one thing slugs do really well is penetrate brush. Rifled slugs are probably the most dangerous type of ammunition to use in a wooded area crowded with hunters and other humans, as they plow through visually impenetrable brush, leaves, and small tree limbs with aplomb. A high velocity rifle with a frangible bullet would be far safer in such an environment. I have, for instance, seen .22 varmint bullets fired at very high velocity turn into a puff of blue smoke on a blade of grass!\r\n\r\nConventional Foster type rifled slugs generally weigh 1 ounce in 12 gauge, 4/5 ounce in 16 gauge, 5/8 ounce in 20 gauge, and 1/5 ounce (or 87 grains) in .410 gauge. The 12 gauge slug has an advertised muzzle velocity (MV) of 1560 fps from a 2 3/4" high-brass shell, 1680 fps from a 2 3/4" Magnum shell, or 1760 fps from a 3" Magnum shell. These are Remington figures from their 2004 catalog. The MV''s of the other gauges are similar.\r\n\r\nThe catalog energy figures for the common high-brass ("maximum") 12 gauge slug load are an impressive 2361 ft. lbs. at the muzzle, but only 926 ft. lbs. at 100 yards. This is due to the very poor BC of the slug. Sighted to hit dead on at 50 yards, that slug is 4.8" low at 100 yards. The more powerful 12 gauge slugs are only marginally better, and kick noticeably harder. No matter what, rifled slugs remain a short range proposition.\r\n\r\nStick with 12 gauge Foster type slugs for deer hunting as the smaller gauges pack much less punch. The 20 gauge slug develops only 648 ft. lbs. of energy at 100 yards, which given its low SD is not encouraging. I have done some testing with .410 rifled slugs and they are definitely not adequate deer loads. The less said about these small bore rifled slugs the better.\r\n\r\nBrenneke, Buckhammer, and Trophy Slug\r\n\r\nThese resemble Foster type slugs with one important difference: the wad remains attached to the base of the slug. This provides a better BC and stability in flight, a better shuttlecock, if you will. The assembly is heavier than a plain rifled slug due to the weight of the attached wad. The difference in retained energy at 100 yards is considerable.\r\n\r\nThe original design of this type, as far as I know, is the German Brenneke slug, offered by Rottweil. Brenneke rifled slugs still use felt and fiber wads, and are suitable for use in smooth or rifled shotgun barrels. Rottweil offers several slug loads in 12, 20, and .410. Their 2 3/4" 12 gauge slug weighs 1 1/4 ounce, and their 3" Magnum 20 gauge slug weighs a full 1 ounce.\r\n\r\nA MV of 1476 fps and ME of 2538 are claimed for the 12 gauge 2 3/4" Magnum load. More important is the 100 yard retained energy figure of 1170 ft. lbs.\r\n\r\nFiocchi of Italy offers the Aeroslug Trophy Slug, which appears to be a modernized and simplified version of the Brenneke design. It, too, is recommended for both smooth and rifled barrels. The Fiocchi Trophy slug weighs 1 ounce in 2 3/4" 12 gauge shells, and 7/8 ounce in 2 3/4" 20 gauge shells. Ballistics are similar to the Brenneke loads with somewhat less energy due to the lighter slugs.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the most creative design of this general sort, with which I am familiar, is the Remington Buckhammer. It is also the most recent innovation. The Buckhammer lead slug itself is a short truncated cone, rather like a lead "Keith" style revolver bullet. Attached to the base of this is a long, plastic "stabilizer" wad. Remington says that the Buckhammer was designed for use in fully rifled barrels, or with rifled choke tubes. The diameter of the lead slug is supposed to be .73", so I do not see why it could not be used in cylinder bore (smooth) shotgun barrels, but I have not tried it. Experiment at your own risk!\r\n\r\n12 gauge Buckhammer slugs weigh 1 1/4 ounces in 2 3/4" cases or 1 3/8 ounces in 3" cases. 20 gauge Buckhammer slugs come only in 2 3/4" cases and weigh 1 ounce.\r\n\r\nThese Remington Buckhammer loads claim the most impressive ballistics of the bunch. The 12 gauge 2 3/4" load has a MV of 1550 fps and ME of 2935 ft. lbs. The 100 yard figures are 1145 fps and 1600 ft. lbs. Zeroed at 50 yards, the 1 1/4 ounce slug should hit 3.6" low at 100 yards, so it is still a short range load. Naturally, they kick like the very devil in a shotgun of average weight.\r\n\r\nThe 20 gauge Buckhammer load has a MV of 1500 fps and ME of 2236 ft. lbs. The 100 yard figures are 995 fps and 1074 ft. lbs. Zeroed at 50 yards, the 1 ounce slug should hit 4.6" low at 100 yards.\r\n\r\nWhile still inferior to the 12 gauge loads, the Buckhammer and Brenneke slug loads (which claim similar ballistics) at least get the 20 gauge slug gun up off of its knees. If I had to shoot a smoothbore 20 gauge slug gun, these are the loads I would use.\r\n\r\nAll three manufacturers of these "super" rifled slugs claim exceptional accuracy in fully rifled barrels. Remington, for example, claims 3" to 3 1/2" 5-shot groups at 100 yards (3.5 MOA or better) with their Buckhammer slugs. Such accuracy would be considered unacceptable from a rifle, of course, but it will take deer at 100 yards.\r\n\r\nSabot slugs\r\n\r\nThese days most of the major shotshell manufacturers also offer sabot slug loads for 12 and 20 gauge shotguns. These are for use only in fully rifled barrels. How a long arm with a fully rifled barrel can be termed a "shotgun," I fail to understand, but that is beside the point. These loads are essentially equivalent to the kind of loads used in modern, high performance muzzleloading rifles.\r\n\r\nSince the Remington catalog is still open in front of me, I will use their sabot slugs as representative of the type. Bear in mind that, as with sabot bullets for muzzleloaders, they''re plenty of variations available.\r\n\r\nRemington offers 12 and 20 gauge Premier sabot loads with both JHP bonded lead core bullets and solid copper hollow point bullets. The former are called "Premier Core-Lokt Ultra," and latter are "Premier Copper Solid."\r\n\r\nThe 12 gauge Core-Lokt Ultra sabot bullet is a .50 caliber, 385 grain HP semi-spitzer. The catalog MV is 1900 fps and the 100 yard velocity is 1648 fps. The ME is given as 3086 ft. lbs. and the remaining energy at 100 yards is 2325 ft. lbs. The trajectory of that load looks like this: +1.8" at 50 yards, +2.4" at 100 yards, and +/- 0" at 150 yards.\r\n\r\nThe 20 gauge sabot bullet weighs 260 grains. It also has a MV of 1900 fps, and its velocity at 100 yards is given as 1615 fps. The ME is 2084 ft. lbs., and the remaining energy at 100 yards is 1506 ft. lbs. The trajectory of that load looks like this: +2.0" at 50 yards, +2.7" at 100 yards, and +/- 0" at 150 yards.\r\n\r\nAs I wrote at the outset, this are similar to the ballistics obtainable with high performance, .50 caliber, inline muzzleloading rifles. Accuracy is apparently not quite as good as the best muzzleloaders, as Remington claims consistent 2 1/2" 5-shot groups at 100 yards. But that is impressive accuracy from any kind of shotgun--even if it is really a rifle!\r\n\r\nClearly, the use of these sabot bullet loads completely negates the rationale behind the "shotgun only" deer hunts. Not only are these shotguns with rifled barrels technically rifles, they shoot like rifles. In fact, they equal traditional big game rifle cartridges such as the .45-70 and .38-55.\r\n\r\nFor example, a .45-70 rifle shooting a 400 grain bullet (BC .214) at a MV of 1900 fps has a trajectory that looks like this: +2.1" at 50 yards, +2.8" at 100 yards, +/- 0" at 150 yards, and -7.2" at 200 yards (Speer figures). That is a very similar trajectory to the Remington Core-Lokt Ultra loads described above.\r\n\r\nThe Hornady .45 caliber, 300 grain XTP-Mag sabot bullet used in their 12 gauge factory load has a BC of .200, which I suspect is not much different than the BC of the Remington sabot bullet. Holding a scope''s horizontal crosswire level with a buck''s back should put the bullet into the heart/lung area at 200 yards. Some shotgun!\r\n\r\nSlug loads for home defense\r\n\r\nQuestions about slugs for home defense arise fairly frequently in my mail so, briefly, here is my take on the subject. Shotgun slugs are dangerously over penetrative for most home defense scenarios. (You have no right to endanger your neighbors.) I suggest that, inside of a domicile, #4 buckshot is usually a more appropriate defensive shotgun load.\r\n\r\nIf you are forced to defend a farm, ranch house, or cabin from external attack, a rifle will probably be superior to a shotgun stuffed with slugs. So I do not see much reason to choose shotgun slug loads for personal defense, except in special circumstances.\r\n\r\nPolice use of rifled slug loads in the riot guns carried in cruisers is one example of a special circumstance. Many police agencies are reluctant to provide both rifles and shotguns for their patrol cars, so they issue rifled slug loads for use in shotguns. This allows the squad car riot gun to serve as a makeshift rifle if required. Once again, the shotgun becomes a "poor man''s rifle."\r\n\r\nSlug loads may also be appropriate in some marine applications. In addition to birdshot and buckshot loads, I always kept a pack of rifled slugs handy for my "boat gun," a Mossberg 500 Mariner.\r\n\r\nConclusion\r\n\r\nI have primarily concentrated on slug loads for hunting, for which purpose I feel that they are most appropriate. Even so, they are a stop gap alternative to a rifle, primarily useful where rifles are banned for political reasons. Shotgun slug loads intended to be fired from smooth bore barrels manage to combine the worst properties of any hunting projectile: marginal accuracy, low velocity, low sectional density, low ballistic coefficient, rainbow trajectory, and heavy recoil. Nearly the worst of all possible worlds! If you can legally hunt with a rifle, you owe it to both yourself and your quarry to do so. If not, but the law allows the use of fully rifled "shotgun" barrels and saboted projectiles, that is what you should use.', ''),

(371447, ' Researching HK P7\r\n\r\nPRO \r\n\r\n1. Squeeze cocking. IMHO the safest gun for daily carry. The gun goes from perfectly safe to perfectly deadly in a split second. If you drop it you may have a heart attack because it might get scratched but you can rest assured it won''t go off. This gun is incredibly fast. \r\n\r\n2. Trigger pull. Thanks to the squeeze cocking system the gun is safely equipped with an excellent single action trigger pull. I''ve had die-hard partisans of every type of gun praise my P7''s trigger. \r\n\r\n3. Compact. Although it has full-size controls (no pinky hang), the gun is sized like a compact approaching a subcompact. It is much thinner than almost any handgun.(1.1-1.2 inches). \r\n\r\n4. Full-size barrel. Despite this gun''s compact size it has a full 4-inch barrel. \r\n\r\n5. Fixed-barrel. This gun lacks the tilting barrel assembly of most other full-sized guns. This lends the gun exceptional accuracy. In combination with the aforementioned trigger, this barrel makes the P7 ultra-accurate. \r\n\r\n6. Low recoil. This is debatable. I have always felt that this has the least recoil of any 9mm. Some disagree, most don''t. This is likely result of the guns low bore/axis and gas system (although some say the gas system should have no effect). \r\n\r\n7. Tough! This gun is CNC milled from a solid steel forging. The gun is so solid it could be used as a nasty set of brass knuckles in a pinch. Without picking one up it is hard to imagine how solid this little gun feels. When I had mine hardchromed the smith complained endlessly about how hard the P7 was to machine. \r\n\r\n8. Excellent sight radius. Although the gun is short, HK maximized the sight radius by pushing the sights as far apart as practically possible. \r\n\r\n9. Oddball manual of arms confuses bad guys and know it all buddies. There are many accounts of cops loosing their P7''s to bad guys who were, in turn, unable to figure out the squeeze cocker. On the lighter side, a know it all at a local gunshop had just explained to all of his bad experiences with the P7 when I handed it to him only to watch him fumble around unable to cock it! Hilarious. \r\n\r\n10. Chamber fluting allows the gun to function even if the extractor is broken. This feature really makes you think when you are trying to determine which gun you want to bet you life on (no offense, but this a much more serious advantage than being able to freeze the gun in a bucket of ice or whatever). \r\n\r\n11. Easily childproofed. The P7''s striker can be removed without tools (and without any other disassembly of the gun). The striker can be re-inserted into the gun in roughly 1 second. This could be a major consideration to those of us with small children and stupid friends. \r\n\r\n12. Ambidextrous. With the exception of the slide catch and take down buttons, every model of the P7 is completely ambidextrous. \r\n\r\n13. Ultra-fast magazine release. This has to be experienced to be understood. Rambo types complained about the PSPâ&#8364;&#8482;s lack of rapid magazine release. HK, Germans that they are, decided to give them what they wantedâ&#8364;&#8221;a magazine that ejects so fast and powerfully that they could be used as back-up projectiles in an emergency.\r\n\r\n14. Ultra fast slide release. Simply squeeze the handle and the slide will be released.\r\n\r\n15. 110 degree grip angle gives the gun natural pointability. 110 degree grip angle makes the gun point just like you finger.\r\n\r\n16. Low profile slide. The P7â&#8364;&#8482;s low profile slide means that there is very little recoiling mass relative to the frame. This, along with the above mentioned 110-degree grip angle makes reacquiring targets a breeze with the P7. \r\n\r\n\r\nCon \r\n\r\n1. The gun gets uncomfortably hot after 60 (or so) rapid shots. More of a training problem than a "real world" consideration. \r\n\r\n2. Finish lacks durability. Blued finish wears quickly and is very little protection against corrosion. \r\n\r\n3. Very expensive. At over $1000, this gun is out of the range of many buyers. \r\n\r\n4. The gun''s design is such that it gets dirty quickly when shot. \r\n\r\n5. The gun malfunctions when not maintained properly. While this is true of all guns, the P7 seems to be more sensitive than most modern autos. The solution is to keep the gas cylinder clean. \r\n\r\n6. The P7''s cocking lever emits a click when released. This is more of an issue with SEAL wannabes than real people. The theory is that the noise will alert the bad guys to your presence. Easily overcome with technique anyway (press in cocking latch at top of cocking lever while releasing your grip). With this technique the gun is almost silent and certainly quieter than any SIG or USP with decocking lever. \r\n\r\n7. Low capacity. Except in now unavailable M13 (LEO only) and M10 (discontinued for ugliness), capacity is limited to 9 rounds (with one in chamber). \r\n\r\n8. Grip screws come loose too easily. Use lock-tite. \r\n\r\n9. Can''t use lead bullets (see cleanliness issues above). \r\n\r\n10. Slide lock button too small for some. \r\n\r\n11. Magazine release on M8/M13 too sensitive to careless holstering (accidental magazine ejection). PSP model doesn''t suffer from this (Euro-magazine catch). \r\n\r\n12. During an emergency a user might accidentally squeeze the trigger while squeezing the cocking lever. I personally think this isn''t a problem. The P7 was designed with a fair amount of take-up in the trigger so the gun is tolerant of some sloppiness. The moral of the story is to keep you finger off the trigger until you are ready to kill something. It should also be noted that your trigger finger is relatively independent of your other fingers. I can''t remember the physiological term, but the other three fingers usually act in unison while the index finger is only partially connected. Still, in an emergency anything is possible--practice proper form with all firearms! \r\n\r\n13. For some, seriously ham-fisted users, the gun might be accidentally disassembled if the take down button is inadvertently pressed while the slide is being racked. This is extremely unlikely, however, it can be done with practice. \r\n\r\n14. Disassembly not for mere mortals. A "detail strip" \r\ncan involve a lot of head/heart ache. The gun has a fair number of parts but the real problem is the gun''s unorthodox design [Expert reassembly tip, use grease to hold in the mag release spring--otherwise you will go mad trying to hold everything together while attempting to drive in the assembly pin]. An armorer at HK told me that they regularly have to reassemble guns for owners who let curiosity get the better of them. Fortunately, there is really no reason to strip it down beyond a "field strip." Just spray in some gun oil and wipe. \r\n\r\n15. Possible difficulty depressing cocking lever with weak or injured hands. My father has weakness in his right hand related to a stroke he had a few years ago. For a while he was unable to cock my M8. On the other hand, once the lever is squeezed it only takes about a pound and a half to keep it cocked. \r\n\r\nGHB\r\n_________________________\r\nFor those who give a crap, I used to be P7Guru.\r\n\r\n"If, after I depart this vale, you ever remember me and have thought to please my ghost, forgive some sinner, and wink your eye at some homely girl."\r\n\r\nMencken \r\n[url]http://www.parkcitiestactical.com/ubbthreads/ubbthreads.php?ubb=showflat&Number=127440[/url]\r\n\r\nAnd a video: [video=google;6239098748148707308]http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=6239098748148707308&ei=JyA4SqbHFoT0lQfRuqDKAQ&q=hk&hl=en&client=firefox-a#[/video]', ''),

Thnx for the specific details.\nSir, what bullet(s) would you think would be best suited for:\n1) Mountain game Urial & Ibex \n2) Plains game Hog Deer, Nilgai & Chinkara ... & even Wild Boar.\n...considering two calibers that I have : 7x57 Mauser and .270 Win (both Win mod. 70 XTR featherwt) as you said specific caliber matters, then bullets. First one I have zeroed at 100yds (short range) and second at 200yds (long range).\nI use Federal 140gr PSP or Winchester 145gr Powerpt in 7x57 Mauser above ; and 130gr Ballistic Silvertip in .270 Win.[/QUOTE]\n \n All Big Game Rifles should be Zeroed at 200 Yds, unless one does not anticipate any use beyond 100 Yds or the Rifles are for Dangerous Game in bushy area.\nUse only one type n weight of bullet ,most suited for the game you are after.\n Zeroe n practice at a 100 Yds with the Rifle, shooting 2 inches High at a 100 yds; this will ensure your rifle would be zeroe or very close to zeroe at 200 yds. \nAt 300 yds you have to see the trajectory table for the specific caliber and bullet at the velocity you are using. Better still shoot 5 shot groups at 300 yds on a day when there is little or no cross wind. \nIt is better to shoot about 50 shots on paper, before going out for a big game hunt like Himalayan Ibex where the permit alone would cost Rs 150,000/- and the travelling and ancilliary expanses would make a total of about Rs 200,000/- at least . \nThe expanse of 50 shots is an insurance against missing that one shot you will get after days of travelling and stalking in arctic temperatures, at 60 degree slopes hanging for dear life.\nFor the 7X57 stick to 140 grain Ptd BT bullets for Ibex; if it shoots well in your rifle. \nFor the .270 stick to 130 grain pointed boat tail bullets and you will not be handicapped. Try to get as close to that Trophy animal as possible and  shoot under  300 yds with the 7mm and not more than 350 to 400 yds with the 270. ( I am assuming you are an excellent shot offhand ) if your shooting off hand, needs more practice , go ahead and do it, other wise do not shoot beyond 200 yds or a bit more.\nI hope I have made sense, actually there are no cut and dry, black and white answers which can be offered by an experienced person because there are so many factors and variables involved.', ''),

I would appreciate if friends could comment if the following assumptions hold any merit.\n\nThe 308 offers the following advantages over the 30-06.\n\n1). Lesser Recoil.\n2). More accuracy.\n3). Relatively Lighter Guns / Shorter Barreled Rifles.\n4). Cheap ammo for target shooting.\n\nAlso I have been hearing from hunters that for almost any game in Pakistan under 300 yards there is no performance benefit of the 30-06 over the 308 W. Is that true ?[/QUOTE]\n\nI do not know if there is some thing wrong with me, but against all laws of physics I find the felt recoil of .308 hunting rifles to be more punishing than that of a .30-06. Perhaps it has some thing to do with the shorter barrel and lighter weight. \nI agree the .308s tend to be a tad more accurate with lighter and medium wt bullets, the heavy bullets are accurate only in 30-06 ( 173 , 180,200, 220 ).\nThe Light Magnum Bullets made by Hornady push both calibers to enhanced performance. \nFor Hand loaders the 30-06 is head and shoulders above the .308. The 180 grain bullets from a 30-06 can be safely pushed to nearly 2900 ft /sec about 300 ft higher than a .308', ''),

(371703, 'Magic Bullet Theory Felt like going American today so wanted to analyse John F Kennedy s assassination.\r\n\r\n[COLOR="red"][B]Synopsis:[/B][/COLOR]\r\n\r\nThe single bullet theory (or magic bullet theory, as it is commonly called by its critics) was introduced by the Warren Commission in its investigation of the assassination of President John F. Kennedy to explain what happened to the bullet which struck Kennedy in the back and exited through his throat. Given the lack of damage to the presidential limousine consistent with it having been struck by a high-velocity bullet and the fact that Texas Governor John Connally was wounded and was seated directly in front of the president, the Commission concluded they were likely struck by the same bullet.\r\n\r\nThe theory, generally credited to Warren Commission staffer Arlen Specter[1] (later a United States Senator from Pennsylvania), posits that a single bullet, known as "Warren Commission Exhibit 399" (also known as "CE 399"), caused all the wounds to the governor and the non-fatal wounds to the president.\r\n\r\nAccording to the single-bullet theory, a three-centimeter-long copper-jacketed lead-core 6.5-millimeter rifle bullet fired from the sixth floor of the Texas School Book Depository passed through President Kennedy’s neck and Governor Connally’s chest and wrist and embedded itself in the Governor’s thigh. If so, this bullet traversed 15 layers of clothing, 7 layers of skin, and approximately 15 inches of tissue, struck a necktie knot, removed 4 inches of rib, and shattered a radius bonecitation needed. The bullet was found on a gurney in the corridor at the Parkland Memorial Hospital, in Dallas, after the assassination. The Warren Commission found that this gurney was the one that had borne Governor Connally.[2] This bullet became a key Commission exhibit, identified as CE 399. Its copper jacket was completely intact. While the bullet''s nose appeared normal, the tail was compressed laterally on one side.\r\nIn its conclusion, the Warren Commission found "persuasive evidence from the experts" that a single bullet caused the President''s neck wound and all the wounds in Governor Connally.[3] It acknowledged that there was a "difference of opinion" among members of the Commission "as to this probability", but stated that the theory was not essential to its conclusions and that all members had no doubt that all shots were fired from the sixth floor window of the Depository building.\r\n\r\nMost pro- and anti-conspiracy theorists believe[4] that the Single Bullet Theory is essential to the Warren Commission''s conclusion that Oswald acted alone. The reason for this is timing: if, as the Warren Commission found, President Kennedy was wounded some time between frame 210 and 225 of the Zapruder film [5] and Governor Connally was wounded in the back/chest no later than frame 240,[6] there would not have been enough time between the wounding of the two men for Oswald to have fired two shots from his bolt action rifle. FBI marksmen, who test-fired the rifle for the Warren Commission, concluded that the "minimum time for getting off two successive well-aimed shots on the rifle is approximately 2 and a quarter seconds" or 41 to 42 Zapruder frames.[7][8]\r\n\r\nThe 1978 House of Representatives Select Committee on Assassinations agreed with the Single-Bullet Theory but differed on the time frame. The Single-Bullet Theory has been staunchly defended by those who believe the Warren Commission''s finding was correct; it has been roundly criticized by those who disagree. \r\n\r\nIf you like what you read the click on the link below for further details...\r\n\r\n[url]http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_bullet_theory[/url]', ''),

Please share something about 7X57 too.[/FONT][/SIZE][/QUOTE]\n \nThe 7X57 MAUSER\n \nQuote " The sound was described as a Zee Zee eu rising to a shrill crescendo then sinking with a thud and a moan by some one getting hit " \nThe American Riflemen never experienced a more dramatic introduction to a cartridge.\nThe date was June 24 1898. The Rough Riders under the Command of Theodore Roosvelt ( Later US President ) advanced on foot at the start of the Battle of Las Guasimas in Cuba and were fired upon by Spanish Snipers entrenched upon the ridge line above armed with 7X57 Mauser Rifles. \nThis was the most costly and intense fusillade of rifle fire in combat faced by the Americans till that time "\nIt had far reaching results other than the heavy casualties borne by US forces. Their own new cartridge was developed as a result ( 30-06 ).\nThe 7X57 is considered as the Grand Daddy of all Modern Cartridges it is small wonder that it was among Jack O'' Connor''s favourites.\nThe 7mm has bullets which have a relatively high BC and SD rendering it effective on both long range game and heavy game at short to medium range.\n7mm Mauser is the oldest Military cum Sporting cartridge still popular, and in active use amongst knowledgeable and experienced hunters.\nIt was developed by Paul Mauser around 1892. Most modern cartridges are based on its case, like the 30-06, 308, 243, 250, 270 and many more.\nMajor W.D.M Bell known as Karamojo Bell in Africa killed a thousand elephants with it with a single shot most of the time beacause of his experience and knowldge, he knew where to hit and he knew the ability of the 175 grain bullets to penetrate. The bullets range from 120 grains to 175 grains. The 140 , 150, 160 and 175 grain bullets are most useful on various types of game. The 140, 150 and 160 are ideal at long range and the 175 are ideal for animals the size of Neel Gai, in fact ideal for it. \nLate President Ayub Khan had removed Import Tax on 7mm and .22 to make these cheap and easily available.\nThe factory ammo is again under loaded for fear of consumer liability as there are rifles still in use which are 120 years old .The ammo is loaded by SAAMI at 40000 CUP but when hand loading it can be loaded to 56000 CUP and you will find it more powerful than the 270 with the heavier bullets and clip the heels of 270 and 280 with the lighter bullets.\nBrother ChocTalpur and PRINCE brother Main --------- tairi farmaish tay', ''),

The dis-assembly and re-assembly is not as quick.  Small parts in hard to reach areas for changing.\nAs for the 1911s well - I say it didn''t win the WWII rather it aided in winning WWII as there were several other countries without their help I strongly believe US would not have won WWII alone.  Then there was Korea, each side states they won, then Vietnam which we know US lost but still states they won, then Greneda which I don''t think they won, Lebanon...... and on and on....

(371826, ' Let me add an article or two about the 30 06 vs the 308.\n\n[B][U]The Great .308 versus .30-06 Debate\n[/U][/B]\nA chat room discussion got me looking hard at the .308 Winchester vs.  .30-06 Springfield debate.  My contention was that there was no  significant difference between the ballistics of the two in hunting  situations, or for that matter in any other situation.  So let''s  examine the ballistics of both cartridges and compare.\n\nFirst we''ll take a quick look at the history of both cartridges.  The  .30-06 Springfield started life as a US military cartridge in 1906.  It  was derived from the .30 Model 1903 cartridge that was designed to  replace the .30-40 Krag.  The 03 cartridge used the same 220 grain  round nosed bullet as the .30-40.  The 06 is essentially the same  case as the 03 with a 150 grain spitzer bullet at 2800 ft/sec.  The  .30-06 was the primary cartridge for the US military until it was replaced by the .308 Winchester/7.62x51mm NATO in 1954.  The  .308''s original load was a 149 grain spitzer at 2800 ft/sec.  Both  cartridges have certainly been very successful in military, match and  hunting use! (Reference Handloading by William C. Davis, Jr.)\n\nTo quote the Speer #13 manual, In the hunting field, ballistic  differences between the 308 and the 30-06 are negligible.  The .308  was designed to duplicate the .30-06 for military use, but in a half  inch shorter package.  Both guns use the same 0.308 bullets.  These  bullets range from 100 grains to 250 grains in various styles.  I  figured that the .30-06 would have an advantage as the bullets get over  180 grains because its case was originally designed for the heavier  bullets.\n\nThe most common hunting bullet weights for these cartridges are the 150,  165 and 180 grain.  I realize that there are tons of loads for each  cartridge but you''ve gotta start somewhere.  I looked in the Speer #13  manual and compared their loads for both cartridges.  I figure this is a  pretty good comparison as loads for both cartridges were fired in the  same type rifle, a Remington 700 with a 22'' barrel.  In each case I  took the bullet with the highest ballistic coefficient and the highest  velocity listed.\n\nHere is a chart of the muzzle velocities for each bullet for both  cartridges, the difference between them (.30-06 minus .308) and the  percentage of that difference:\n\nBullet weight  .308    .30-06    Difference      %\n150               2919    2847      -72 ft/sec      -2.5\n165               2812    2803       -9 ft/sec       -0.3\n180               2623    2756      133 ft/sec       4.8\n\nFrom the chart we can see that the average difference in velocities for  the three bullets is 17 ft/sec, or 0.6%, in favor of the .30-06.  Now  don''t forget that these are average velocities.  In a string of shots a  cartridge/gun''s velocity can easily have a standard deviation of 1%  or more.  In other words the normal variations in loads result in a  built-in error that pretty much means we can''t count on such a small  difference to be meaningful.  \n\nSo, what does all this mean downrange?  We''ll zero both guns at 200  yards and compare the bullet energy there.  Let''s also take a look at  what the bullets will be doing at 400 yards, which is a heck of a long  shot for hunting.  I used the PointBlank ballistics program to  make the comparisons.\n\nWith the 150 grain bullet the .308 has 2093 foot-pounds of energy at 200  yards while the .30-06 has 1985 foot-pounds.  Out at 400 yards the .308  will have dropped 20.9 inches, and still has 1512 foot-pounds. The  .30-06 will have dropped 22.13 inches and maintains 1428 foot-pounds.   The .308 shows 5.9% more energy at 400 yards.\n\nThen with the 165 grain bullet 200 yards the .308 shows 2202 foot-pounds  versus 2187 foot-pounds for the .30-06.  At 400 yards the .308 drops  21.90 inches and has 1645 foot-pounds.  The .30-06 drops 22.06 inches  with 1633 foot-pounds left.  At 400 yards the .308 has a tiny 0.7%  energy advantage.\n\nFinally we take the 180 grain bullet, which should give the biggest  advantage to the .30-06.  At the 200 yard mark the .308 will have an  energy of 2143 foot-pounds and the .30-06 will have 2379 foot-pounds.   The .30-06 has about 11% more energy.  When we get out to 400 yards the  .308 will be 24.64 inches low and still have 1647 foot-pounds while the  .30-06 will be 22.10 inches low and still carry 1840 foot-pounds.  That  means that at 400 yards the .30-06 has an 11.7% advantage in energy.\n\nNow I''m sure that folks will look up their favorite of these two and prove that it is better in some manual or another.  I looked in  some other manuals too and found varying velocities.  One thing I  noticed in one manual was that, with 250 grain bullets (yes, that is two  hundred and fifty grains), there was only 100 feet per sec difference  in the velocities of the two cartridges.  That particular manual  doesn''t give any barrel lengths though.\n\nJust for giggles I also looked at the .270 Winchester and .280 Remington  loads in the same Speer manual.  With a 22'' barrel and a 150 grain  bullet at 2907 feet per second the .270 has 2170 foot-pounds at 200  yards and 1648 foot-pounds at 400 yards, while dropping 19.98 inches.   The .280, with a 24'' barrel and a 145 grain bullet at 2975 feet per  second, shows 2209 foot-pounds at 200 yards and 1689 foot-pounds at 400  yards, while dropping 18.83.  So, both of these cartridges beat  the .30 caliber rounds in energy and trajectory.\n\nWhen it''s all said and done does either the .308 or the .30-06 really  have any ballistic advantage over the other?  I''ll concede that an 11%  difference in energy with the 180 grain bullet is an advantage but I  wonder if a deer on the receiving end tell the difference between 1647  and 1840 foot-pounds of energy?  Considering the overall differences and  performance of both cartridges I''ll stick to my assertion that there  is no SIGNIFICANT ballistic advantage with either cartridge.  Now just  pick which ever you like and enjoy shooting it!    \n\nSource: [URL]http://www.huntingnut.com/index.php?name=news&file=article&sid=58[/URL]', ''),
(371827, ' [B][U]Article 2:[/U][/B]\n\n[B][U]Accuracy Facts: .308 Winchester versus .30-06 Springfield By  Bart Bobbitt[/U][/B]\nSeems to me that any time there''s more metal contacting the bullet, the  greater [the] chance that more variables come into play. Besides, folks  who shoot highpower rifles the most accurate[ly] have very little case  neck tension on the bullet anyway.\n  \nIt''s really easier to have uniform case neck tension by having it light  in the first place; neck length doesn''t come into play when this is how  it''s done. And ammo that''s been handloaded [which is] then let set for  several weeks or months will have a greater release force needed with  long necks because of dissimilar materials bonding between bullet jacket  and case neck/fouling. There''s more area to bond when longer necks are  used.\n  \nAll that aside, lets go back to when the .30-06 and .308 were the only  cartridges allowed in NRA match rifle matches. Both cartridges were used  in barrels of equal quality as well as the same action and stocks by  several top shooters in the USA. Both cartridges were used in matches at  ranges from 100 through 1000 yards. Many thousands of rounds were fired  in both types. Bullets from 168 through 200 grains were used with  several powder, case and primer combinations.\n\n  In comparing accuracy between the .308 and .30-06, folks who used each  quickly agreed on one thing: .308s were two to three times more  accurate than the .30-06. In the early 1960s, it was also observed that  competitors with lower classifications using .308s were getting higher  scores than higher classified folks using .30-06s; at all ranges. By the  middle to late 1960s, all the top highpower shooters and virtually all  the rest had switched to the .308. The Highpower Committee had received  so many complaints of ties not being able to be broke between shooters  using the .308 and shooting all their shots in the tie-breaking V-ring,  something had to be done to resolve this issue. In 1966, the NRA cut in  half the target scoring ring dimensions.\n  \nAt the peak of the .30-06''s use as a competition cartridge, the most  accurate rifles using it would shoot groups at 200 yards of about 2  inches, at 300 of about 3 inches. The 600-yard groups were 6 to 7 inches  and at 1000 yards about 16 inches. As the high-scoring ring in targets  was 3 inches at 200 and 300 yards, 12 inches at 600 and 20 inches at  1000, the top scores fired would have 90+ percent of the shots inside  this V-ring.\n  \nAlong came the 7.62mm NATO and its commercial version; the .308  Winchester. In the best rifles, 200 yard groups were about 3/4ths inch,  at 300 about 1-1/2 inch. At 600 yards, groups were about 2-1/2 inch and  at 1000 about 7 to 8 inches. It was not very long before the .30-06  round no longer won matches nor set any records; all it''s records were  broken by the .308 by a considerable margin. Some accuracy tests at 600  yards with the .308 produced test groups in the 1 to 2 inch range. These  were 20 to 40 shot groups. No .30-06 has ever come close to shooting  that well.\n  \nAt 1000 yards, where both the .30-06 and .308 were allowed in Palma  matches, the .308 was the clear-cut most accurate of the two. If top  shooters felt the .30-06 was a more accurate round, they would have used  it - they didn''t. In fact by the early 1970s, the scoring ring  dimensions on the 800 - 1000 yard target were also cut in about half due  to the accuracy of both the .308 Win. over the .30-06 and the .30-.338  over the .300 H&H when used in long range matches.\n\n  Most top highpower shooters feel the main reason the .308 is much more  accurate than the .30-06 is its shorter, fatter case promotes more  uniform and gentle push on the bullet due to a higher loading density  (less air space) and a more easily uniformly ignitable powder charge.\n  \nMilitary arsenals who produced match and service ammo in both 7.62mm and  30 caliber have fired thousands of test rounds/groups with both. They  also found out that with both ammo types, the smallest groups were with  the 7.62 by about 50 to 60 percent. M1 rifles in 7.62 shot about twice  as small of groups as .30 M1s at all ranges. When the M14 was first  used, there were some .30-06 M1 rifles that would shoot more accurately.  It took the service teams several years to perfect the methods of  making M14s shoot well, but when they did, they shot as good as M1s in  7.62. \n  \nThere will always be folks who claim the .30-06 is a more accurate  cartridge. All I have to say to them is to properly test .308 vs. .30-06  and find out. Theory is nice to think about; facts determine the truth.\n\nSource: [URL]http://www.snipercountry.com/articles/accuracyfacts.asp[/URL]\n\n\nHere''s chart below comparing the recoil between the 308 vs the 30-06: \n\nThe first value is [B]R[/B][B]ifle Weight[/B] followed by  [B]Recoil energy [/B]and [B]Recoil velocity:[/B]\n\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]3696[/ATTACH]\n\nSource: [URL]http://www.chuckhawks.com/recoil_table.htm[/URL]', ''),

(629562, 'Why some scopes are costly and some are cheap? [COLOR=#141823][FONT=Helvetica]Here I share what I believe I know. Yes there are a lot of scopes in the market which can serve the purpose. But still it depends what is the purpose. Why some scopes are called of high quality and are costly and why some scopes do have similar functions but are a lot more cheap? When I research on it I find that the maximum cost involved in outdoor tours is of tour itself. Its not the gun nor the scope but people spend thousands of $ and off days to manage a trip for such hunts. In this scenario it becomes very critical that your scope must perform well in all kind of situations and low light conditions. To us all this does not matter as we usually do some target shooting or some hunting. We all know that most of scope making companies offer very good warranty services but still people select the best they can buy. Why is it so? Its all because they know that there scope will be taken care by the manufacturer but what about the cost of the tour? If they go to Alaska only three times in their life time, it is very critical that their scope should not deceive them. Now come to some of the known scope manufacturers. There are Leapers / UTG, Centre Point. Hawke. All these three are made in China even if they are original. There is no harm in made in China only if the QC is fine. But the scopes under these brands which go to US are also made in China. But Hawke is found to be best in them. Specially Hawke Airmax series is made for magnum springers.[/FONT][/COLOR]\n[COLOR=#141823][FONT=Helvetica]But still many CPs and Leapers do well on springers. We normally feel that Hawke is very good scopes but still the US users find them to be 2nd rated when they compare Hawke to Leupold or Vortex Diamondback.\nThen come comes BSA scopes. These are fine scopes as long as they are used on light powder burners or on PCPs. But on magnum springers, these normally dont perform.\nWhat is the main feature of the scope which we should consider while purchasing a scope is that it should hold POI (zero) day in and day out.\nSo the most important thing in any scope is the ability to hold zero. You will find many Leupold basic scopes which are costly than high end Hawke, but Leupold will be costly. It will not have that much features but still costly.\nIts because the capability of holding zero is much better.\nThen comes the matter of first focal plain and 2nd focal plain. That is also important but not at this stage. This discussion can be deferred.\nSo the quality of scope is not related to number of features but relates to its real quality.\nSome Hawke and BSA will give you all those features which Leupold will give you but at 4 times of cost.\nIt is just like you can go somewhere on Suzuki Mehran or you can also go on BMW.\nBoth works but one is much more reliable than the other.\nFinally you get what you pay for.\n[/FONT][/COLOR]', ''),

(371970, ' The .308 Win will display a little edge in accuracy over the 30-06, only when two identical Match Grade rifles are used. In other cases each rifle will behave differently. \nAlso the 308 and the 30-06 are at par upto 150 grain bullets, but when one goes to the heavy weights like the 165, 180 grain or heavier the 30-06 out shines and leads by 250 feet or more velocity. This is because  the .308 has  a little case volume and more often than not the loads are crush loads with the loading density (powder) nearly 100 % of case volume; incidently this is what contributes to the some what more accuracy, as  at the time of firing the propellant is exactly in the same position from shot to shot. Where as in larger cases ( 30-06 and others) the case volume bieng greater the the powder position is diferent from shot to shot. The short action ( all 308 rifles are not short action) also provides more rigidity to the rifle action again contributing to the accuracy. The recent surge of Short Magnums can be attributed to the realization that short, fat cases with just enough  capacity will at least theorotically be more accurate and also do give less recoil due to shorter over all rifle length.', ''),

(371994, 'Achieving Optical Centre of the scope Dear All,\n\n1. First of all be sure that you have purchased an Airgun Rated scope which is capable of holding double recoil of spring airgun.\n\n2. Cut two V shaped pieces of wood allign them and fix then with nails on a chip board\n\n3. Be sure that the above mentioned set up is such that you can easily put the scope in the V slots of the set up and can rotate the scope.\n\n4. Take the scope in hand and fully tight the windage knob. Now open it to full extent and count the number of rounds the knob takes to get it opened completely.\n\n5. Divide the total rounds with 2 and retight the knob to that extent.  This will get you near the optical centre.  It is called mechanical center of the scope.\n\n6.  Do the same excercise with elevation knob.\n\n7.  Now put the scope on the wooden set up and see through the scope.\n\n8.  At 20 yards distance, place a paper and make a dot sign where the the scross hair of the scope is.\n\n9.  Now rotate the scope very slowly and you will see that the cross hair will not remain on the dot spot.  Now while looking through the scope achieve such a situation where the cross hare would remain on the dot spot during the 360 degrees movement of scope rotation.\n\n10.  Now if you have achieved this, it means you have achieved the optical centre of the scope.\n\n11.  Install the scope on the gun and do a test fire.  If your gun is Diana, the pellet will hit a bit low that the aim point.\n\n12.  Please do not adjust the scope knobs to correct this, rather remove the scope and place some plastic films like X ray sheet under the rear mount.\n\n13.  Now again install the scope and do 2 test fires.  You will see that this time the pellet will hit near the target as compared to the 1st shot.\n\n14.  You can place two or three pieces of X ray sheets to bring the pellet hit as near to the target as possible.\n\n15.  The remaining minor difference between the pellet hit point and the target may be removed by adjusting the windage and elevation knobs of the scope.\n\n16.  If you have successfully done this, you scope will work perfectly.\n\nFor any further information  [email]mubhaur@yahoo.com[/email]', ''),

People who specially train these give them 3 almonds daily, some insects, minced meat (keema), greenery (Patthay), Parathay ( made with Desi Ghee) and a mix feed of different grains.They are also massaged after fights.\nSome people keep their Aseel roosters in Chains as they attack humans. Female Aseel don''t look much different from other hens, generally have the same height, but give 7-20 eggs per season (much less than golden, desi,etc).\nAseels have long legs, strong built but are not fat (look thin), bald from shoulders, have small ''kalghi'' and long necks. \nI have kept aseels, special ones found in Punjab are found in villages of Sargodha,Mianwali,Gujrawala,Okara,Faisalabad,Multan and bahawalpur districts.', ''),

In this regards, I & my son Zargham Khan have just started making videos of such hunts organized by us in Pakistan and I''ll soon publish "Seven Films" in the very near future.\n\nAlthough, I happen to be a "Professional Photographer" since 1980 and you must have seen many of my photos on PakGuns, however, since I''m quite new in the field of videography and it''s arduous art of editing, I''m still learning the knots of this demanding profession, so the quality of my videos may not be up to the expected standard, however, since we have captured the "REAL HUNTS" of "REAL HUNTERS"  and since there is nothing artificial in our films, I hope you''ll enjoy them & I also hope you''ll be kind to ignore any flaws & errors therein.\n\nBeing a 55 Year Old Man ...  it took me three months (Jan-Mar 2011) to learn the Video Editing Software (Pinnacle 14) & it took me another four months (Apr-Jul 2011) to edit four of my raw hunting films. My slow PC & lack of experience slowed the whole process & exorbitant delays in lieu literally made me mad but ultimately I accomplished my goal. I''ve now bought a new PC with high specs & very good speed & InshAllah my forthcoming films will be much better\n\nNevertheless ... I''m happy that I got rid of all those Pakistani video film editors commonly found in Pakistani Video Markets who are no doubt quite experienced but since they mostly edit "Pakistani Marriage Films" in a typical "FILMI STYLE" ... they never suited me, rather, they made us laugh on one of my hunting films which they edited with "NASEEBO LAL''S" songs in the background ...lol ... whereas, the few real professional editors from private video houses were so expensive I could not afford them.\n\nYour kind suggestions, comments and invaluable help to improve the quality of these films will be greatly appreciated.

I also admire your partridge breeding & releasing program & I sincerely hope this becomes a precedence & a role model for many other hunters of Pakistan whose ultimate benefit will go to our forthcoming generations.\n\nAs regards your question, I suggest you follow the strategy of Qabool Shah Saheb ... I mean sprinkle a lot of grain & feed these birds in the area where you intend to release them. Easy & plenty of feed readily available under their feet will naturally make them residents of this area and the best result of this strategy will be visible when the season will be over and those pheasants who will escape from your guns will become permanent residents of such areas & they will attract & lead the new birds (which you''ll release next season) to also become local residents. I hope this strategy will work ... but please don''t forget to spare a few pheasants so they may live till the next season !!!\n\nPS : If you''ll implement this humble suggestion of mine I''m sure you''ll allow me my quota I deserve in lieu thereof ... lol\n\nKind Regards', ''),

Meaning the crosshairs provide a fixed elevation adjustment at each level vertically for specified distance. For example if our scope is zeroed at 200 yards then moving the crosshairs one level downwards would make the projectile move to 250 yards or whatever the specification of the scope might be. This provides compensation for bullet drop.\n\n10)	Better eye relief.\n\nP.S: I have only mentioned high-end scopes&#8217; features for drawing the difference consider low-end scopes to be the opposite.

They are known to be very tall, come up to one''s knees and are very hard fighters. They are widely available throughout Pakistan.\r\n[U]Mianwali:[/U] Many color variations, even in white color, very very hard fighters.Among Aseel lovers, there is a dispute b/w Sindhi and Mianwali lovers, some say Mianwali Aseel has advantage in fight due to short height and strong built.\r\n[U]Java:[/U] Mostly have uniform color, i.e. a blend of brown,black,white,yellow,blue,etc. Very common in Pakistan and some are said to be very brave fighters. \r\nOther aseel breeds are Cholistani,Peshawari,Balochi} mostly classified by the area they live in.\r\nAseels make a good handi if you select young ones and not too old ones, these are available in butcher shops very commonly...I remember buying aseels at the rate of Rs165/kg and I bought 5 live aseels, but now the rates are sky-high.\r\nAseels are mainly kept by fighters who win bets of over 50,000 rupees. A good champion aseel sells for over 1lakh.\r\nGood bloodline aseel chicks are available for as much as 1000 rupees in our villages in Punjab. \r\n90% People keep aseels for fights, the rest 10% LOVE THE BREED.\r\nFor training aseels for fights, one should buy a small chick ( an aseel chick can be recognized by having a bare(hairless) neck and some other parts. It should be trained using gloves and mirrors. People who specially train these give them 3 almonds daily, some insects, minced meat (keema), greenery (Patthay), Parathay ( made with Desi Ghee) and a mix feed of different grains.They are also massaged after fights.\r\nSome people keep their Aseel roosters in Chains as they attack humans. Female Aseel don''t look much different from other hens, generally have the same height, but give 7-20 eggs per season (much less than golden, desi,etc).\r\nAseels have long legs, strong built but are not fat (look thin), bald from shoulders, have small ''kalghi'' and long necks. \r\nI have kept aseels, special ones found in Punjab are found in villages of Sargodha,Mianwali,Gujrawala,Okara,Faisalabad,Multan and bahawalpur districts.[/QUOTE]\r\n \r\nNicely described Chaudry sb......\r\n let me add one more breed which is very rare and renowned for their "kaari" kicks to the opponent... called "QANDAHARI" as depicted by name their origin is Afghanistan ... they are mostly pure white in color, and are big sized roosters... i saw "pairh"in my college times in which a "qandahari" was involved believe me most of the spectators came to just see a "qandahari" aseel murgha.... and as expected the "qandahri" won the fight in first "pani" by hitting few "kaaris" to the opponent.......', ''),

This is the story of a Himalayan Ibex Hunt in Kurumbar Valley in the province of Gilgit-Baltistan by one of our senior hunters Dr. Joseph Zbylski from Denver Colorado (USA).\n\nBorn in 1933, Dr. Joseph Zbylski is a famous plastic surgeon, a popular social worker, an avid veteran hunter & the ex president of The Safari Club. In 2008, Dr. Z accepted the arduous challenge to hunt the Himalayan Ibex at the age 77 years in the towering snow capped mountains of Northern Pakistan. \n\nDespite Dr. Z''s extensive hunting experience and un-matched skills, the illusive Ibex played hide & seek for over nine days in the snowbound valleys of Hushay & Basho. Meanwhile, the hunting season was over and Dr. Zbylski had to go back home. \n\nHowever, Dr. Z was so impressed by the awe inspiring beauty of Pakistan''s breathtaking mountains and the hospitality of friendly people of Gilgit Baltistan that he returned in 2010 to claim his un-accomplished hunt. \n\nAmazingly, Dr. Z shot the Ibex from over 370 yards with his Browning 7mm win mag !\n\nBoth of his hunts (2008 & 2010) were organized by Pakistan Guides, Dr. Zbylski was guided by Zargham Khan (G.M. Pakistan Guides) and Raja Naeem Khan (P.H. Pakistan Guides). The videography was done by Zargham Khan and this film was edited  by Kaiser Khan, (CEO, Pakistan Guides). \n\nIbex Hunting By Pakistan Guides (Part 1 of 2) : [url]http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=glBw08q5xq0[/url]\n\nIbex Hunting By Pakistan Guides (Part 2 of 2) : [url]http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EFRc-FcFNPU[/url]\n\nAs mentioned earlier, this is just the beginning of our Hunting Videos & these films have been made on "Do It Yourself" basis with No Formal Training, Experience or Background in videography & editing so kindly forgive us for any flaws therein and please do give us your valuable suggestions to improve the quality & style of these films. \n\nFor more details on Big Game Trophy Hunting in Pakistan.

(372371, 'Shotgun Cleaning: 15 Minute Challange [B]AoA Everybody[/B]\r\n\r\nI challenged (a typical symptom of heightened boredom) my self today by thoroughly cleaning an autoloader shotgun in 15 minutes. the total time (15 mins ofcourse) included detailed disassembly in major components, cleaning, lubricating and final assembly.\r\n\r\nWell....thanks to two wonderful products I managed to pull it off and completely cleaned and lubricated a shotgun in just under 15 minutes.\r\n\r\n[B]Products Used:[/B]\r\n\r\n[B]1. Liqui Moly Brake and Parts Cleaner[/B]\r\n[IMG]http://i998.photobucket.com/albums/af103/12gauge-pakguns/15%20minute%20Shotgun%20Cleaning%20Challenge/DSC00658.jpg[/IMG]\r\n[B]2.

Carbon/Gunk/Fouling simply washes away and the parts come out squeaky clean without even a trace or residue of any kind.\r\n\r\nAs far as the bore is concerned, I just sprayed a generous amount and left it there for a couple of minutes while I sprayed other stuff. returned and sprayed again. then used a cotton patch fixed on a cleaning rod to clean everything from inside the bore and I was done. Just one cotton patch was needed. the spray did most of the cleaning.\r\n\r\nFor lubrication, I just cleaned everything with the "brake and parts cleaner" then sprayed everything with Rusto-Nil. removed excess lubrication using a clean cotton cloth.\r\n\r\n[B]Steps Involved:[/B]\r\n\r\n1. Disassemble the shotgun into major components\r\n2. Spray the barrel bore with Brake and Parts Cleaner and let it all drip out the muzzle end.\r\n3. Spray the receiver, bolt assembly, gas piston and let it drip out.\r\n4. Repeat step 2 and 3 (if you gun is really dirty, repeat step 2 and 3 again!)\r\n5. Spray Rusto-Nil inside the Bore, Receiver, Bolt Assembly, Gas Piston\r\n6. Clean everything with a cotton cloth and run a cotton patch inside the bore using a cleaning rod.\r\n7. Assemble the shotgun and you are good to do.\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i998.photobucket.com/albums/af103/12gauge-pakguns/15%20minute%20Shotgun%20Cleaning%20Challenge/DSC00660.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\n[B]Regards.[/B]', ''),

(372408, ' What Shotgun Should I Use For ?????\r\n\r\nby Rick Rappe\r\n\r\nEarly in the development of what we''ve come to know as the shotgun, hunters of ducks and other gamebirds used a variety of methods to sneak up on game "on the set" and fire a charge of rocks, and later lead pellets at single or entire flocks of birds before they could fly off. Heavy, cumbersome guns with primitive ignition systems made "shooting flying" impractical if not impossible.\r\n\r\nIt wasn''t until the development of systems such as the flintlock in the 18th century, that the ability to fire at moving/flying game began to be a practical form of hunting.\r\n\r\nHere in America, while we have romanticized notions about the Colt and the Winchester as the "Guns that won the West", the strongest argument can be made that the real tool of the pioneer was the shotgun. With a single gun, a frontiersman could feed himself and family, keep "critters" out of the vegetable garden plus do an adequate job of defense from hostiles. Loaded with a single ball, the shotgun at short range made a credible tool for deer and even larger game.\r\n\r\nOver the last 200 years or so, shotguns which, with one modern exception, are classified in "gauges", have come in a variety of bore sizes from the massive 4 gauge (and larger) "punt guns" used in the last century by market hunters to fire at large flocks of "sitting ducks" to the diminutive .22 rimfire shot loads.\r\n\r\nA gauge is a comparatively primitive form of measurement of the number of pure lead balls fitting the bore size that equal one pound. For example, a gun in which 12 lead balls that just fit down the barrel were to weigh one pound, is a 12 gauge. Said differently, the bigger the gauge number, the smaller the hole because it takes more balls to weigh one pound.\r\n\r\nThe one common exception to the gauge measurement is the .410 shotgun, which is actually a bore diameter designation.\r\n\r\nToday, the commonly encountered shotgun ammunition sizes are (smallest to largest), the .410, 28, 20, 16, 12, and 10.\r\n\r\nBefore we outline the hunting applications of each gauge, there are two other points the novice must understand: Chokes, and shot pellet sizes\r\n\r\nShot Sizes\r\n\r\nThe presumption is that the reader understands that the shotgun typically fires a load of small pellets rather than a single projectile (bullet) as does a rifle. Historically, these pellets have been made of lead, but due to evidence (subject to debate) that ducks in particular are ingesting lead pellets from the bottom of lakes and marshes and contracting lead poisoning, in the USA, waterfowl hunters are now required to use non-toxic shot (steel).\r\n\r\nThe novice looking over gauge and shot pellet size alternatives within each gauge needn''t be bewildered. Speaking of lead shot only for the moment, one needs only to remember that just the opposite as with gauge sizes, the bigger the number (shot size) the smaller the size of the individual pellets. Typically, larger pellets are used for larger quarry.\r\n\r\nThe smallest pellet size normally used for hunting is the size 8, typically used for game the size of quail or dove. Size 7 1/2 or 6 are used for many upland species such as grouse or pheasants. Size 5 and 4 are often recommended for pheasants shot at greater distance (larger pellets, because they are heavier, retain their velocity better and so killing power over distance is greater than the smaller sizes), where lead is legal, #4s or 5s are commonly used for ducks, with lead 2s or the still larger BB size used for the largest of birds such as Canada geese.\r\n\r\nStill occasionally encountered, are shotgun shells loaded with "buck shot", so called because the pellets are large enough to take game like deer. These sizes range from #4 buck to the largest size #00, referred to as "double aught buck". (I mention here that there are single projectile shotgun loads, typically referred to as slugs, or rifled slugs that are far more efficient on deer sized game than buck shot.)\r\n\r\nBecause "steel shot" (actually an iron alloy) is much less heavy than lead, larger pellets are needed to provide the same individual pellet energy. As a general rule, duck hunters who might have used lead 6''s are counseled to move up two shot sizes (#4) when switching to steel. Because long range duck and goose hunters needed steel loads with sufficient pellet energy, new steel sizes that fit between lead BB and #4 buck have appeared with letter designations such as T and F.\r\n\r\nChokes\r\n\r\nThe earliest shotgunners quickly realized that the moment a charge of shot left the barrel, the individual pellets colliding with each other and meeting wind resistance began to disburse, and after only 20-30 yards, killing power was dramatically reduced because the pellets had spread so much that too few hit the target. A solution was to use larger pellets so fewer need to connect, but this is partly offset because bigger & heavier pellets meant fewer of them can fit in the shell casing in the first place.\r\n\r\nSome credit an American market hunter in the 19th century named Fred Kimball with the idea of constricting (choking down) the bore of the shotgun to better focus the pellets just as the nozzle of a garden hose can be made to shoot a stream instead of a spray.\r\n\r\nTypically, shotgun chokes are referred to as full (the most constriction), modified (medium), improved cylinder (a small amount), and cylinder (no constriction). You will also occasionally encounter nuance sizes such as extra-full, skeet, or improved-modified.\r\n\r\nThe traditional British designations are full, half (modified), quarter (improved cylinder), and cylinder.\r\n\r\nOn first learning about how choke boring extends the killing range of a shotgun from less than 30 yards (cyl. bore) to 60 yards or more (full choke), the reader might logically ask why any hunter would use anything but the tightest choke available. There are two reasons. First, the spread, or pattern of the shot load over a larger area can make hitting a flying bird easier because it allows for some aiming error. Second, a bird shot at close range with a tightly choked gun can be hit by too many pellets, destroying its edibility.\r\n\r\nHunters who''s quarry is typically shot at closer range are counseled to use a more open choke such as improved cylinder; at the longest distances, full; with modified recommended as a more all around compromise.\r\n\r\nWhile there have been in times past, a number of adjustable choke devices marketed, a hunter wishing greater versatility was required to either have multiple guns with different choked barrels, or a gun with interchangeable barrels.\r\n\r\nIn the last few years, guns with changeable "screw in" chokes have become common; greatly increasing versatility for the one gun hunter.\r\n\r\nThe Gauges\r\n\r\nThere is considerable overlap in the suitability of shotgun gauges for various game. For example, one can easily find or handload 1 ounce shot charges in the 28, 20, 16 and 12 gauge. So what gauge to use for which game is far from a black and white decision. One hunter might want maximum versatility, while another might focus on only one type of hunting. Whereas one duck and goose hunter might be well served with a heavier 12 or 10 gauge, but another who also hunts ruffed grouse where a lighter 20 gauge is a better choice might opt to also duck hunt with the same 20 gauge gun.\r\n\r\nThere is no intention below to make absolute statements about what is best. Rather these comments are to be guidelines for the novice. As always, the hunter is encouraged to ask for additional advice and make his or her own informed decisions.\r\n\r\nShotgun science is also so inexact to be referred to more as art than science by many, with nearly as many exceptions to the rules, than rules. Another example: Will a one ounce shot charge from a 20 gauge be exactly as effective as one from a 12? No. In general, because the 20 has a smaller bore, the shot exits the barrel in a longer and more strung out mass (called a shot string) than a 12. Yet if the 20 user was firing ammo with high quality shot versus the 12 gauge using inexpensive promotional loads, the 20 might actually be more effective, and in either case, since it requires only a few of the hundreds of pellets in that ounce to hit and bring down the quarry, the hunter might find no practical difference between the two. See what I mean?\r\n\r\n.410 Bore\r\n\r\nThe smallest of the commonly encountered shotgun sizes, the four-ten is suitable for game such as rabbits, squirrels and some smaller close range bird hunting. Because four-ten guns tend to be lighter weight and the small sized cartridge generates less recoil or "kick", it is often recommended as a beginners gun with which to learn shooting fundamentals. However, many disagree with this approach citing that the very small shot charge makes effective hitting of the target more difficult and can discourage the beginner. This writer tends to agree, and recommends that the beginner start with a larger gauge with the four-ten reserved for specialty applications or for use of experts.\r\n\r\n.410 ammunition comes in 2 1/2 inch and 3" lengths, with nearly all guns capable of firing both. The 3" holds more shot and is therefore a better hunting choice.\r\n\r\n28 Gauge\r\n\r\nStill comparatively uncommon, the 28 "kicks like a .410 and hits like a 20". For years, the only reason the gauge did not completely disappear was because of a skeet shooting application. It is the smallest gauge many feel practical for bird hunting, and in a trim and fast handling shotgun is a delight to use on such game as quail. Drawbacks are limited availability of ammo, an inadequacy at longer ranges, and insufficient shell capacity to handle larger shot, including steel.\r\n\r\n20 Gauge\r\n\r\nVery popular, the 20 is an excellent choice for many types of hunting. Most guns are light enough to not pose a long distance carrying problem, and with the 20 gauge 3" magnum, it approaches the 12 in effectiveness. For any hunter whose quarry is other than deer, ducks, geese or turkey (and it can suffice in these applications), the 20 should be a strong consideration. It is highly recommended as a first gun (with light loads if recoil is a problem).\r\n\r\n16 Gauge\r\n\r\nOnce very popular, and with periodic surges in popularity, the 16 remains in a back seat position to both the 20 and the 12. Proponents will argue that it throws better patterns than the 20, and equals the 12 in game getting power. There once was more truth to this argument than today. With advances in shotshell technology more devoted to the 12 and 20 than the 16, the 20 gauge now equals or surpasses the 16. When it became impractical for American manufacturers to build guns in three frame sizes, the 16''s (after being made for a time on 12 gauge frames) lost favor. If a hunter wanted power, he bought a 12. If he wanted light weight, he bought a 20. Both ammo and reloading components are more difficult to find, and while I personally intend to keep my one remaining 16; for practical purposes it cannot get the highest of recommendations.\r\n\r\n12 Gauge\r\n\r\nBy way of illustration of the comparative popularity of the 12 gauge, my own gun vault contains 10 shotguns at present. One 28, one 20, one 16 and seven 12 gauges. The 12 is far and away the most versatile and most practical of all. In a light gun with light charges it makes an excellent short range and fast handling "bird gun" for such game as quail and grouse, and at the other end of the spectrum, the 12 gauge magnum 3 inch is the most popular choice for duck, geese and turkey.\r\n\r\nShopping today only for an "upland game" gun, you might opt for a light 20. If looking just for a heavy duck and goose model, you might consider the 10 (there are now a few guns being chambered for a 3 1/2 inch 12 gauge super magnum); but for overall versatility, the 12 is never a bad choice.\r\n\r\n10 Gauge\r\n\r\nIn times past, if a hunter was a duck and goose specialist, the big 10 was the gun to have (U.S. laws in the 1920''s outlawed gauges bigger than 10 for waterfowl use.). Over time, the 12 gauge 3 inch magnum surpassed the 10 with shell technology and less massive guns. But with the requirement for less efficient steel shot, bigger again became better (in theory), and the 10 has seen an upswing in popularity.\r\n\r\nThere remains some debate as to the practical advantages of the 10 over the 12 in the ability to smoothly swing a bigger gun and actually hit a long range flying target as well as actual delivery of a killing pattern any further out than the 12 can do. If you must have the biggest, this is it, but for the beginner or any hunter with the intent to pursue anything other than long range ducks and geese, the 10 is not the best choice.\r\n\r\nWhat kind of gun (action type) do I buy?\r\n\r\nShotguns come as single shots, a few bolt actions, slide actions (pumps), semi-automatics, and double barrels (either side by side or over and unders).\r\n\r\nThe single shots and bolt actions, while having some hunting utility, are quickly dismissed as no situation where they would be a first choice is recognized.\r\n\r\nBoth the pump and the semi auto have good utilitarian applications, with this writer giving the slight edge to the pump. While the "automatic" has a slight edge in rapidity of fire, and often less perceived recoil, accurate followup shots, with practice, are virtually as quick with the pump. All currently manufactured pumps, I believe, are now chambered for at least the 3" magnum (12 and 20) which means they will function with the standard length ammunition as well. The same cannot be said for all models of semi-automatic.\r\n\r\nWhile it is also true that the auto and the pump have a ammunition capacity of typically 5 shots, all models are now shipped with a magazine plug (here in America) limiting capacity to three (a waterfowl hunting restriction). Three shots is sufficient for nearly all situations, and some countries further restrict capacity to two, negating any advantage (other than cost) that these guns have over the double barreled models.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the epitome of sporting arms, the classic side by side double barrel has long been out of mainstream favor in the USA. The reasons are several including the perception of comparative fragility, the high cost of manufacture, and the belief that looking over two barrels is a less precise method of aiming (ok, pointing).\r\n\r\nWithout a physics discussion, it is true that getting two barrels affixed side by side to shoot to the same point of aim is a labor intensive and so expensive procedure. The other reasons, are debatable.\r\n\r\nOver and under models are a different matter. With many, but not all, of the dynamic handling characteristics of a quality SxS, but still more expensive than the pumps or automatics; these guns are quite popular.\r\n\r\nThere are a number of guns available in a range of features and quality, but if forced to make recommendations, I''d suggest:\r\n\r\nFor the one gun hunter on a budget, but desiring maximum versatility:\r\n\r\nRemington 870 12 gauge, pump action, 3 inch chamber, screw in chokes, 26 inch barrel if possible- 28 inch ok. If I wanted to add deer hunting, special added barrels with rifle sights are available.\r\n\r\nWere duck, geese, turkey and deer, not a consideration, the same gun is available in 20 gauge.\r\n\r\nAn economy model of the 870, called the Express can be had for just over $200.\r\n\r\n(Note: Remington has said they will no longer honor any warranty if the shooter converts the safety to left handed operation and so after market left hand safeties are no longer available. There is an 870 made especially for left handers)\r\n\r\nFor those desiring a semi-automatic, look at the Remington 11-87 (12 gauge only. Hunting models have 3 inch chambers, target models do not.)\r\n\r\nIn over and unders, the Ruger Red Label is a good value, but a bit heavy for some tastes. It is available in 12 and 20. The Browning Citori is also an excellent choice and comes in a variety of configurations.\r\n\r\nAs to currently available side by sides, there are none either made or imported that are priced under $1000 to which I can give endorsement.', ''),

Two are in shooting clubs in Belgrade (one in "MUS" and one in "Partizan") and at least two are still at Zastava.\r\n\r\nTOP XX was never mass-produced by Zastava Arms. \r\n\r\n\r\n100,000+ rounds \r\n\r\nIn December of 2008, the TOP XX owned by the MUS Club in Belgrade had fired over 100,000 rounds of ammunition as recorded in the club''s official log. An article in January ''09 issue of "Kalibar" magazine reports that at the time of writing that TOP XX sample had some 102,000 rounds as recorded in club''s official log. For that occasion it was disassembled and some key parts were measured and compared to factory specs revealing that each of them was well within the factory specs. Accuracy tests had revealed no drop in accuracy, and this sample had accuracy on the par with newer, barely used CZ 99 and CZ 999 pistols. \r\n\r\nThe only recorded breakdown was that of the gun disassembly lever. \r\n\r\nThis milestone confirm not only the quality and durability of the TOP XX but also of the entire CZ 99 family of guns.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nStory of the CZ 99 and CZ 999 firearms would be incomplete wihtout mentioning two projects based on these two handguns: CZ 99 IPSC and TOP XX. \r\n\r\nOne - TOP XX - had been initiated by Zastava Arms. The other - CZ 99 IPSC - had been initiated by a company NB I.N.A.T. The founder of this company was Mr. Bozidar Blagojevic, better known as the father of CZ 99 pistol. After retiring from Zastava Arms in 1993, Bozidar Blagojevic had founded his own firearms company - NB I.N.A.T. located in the city of Kragujevac, Serbia - same city where Zastava Arms is located. \r\n\r\nBoth of these have only existed as prototypes, and both stem from either CZ 99 or CZ 999 and neither had ever moved to mass production stage. \r\n\r\n\r\nCZ 99 IPSC \r\n\r\nCZ 99 IPSC was a project initiated by a Shooting Club of Kraljevo to build a first Serbian IPSC handgun. Members of this club clearly defined detailed specifications as to what such pistol should be like. With that list of demands they met with Bozidar Blagojevic. \r\n\r\nNow, with the specifications, Bozidar Blagojevic and his assistants Mr. Zeljko Blagojevic and Mr. Nebojsa Kerkez set to create the handgun. \r\n\r\nThey started with the CZ 99 mainly because of the availability of this pistol on the market. The greatest challenge was to create the effective compensator. In testing some comps proved to be so effective that they locked up the whole slide and stopped it from cycling. After experimenting with various comps, they finally found one that was deemed to be perfect. It was discovered that the comp was so effective that the firearm seemed to kick back no more than weapons of the same caliber, but with fixed barrel (i.e. not utilizing the Browning locking principle). It should be noted that the gun can use a barrel without a compensator allowing it to be used in the standard class. \r\n\r\nTriggering principle of this gun is another perfection. In double action trigger travel is 2.5mm long and requires a force of a little over 8 lbs. (3700 grams). In single action trigger pull is approximately 3 lbs. (1400 grams) and a trigger travel is only 0.5mm. Compare this with the Heckler & Koch USP Expert whose single action trigger travel is 1.06mm. The trigger of CZ 99 IPSC also features a trigger stopper. \r\n \r\n\r\n  \r\nCZ 99 IPSC (up); CZ IPSC and CZ 99 (down)\r\n\r\n\r\nCZ 99 IPSC also features adjustable rear sight, dovetailed into the slide. This sight is adjustable 12 clicks vertically and 8 clicks horizontally. One click moves point of impact 6 millimeters (approx. 1/4 inches) at 25 meters (approx. 27 yards). \r\n\r\nPossibly the biggest modification was thinning of the CZ 99 frame and slide. As such, gun fits shooter''s hands better than CZ 99 does. \r\n\r\nOther modifications include the extended magazine release button, modified hammer and an added plastic buffer to protect the magazine when dropped onto the ground. \r\n\r\nEmpty, with a compensated barrel, this gun weighs 900 grams (compared with CZ 99''s 1080 grams) and is 224mm long (CZ 99 has a length of 190mm). Sight line is 165mm long. \r\n\r\nTests proved the gun was accurate way past expectations and featured good ergonomics. Based on experiences with the prototype, NB I.N.A.T. is reportedly capable of production runs on demand, and since the CZ 99 IPSC is based on police/military CZ 99 which is the most readily available handgun in Serbia, there is no doubt this gun is pretty affordable. \r\n\r\nIt is not known how many had been manufactured so far past the prototype stage. \r\n\r\n\r\nTOP XX (TOP 20) \r\n\r\nUnlike CZ 99 IPSC which is a private venture, TOP XX (TOP 20 - "XX" being a Roman numeral 20) is a Zastava Arms venture to create a gun for IPSC competitors. Even though it was produced by Zastava Arms, the actual father of this firearm is Mr. Ivan Zivkov - armorer of the SAJ (Specijalna Antiteroristicka Jedinica) - Special Antiterrorist Unit - an elite unit of the MUP (Ministarstvo Unutrasnjih Poslova - Ministry of Interior) of Serbia. \r\n\r\nAlso, unlike CZ 99 IPSC, TOP XX had been based on CZ 999 - an improved, second generation of CZ 99. It features a "bull barrel" which can be of three lengths: 108 mm, 125 mm and 134mm, with 125mm long barrel also having ability to mount a compensator. \r\n\r\nPrototypes were made in 9mm Parabellum, .40 S&W and .45ACP caliber, with universal magazines for both 9mm and .40 variants. \r\n\r\nTOP XX features a steel slide and aluminum alloy frame. \r\n \r\n\r\n  \r\nTOP XX prototypes at Belgrade Firearms Expo, February 2005\r\n\r\n\r\nIn all, 32 prototypes had been planned, and 32 frames made, but 4 frames had manufacturing defects and had been discarded, leaving 28 to be completed as prototypes of various size, barrel length, controls and caliber. \r\n\r\nTOP XX prototypes exist in 9mm Para, .40 S&W and .45ACP calibers, with standard and long slides, with normal and extended/threaded barrels - each being unique in some way. \r\n\r\nMost prototypes had been given away to people involved in bringing TOP XX to life. Two are in shooting clubs in Belgrade (one in "MUS" and one in "Partizan") and at least two are still at Zastava.\r\n\r\nTOP XX was never mass-produced by Zastava Arms. \r\n\r\n\r\n100,000+ rounds \r\n\r\nIn December of 2008, the TOP XX owned by the MUS Club in Belgrade had fired over 100,000 rounds of ammunition as recorded in the club''s official log. An article in January ''09 issue of "Kalibar" magazine reports that at the time of writing that TOP XX sample had some 102,000 rounds as recorded in club''s official log. For that occasion it was disassembled and some key parts were measured and compared to factory specs revealing that each of them was well within the factory specs. Accuracy tests had revealed no drop in accuracy, and this sample had accuracy on the par with newer, barely used CZ 99 and CZ 999 pistols. \r\n\r\nThe only recorded breakdown was that of the gun disassembly lever. \r\n\r\nThis milestone confirm not only the quality and durability of the TOP XX but also of the entire CZ 99 family of guns.', ''),

The .223 on the other hand is very common and ammunition is available in just about every sport shop in North America....

Sept 2nd woke up at 4 a.m, loaded the truck and head out to southern okanagan. upto this point the biggest deer i harvested was a small 3 pt whitey and this being my final year as a youth i really wanted to get something really nice, so i was ready to do some tough bush waking and hike every single hill until i had my buck. went and bought a gun sling, took out my old back pack, hiking boots and stick but little did i know what was in store for me. original plan was to hunt around m.u 8-14 but on our way there we received a few tips which led us to this place. 5 mins into the hunt we find a little spike whitey right in the middle of the FSR, but i was hoping for sumthing bigger and i had 2 full days to do it......wha.....wait there are three more bucks standing on top of the hill, a couple 2 pt and a beautiful velvet 3X3, Dad really wanted me to take the 3 pt but i was still gonna hold out for something better so i decided to shoot it with my camera instead. we decided to drive around and find a trail and hike. drove a km more in the bush and found this guy standing 100 yards away from the truck, a beauty 3x4 whitey exactly what i wanted. the adrenaline pumped in, i jumped out of the truck......Bang, first shot right in the lungs, the buck started running downhill...reload.......bang..... a .150 gr. bullet right through the neck.... the buck rolled into a ditch, had to use bit of muscle to pull it out. well it turned out to be a great start of the season, a 3X4 in 20 minutes into the hunt.

(372682, ' [B]256 Winchester Magnum[/B]\r\n\r\nThe 256 Winchester Magnum was announced in 1960 as a new handgun cartridge; however, the only handgun cartridge that chambered it was the single shot, enclosed-breech Ruger "Hawkeye" introduced late in 1961. The long awaited revolver never appeared, due apparently to problems related to the cylinder gap and the relatively high pressure developed by this cartridge, which was imposed insurmountable setback and extraction difficulties. The 256 Winchester Magnum is listed as a rifle cartridge because Marlin, for a few years, produced their Modesl-62 lever-action rifle in this caliber, Universal Firearms made the semi-auto "Ferret" on the M1 Carbine action and there have also been a number of custon single shot and repeating rifles made up for it. The Marlin rifle was available about a year after the Ruger "Hawkeye" and both were discontinued after a relatively short production life. The Thompson/Center Contender , a single shot pistol, is the only firearm currently available for this round. The cartridge is based on the necked-down 357 magnum revolver case.\r\nAs a rifle cartridge, the 256 is considerably more potent than the 25-20 and several jumps ahead of the 22 Hornet or the 218 Bee. The factory-loaded 60-grain bullet develops over 2760 fps muzzle velocity when fired from a 24-inch rifle barrel. This is equal to around 1015 foot pounds of muzzle energy, which is well above the Hornet or the Bee. The 256 magnum is really quite an effective varmint cartridge out to ranges of around 200 to 225 yards. It can be handloaded with heavier 75- or 85- grain bullets to velocities of about 2500 and 2230 respectively. Although a good varmint and small game caliber, it is not as adequate deer cartridge and most states won''t allow its use for this purpose.', ''),

(372721, 'Air Gun Ballistics I have not fired an air gun since the early 1950’s. At that time I had a.177 pistol and a rifle. Very recently I had an opportunity that I could not pass up. I made a trade and through that trade I acquired a RWS 34P in .177 caliber with a scope. The scope is mounted 1.5” above the bore of the rifle.\r\n\r\nI collected and computed ballistics data for the pellets of interested to me for use in the RWS 34P. I have compiled that in a table. The data is “dense” meaning lot of information is packed in the table.  Other member may be interested in this tabulation.\r\n\r\nHere is how to read the table. Let us take the second pellet listed in the table - the Crosman Premier Lite. The weight is listed as “8.0t” - meaning the actual weight was tested and found to be 8.0 grains. The nominal weight of this pellet is 7.9 grains.\r\n\r\nThis pellet delivers 889 feet per second velocity at the muzzle. The ballistic coefficient (BC) of this pellet is .015. BC is a measure of overcoming air resistance. The higher the BC, the more aerodynamic the pellet shape.\r\n\r\nThere are five columns for distance, namely 30, 35, 40, 45 and 50 yards. In the distance columns is: [-.0.5”]. I will shortly explain what this number means. For illustration purposes, we will look at the column for the distance of 40 yards. \r\n\r\nFirst line: [13/44/.6/27”] In this instance the rifle is zero set for 40 yards (the column heading). The pellet crosses the line of sight first at 13 yards an then again at 40 yards. At 44 yards it is 0.5” low. With the rifle sighted for 40 yards, the pellet attains maximum height of 0.6” above the line of line of sight at 27 yards.\r\n\r\nSecond line: [48/50.5] With the rifle sighted for 40 yards, at distance of 48 yards the pellet drops 1” below the line of sight. At 50.5 yards the pellet drops 1.5” below the line sight.\r\n\r\nThird line: [637/7.21] At distance of 40 yards the pellet velocity is 637 feet per second. At this distance the computed energy of the pellet is 7.21 foot-pounds.\r\n\r\nSome data in the table is highlighted in bold. These bold numbers represent ballistics that are superior compared to other pellets for the distances selected.', ''),

(372730, 'RWS 34P .177 Air Rifle Drop Table I prepared this pellet drop table for my RWS 34P air rifle. It may be of interest to other members. The pellet used is Crosman Premier Lite. The actual weight of the pellet was 8.0 grains. The advertised weight is 7.9 grains. The scope is 1.5” above the bore. The reticle adjustment for this scope is 4 clicks for one inch at 100 yards.\r\n\r\nHere is how use this table. Assume your rifle is zero set for 40 yards. Look at the column “40” and read the drop for distances given in the column on the left hand side. At 50 yards the pellet will be 1.45” below the line of sight. Now you wish to zero set the rifle to distance of 50 yards. Read the row on the left side “From 40Y” and across to column “50” down. This gives you “+12”.

(372826, ' [B]257 Roberts[/B]\r\n\r\nThe commercial version of the 257 Roberts was released by Remington in 1934, chambered in their Model 30 bolt-action rifle. It was quickly picked up by Winchester for their Model 54 and the later Model 70. The Remington 722 bolt-action and the 760 slide-action models were also available in 257-caliber. Most European-made sporting bolt-action rifles were at one time available for this cartridge. In recent years American manufacturers have discontinued it, although one run of the Ruger Model 77 bolt-action included some chambered for the 257. The original cartridge was designed by N. H. Roberts ( a well known experimenter and arms writer during the 1920s and 30s) and is based on the 7X57 Mauser necked-down. Remington changed the original shoulder angle from 15 to 20 degrees. Custom rifles in this caliber were made by the Niedner Rifle Co. as early as 1928. The Winchester Model 70 Featherweight and Ruger Model 77 bolt-action rifles have recently been available in 257-caliber.\r\n\r\nThe 257 Roberts has been referred to as the "most useful rifle cartridge ever developed", and that is not very far wrong. It is suitable for a wide range of hunting under a variety of conditions. As a long-range varmint cartridge, it is about as good as they come, being only slightly inferior to the newer 6mms. On deer, antelope, black bear, sheep or goat it is as good as any other cartridge available. Naturally, it its not as powerful as the 270 Winchester, 30-06 or many other cartridges, but it has ample power for the game mentioned at all practical ranges. The 257 is much under-loaded by the ammunition companies, and the factory ballistics do not indicate its full potential. With modern powders reloader can step it up safely in all bullet weights. With the 117- or 120- grain bot-tail bullet, at velocities of around 2800 fps, it moves up a notch in the big game class and such loads have been used very successfully on elk and caribou. It is at this end of the scale that it has an advantage over 6mms.', ''),

The dried up hard brown coconut\n\nFirstly, the target was the softer greener coconut. \n\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]3833[/ATTACH]\n\nNow with all things remaining constant below are the results for the hard coconut. It is evident that the JHP did little damage to the hard shell of the dry coconut proving the inability of JHPs to penetrate through solid surfaces.\n\nInitially I was confused as I was expecting the same result with the brown coconut but after a detailed analysis with AK47 bro I learned that the human body is more like the greener coconut containing soft skin, flesh, some amount of water, and bones- the mid hard outer surface and that was what the Hollow Points were designed to do. They basically are not designed to penetrate hard surfaces like FMJs can.\n\nOh by the way I recently bought a new professional camera and these pictures are the courtesy of my new cam.

In the vdo being refered to here (posted by @Kamran_uk75): [url]http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BxVud...eature=related[/url], it is evident from the abuses hurled at the poor dying animal that they are not shikaris but just shashka range shooters...hence the sarcasm.\r\n\r\n[QUOTE=francolino;211178]For that too, one has to have a knowledge of HUNTING & HUNTING RIFLES and not TARGET SHOOTING rifles. And [B][COLOR="blue"]for that too, one has to be used to field shooting instead of ranges, like in the vdo, the guy was shooting wild boar with an assault rifle [/COLOR][/B]which is fit for ranges or personal ''shashka'' only (tactical flashlight etc fitted).\r\n\r\nAnd ....By EASIER, it means RELATIVELY easier than animals in wild due to limited space. They are heard to be utilized mostly by shooters who are new to hunting or who mostly have done target & range shooting. [B]I have had enough chances at wildlife in the wild to not need those Private Range permits anyways[/B]. However, Chaudhry bro''s info about cholistan looks better if permits are reasonably priced. Try those by following the dept announcements.[/QUOTE]\r\n\r\nAs above stated, as most of MY shooting has been in the  actual wild, I have ZERO experience of farm shooting (just heard from a few hunters who shot some black buck and Maflon sheep from one in Peerowal etc); depends on the reserve how much challenging the shots are. The shots taken in desert belt at chinkaras with rifles in daytime (as Chaudhry states) must be tougher obviously while the pvt farm of Rana&#8217;s would be the easiest on other extreme. Not all of them would be Bakras thus, as I guess. So, It really depends too which farm ranges you have been to. Besideszzz&#8230;.. these farm ranges or Pirowal type ranges were not there before. Have sprung up in recent yrs. Will take some time to mature (with ifs and buts). Idea of PRIVATE RANGE/RANCH HUNTING is not bad per say. Will take some time to develop into proper form. Already heard, the authorities have and are collecting inputs from shikaris to make the idea successful and market-acceptable as per what client (hunters) wants. The wildlife authorities after getting inputs of bad flights of pheasants at Pirowal in 2009 and SOME big game hunting experiences, work is on its way. The concept, the idea, is not bad per say &#8230;.

The shots taken in desert belt at chinkaras with rifles in daytime (as Chaudhry states) must be tougher obviously while the pvt farm of Rana&#8217;s would be the easiest on other extreme. Not all of them would be Bakras thus, as I guess. So, It really depends too which farm ranges you have been to. Besideszzz&#8230;.. these farm ranges or Pirowal type ranges were not there before. Have sprung up in recent yrs. Will take some time to mature (with ifs and buts). Idea of PRIVATE RANGE/RANCH HUNTING is not bad per say. Will take some time to develop into proper form. Already heard, the authorities have and are collecting inputs from shikaris to make the idea successful and market-acceptable as per what client (hunters) wants. The wildlife authorities after getting inputs of bad flights of pheasants at Pirowal in 2009 and SOME big game hunting experiences, work is on its way.

They come over the lower Himalayas and also flying over Afghanistan from Africa and Siberia. \r\nThe Imperials are beautiful birds and in the sandy desert like areas of Kakar Khurasan North East of Quetta these appear in great numbers from end of November till February. The famous areas are Qila Saifullah, Toi Maidan and all of Khurasan including Zhob and comming upto Fort Abbas and Cholistan. These are very gregarious and very large flights are seen, they fly in waves changinging course and utter a typical call while flying.\r\nThey are very punctual and appear at the same time every day to drink on same  water holes in semi desert and desert areas.\r\nI used to hide in a blind and at exact same time these would appear each flight making two or three passes before going away due to shooting.\r\nA rather unsporting method is to chase a covey at fullspeed in a jeep when it takes off and then several guns shoot at the flight. I am not in favour of this as this is just blazing away with no particular bird in sights but every gun blazing in the brown which results in a lot of cripples ( some times shooters are also crippled for life due to overturning of Jeeps).\r\n I have known people to shoot several hundred Imperial Sand Grouse in this manner after shooting hundreds of cartridges. This practice is followed  by high ups in the civil and military who have the resources and leverage over the residents. Some of these shikaries are un able to walk a couple of hundred yards and have never hunted earlier.\r\nThe other species of sand grouse do not appear in such large numbers and some are spread only in the south of Pakistan and some in select areas of Punjab including the salt range.

It is also highly predictable that the new scope will be optically centered and hence there is no need to do any such exercise.\n\nOnly the rotating of scope on V blocks should be done to confirm whether the scope is optically centered or not.\n\nIf the scope has also been previously used and is not new, then the best way to achieve the optical center is the same as I have already mentioned.  Rotating of knobs to full extent for just a few seconds does not cause any harm to springs.\n\nFor your information I would mention here that Sportsmatch AOP 55 one piece fully adjustable mount is a great thing.  This is made in UK.  It is costly.

(373061, ' Palagems.com Ruby Buying Guide\r\nBy Richard W. Hughes\r\n\r\nIntroduction. The term ruby is reserved for corundums of a red color, with other colors called sapphire. In Asia, pink corundums are also considered rubies. Outside of Asia, such gems are generally termed pink sapphires.\r\n\r\nColor. For ruby, the intensity of the red color is the primary factor in determining value. The ideal stone displays an intense, rich crimson without being too light or too dark. Stones which are too dark and garnety in appearance, or too light in color, are less highly valued. The finest rubies display a color similar to that of a red traffic light.\r\n\r\nLighting. Rubies generally look best viewed with incandescent light or daylight (particularly around midday). Avoid fluorescent tubes, which have virtually no output in the red end of the spectrum, and so cause ruby to appear grayish.\r\n\r\nClarity. In terms of clarity, ruby tends to be less clean than sapphire. Buyers should look for stones which are eye-clean, i.e., with no inclusions visible to the unaided eye. In the case of some rubies, extremely fine silk throughout the stone can actually enhance the value. Many rubies also display a strong red fluorescence to daylight, and this adds measurably to the beauty of this gem.\r\nWhile a certain amount of silk is necessary to create the star effect in star ruby, too much silk desaturates the color, making it appear grayish. This is not desirable.\r\n\r\nCut. In the market, rubies are found in a variety of shapes and cutting styles. Ovals are cushions are the most common, but rounds are also seen, as are other shapes, such as the heart or emerald cut. Slight premiums are paid for round stones, while slight discounts apply for pears and marquises. Stones that are overly deep or shallow should generally be avoided.\r\nCabochon-cut rubies are also common. This cut is used for star stones, or those not clean enough to facet. The best cabochons are reasonably transparent, with nice smooth domes and good symmetry. Avoid stones with too much excess weight below the girdle, unless they are priced accordingly.\r\n\r\nPrices. With the exception of imperial jadeite and certain rare colors of diamond, ruby is the world‘s most expensive gem. But like all gem materials, low-quality (i.e., non-gem quality) pieces may be available for a few dollars per carat. Such stones are generally not clean enough to facet. The highest price per carat ever paid for a ruby was set on February 15, 2006, when Laurence Graff, a London jeweler, paid a record $425,000 per carat ($3.6 million) for an 8.62-ct. ruby, set in a Bulgari ring, at a Christie’s auction in St. Moritz.\r\nLess than a year before, on April 12, 2005, an 8.01-ct. faceted stone sold for $274,656 per carat ($2.2 million) at Christie’s New York. Previously the record for per-carat price was held by Alan Caplan’s Ruby (‘Mogok Ruby’), a 15.97-ct. faceted stone that sold (also to Graff) at Sotheby’s New York, Oct., 1988 for $3,630,000 ($227,301/ct).\r\n\r\nStone Sizes. Large rubies of quality are far more rare than large sapphires of equal quality. Indeed, any untreated ruby of quality above two carats is a rare stone; untreated rubies of fine quality above five carats are world-class pieces.\r\n\r\nPhenomena. Ruby may display asterism, the star effect. Fine star rubies display sharp six-rayed stars well-centered in the middle of the cabochon. All legs of the star should be intact and smooth. Just having a good star does not make a stone valuable. The best pieces have sharp stars against an intense crimson body color. Lesser stones may have sharp stars, but the body color is too light or grayish. On occasion, 12-rayed star sapphires are found. Inexpensive star rubies come mainly from India.', ''),
(373062, 'How to pattern your shotgun How To Pattern\n\nI like to use paper that measures 4 feet square. Paper this size may be hard to find locally.\n\nIf it is not available try taping several sheets of butcher paper together. The reason for the large paper is that if your gun does not shoot to the point of aim part of your pattern could be off of the target with a small paper and you could confuse this with a bad pattern. If it helps you, mark the target center for use as an aiming point. I prefer to use a rest when shooting. If you do make sure the gun is not touching any hard object. The reason for using a rest is that it helps remove some of the variables. From the correct distance shoot at the center of the target.  I would do this a minimum of  5 times on different targets with each shell or choke that is being tested. You will need to draw a 30-inch circle around the most dense portion of the pattern on each target. Count the pellets inside of the circle. Divide this number by the total number of shot contained in the shell and you will have your percentage. Average your percentage by the total number of shots fired with the particular shell or choke to obtain your overall average. Sounds like a royal pain doesn&#8217;t it? It is, but there are no short cuts if you really want to know what your shotgun is doing.\n\nAfter you have finished look carefully at each pattern for holes that are big enough to let your intended target slip through. You want a dense enough pattern to ensure multiple hits.\n\n\n\n\nits is copy from the net', ''),

(373214, ' Salam All,\nBro - I asked you to please take the barrel OUT of the gun so you can take some proper photos - NOT photos of the chamber at an angle, I believe it would have added no more than 5 minutes of your time to do this I wanted to check the inside of the chamber which lots of times looks smooth to the novice.  So you can either do that and probably have a gun that feeds like butter or just go ahead and change it if you can/want.  No amount of lube or dry firing will cure this one cannot deburr metal by way of brass!  Furthermore one also cannot use the same material in tight tolerances as that causes galling of metals soooooo think about what I am asking for and kindly spend the time as I am to help you out and try what I need to see and then recommend to you.  \nThus far from what I can already see is that though your feed ramp seems to be ok - you chamber has a lots of machining marks and it should be smoothly polished inside, what happens is this, a reamer is used to make chambers.... and well like other things in life a reamer also has its own life, the more worn it gets, the more tighter the chamber gets, looks can be deceiving as a chamber size can be off by .001mm (like a machining mark), and its enough to cause certain ammo not to feed reliably.  This problem is very easily fixed and IS done on many high end guns for flawless feeding with all kinds of ammo.\nTake a drill gun, put a smooth straight rod about 4mm dia., it should have a cut on top end, on this top end, attach a nice piece of pure cotton cloth rotated on the tip enough to where when you stick it in the chamber the cloth fills the chamber snugly, run the drill, you will see the high polish/deburring it does.\nTry this and it will work.\nThanks.', ''),

(373264, ' Was searching the net for info on ballistics and found below, its an interesting read with historical references to ballistics & how a modern day bullet & barrel evolved.\n   \n   \n  [CENTER][CENTER][U][B]Factors Affecting Flight[/B][/U][/CENTER][/CENTER]\n    [CENTER][CENTER]by Wayne van Zwoll,[/CENTER][/CENTER]\n   \n  A bullet must negotiate turbulent seas before it strikes an elk. Only you can steer it. \n    \nBefore turning inside out while killing an elk, a bullet endures pretty rough treatment—mainly from hot, high-pressure powder gas and the searing press of rifling. But conditions have their way with bullets too. Wind, gravity, temperature, air density, humidity and shot angle don’t deform the bullet, but they certainly influence its flight path.\n  So does snow. The elk were lining out across a broad white valley below when my partner reached the brow of the hill. He flopped prone, breathing heavily after the fast climb, ankle-deep. “How far?”\n  I guessed it, now, at nearly 300. The bulls at the end of the column twined in and out, giving the hunter little opportunity. But now one swung to the side and stopped. The crack of the rifle died suddenly against December’s powder. The elk—all of them—trotted off into the distance.\n  Our guide spared me the duty of calling a miss. Then we saw it: a long, pencil-thin gash in the soft snow in front of the rifle. “You had a clear line of sight, but the bullet got caught,” I observed. \n  “You think that snow would turn a bullet?”\n  I allowed that I thought so. Bullets are easily turned. \nCompared to spears and arrows, bullets fly very fast. The first rifleman probably thought they also flew in a straight line. In 1537 Trataglia, an Italian scientist, described the bullet’s path as an arc. Trataglia determined that a launch angle of 45 degrees would give any bullet its greatest range. While his conclusion isn’t true for modern bullets, it was valid for low-velocity projectiles, which are affected more by gravity than by air resistance. \n  A century after Trataglia, Galileo dropped cannonballs from the Leaning Tower of Pisa and wrote that because gravity’s acceleration appeared constant, trajectories must be parabolic. He didn’t expound on drag (negligible on cannonballs dropped to earth). Another century would pass before anyone advanced the science of ballistics beyond Galileo’s work.\n  Meanwhile, Isaac Newton investigated laws of mechanics crucial to the understanding of ballistics. Newton’s universal law of gravitation held that the tug of gravity varies with altitude. He demonstrated that drag increases with the density of air and the cross-sectional area of a projectile. He also acknowledged the disproportionate effect of velocity on drag. Because he had no way to measure the speed of musket balls, he couldn’t know that drag increases dramatically when projectiles near the speed of sound (1,120 fps). \n  Around 1740, Englishman Benjamin Robins invented the ballistic pendulum. The pendulum had a heavy wooden bob of known weight, hung vertically. Robins weighed a bullet to be fired then shot it into the pendulum. By measuring the bob’s swing, he calculated impact velocity, because speed (with mass) is a component of momentum. People then could hardly believe musket balls flew as fast as his device showed: to 1,700 fps! Reduced readings at long range indicated air resistance to be 85 times as strong as the force of gravity! Incredible. But, of course, true.\n  We no longer measure velocity with pendulums, but with electric eyes that register the passage of a bullet’s shadow as the bullet travels a known distance. My friend Dr. Ken Oehler performed an enormous service for shooters by designing the first chronographs for consumer use. \n  The idea of a “standard bullet” that could be used to develop benchmark values for drag and other ballistic variables came to experimenters in the mid-19th century. The concept of ballistic coefficient followed. Commonly expressed as “C,” ballistic coefficient defines bullet flight in the equation C = drag deceleration of the standard bullet / drag deceleration of the actual bullet. Its mathematical expression employs sectional density, velocity and coefficient of form. Ballistic coefficients are useful in comparing flight characteristics of bullets only when those bullets are driven at the same speed. But few shooters have facilities for finding C in firing tests. A simple formula offers an alternative: C=w/id2, where “w” is the bullet weight in pounds, “d” is bullet diameter in inches and “I” is the form factor (a numerical expression of the bullet’s shape). The higher the ballistic coefficient, the flatter a bullet will fly and the better it will conserve speed and energy. The standard bullet has a C of 1.000. Most hunting bullets have Cs of .200 to .400.\n  Enough math. For a better understanding of bullet flight, you’ll crunch more numbers. But to shoot well at distance, you’ll also need a feel for outside conditions that affect flight. Here’s a short list.\n  For any given cartridge, bullet velocity depends on powder type and charge and bullet weight; it’s influenced by chamber and barrel dimensions, throat profile and length, and bore finish. A tight chamber reduces the energy lost to case expansion. So does a tight throat. A long throat permits shallow seating to increase powder space. But the farther a bullet moves before engaging the lands, the more likely a drop in pressure from gas that finds its way around the bullet. \n  Some barrels are “faster” than others, generally because their bore diameters are smaller. A clean barrel typically shoots to a different point of aim than one that’s fouled and often delivers higher or lower bullet speed than with subsequent rounds. Barrel length influences velocity because the bullet’s exit cuts short the pressure curve responsible for the bullet’s launch. \n  Components matter. Magnum primers, for instance, usually boost pressure. Similar change occurs with smaller powder chambers (thicker case walls or webs). Fast-burning powders abbreviate the pressure curve. Bullets with long shanks or hard or “sticky” jackets can elevate pressure. Expect velocity to follow pressure, though not at the same rate of increase.\n  The high exit speed of modern big-game rounds boosts the influence of drag on bullet flight. The sum of drag forces depends on a bullet’s weight and profile too, plus axial spin and atmospheric conditions. Add jacket texture at long range, because skin friction is a big component of drag. Pressure drag occurs at the bullet’s nose. A long ogive (conical section between bullet tip and shank) trims pressure drag—as does supersonic speed (greater than Mach 1.2). Subsonic travel (less than Mach 0.8) increases pressure drag. A supersonic bullet, however, also produces wave drag. Boat-tails or tapered bullet heels mitigate base drag, but you’ll notice that effect only beyond 300 yards or so.\n  Yaw sets up drag too. A bullet is in some state of yaw whenever its axis does not coincide exactly with its direction of travel. Precession, or the rotation of the bullet’s nose about its axis, adds to drag. Any tipping of the bullet—from a damaged muzzle, a nicked bullet base or lack of jacket concentricity—can put the nose into its own orbit around the bullet’s axis. Like a top that “goes to sleep” after you give it a spin, the bullet may rotate with less precession after covering some distance. That is why you may get smaller groups (in minutes of angle) at long range. Extreme yaw can cause the bullet to tumble. Axial spin fights yaw but must be matched to the bullet’s weight, length and speed. Rifling twist too \nslow to stabilize the bullet can result in “keyholing” at the target. Excessive spin increases yaw angle.\n  Air resistance has a huge effect on bullet flight. Poke your head out the window of an automobile cruising at 60 mph, and you’ll identify with a bullet moving 88 feet per second. That’s glacial. Multiply the tug of that wind by 35, and you have the drag on a .300 Winchester Magnum bullet as it leaves the muzzle. That bullet must penetrate the atmosphere as it penetrates an elk. The air offers less resistance, but over a much longer period. The influence of other environmental factors—wind, humidity, temperature—are also  magnified by the bullet’s speed and time in \nflight. Watch the BB from an air gun or the track of a rimfire bullet through a high-power scope, and you’ll see that neither path is straight! Aerial combat footage from World War II shows drift in the tracer bullets of machine guns. \n  As drag slows a bullet, gravity pulls it earthward. Every bullet falls at an accelerating rate of 32.16 feet per second after leaving the muzzle. One reason few bullets drop 32 feet is that they don’t stay aloft for a full second. Another is that we usually calculate drop not from bore-line but from sight-line, manipulated to intersect the bullet’s path at two points. The farthest is the zero range. \n  Unlike gravity, wind does not displace a bullet with accelerating force. Neither is it constant with regard to speed or direction. You can predict how far gravity will tug a bullet between 300 and 350 yards; but you cannot accurately predict displacement from wind because you cannot accurately gauge the wind over that segment of flight. Wind shifts at the muzzle have greater effect than do equivalent changes far off. But the bullet is more easily moved the farther it flies because there’s increasing time (per unit of distance traveled) for the wind to impose its will.\n  Wind direction, relative to the bullet path, matters as much as wind speed. “Full-value” wind, from 3 or 9 o’clock, has the greatest influence. Wind coming at you or from behind has the least effect. (A bullet clocking 3,000 fps generates its own headwind, a 2,000-mph gale—so a 20-mph breeze on nose or tail has negligible effect.) Wind from the right will give bullets from right-twist rifling a little lift as it moves point of impact to the left. Wind from the left depresses point of impact. You can shoot tight groups in wind—as long as it is steady. You can shoot accurately in wind—if you dope it accurately. It’s best to zero on a still day. That way, you can shade for wind effect afield. If you zero in wind, the lack of wind will displace your shot as surely as if it were blown off course. Beware the effect of topographic features on air movement. A mountain can bend the wind. Passes and canyons accelerate it. \n  How much drift? A useful rule of thumb is to assume an inch of drift for a 10-mph full-value wind at 100 yards, then double that at 200. Triple the 200 drift at 300, double the 300 drift at 400. Velocity and C value affect how closely a bullet will hew to this rule. Here’s how it applies to a 180-grain .30-06 bullet where AD is actual drift in inches and ROT is rule of thumb drift in inches.   \n  When doping wind, mind the mirage visible near the ground on warm days. Mirage boils straight up when there’s no wind, flattens during a pick-up. I found after many painful lessons in smallbore matches that boiling mirage can also signal a shift in wind, especially if it follows strong prevailing breeze. Shooting during a let-off, you run the risk of a pick-up just as you fire. \n  To shoot well in wind, you must practice in wind. Shoot at targets you can read (paper bulls-eyes). Match observations of wind speed (grasses bending, leaves ruffling, the press of air on your cheek) with bullet displacement. Consult a pocket anemometer like Kestrel’s to assign numbers. Complement practice with computer time using ballistics programs like Infinity from Sierra Bullets. \n  Such programs can also tell you how conditions you might not get during practice will affect your shots afield. Elevation, for example. The air in Wyoming elk country may be considerably thinner than at the rifle range outside Miami. Changes in trajectory at normal yardage are negligible, especially when your target is the size of an elk’s forward ribs. A 180-grain .30-06 bullet will strike only about 3 inches higher at 300 yards when fired at 10,000 feet after you zero the rifle at sea level. Air temperature also figures into the mix. Cold air is denser. So shooting at elk during November in the Rockies after prepping in Florida, you may automatically counter the effect of elevation. Figure no more than half a minute of elevation for a 100-degree change in temperature. Expect a velocity change of 3 fps for each degree F. Sierra’s software shows point of impact shift for a 140-grain Ballistic Tip bullet from a 7mm Remington Magnum: Started at 3,150 fps, that bullet fired in 59-degree air should land 16.9 inches low at 400 yards with a 200-yard zero. In 70-degree air, the bullet hits 16.8 inches low. You’d have to travel from the Carribean to the Arctic to notice any move in bullet impact caused by changes in air temperature, and then only at extreme range. Humidity likewise affects bullet arc to such a minor degree that you’ll be hard-pressed to notice it at normal ranges.\n  The temperature of the powder charge does matter. A hot day boosts temperature, which elevates higher pressure and velocity.  A cartridge kept in a warm pocket and fired soon after loading on a cold morning will behave differently than \none carried in a rifle all day in sub-zero temperature. Cartridges on a hot dashboard can get much warmer than the rifle, building higher pressures. Some powders are more temperature-sensitive than others. One selling point of the new Ruger Compact Magnum rounds developed by Hornady is their uniform behavior over a range of temperatures. Use your freezer to determine how cold will affect your ammunition.\n  Shot angle affects point of impact—noticeably at steep vertical angles and long range. Gravity has the greatest influence on bullet flight when the bullet is launched horizontally. Shooting straight down or straight up, you’re shooting into or against gravity, so it does not bend the bullet’s path. At angles between vertical and horizontal, you get something between zero and maximum effect from gravity. You can adjust appropriately by figuring the horizontal distance to your target, and holding for that. For example, if an elk is roughly 300 yards off, above you at a steep 45-degree angle, you’ll hold for 200 yards. That’s very close to the horizontal component of the yardage. A hold for 300 yards will cause the bullet to hit high. Inside a 200-yard zero, you can usually ignore shot angle.\n  At the last Elk Foundation Elk Camp in Reno, a fellow asked me how far he could shoot his .300 Magnum and kill an elk. I had to beg ignorance. “I’ve no idea how far you can shoot accurately.” Well, he pressed, how far is the .300 Winchester Magnum lethal? I shrugged. “As far as the remaining speed is sufficient to open an expanding bullet.” He walked away, apparently satisfied I knew nothing.\n  The lethal range of a cartridge has nothing to do with how far you can effectively kill elk, because conditions always undermine accuracy before the bullet slows to the point of terminal failure. I can say that with some certainty because, besides those conditions already covered here, there’s the human variable. It’s nonsense to focus on the effect of temperature or air density when the area scribed by a wandering reticle is bigger than the vitals of your target. From hunting positions, most riflemen are hard-pressed to shoot inside 3 minutes of angle consistently. Only gravity and wind move your bullet that much over normal distances. \n  Remember that a twitch of the rifle muzzle of only 1/50 inch displaces your bullet 6 inches at 200 yards. In the final sift, the condition to mind the most is the state of your marksmanship!\n  \n\nCopied from: [url]http://www.rmef.org/Hunting/RifleCart/Rifles/Flight.htm[/url]', ''),

(373341, ' Article for newbies........\n\n[B][COLOR="red"]Regular Bullet vs Hollow-Point Bullet\n[/COLOR][/B]\nAside from caliber, there is also other ways that bullets differ from each other. A major classification is whether it is a regular or a hollow-point bullet. The main difference between the two is the presence of a cavity. Whereas a regular bullet is a smooth, dome-like shape, a hollow-point bullet has a hole at the top that varies in size.\n\nThe purpose of the hole in a hollow-point bullet is to allow it to expand upon impact. Once a hollow-point bullet impacts, the force on the front bullet forces the soft lead to buckle and expand outwards. Although regular bullets also experience expansion when it hits a solid object, it is far less likely to do so when hitting soft targets like flesh.\n\nExpansion is desirable in bullets for a variety of reasons. The first is its ability to inflict a lot more damage to the target compared to regular bullets. An expanding bullet would expend all its energy on the target, thereby applying more force and has more stopping power. The second is its ability to tear more tissue as it progresses through the body of the target not to mention that the embedded bullet would be more deadly to the target if not extracted swiftly and properly by a trained medical professional.\n\nRegular bullets, especially those that travel at a very high speed, tend to go through targets. In cases where the target is hiding behind something that is not too strong, like wood or a few layers of thin metal, a regular bullet is more likely to pass through the barrier and hit the target with enough force to still be effective. The expansion of hollow-point bullets makes it less likely to do so. Despite that, it still has advantages. Hollow-point bullets are good for situations where civilians are involved. Since the bullet wouldn&#8217;t go through the target, there is a reduced likelihood of collateral damage because of civilians being right behind the target.\n\n\n \nRegular and hollow-point bullets have their own specific uses. Knowing which one fits your needs is the key in maximizing the power of your firearm.\n\nSummary:\n\n1.Regular bullets are solid while hollow-point bullets have a cavity in the middle.\n2.Hollow-point bullets are meant to expand while regular bullets are not.\n3.Hollow-point bullets can do more damage than regular bullets.\n4.Hollow-point bullets are less likely to go through a target than regular bullets.', ''),

(373446, 'Most important information regarding Diana airguns (Please do read) 1.  Diana started outsourcing barrels for 34 and 350 magnums during last few years.  All those guns having 12 Land barrels which are outsourced from other countries like China.  Diana factory makes only 8 Land barrels.\r\n\r\nYou can check your gun, whether its barrel is made by Diana or by an other manufacture.\r\n\r\n2.  Diana left the practice of getting outsourced barrel in 2010.\r\n\r\n3.  Diana scopes are not made in Germany.  These scope are made under licence of Diana company.  These are made in some other country like China but with very good quality control. These scope meets the purpose very well.\r\n\r\n4.  Diana scopes have the guarantee of only 2 years.\r\n\r\n5.  With magnum guns and fixed barrel guns, Diana give guarantee only if Dampa mount is used.\r\n\r\n6.  Almost all new Diana airguns come dry from the factory.\r\n\r\n7.  All new Diana guns which come dry from the factory change their behavior positively if properly greased and lubed inside the guns.  Be careful as improper greasing can destroy the internals of the gun.\r\n\r\n8.  Stock screws must be checked at some reasonable intervals as if these are loose, the accuracy may not be guaranteed.\r\n\r\n9.  T06 triggers may be adjusted to one''s like.  Only the 2nd screw in the trigger blade is suggested to be very slightly adjusted.\r\n\r\n10.  In Diana 54 airking, the sledge (anti recoil system) can be adjusted.  The best adjustment is one where the action remains locked upwards till the gun is given a slight jerk. With a slight jerk, the action should come backwards.\r\n\r\n11.  The best pellet weight is between 13 Gr. and 16 Gr.\r\n\r\n12.  It is difficult to shoot with magnum airguns accurately (except 54) unless and until a proper lube tune is made.\r\n\r\n13.  48, 52 and 54 models'' springs have relatively short life.  The spring break after approximately 6000 pellets fired.\r\n\r\n14.  There are even better springs available in the USA market\r\n\r\n15.  The best Tuning kit (Spring+ Guides) is made by JM Maccari which costs around 80$.  This spring and guide makes Diana 54 and any other Diana gun much more smooth and easy to shoot.  Also these springs do not break.\r\n\r\n16.  For airguns, only airgun rated scopes should be used.\r\n\r\n17.  Hawke scope are also considered good for airguns.  AGS Cobalt from Webley is also a good option.\r\n\r\n18.  Always keep your scope optically centered to achieve best results and to enhance the scope life.\r\n\r\n19.  Never use mineral based oils or mineral based grease in internals of airguns\r\n\r\n20.  Peep sight is one of the best options if you want some other means (other than scope and open sight) to shoot accurately.\r\n\r\n21.  Never fire an airgun without a pellet.\r\n\r\n22. If a magnum airgun is fired without a pellet,  the gun may be ruined and may never be repaired.\r\n\r\n23.  For short range, match type Wad cutter  pellets work fine.  For long range Dome shape is good for hunting.\r\n\r\n24.  Crosman Premier is one of the best low cost pellets\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\n\r\nUmair Bhaur', ''),

(373457, 'Diana 460 is much superior to 350 Dear Sir,\r\n\r\nI have used both the guns.  I have also studied a lot on both the guns.  I can suggest you with quite authority that 460 is better.  The recoil is less than 350.  The power is more than 54. Its very stable. Very accurate.  For scopes, it gives less harm.\r\n\r\n350 can be tuned into a smooth gun but 460 is smooth out of the box and with some tuning the smoothness can be improved.\r\n\r\nIts not recoil less like 54 and 56 but it is not difficult to shoot accurately with this gun. The weight is much less than 350, hence for hunting, it is a good gun.\r\n\r\nI would say if you have to chose between 350 and 460,  460 is the clean winner.\r\n\r\nIf you have to choose between 460 and 54 then you have to consider the weight of 54 and its recoil less system. Its your choice.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\n\r\nUmair', ''),

Similar exercise was  repeated in Karachi and Quetta on 25th November 2008 and 28th  November 2008 respectively. In these seminars traders, importers and  exporters participated.

If you want to do it cheaper without having to go to all that trouble, but a snap cap and pull the trigger away. The 709 has a double strike capability with its firing pin so once the snap cap is in the chamber you dont have to operate the slide each time you fire.

It is a snub nose 2incher, Very accurate despite its small barrel size and in my opinion, better than S&W equivalents as it carries 7 rounds of .357 mag in its cylinder rather than the standard 5 offered.  It also comes with stock Taurus rubber grips which are GREAT for absorbing some recoil. Another great thing about .357 cal revolvers is that you can keep the high powered rounds for Self Defence (SD), however, for range practice you can use the .38 special round  which is MUCH milder on the hand.  Price for .357 round from armscor is around Rs. 100- Rs. 120/ bullet for .357  in 159 grn JHP in Karachi last time i checked in Saddar/ lucky star area but asking price would be higher so you need to negotiate.   The 617 is available for around Rs. 75k to Rs. 90k for where you look in SS (Stainless steel) , it is also available in light weight Titanium (Ti) with ported barrels which is more expensive Rs. 90k to 100k. I''d personally stick with the SS version as it is heavier and hence slightly less recoil. If you are carrying it a lot as CC (Concealed carry) you might opt for the Ti version, however, it would kick more due to its lighter weight as well as produce a larger muzzle blast on top of the barrel (due to ports) which might be a bad thing if you shoot at night. However, the muzzle rise would be lesser compared to the SS version.   \nOne last thing, due to the small barrel and larger cartridge with slower burning powder, the muzzle blast on both versions is HUGE and the BANG louder. If you shoot it in an enclosed space (such as a vehicle), be prepared for extended ringing in the head and possible damage to the ear drum ;) . It WOULD stop any attacker stone cold in one shot though w/ JHP (jacketed hollow points). Never use FMJ (Full metal jacket) for Self defence (SD) in this round as it would go through like butter (over penetration) w/out much immediate stopping power (unless it hits bone). Keep in mind that while 2 incher snubbies are great SD weapons, they are difficult to master in terms of aiming with a long double action pull of the trigger and also shorter barrel and are usually used for close proximity  point-and-shoot type of encounters.', ''),

In a vehicle defense situation, stopping power is  more important than killing power. Any  round could kill including a .22 wherein the subject shot would die of  bleeding if not treated. but immediate stopping power comes only with  larger rounds .357 magnum, .45 , 10 mm , .40 and 9mm (hot loaded/  premium jhp bullets) being the minimum.  Even 9mm''s used by U.S.  law  enforcement world wide has  questionable IMMEDIATE stopping power, unless it is used with a hot load  which is +p+ rated (such as the Federal Tactical Hydra-shock +p+) .    Not  a single law enforcement  agency in the world uses .22,  .32 anymore due to lack of immediate  stopping power. Even 9mm is questionable if it is not with a high  quality JHP which is a +p+ load.   search any U.S. law enforcement  discussion and more or less the conclusion is the same as above.  More  rounds do not matter in up close and personal gun fights as it is the  first 1-3 rounds that decide the outcome.', ''),

(374641, 'Review: Brno .22 LR Salams, I had this rifle for a few years now but never got around to shooting it much. Bought it, scoped it, fired a few casual rounds and stored it. Came across it again and thought it''d be a nice break from handgun shooting.\n\nAt first a little intro, most of the Brno .22 LR guns were imported in the late 80''s and early 90''s. Without going into long details CZ and Brno are more or less the same. \n\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]4012[/ATTACH][ATTACH=CONFIG]4016[/ATTACH][ATTACH=CONFIG]4017[/ATTACH][ATTACH=CONFIG]4013[/ATTACH][ATTACH=CONFIG]4014[/ATTACH][ATTACH=CONFIG]4015[/ATTACH][ATTACH=CONFIG]4011[/ATTACH]\n\nHolding the rifle, I was quite impressed with the weight, it''s very manageable and not heavy at all. Any 14 year old could carry it around all day long. The wood stock has fantastic finishing for a sub Rs. 50,000 rifle. It comes with a single 5 shot magazine although a 6th round can be loaded manually in the chamber. The bolt action is remarkably smooth and the trigger has a little creep but it''s very predictable and pull is excellent. The trigger pull at 4.5 pounds won''t disappoint or spoil your shot. \n\nMy gun is a 1989 year of manufacture. It literally shot it''s first round 20 years after it was built and the out of box accuracy is astonishing! Since I bought it to be a ''fun gun'' and a plinker rather than anything else I put a cheapo Rs. 8,000 Bushnell Sportsman Scope on it.  \n\nI expected zeroing the scope to be a pain but it was a most entertaining experience. A few hours and 200 rounds later, I was quite happy with the results.', ''),

I thought I would shoot a few hundred rounds though it, zero the gun, clean it and back into the closet it goes but the results it started giving me me it take it to the range twice more.\n\nDay 3 and about 500 rounds shot total in three days. Targets are all at 50 Meters. On both targets 35 rounds each were fired.\n\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]4019[/ATTACH][ATTACH=CONFIG]4018[/ATTACH][ATTACH=CONFIG]4022[/ATTACH]\n\n\nUsually when you shoot targets like the ones above there is almost always no one there to witness. Luckily it was a Sunday and atleast ten friends were present ;)\n\nI was completely astonished ! One inch groups at 50 Meters is phenomenal accuracy. I''m sure if we had a rifle rest this gun is fully capable of giving half inch groups at 50 metes. \n\nSince this is known more as a hunting gun rather than a target shooting gun (I wonder why) I wanted to see what kind of performance a .22 LR hollow point would give at 50 M. I put a glass bottle of Sprite below my target and shot at it, it exploded ! Did not break, did not shatter, it EXPLODED! \n\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]4020[/ATTACH]\n\nI would not like to be on the receiving end of a .22 hollow point. We tried to make video to share with you guys but it turned out very hazy. Any Rabbit/Hare sized game within 100 Meters is very easy with this gun. It is indeed one of the most value for money guns one can buy. \n\n[B]Verdict:[/B] If you find the Brno .22 anywhere, pick it up instantly.

(374651, ' [QUOTE=S.M.R;213233]I tend to bit disagree with you. Majority of people go for pistol range and trap/skeet shooting. Pistol range is not that different of two. In rangers SR, an additional facility of ''target vision'' is installed. But if you compare the facilities of both ranges keeping in view the amount to be paid, Karsaz range is much better and economical.\n[/QUOTE]\n I respect your opinion. I don''t like Karsaz range cos it is being run unprofessionally. \nI''ll state the reasons. This is what I have experienced. Others experience may vary.\n1. I don''t get their bills. Each time I have to call up and inquire.\n2. They don''t inform if the range is closed for members. Many a times I couldn''t use the range cos of a flimsy reason that the guests of a high ranking official are to visit. Many a times, I was refused entry cos Navy team was practicing in members time and they could not be disturbed. \n3. Without intimation they close the range for weeks due to security concerns. Never declare when the the restriction is lifted.\n4. One fine day, when I was at range with guests, I was informed that guests are no more welcome. Even on insistence, I was not give copy of this policy matter to raise the issue with higher authorities.\n5. Many a times, I saw guests with members. Upon inquiry I was told they are exceptions and I can''t enjoy that privilege. \n6. Many a members are seen flouting range safety and dress rules with impunity with no interference from range master. Many an accidental discharges have occurred without the offender being held accountable.\n7. Range is always filthy. Please visit 50m range for confirmation. 25m doesn''t fare well either. Same goes for washrooms. \n8. Staff keeps you waiting for at least 10 min even after prior calls of arrival.\n9. They are always short of targets and target stands.\nTo be continued...........', ''),

(374792, ' [B][FONT=Arial][SIZE=2][COLOR=#ffffff]The News: Dated 4 September, 2011[/COLOR][/SIZE][/FONT][/B] rumors about data sharing of nadra.\nbelow statement clears the original picture\n       [COLOR=#000000][FONT=Times New Roman][COLOR=black][COLOR=black][COLOR=black][FONT=Times New Roman][FONT=Times New Roman][FONT=Times New Roman]The National Database and Registration Authority (NADRA) on Saturday vehemently denied its massive database of Pakistani citizens could be replicated or shared with any country or entity on the wish of an individual.\n\nReacting angrily to the media reports, attributed to the WikiLeaks, that Interior Minister Rehman Malik had offered to share all the Nadra citizens’ record with the United States in 2009, the authority’s Deputy Chairman Tariq Malik asserted that this could not be done on the wish of an individual.\n\n“The NADRA security control mechanisms do not permit an individual, notwithstanding his authority or position, to compromise its theft or to give consent to share with data replication,” he made it clear, when The News approached him for his comment on the WikiLeaks.\n\nWikiLeaks said that welcoming US aid, the interior minister had offered to share the NADRA database of Pakistani citizens with it and proposed making public a model of the mutual agreement to ‘appease’ the people of Pakistan.\n\nTariq Malik pointed out that the database belonged to the people of Pakistan, who owned it, and hence it was a collective bearing agreement with the people. “We guard that privacy with passion and would not like anybody to even entertain that thought of sharing it,” he contended. \n\nReferring to the media reports, he cautioned that such kind of revelations and statements could severely affect the international business that NADRA was undertaking and strengthen its competitors’ hands. \n\nHe noted that even India was in the process of preparing its own database, which NADRA had developed and it was a priceless national asset. However, the neighbouring country was nowhere near what the authority had already evolved and developed. It may be noted that NADRA has left behind the US-owned ‘Pisces’ system (international passenger holder system), having replaced it with a more robust integrated border management system powered by it.\n\nTo a question, Tariq Malik said NADRA occupied more space in the national interests instead of giving in to any demand of sharing database. He said NADRA had managed to restore the citizens’ trust on the state with its sheer hard work, dedication and commitment. In this connection, the NADRA deputy chairman referred to BISP programme, Watan cards and machine-readable passports and social security-related matters, which became possible only because of its database. \n\nHe said that Nadra had already applied the integrated border management system (IBMS) at the Islamabad International Airport and would shortly be doing so at Peshawar and Karachi airports.\n\nInterior Minister Rehman Malik was not available for comment but sources close to him contended that Malik privately said NADRA itself had offered to share all the citizens’ record with the United States and denied making any offer by him to the US in this regard. But this could not be confirmed from him.\n[/FONT][FONT=Times New Roman]\n[/FONT]\n[/FONT][/FONT][/COLOR][/COLOR][/COLOR][/FONT][/COLOR]', ''),

The temperaturestrip and instructions determine the required dose. This method works by dissolving small amounts of iodine in the water.

Because of this, and the makeup of the solution you usually end up consuming far more iodine than is really necessary. For a 2% solution use 5 drops per litre of water. Leave to stand for 15 minutes before drinking.

[/B]\n Any way i am not completely sure but the treatment you are mentioning has been implemented by the Brazilians and gave very successful  results . here is a abstract from a study base on there use in Brazil ;\n\n&#8220;Homeopathy has contributed throughout history to the control and eradication of epidemic diseases. Facing the challenge of controlling an outbreak of dengue, the Secretary of Health of the county of Macaé, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, in early 2007 carried out a &#8220;Homeopathy Campaign against Dengue&#8221;. 156,000 doses of homeopathic remedy were freely distributed in April and May 2007 to asymptomatic patients and 129 doses to symptomatic patients treated in outpatient clinics, according to the notion of &#8220;epidemic genus&#8221;. The remedy used was a homeopathic complex against dengue containing Phosphorus 30cH, Crotalus horridus 30cH and Eupatorium perfoliatum 30cH. The incidence of the disease in the first three months of 2008 fell 93% by comparison to the corresponding period in 2007, whereas in the rest of the State of Rio de Janeiro there was an increase of 128%. While confounding factors were not controlled for, these results suggest that homeopathy may be an effective adjunct in Dengue outbreak prevention.&#8221; The researchers conclude, in part, by saying that indications are that homeopathy:\n\ncan make a significant contribution to public health,\nis a low-cost treatment,\nhas effectiveness supported by empirical evidence,\ncan be implemented rapidly during a disease outbreak,\nhelps minimise the progression and severity of diseases, and\nappears to have made a significant contribution to the control of dengue fever in Brazil.\nIt was also noted that symptoms were relieved from the very beginning of treatment and that if dengue fever was caught in spite of the prophylactic being given, symptoms were less severe.', ''),

Most people do not like them and definitely do not want them in their yards. There are snake repellents available to help rid you of these unwelcome visitors.\r\n\r\nRepellent oils\r\nClove oil, cinnamon oil and eugenol have been shown to be effective in repelling snakes. These oils, when sprayed directly on the snake will cause it to retreat. Oil is not effective when it is applied to hard surfaces. It may be used in enclosed areas in order to fumigate a space. Absorbent material (such as cotton), saturated with the oil and warmed to no more than 200 degrees Fahrenheit will remove snakes from the area. There may be some regulations regarding the use of these oils in some states.\r\n\r\nSnake-A-Way\r\nSnake-A-Way is a snake repellent product that contains Naphthaline, an ingredient that interferes with the snake''s sensory system. Essentially, it temporarily closes down the snake''s nervous system, causing the snake to leave. Snake-A-Way was used during the Gulf War by the military to protect soldiers from cobras and sand vipers. It is a dry, granulated product that can be applied around the perimeter of your garden, your home or your swimming pool. It is effective for a period of about two months. Snake-A-Way is about $15 for a 4-pound container, online.\r\n\r\nLiquid Fence\r\nLiquid Fence has a complete line of repellents for various animals and insects. Their snake repellent is safe for the environment, safe around children and pets, and safe to use near water. Liquid fence can be sprayed around the areas you want to protect and it is effective for two to three weeks before reapplication is needed. The cost is approximately $35 for a one-gallon jug, again available online not seen anywhere in Pakistan.\r\n\r\nBioDefend\r\nBioDefend, like Snake-A-Way, interferes with the snake''s senses and causes it to vacate the area. It is available in sprays or granules and is safe to use around children and pets. It claims to be effective for as long as 90 days. The cost is between $25 and $30.\r\n\r\nPrevention\r\nTo prevent snakes from taking up residence in your yard, keep your lawn mowed, bushes and shrubs trimmed and avoid having dense gardens. All of these areas give snakes a place to hide. In addition, they will move into places like compost piles, mulch and stacks of wood. You might want to keep these items further away from your house. Eliminating small rodents and insects will also make your yard less attractive to snakes.\r\n\r\nWarnings\r\nSnake repellents should never be used inside a vegetable garden or anywhere that you are growing food. They should never be used around your water source or any natural body of water. If you see a snake that you believe to be poisonous, do not attempt to remove it yourself. Call your local animal control to remove it for you. It is advisable to be aware of any poisonous snakes may be found in your area and be able to recognize them.', ''),

This makes sense also, because they have no definite time frame as to when the cards would be made ready and if one gives up their licences completely, it would be a potential issue waiting to happen if required to provide proof of legality of weapon if demanded by law enforcement agencies.

(375524, ' perhaps all of you are right and perhaps some right and some wrong. one thing is for sure that having fired extensively a variety of 9 mm pistols, I bought my first Glock 17 in 2003 with a lot of expectations. i was immediately put off when I mistakenly fired against a Sig X5. it was like trying to race a suzuki against a BMW. Glock''s trigger was nothing compared to X5, it feels heavy even against an NP22. incidentally i found even a Makarov''s trigger (two of which I owned for 6-7 years) to be of much lighter and smoother variety than Glock. common even look at the price. a glock in US costs around 450 dollars. even most of my air rifles are in 500 dollar plus range. the extreme mismatch in weight (heavy barrel and slide sitting atop a very light fibre body), coupled with not so fine trigger in my opinion does not lead to accurate shooting at long ranges. look at the heavy weights if long range shooting, and look at the extra heavy barrels and centered weights around the grip and first finger. where does Glock stand in all these areas?\ni think the only plus point of Glock which makes it the darling of all LEAs is its extreme reliability. its the Toyota of pistols and thats it. now this fact and its resultant popularity does not automatically translate into accurate long range shooting.

These player can auto play for many hours and days but timing depends upon battery amps per hour.\r\n\r\nSecondly, sounds for the arriving flocks is different and than calls for the get to gather for landed birds in the area are different, than near dawn area domination calls are different and at morning femal calls are more effective than male calls.  but at the night time especialy at midnight mix sounds with low picth female sounds and high picth male sounds are giving good results, may you will not beleive that My dog was confused due to wide and fresh smell range at game soil due to Quails rush landing and I enjoyed bag of 39 with single gun out of more than 90 flush birds.\r\nAlready you have my number you can call me ay time for details, I will brief you better than text drafts. \r\n\r\nYes, Bulara is tricky thing mature hunter can''t trap by wildlife department but PWLD friendly hunters can feel fear andcan be problem for other junior hunters, otherwise Bulara and electric  or electropnic calling system are different things. Otherwise PWLD law obeying hunters are better thah PWLD friendly hunters becaue their activities are research based not complains based, so naturly thier knowledge can be better about changes in tech according to Act Clasue.', ''),

(375541, ' [QUOTE=AzamAgha44;214165]perhaps all of you are right and perhaps some right and some wrong. one thing is for sure that having fired extensively a variety of 9 mm pistols, I bought my first Glock 17 in 2003 with a lot of expectations. i was immediately put off when I mistakenly fired against a Sig X5. it was like trying to race a suzuki against a BMW. Glock''s trigger was nothing compared to X5, it feels heavy even against an NP22. incidentally i found even a Makarov''s trigger (two of which I owned for 6-7 years) to be of much lighter and smoother variety than Glock. common even look at the price. a glock in US costs around 450 dollars. even most of my air rifles are in 500 dollar plus range. the extreme mismatch in weight (heavy barrel and slide sitting atop a very light fibre body), coupled with not so fine trigger in my opinion does not lead to accurate shooting at long ranges. look at the heavy weights if long range shooting, and look at the extra heavy barrels and centered weights around the grip and first finger. where does Glock stand in all these areas?\ni think the only plus point of Glock which makes it the darling of all LEAs is its extreme reliability. its the Toyota of pistols and thats it. now this fact and its resultant popularity does not automatically translate into accurate long range shooting. Glocks have never been famed for accuracy, anywhere in the world but still have a cult like following. we need to dispassionately look at the cause of it.........not see everything glowing just coz its a Glock!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!![/QUOTE]\n Respected Agha Sahab\nthe Glock is a duty pistol, for the police, it is a combat pistol for the army and special forces. The X5 and X6 are top grade match pistols. For Combat/ SD  I would never carry an X5 or an X6, I would be carrying a Glock, for a Match I will not be without my beloved X6. \n I do not wish to be impolite but in the cross country a piddling suzuki jeep will beat the hell out of a Ferrari and on the track or Motorway it will be the otherway.\nMost of us carry 9mms for SD and for that purpose the ever ready Glock with its Safe Action and utter reliability and light weight, only 19 ounses versus 35 ounces or more of other pistols  is a delight to carry. The heavy weight of the slide is where it belongs, the Glocks Slide and Barrel are the strongest in comparison to any other pistol as it has almost no weight in the frame. The heavy Slide not only tames the recoil it helps in controlling the second shot, also the polymer frame has give in it which softens recoil.', ''),

(375552, ' @Haji, bro different countries have different laws according to quail populations. Electronic calls/lures are NOT banned everywhere. Here, electronic call (mp3 or audio tape etc) does no harm to the bird population if it is shot with guns only, as this bird comes to our areas in fairly high numbers. Unecessary netting of this poor bird is taking place across the country in villages on a massive scale ... to sell in the local markets and some for self consumption and obliging friends/guests. The dept is FULLY hand in glove with many netters (sadly). So the ban on netting is not seen announced by the department. Rather some in the department recommend to put restrictions on hunters/weapons instead. If one really wants to conserve this bird?????.....then to convince the dept to put a ban on its netting/trade is more impt; whereas allowing sport shooting with electronic call does no harm; and besides on which days to allow shooting & bag per gun limits - these can be debated further. So real points on conservation that you were pointing out are different.', ''),

(375625, ' A 22 Short is suitable for suicide and is, in fact, one of the most certain methods of commiting suicide. Autopsies show that the round has sufficient velocity to penetrate the skull but then has insufficent velocity to exit the other side of the head. Instead, the round deflects off the other side of the skull and back into the brain. In effect, the bullet bounces around inside the head. The damage is quite excessive.\r\n\r\nIt has been correctly pointed out here that the 22 round loses velocity. Thus, after a certain distance, the 22 Short would not penetrate the outer skull at all but be deflected. But, at that same distance, the 22 Long would still penetrate the skull, then fail to penetrate and exit the other side and "bounce around in the brain", making an identical, fatal wound as the .22 Short.\r\nThe 22 Long Rifle HP will mushroom on impact to the skull, thereby reducing its velocity to the point of, again, not exiting the other side of the head. Again, "bouncing" occurs but now with a mushroomed bullet. Having a bullet bounce around in one''s head is quite lethal and a .22 is pretty much guaranteed to do it.\r\nAnyone who wants can Google how James Brady survived a 22 round to the head. His successful survival was based on two things. First, he was in the ER in less than 5 minutes from being shot. Second, the 22 round used was an "exploding" round versus an HP round. "Exploding" ammo explodes on contact with the skull, expending most of its energy in order to create a larger entry wound (In Brady''s case, about the size of a dime.). With so much energy lost, it failed to penetrate very far and there was no "bounce". He lived because the shooter chose the wrong ammunition. But the shooter still put James Brady down with one shot just as RFK was put down with one shot by a 22 (by a shooter using the wrong weapon). Thus, even a complete amateur (wrong ammunition and wrong pistol) can disable and kill an opponent with a 22. It''s not a question of luck by the shooter. "Luck" is James Brady surviving it.\r\nI am still not claiming a 22 is "as good or better" than a large caliber pistol for self defense as aiming for "center of mass" demonstrates, but it would be if you hit opponent in the forehead and the round was not deflected (Which goes back to pistol and ammunition again.). This is not a secret to the medical world.', ''),

Prof. Dr. Rauf Niazi (Physician) and many more in Islamabad only. \r\n\r\nAll the Doctors work under the specifications/limitations provided by the Govt, Doctors work on what is provided by the Govt.

(375666, ' Agreed in totality with Skeeker60 sb''s analogy. Duty pistol''s have a higher trigger pull rating in pounds as when adrenaline is pumping  a 7lb pull feels like a 2 lb pull. You would also be surprised how quickly the supposed 10-15 even 20 rounds go in a firefight simulation (seconds!) This is the reason why, i believe, that most duty pistols have a harder pull (requiring more force) and /or a double action first followed by single action trigger system.  \nThe same is true for hunting rifles as opposed to target rifles. Hunting rifles'' triggers need more pull in LBS than target rifles which usually have ''hair triggers''.  Just because a pistol''s got a harder pull (requiring more force)does not mean it is bad. IT all depends on what the pistol is designed for.   I for one would never want to be in a self defence/ concealed carry mode with a hair trigger SA only pistol.', ''),

(375703, ' Compared to autoloading handguns, a revolver is often simpler to operate and may have greater reliability. For example, should a semiautomatic pistol fail to fire, clearing the chamber requires manually cycling the action to remove the errant round, as cycling the action normally depends on the energy of a cartridge firing. With a revolver, this is not necessary as none of the energy for cycling the revolver comes from the firing of the cartridge, but is supplied by the user either through cocking the hammer or, in a double action design, by just squeezing the trigger. Another significant advantage of revolvers is superior ergonomics, particularly for users with small hands. A revolver''s grip is not required to accommodate a magazine, and it can be designed or customized much more than a typical semi-automatic. Partially because of these reasons, revolvers still hold significant market share as concealed carry and home-defense weapons.', ''),

(375729, 'MY SHOOTING STAND, Multiple use! Hi! \r\n\r\nAs you all would agree with me perhaps, one of the most common pre-session headaches faced by us - when intending to go out for some practice shooting or doing some reviewing of some newly acquired toys, etc - is usually the inevitably occurring question of how to do the “placement” of the intended target boards, etc, at the ranges/ fields, or the typically occurring “where do we hang this object” type of questions.\r\n\r\nSome of the registered ranges around do allow for some personal settings within the prescribed shooting areas, whereas with others, you’ve to sadly stay within the limited and laid down arrangements. On private ranges also there are nil of pre-arranged settlements and best imaginative resources hence are required to come back home from the session with anything positive or reportable for a feed-back.\r\n\r\nA popular proverb has it that ” An empty Mind is a Devil’s Workshop” and such was the status of mine as well, when off for 3 months vacations lately, so I decided on homecoming to tackle this matter for myself and with the best of what I could come up with.\r\n\r\nInspired by 12G bro’s earlier economy PakGuns solution of an easy-to-carry target  -shooting stand for handguns (Perhas also for 12 Gauge blasts, I don''t know), I wanted some further improvement for my personal requirements, a bit more “flexibility” and a stand that could gratify 12 Gauge shots as well and be of multiple targets use.\r\n\r\nBefore I proceed on, may I just add, that the solution by 12G bro remains perfect and the fastest one to get into field use, though it does have some limitations that I sought done away with here, yet at the cost of not only more finances involved, but also a couple of more tiring, “boredom-killing” hours spent with the different people involved in putting out the final product, namely, a carpenter, a welder and finally a plumber also.\r\n\r\nLuckily enough, I knew a couple of people within these fields who courteously attended me at my venue on request, yet in addition to the time spent here at home, I also had to visit them at their workshops occasionally, during the 3 days that it took them to complete the unit for me. As usual, first such item always require spending some time like that for the fine tuning of things, yet would be less troublesome for the future.\r\n\r\n[COLOR="red"]The purpose was:[/COLOR]\r\n\r\n1)	[COLOR="blue"]A Completely Folding Set-up.\r\n2)	Wrench/ Tools-free attachments\r\n3)	Easy Carry, Car Friendly\r\n4)	Supporting Multiple Targets\r\n5)	Suitable for both Handguns/Shotguns\r\n6)	Height Adjustable\r\n7)	Requiring Minimum of Post-Shooting Workshop Visits\r\n8)	Cost Effective.[/COLOR]\r\n\r\nPart 1 below is introduction, part 2 further below shows the making, so let’s get to the affair:\r\n\r\n[SIZE="5"][SIZE="7"][COLOR="red"]Part 1:[/COLOR][/SIZE][/SIZE]\r\n\r\n\r\n[SIZE="5"][COLOR="red"]The Rock-solid [I]Simplicity[/I]:[/COLOR][/SIZE]\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i1136.photobucket.com/albums/n497/wahstar1/The%20Stand/Present1Small.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\n[COLOR="red"][SIZE="5"]Some of the the[I] practicality[/I]:[/SIZE][/COLOR]\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i1136.photobucket.com/albums/n497/wahstar1/The%20Stand/Present2Small.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\n[SIZE="5"][COLOR="red"]And [I]Dimension II[/I]:[/COLOR][/SIZE]\r\n[IMG]http://i1136.photobucket.com/albums/n497/wahstar1/The%20Stand/Present3Small.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\n[SIZE="5"][COLOR="red"]  [COLOR="green"][SIZE="6"][COLOR="purple"] [COLOR="red"]The[/COLOR] 3D[/COLOR][/SIZE] [/COLOR][SIZE="6"]effect:[/SIZE][/COLOR][/SIZE]\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i1136.photobucket.com/albums/n497/wahstar1/The%20Stand/3DMedium.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\n[COLOR="red"][SIZE="5"]Another option:[/SIZE][/COLOR]\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i1136.photobucket.com/albums/n497/wahstar1/The%20Stand/3D2Medium.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\n[SIZE="5"][COLOR="red"]The Target-board Backside:[/COLOR][/SIZE] (card-board sheet with fortifications [B]NOT[/B] intended, carpenter''s fault, check making in Part II):\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i1136.photobucket.com/albums/n497/wahstar1/The%20Stand/Present4BacksideTorsoMedium.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\n[SIZE="5"][COLOR="red"]The target Torso units for SD shooting:[/COLOR][/SIZE]\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i1136.photobucket.com/albums/n497/wahstar1/The%20Stand/PapertorsoMedium.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\n[SIZE="5"][COLOR="red"]The target-board base unit:[/COLOR][/SIZE] ( [COLOR="blue"]Can take up to about 1" thick sheets, chipboard, Lasani,  etc![/COLOR])\r\n\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i1136.photobucket.com/albums/n497/wahstar1/The%20Stand/Targetbaseunit1Small.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\n\r\n[SIZE="5"][COLOR="red"]My normal trunk-load[/COLOR][/SIZE]( 1 single stand):\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i1136.photobucket.com/albums/n497/wahstar1/The%20Stand/Present5Car1Small.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\n[SIZE="5"][COLOR="red"]The extended system:[/COLOR][/SIZE] ([COLOR="red"][COLOR="blue"]3+targets[/COLOR][/COLOR], [B]as many as you can keep adding[/B])\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i1136.photobucket.com/albums/n497/wahstar1/The%20Stand/Present6Car2Medium.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\n\r\n[COLOR="teal"][SIZE="5"][COLOR="red"]The stand and boards were tested out successfully yesterday and stood all the loads, 9 mm, cal .45 and 12G SG shells, 36 Grams Victory BB shots, etc, without budging an inch to any directions.

(375863, ' [color="blue"][SIZE="7"]PART II - THE MAKING[/SIZE]:[/color]\n\n\n[COLOR="red"][SIZE="5"]The footing base:[/SIZE][/COLOR]\n\nI wanted something "bump-proof," [I][COLOR="blue"]surface friendly[/COLOR] [/I]that would spare myself from bruises and the car from scratches when loading/ unloading, and be just the weight required to stand the shot-loads, neither more, nor less.\n\n I could have chosen a steel/iron footing, yet it would be heavy and more [I]surface-hostile[/I] for transport. My initial idea was a thick and round three stub (&#8220;Mudha&#8221; in popular Punjabi), yet my carpenter advised against, saying that the final output would be less &#8220;finished&#8221; in texture, harder to work on, harder to form to desired standards, hence his suggestion was for use of Lasani wood and though I did not like the idea initially of placing this material onto humid/wet surfaces in the fields, I thought I could always[I] laminate[/I] it with some good paint and if required be, even cover it up fully in artificial leather for use in wet season, yet heck, who goes out shooting on a rainy day, lol!\n\n4 layers of  ¾&#8221; thick Lasani wood circles topped onto each other brought out the below base after a bit of rotor sawing. [COLOR="blue"]Weight is approximately 4.Kgs with basic fitting.[/COLOR]\n\n Bottom Lasani circle is [COLOR="blue"]15" in diameter[/COLOR], others reduced gradually to form about [COLOR="blue"]6" for the top layer[/COLOR].\n\n[IMG]http://i1136.photobucket.com/albums/n497/wahstar1/The%20Stand/FootbaseMedium.jpg[/IMG]\n\n[SIZE="5"][COLOR="red"]Top part:[/COLOR][/SIZE]\n\n[IMG]http://i1136.photobucket.com/albums/n497/wahstar1/The%20Stand/RoundplatetopSmall.jpg[/IMG]\n\n[SIZE="5"][COLOR="red"]Target Base Unit:[/COLOR][/SIZE]\n\n[IMG]http://i1136.photobucket.com/albums/n497/wahstar1/The%20Stand/TargetunitbasenutsSmall2.jpg[/IMG]\n\nOne part of the wooden TBU support is "fixed", othe part move-able to accommodate up to 1" thick wooden sheet, finally tightened with bolts and nuts through the target board, hardly a minutes job to place the target on top of it, no need for any keys here, tightening is enough with the bare hands.\n\n\n[SIZE="5"][COLOR="red"]Steel Plate:[/COLOR][/SIZE]\n\nNext part was a 6&#8221; round iron/steel-plate of gauge 14 or less in thickness to have bolted through the wood base [I]for welding onto of the required sanitary fittings later. [/I] The welder secured me this by cutting out 4  steel circles measuring 6&#8221; in diameter each from a roughly 2 square feet gauge 14 steel plate:\n\n[IMG]http://i1136.photobucket.com/albums/n497/wahstar1/The%20Stand/SteelplateSmall.jpg[/IMG]\n\n[SIZE="5"][COLOR="red"]And holed out:[/COLOR][/SIZE]\n\n[IMG]http://i1136.photobucket.com/albums/n497/wahstar1/The%20Stand/holedoutSmall.jpg[/IMG]\n\nThen the welding of the steel fitting to the plate, which was done with a water- level on top of the welded part during the welding process, as to secure complete &#8220;zero&#8221; level fit.\n\n[IMG]http://i1136.photobucket.com/albums/n497/wahstar1/The%20Stand/SteelplatesocketweldingSmall.jpg[/IMG]\n\n[B] If the base is not a complete &#8220;zero&#8221;, rest assured even the straightest of pipes later will not appear &#8220;straight&#8221;, lol![/B] A very hard task, coz steel deforms with high heat, so I had to ultimately put some steel packing beneath the finished product as to attain the complete &#8220;zero&#8221; level. The solution here is a choice of even thicker steel plate, say Gauge 12 or 10.\n\nThe steel plate with the added fitting was then [I]bolted[/I] to the wooden footing base, [COLOR="blue"] by using 3&#8217;25&#8221; long and 2 ½&#8217;&#8221; thick bolts[/COLOR]. Drilled and inserted from the bottom and tightened from the top of the base with corresponding nuts and steel washers beneath the nuts, and further strengthened  from the top side by adding 3 screws to make the whole thing rock solid.\n\n The extra nut on top is just plain cosmetics and to secure that the slightly extended bolt does not come into contact with anything. The single nut serves the purpose.\n\n[COLOR="red"][SIZE="5"]We now had a[I] pipe-mountable[/I] footing base:[/SIZE][/COLOR]\n\n[IMG]http://i1136.photobucket.com/albums/n497/wahstar1/The%20Stand/FootbasesteelpaltedMedium.jpg[/IMG]\n\n[SIZE="5"][COLOR="red"]And the pair:[/COLOR][/SIZE]\n\n[IMG]http://i1136.photobucket.com/albums/n497/wahstar1/The%20Stand/2baseunitsSmall.jpg[/IMG]\n\n[SIZE="5"][COLOR="red"]And the Target Base Unit, 2X8 inches steel plate:[/COLOR][/SIZE]\n\n[IMG]http://i1136.photobucket.com/albums/n497/wahstar1/The%20Stand/TargetunitbasesocketSmall.jpg[/IMG]\n\n[SIZE="5"][COLOR="red"]And the full set, with tops also[/COLOR][/SIZE]:\n\n[IMG]http://i1136.photobucket.com/albums/n497/wahstar1/The%20Stand/FullsetupMedium.jpg[/IMG]\n\n[SIZE="5"][COLOR="red"]Some quick lamination:[/COLOR][/SIZE]\n\n[IMG]http://i1136.photobucket.com/albums/n497/wahstar1/The%20Stand/LaminationSmall.jpg[/IMG]\n\n\n[SIZE="5"][COLOR="red"]Piping:[/COLOR][/SIZE]\n\nNext step was supposed to be simple and less time consuming, yet it still required quite some care. The plumber came to my venue with all the material and I gave him a few dimensions to be cut in first ½&#8221; dia steel pipes and then in ¾&#8221; plastic pipes for top cover. The green colored plastic pipes being used as "sleeves" only - to cover up the internal steel - serve basically 3 purposes:\n\n[COLOR="blue"]1)	&#8220;Fuller&#8221; more solid looks.\n2)	Paint work evasion\n3)	Richochet control of misplaced shots, just in case. \n[/COLOR]\n\nThe piping was done with a level on top of every part added, just to secure that all was at complete "zero hold":\n\n[IMG]http://i1136.photobucket.com/albums/n497/wahstar1/The%20Stand/LeveledSmall.jpg[/IMG]\n\n[COLOR="red"][SIZE="5"]Part III in next post will cover materials, labor cost.[/SIZE][/COLOR]\n\n\nRegards.', ''),

(376029, 'Dengue.........................feverrrrrrrrrrr Dengue Hubbubs\r\n Do n’t Panic . I just treated my own  nephew at home because there is no room available in the Hospitals in Lahore.\r\n\r\nFacts\r\n\r\n1) It is not as dangerous as you have been informed\r\n2) It is self limited\r\n3)  It will torture you for about b7-10 days\r\n4)  Do n’t confuse it with Dengue hemorrhage fever or Shock\r\n5)   The mosquito is called Egepity similar to Nile and yellow fever virus\r\n6)    If 100 people are beaten; only 20 will get sick. Other eighty will have no signs\r\n7)    Out of 20, there will be one death\r\n\r\n\r\nDiagnose\r\n\r\nWhen bitten, interferon is released. Symptoms rare due to interferon. Similar to Malaria. High fever up to 105 degree height, headache behind the eyes, aches, bone breaker, weakness. Interferon trigger WBC which will kill the virus but dies too. WBC or white blood cells sacrifice to protect us. Platelets have small role . These are to prevent bleeding because virus breaks down the small blood vessels or capillaries. Then the fluid leaks out with blood but is rare incident.\r\n	Here is a simple test called tourniquet test. Place the Blood pressure cuff. Inflate to 140 for 5 -6 minutes. Release the cough. If the site is reddened and rash develops, suspect Dengue. To conform it, there are two tests. One is called Isolation of virus by cell culture and the other is Nucleic Aid test by PCR. There reliability is 99 % but I do n’t know if Pakistani hospitals have the technique. If not , then CBC will conform the dengue fever. WBC are reduced rapidly because they are dying fighting the virus.. WBC are 5 types. Each white blood cell has different role to play.\r\n\r\nTreatment\r\n\r\nDehydration is common, therefore, lactate ringer IV is started. Ringer is not available then O.R.S. will do. Acetaminophen ( Paracetamol, Tylonol, Panadol, Dorcol,Tempera, Genapap. Lots of name and brand for acetataminophen) is given to control the fever). Do not give aspirin, and Brufen. If Paracetamol is not available, place ice around the neck, under the armpits and on the groins. Control the fever, control the dengue. Rest is up to the body. Give the patient juices and vitamins. If the WBC reduced to 25-35, then either the packed cells or whole blood is transfused.\r\n\r\nPrevention\r\n\r\nAs long as Pakistan has poor sanitation, open sewages; other diseases along with Dengue will remain health problems. I am not afraid of dengue but what scares me are other diseases which are much more dangerous such as Cholera, yellow fever, and plague will wipe out the population.\r\n\r\nConclusion\r\n\r\nPharmaceutical companies, hospitals and doctors have made an enormous money by frightening poor lay people. Panadol is selling for 100 PKR per 10 tablets and doctors are charging 1000 -1500 PKR per person. Hospital room are way high up to 9000 PKR per day.', ''),

I''ll post a picture tomorrow of one such option for fixture of the tops to the stand, without any welded steel plate to the TBU''s, yet it seems the present system is the most stable, however.\n\nIf no further "improvisation" is possible and the present model is affixed as it is now, we can proceed to finding some skills-me.\n\nSince our community is pretty much Lahore and adjoining areas residing, best would be if someone from the community could find some willing skills-men in Lahore to do the job for easy collection. Find ONE such team there to complete the stands in Lahore, then only order through this team, this will ensure a "standardization" of the product and ease the community from finding individual workshops in already crowded big cities, where even finding a reasonable parking lot near these areas is pretty much of a nerve-killer, leave alone explaining the skills-men and getting the product made to desires.\n\nPerhaps, Naveed could be of some assistance here in locating up the right team to do the work in Lahore, then collect orders, say min 3-5 stands at a time and forward to the skills-men. This may reduce labor cost also.\n\n[COLOR="blue"]One major benefit of a "standardized" target-shooting system like this is the "uniformity" of shot placement requirements for improving the shooting skills and  the ease of the consequent analysis/suggestions by fellow members, for improvements, to the individual shooter after posting here of his shooting results, be it in precision shooting on PG charts, or standardized torso unit SD shooting.\n[/COLOR]\nLolz, seems like we''ve an "Official Pakguns Stand" in the making.

(376131, ' Having a proper security system and plan is key in this scenario. One must plan the security of his home (be it an apartment or a house). \nIf you are worried about people climbing into the home via a Balcony, you could put in a home monitoring system such as Mutual security (ADT type). This system gives you the following:\na) a arming/ disarming keypad located near your main door. You would punch in secret codes (that you and your family only knows) to arm and disarm the security system.\n1- Motion sensors (if anything moves in a given area after the system is armed, the alarm goes off (siren @ home) and signal to the monitoring company who normally respond with their own force of armed guards and can also coordinate with the police.) \n2- Door contacts- If any of the doors is opened that has these contacts the alarm would go off . This is true for all armed doors except for the main door, which if opened when the alarm is armed, would give approximately 30 seconds for the user to put in their deactivation code, failure to do so would automatically sound the alarm.\n3- Window contacts- If any windows that have these contacts / sensors opened after the system is armed, the alarm would go off.\n\nAdditionally, you can have window shatter sensors which would go off if a window is broken.\n\nOne the alarm signal goes off the monitoring company will call you immediately (on your land line 1st and then to you cell) to find out if everything is okay. You will have a code word set up to let them know that it is REALLY you that has answered the phone (in case the Bad guys( BG) answers the telephone.  Additionally, you would also have a coercion code- This would be used by you to inform them that you are under threat or something (eg. a gun is pointed to you or your loved one when the phone rings the BG want you to  announce that everything is okay). In this case you would  say ''hello, the code word is "xyz" (whatever you have previously set up as as a coercion password), yes , everything is fine, accidental arming of the signal"... the monitoring company would thank you and hang up and send the force to your place possibly with Police. \nThe monitoring fee is around Rs. 5000 per quarter (three months) including taxes.\nSometimes, the BG''s are aware of the monitoring system and may choose to first cut your telephone lines (so that signal would not be transmitted to the monitoring system).. TO deal with this, either you can request a backup GSM system (Rs. 1500 approximately) This system would send the signal via a mobile signal to the monitoring company if the landlines are cut. Some company''s offer the wireless GSM based signal facility as standard. Please ask around.\n\nYou also get  PANIC/Silent alarm switches, which you can press and the house alarm would not go off, but a silent signal would go to the monitoring company who would call and send their guards. These switches look very harmless and like a normal light switch. One should have them installed in ALL rooms of the home as sometimes the BG''s would lock the family in one room and do their nefarious deeds in the rest of the home.\n\nIf you do not want such an elaborate system, you can buy OVER the counter motion sensors. These can be put in your living room or balcony and would sound a loud alarm if something moves in their area after they are armed. They are usually armed with a remote control (similar to your car alarm system).\n\nA very important and economical security point is to install PEEP hole viewing systems in all bedroom doors and the main door also. \nA few friends had their houses robbed wherein the BG''s would first take control of either a servant (sleeping outside) or someone in the home (say they manage to get into the room of your parents or kids). On gunpoint, they would force these ''captives'' to knock at other bedroom doors calling the people outside. The insiders would obviously have no reason to be suspicious at say ''their mother calling them out in the middle of the night'' and they would open their doors to be held captive also. \n\nHence it is IMPERATIVE that one puts in peep hole viewers in all bedroom doors and instruct everyone to use it first before opening their doors.   ALL family members should also be instructed to lock their doors using the latch (kundi) and lock.   Just a Kundi locked door is very easy to break open with a kick from outside.\n\nEven if you dont have an alarm system, put up a sign saying that you do outside your homes. such plates / signs / Stickers can be seen outside protected properties. You might have to go to the trouble of having these made for a few hundred Rs. from a good printer or a plate/sign maker.BG''s always scan/recce the place first maybe for  a few days before they take action and usually would avoid any place with alarm systems. \n\nUse steel bars in balconies or large windows where there can be easy access of BG''s into your home. \n\nInvest in an AREA chowkidar or two where everyone pays a little towards the area Chowkidar - watchman''s salary and he can be given a mobile phone and a LOUD whistle. Each house/ apartment complex can be protected this way and the watchmen would know suspicious individuals or groups they dont recognize and whistle or call to make people aware.\n\nThere are motion detecting lights that turn on when someone passes by. These lights should be installed outside balconies and dark areas around the house.\n\nCCTV system is also a good idea. though make sure that if you are going to invest, invest in a system that is hooked on the internet where the data can be backed up on a server (outside your home). There is no point in CCTV if the BG would take away the harddisks/ backups from you home. The advantage of IP based CCTV systems is that you can monitor your home from anywhere in the world using a laptop/ mobile phone with internet access.\n\nThe key is to make your home as ''inhospitable'' to the BG as possible using such techniques that they dont bother your home and go for other homes that are ''easier prey''.\n\nIf worst case scenario comes up and you realize BG''s are entering or in your home and you are in a safe secure location,  do the following:\n1- Barricade yourself in a room.\n2 - call 15\n3- call your family / neighbours etc.\n4- Make loud noises, sounds inform the BG''s that the police is on the way and that you are armed.\n5- Fire in the air (last resort). Please do not fire a FMJ bullet in an enclosed room. the bullet would ricochet around and could even seriously injure/harm you and your loved ones. If you have NO CHOICE and absolutely feel that you must discharge a weapon, do so with a proper backstop in place (eg.  keep 10-12 large telephone directories in a stack etc.  I don''t ever RECOMMEND anyone for discharging a weapon in an enclosed space. Use your own discretion).\n4- If you are confronting a BG who is armed (w/ a gun/ knife/ even a baseball bat). shoot to incapacitate/ neutralize ( incapacitation/neutralization does not mean shooting in the arms and legs. it means shooting at the vital areas deliberately and repeatedly). You are in immediate danger/threat for your life and that of your loved ones, you want the BG To STOP IMMEDIATELY and unfortunately the only way to do that is by the above method). The BG would probably die, but that is the consequence of his action. You are not aiming to KILL for thrills but rather to save your life and that of your loved ones. This is important.\n5- Lastly, if you are armed and your family is with you in a room. barricade the room and lock yourself inside. Call the police, hit the panic buttons. make loud noises do whatever but DO NOT go out being RAMBO looking for BG''s. They also have ears and  are/maybe armed and may hear you come and take the first shot!). BG''s NEVER intrude in a home alone. They are always a group of at least 3+ and are usually armed. It is not prudent to go looking for a firefight ever and certainly it is NOT wise to go into a firefight deliberately outnumbered/outgunned. Think about life for your loved ones if you are critically hit...Do not EVER be a RAMBO in such circumstances. Your life and that of your loved ones is not worth all the valuables in the world.\n\nRemember a firearm is to be used a defensive weapon of the LAST resort!. \n\nthe above are my two cents.\n\nMay Allah always keep us and all people in HIS protection and we never ever have to face such a situation.', ''),

Other eighty will have no signs\r\n7)    Out of 20, there will be one death\r\n\r\n\r\nDiagnose\r\n\r\nWhen bitten, interferon is released. Symptoms rare due to interferon. Similar to Malaria. High fever up to 105 degree height, headache behind the eyes, aches, bone breaker, weakness. Interferon trigger WBC which will kill the virus but dies too. WBC or white blood cells sacrifice to protect us. Platelets have small role . These are to prevent bleeding because virus breaks down the small blood vessels or capillaries. Then the fluid leaks out with blood but is rare incident.\r\n	Here is a simple test called tourniquet test. Place the Blood pressure cuff. Inflate to 140 for 5 -6 minutes. Release the cough. If the site is reddened and rash develops, suspect Dengue. To conform it, there are two tests. One is called Isolation of virus by cell culture and the other is Nucleic Aid test by PCR. There reliability is 99 % but I do n&#8217;t know if Pakistani hospitals have the technique. If not , then CBC will conform the dengue fever. WBC are reduced rapidly because they are dying fighting the virus.. WBC are 5 types. Each white blood cell has different role to play.\r\n\r\nTreatment\r\n\r\nDehydration is common, therefore, lactate ringer IV is started. Ringer is not available then O.R.S. will do. Acetaminophen ( Paracetamol, Tylonol, Panadol, Dorcol,Tempera, Genapap. Lots of name and brand for acetataminophen) is given to control the fever). Do not give aspirin, and Brufen. If Paracetamol is not available, place ice around the neck, under the armpits and on the groins. Control the fever, control the dengue. Rest is up to the body. Give the patient juices and vitamins. If the WBC reduced to 25-35, then either the packed cells or whole blood is transfused.\r\n\r\nPrevention\r\n\r\nAs long as Pakistan has poor sanitation, open sewages; other diseases along with Dengue will remain health problems. I am not afraid of dengue but what scares me are other diseases which are much more dangerous such as Cholera, yellow fever, and plague will wipe out the population.\r\n\r\nConclusion\r\n\r\nPharmaceutical companies, hospitals and doctors have made an enormous money by frightening poor lay people. Panadol is selling for 100 PKR per 10 tablets and doctors are charging 1000 -1500 PKR per person. Hospital room are way high up to 9000 PKR per day.[/QUOTE]\r\n \r\nThanks for sharing very valuable information doctor sahib.', ''),

The best weapon for you is that which is from a reputable company and that FEELS the most natural and easy for you to hold/ aim/fire. \nA Rs. 1 million pistol is useless to you if it does not fit well and makes you uncomfortable.

Other pakgunners have reflected on this topic quite well as it is :)  The TYPE of sling to you choose to use is a whole different ball game altogether. There are simple traditional slings A- 2 point slings- These can actually aid in balancing the weapon and holding it steady while firing.   B- 2 point quick adjustable sling - same as above, except you can quickly adjust its length etc.   C-  3-point sling - This is a new concept for tactical shooters and police etc who want their weapon to be strapped close to their bodies . You can also transition into secondary weapons quite easily with this sling .  D- single point sling - another tactical sling that allows shooter to quickly transition the weapon from one shoulder to another for say shooting around odd corners without exposing one''s entire body.\n\npersonally i have slings on ALL my long weapons.', ''),

[QUOTE=mehdi;214757]I am a great fan of Dianna Air Guns,I still have my first Diana 23 cal .22, made in West Germany, was in working condition till a few years back , trying to get some parts like main spring, piston assembly, breach seal etc.I also have a Diana 35 cal .22, these guns are reliable and last long.At one point of time I also had the 45 with me, but it had lot of vibration and very heavy.I had to part with it \r\n\r\nMy question is why should a new gun need tuning ? it should be ready out of the box.Apart from the break in period. The new ones in the market Gamo for instance are very light easy to handle, no vibration and dead accurate.I am thinking of buying a gamo whisper these days.[/QUOTE]\r\n\r\nDear Brother,\r\n\r\nFirst of all I thank you to come up with a question.\r\n\r\nAs you know that all over the world, the cost cutting procedures are being applied.  The most important factor in cost cutting is reducing the required time for assembling a product.\r\n\r\nIn 1980''s and prior to that period, all Diana airguns were properly lubed before departing from the factory.  But After 90''s the work force in Diana factory was drastically reduced. This was done in order to cut the cost.  There are always some drawback of cost cutting.  \r\n\r\nIn case of Diana we find that now the guns come from the factory bone dry. Also no de-burring is found in internals of the guns. The spring ends are not properly polished.\r\n\r\nAll those Diana guns which produce 1000fps and more in .177 caliber and more than 700fps in .22 caliber reacts if they are dry. There is a lot of vibration in these guns.  And if we use 350 magnum out of the box, it is very much difficult to shoot accurately because of non-lubing.\r\n\r\nAs the new piston seals are self lubing, Diana left lubing whole the gun while the main spring, guides and piston skirt needs to be properly lubed for smooth firing cycle.\r\n\r\nThere is no need to lube the piston seal of New Diana guns rather oiling new seals will destroy the seal.\r\n\r\nIn USA there are specialized companies who make better springs and better guides for Diana guns.  Normally people in USA purchase Diana gun and remove original spring and replaces it with the specialized springs of some other companies like Jim Maccari.\r\n\r\nThis makes the guns very much smooth and accurate.\r\n\r\nEven if we dont change the main spring proper overhauling and lubing improves the guns behavior.', ''),

So many special ops like the British SAS, New Zealand SAS, Aussie SAS, Pakistani SSG and SSG (N) are using 9mm............[/QUOTE]\n \n\n@ Furrukh bro. The 9mm has been selected for the same reason  as the 5.56 round has been chosen over the 7.62 Nato round by the U.S. and NATO forces. \n\nSmaller round means more ammo for the same weight. Higher capacity firearms for the same weight means more sustained outgoing fire and less frequent reloading.   Having smaller bullets means less stress on the supply chain also. This is the reason why the former Soviet Union also switched to the 5.45 round from the 7.62x 39 round.\n When millions and millions or bullets are being used (as to equip and train a large army and in the scenario of war, cents saved per bullet in terms of production costs/ transportation/ carrying translates into SIGNIFICANT savings.\n\nAlso, the aim of military planners is NOT to kill an opposing soldier, but rather to seriously injure  so that MUCH more resources of the enemy are tied down in rescuing/ transporting and taking care of the injured soldiers. This is another major reason why no army uses hollow point bullets which are clearly more effective in terms of their stopping power.\n\nWhile the 9mm Beretta m9 is the standard issue weapon for US soldiers, a lot of soldiers are going back to .45''s especially via the H&K Mark 23 .45 cal pistol. \n\nPlease see the open letter by member of U.S. forces to the U.S. Congress totally highlighting this issue:\n\n[URL]http://www.militaryphotos.net/forums/showthread.php?6542-Toss-the-9mm-bring-back-the-Colt-.45[/URL]!\n\n\nWhile i am a great fan of the .45, i feel perfectly adequately armed using JHP loaded 9mms and do not own a single .45 handgun. for my concealed carry though i use  a .357 mag for its  greater stopping power and for peace of my mind. :)', ''),

Please look closely if there is a gap or if the slide has not gone forward completely on the last round that does not fire. You are saying that you pull the trigger  and the firing pin strikes but there is no strike mark on the primers?  ALL Taurus have a 2nd strike capability so did you pull the trigger again on the non-firing bullet? I am seriously considering this to be a mag issue.\n(NOTE: when  you pull the trigger and the bullet does not go off, DO NOT immediately rack the slide and pop the bullet out. In rare cases it could be due to a slow ignition and the bullet MIGHT go off after a few seconds. so make sure that you keep the gun pointed in a safe direction for at least 5-10 seconds when this happens and ONLY after this time , you rack the slide and eject the bullet).\nCan you kindly check your weapon in a completely SAFE place with the weapon pointed at a safe backstop and do the following?\n\na) make sure you are in a safe place to operate the weapon, make sure it is pointed to a proper backstop\nb) fill up your mag with 5x bullets\nc) load the mag into the gun while pointed in a safe direction. HANDS OFF the trigger\nd) rack the slide and chamber the 1st bullet. keep the gun pointed in a safe direction and hand off the trigger. notice the position of the slide as fully forward.\ne) empty the  bullets by racking the slide till you get to the last bullet and once the last bullet is chambered, compare the slide position with before.\n\nIf the slide is not fully forward, this would mean that the bullet is not chambering properly and not allowing the slide to go fully forward and hence preventing the firing pin from making contact with the bullet primer. \n\nIf this is the case then the issue is most likely faulty mag followers. your problem may be solved by trying out different magazines.', ''),

Also, since I don&#8217;t think most of us here perform security guard duties so the reply is also limited to hunting conditions. \r\n\r\nBasically, it is a matter of personal choice and since hunting conditions and individual circumstances varies soo much that a universal comment is not applicable. \r\n\r\nHowever, if you look at all quality shotguns almost all of them don&#8217;t have the sling studs and this is because traditionally shotguns are carried without sling, I have never put a sling on my shotguns and I am yet to see a quality hunter that has some class do so.', ''),

The key niches for Vepr 12 are sport shooting under IPSC rules, as well as use for civilian home defense and for security purposes. Vepr 12 is produced by "Molot" factory, which also makes RPK-74 machine guns and Vepr brand semi-automatic hunting rifles. All "Vepr" brand rifles and shotguns are broadly based on the RPK-74 light machinegun designs, adapted for civilian purpose and appropriate ammunition.\r\n\r\nTheVepr 12 shotgun is gas-operated, semi-automatic shotgun which uses long-stroke gas piston located above the barrel, and a rotary locking bolt. Gas system is self-regulating and does not need manual adjustments. Gun is fitted with modified AK-style safety that has additional lever that permits faster "safety on" operation (mostly useful for IPSC shooters). Safety lever is also duplicated on the left side of the receiver. Other useful addition that is not found in AKor Saiga 12 is bolt hold-open devicewhich holds the bolt open when magazine is exhausted. Magazine housing is provided with extended magazine tunnel, which permits for faster magazine insertion (without typical AK-style rocking movement,necessary to lock the standard AK-type magazine). Furniture includes a detachable or fixed flash hider on the barrel, a side-folding skeletonized butt with polymer coating, and plastic pistol grip and forend. Bottom handguard and bottom of gas block are fitted with Picatinny-type accessory rails, additional rail is provided on the receiver top cover, which is hinged to the receiver at the front.Standard sights are of AK pattern as well, with front sight installed on the gas block and adjustable rear sight on the receiver. It is worth to note that Vepr 12 shotguns can use both proprietary 8-round magazines and Saiga 12 magazines, but Vepr magazines will not work in Saiga 12.\r\n  Vepr shotguns are produced in three basic versions, standard (with 430 mm /16,9" barrel with removable flash hider), Vepr 12 mod.01 (with 520 mm /20,5" barrel with fixed flash hider) and Vepr 12 mod.02 (with 680mm / 26,8" barrel with interchangeable chokes).\r\n\r\n[URL="http://www.molot.biz/product-e/molot205.php"]http://www.molot.biz/product-e/molot205.php[/URL]\r\n\r\n[URL="http://world.guns.ru/shotgun/rus/vepr-12-e.html"]http://world.guns.ru/shotgun/rus/vepr-12-e.html[/URL]', ''),

Because in field at upland, sling interferes when taking shots. For that purpose, above type gun sling (#1) is helpful (worn over waist) or #2, as per shooter''s preference, if shooter wants to take some fatigue out and distribute the gun''s weight on waist on long walks. But those are just some options which can be used to one''s comfort. I got the gun sling (#1) a couple of years back, and its very helpful at upland and especially so at WATERFOWL HUNTING, while standing in water in ready-to-fire position in reeds or standing in blind in lowlight hrs. Saves some wasted split-secs when taking quick shots. But in upland hunting, I prefer the traditional sling that the thread is referring to (light weight & quick removeable type, not the fancier leather slings), then I pack it in the strap vest in the back pocket. Strap vest and the gun sling, both are being made here now too, so I have heard. Both are good alternate ways of managing this issue of gun (weight) management. \r\n\r\nThere is yet another product which is in use by few hunters here (haven''t located the name and model) which is a fantastic gear idea for upland. The stock of the shotgun rests just below the armpit in that product and the shooter can walk while the gun is held in the 45 degrees angle with the support of one hand. The flushing birds are really easier & much quicker to take; and the gun weight is again distributed more effectively. That is I think the best product as an alternate to the traditional sling at any ready-to-fire situation.', ''),

(376850, ' Pics of Volcanic 12 gauge semi-auto shotgun\n\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]4200[/ATTACH][ATTACH=CONFIG]4198[/ATTACH][ATTACH=CONFIG]4199[/ATTACH]\nBro. here are the pics. I have taken this weapon out of my safe after AGES. the phone would give you an idea of its dimensions.  The laser installed on the mag tube is NOT standard, i installed it myself. This is a wonderful weapon for home defense and even as a vehicle carry for SD with a guard. very light weight. the Barrel states that is has been proof tested for 12 gauge- 76/3" ch. I have x''ed out the serial number obviously for the pic.  You also get an idea of what i meant when i said the RIGHT side folding stock can be a little odd, but it does not get in the way of the trigger OR the bolt. I DO find it rather unconventional.         OH and ONE LAST THING. in order to reload, you may want to take a good look at the pic which has the SIDE VIEW with the serial X''ed out. You would notice that i have put up a flower looking markers at one place right below the weapon. If you look closely, you see a button right above it on the side frame of the weapon (right before where it says "made in Turkey". In order to reload shells into the shotgun, this button NEEDS to be pressed at the time of loading. This makes for reloading this weapon a little clumsy process, but with practice it gets to be an easy procedure. Though i would rather NOT have this button and reload the cartridges into the tube directly. Also, where the rear stock meets the frame of the weapon, there is an ever so slight play so the rear stock wiggles a very tiny little bit. While this is possibly bad for the accuracy of a weapon, in a shotgun like this which is meant for me to be used in SD scenarios of 50 yards maximum, it does not  make  a difference. There (2) things are the only caveat of this otherwise very wonderful weapon.\nThe plastic pistol grip is very comfortable . The rear stock has an integrated recoil pad which makes rapid fire with this weapon very sweet as it absorbs the recoil very well. However, even with the stock folded, this weapon is a breeze to shoot as most of the recoil is absorbed  by the inertia driven bolt that cycles the weapon after each round.', ''),

RWS DIANA 34 (the newer one and the one i am talking about) has great Power and accuracy! .22 cal. is ideal for hunting small game and pests. TO6 2-stage adjustable trigger. Up to 800 fps in .22 cal with lighter lead pellets. A review from pyramidair shows that it simply outclasses Diana 35. Here it is:\nThe most popular rifle sold by RWS, this German rifle will keep you shooting accurately and powerfully for decades. While it doesn''t have some of the frills that more expensive guns have, it goes head-to-head where it really counts! The well-balanced hardwood stock makes it easy to hold and shoot the RWS 34. Quality is evident in other places, too: a two-stage adjustable trigger, fiber optic sights (fully adj. rear) and a finely rifled barrel. No need to worry about cocking difficulty, as that''s where this rifle really shines (just 33 lbs.). Both calibers are ideal for plinking, paper targets and spinners. Like to hunt? The .22 cal. should be your choice for small game and pests. If you''re a serious airgunner on a budget, the RWS 34 was made for you!', ''),

(376897, 'Review: Germanica Autoloader Shotgun Salams!\r\n\r\nThe Germanica Hunter Mod Combo package, a 7+1 capacity 12 Gauge Autoloader, was left waiting for me to be picked up at Hira Arms last year, when, charmed by something else of more [I]compact[/I] nature – [I]and quite unjustly  to the waiting retailer at Hira Ams [/I]– I returned home from Lahore[I] honey-mooning[/I] a petite Tomahawk pump-action 4+1 instead, purchased from another dealer.\r\n\r\nFate wanted me, however, to legally “wedlock” the Germanica Semi-Auto this year, a day before Ramazan, during a Lahore flash-visit and with the kind assistance as usual by respected friend and fellow bro Naveed Pk, who kept it clean and well greased till my collection, all the way since actual purchase in April or so.\r\n\r\nBeing pre-dominantly a hand-gunner, I may never desire/manage stretching myself beyond the purchase of mid-end items in shotguns as such, and the choice this year also had to be made between two excellent such items from the relatively more budgetary range, as well as from 2 of the more popular models with clean, proven track records here on PG:\r\n\r\n[COLOR="blue"][SIZE="5"][I]1)[/I][/SIZE]	[SIZE="5"][I]The Hatsan Escort 7+1 Autoloader Combo version[/COLOR]\r\n\r\n[COLOR="blue"]2)	Germanica Hunter Mod 7+1  Autoloader Combo model.[/COLOR][/I][/SIZE]\r\n\r\n\r\nIn purchasing my items, I’ve always preferred and strived my best to seek the correct balance between the 2 major purchase-specific factors of [I]reliability[/I] and [I]durability[/I], yet always in combination somehow with the 3.rd important factor to me as well, the [I]aesthetics[/I] and [I]tacti-cool features[/I], if I may use this expression by one our most respected 12G’ers around, our beloved and very own 12G bro.\r\n\r\nAs of such, though being heavily “Hatsan infected” by Denovo bro’s chilling review earlier here on the Hatsan Escort Autoloader, the choice as a process of “[I]natural selection of species[/I]” somehow went in favor of perhaps same class of a gun in durability/reliability and mechanical function as the Hatsan Escort, yet to me, the somewhat better looking, more smooth n’ cool finessed, [I]tacti-cool[/I] Germanica Hunter Mod 7+1 Combo package.\r\n\r\nThe hell-blaster acquired has a fantastic appearance and a 1.st impression impact of “Katrina-like” [I]silk n’ smooth[/I] matte finish texture, which appears course as quite a [I]stigma[/I] to it''s actual devastating nature.\r\n\r\nThough appearing visually as being kind of more "delicate” than the more "rugged looking" Hatsan Escort, it nevertheless features the same working robustness as of the Escort - or any of the better Turk brands out there - since, as you probably do already know, we’ve the general feeling here on PG, that the manufacture[I] origin[/I] of all, or at least of some of the most  popular models out there from Turkey, literally happens to be the same, namely Hatsan''s!!!\r\n\r\nAnyhow, the review is being  divided over Part 1 (Intro) and Part II (Field Test) further below, with vids and pics included, and finally adding a brief conclusion by the end of the post.\r\n\r\nI’m not quite the right man to review a shotgun in full details, so kindly do bear with me, in whatever comes up below:\r\n\r\n[SIZE="7"][COLOR="black"]PART 1:[/COLOR][/SIZE]\r\n\r\n\r\n[COLOR="red"][SIZE="5"]The shotgun comes with:[/SIZE][/COLOR]\r\n\r\n[COLOR="blue"][B]1)    18” security barrel.\r\n2)    28” ribbed Hunting barrel \r\n3)    Tube extension to convert from 5+1 to 7+1 cap.\r\n4)    4 chokes\r\n5)    Polymer furniture.[/B][/COLOR]\r\n\r\n\r\n[SIZE="5"][COLOR="red"]The Box:[/COLOR][/SIZE]\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i1136.photobucket.com/albums/n497/wahstar1/GERMANICA/GERMANICA%20PG%20UPLOAD/Germanica1.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i1136.photobucket.com/albums/n497/wahstar1/GERMANICA/GERMANICA%20PG%20UPLOAD/Germanica2.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\n[SIZE="5"][COLOR="red"] The Hunting Barrel, 28" long :[/COLOR][/SIZE]\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i1136.photobucket.com/albums/n497/wahstar1/GERMANICA/GERMANICA%20PG%20UPLOAD/Germanica4ExtrabarrelMedium.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\n[SIZE="5"][COLOR="red"]The Chokes:\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i1136.photobucket.com/albums/n497/wahstar1/GERMANICA/GERMANICA%20PG%20UPLOAD/Range002Small.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\n[/COLOR][/SIZE]\r\n\r\nAnd since I''ve always been more [I]security concerned [/I]about shotguns, and only occasionally hunting, I found this beautiful and very practical side-folder with pistol grip to couple it up with, for easier [I][B][COLOR="red"]vehicular carry:[/COLOR][/B][/I]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i1136.photobucket.com/albums/n497/wahstar1/GERMANICA/GERMANICA%20PG%20UPLOAD/Work0Butt.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\n\r\n[SIZE="5"][COLOR="black"]And now let''s move on to the customized beauty, with self-descriptive texts and pictorial coverage[I] exclusively dedicated to PakGuns.Com:[/I][/COLOR][/SIZE]\r\n\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i1136.photobucket.com/albums/n497/wahstar1/GERMANICA/GERMANICA%20PG%20UPLOAD/Customized1.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i1136.photobucket.com/albums/n497/wahstar1/GERMANICA/GERMANICA%20PG%20UPLOAD/Customized4rightprofileMedium.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i1136.photobucket.com/albums/n497/wahstar1/GERMANICA/GERMANICA%20PG%20UPLOAD/Customized6TriggerSmall.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i1136.photobucket.com/albums/n497/wahstar1/GERMANICA/GERMANICA%20PG%20UPLOAD/Customized5leftprofileMedium.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i1136.photobucket.com/albums/n497/wahstar1/GERMANICA/GERMANICA%20PG%20UPLOAD/Customized7chamberactionSmall.gif[/IMG]\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i1136.photobucket.com/albums/n497/wahstar1/GERMANICA/GERMANICA%20PG%20UPLOAD/Customized9TubeglassMedium.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\n\r\n[SIZE="6"][COLOR="black"]Continued below in next post:[/COLOR][/SIZE]', ''),

(376899, ' [QUOTE=Maximus;215392]I believe thats an self-opinionated statement. Its a huge accusation to be making about a company that has been delivering economical products and bells n whistles that make the moderate gun-user proud. I agree with you that some firearms may have had their cons but mostly are known and easily fixable.\n[/QUOTE]\nI am sorry to have offended you by my opinionated statement.\nI believe that mostly In Pk we buy weapons for self defence and not range plinkers. No new gun out of factory should  need a repair out of the box however easy to fix. We don''t have  any concept of customer service or after sale warranty here and good gunsmiths are hard to find. ( BTW OP doesn''t know how to degrease the weapon what to talk of diagnosing a problem for repair. Its true for 99.9% of users here. )\nMy opinion is based on performance of 7 different Taurus 24/7, 03 PT-92, 02 PT-145, 01 917, 01 24/7 .45 OSS and 02 709s which all had minor or major problems. IMHO if in the same or lesser price we can buy a combat weapon with proven track record and no quality control issues then we should opt for that. YMMV', ''),

Shotgun[I] slinged[/I] and with flash-light on at night, distance 50 Feet, 6 Shots of POF SG, [B]in about 3-4 seconds[/B]:\n\n\n[IMG]http://i1136.photobucket.com/albums/n497/wahstar1/GERMANICA/GERMANICA%20PG%20UPLOAD/Range009Small.jpg[/IMG]\n\nYou may have your comments on above shots, yet don''t forget, these are[B] not[/B] aimed shots. The 1.st shot was kind of[I] point-to-shoot[/I] only, remaining shots, slinged from the hip,[I] commando style[/I].\n\n\n[SIZE="6"][COLOR="red"]Conclusion:[/COLOR][/SIZE]\n\nI have to say this shotgun really impressed me with very smooth and reliable cycling with different types of loads and with nil issues at all during the cherry popping event. We already have a track record from Naveed PK bro, with a firing history of +300 shells from the Germanica Autoloader and [B]nil[/B] issues.\n\nRecoil is very "soft", manageable, and there&#8217;s absolutely no muscular discomfort, soreness, etc, even after a set of quick rapid fires.\n\nI deliberately did not go beyond 15 mtrs, hence 50 feet, in the shots above, since the purpose was to establish it&#8217;s patterning from SD distances, or slightly above SD distances, when shot from a 18&#8221; security barrel.\n\nWe already do have reports from Naveed PK bro, downing a flying duck from some 75-80 yards using the Germanica&#8217;s extra supplied 28&#8221; long hunting barrel. I shall report back later sometimes on the patterning from the longer barrel, but would need to visit the fields again, once weather has settled down a bit for the better.\n\nThe side-folder was a pleasure to use and is practical for both security as well as hunting purposes, not disturbing the balance of the shotgun when attached. Since I&#8217;m an occasional hunter only, I truly do not think I&#8217;d need to replace it with the stock one for hunting, the side-folder serves me pretty fine.\n\nFinally, I have to say, since I&#8217;ve always been more[I] security use concerned[/I] with shotguns, I was really impressed by the[I] added control[/I] and fast[I] target re-acquisition[/I] that an autoloader gives over the traditionally preferred pump-action types. Used with the right and carefully selected ammunition, I&#8217;d say, it even has an edge over the pump action, no doubts.\n\n[I][COLOR="red"][B]My brief verdict is:[/B][/COLOR][/I]\n\nThe Germanica Autoloader reviewed here is an excellent shotgun and a very fine alternative to the Hatsan Escort, if you&#8217;re looking for the same kind of reliability/durability and a smooth functioning budget shotgun, yet with quite some added charisma to the finishing works, appearance.\n\n[COLOR="blue"]Priced at some $600 or so, it&#8217;s no doubts a [I]value-for-money[/I] deal here in Pakistan.[/COLOR]\n\n\nRegards.', ''),

The 9mm has been selected for the same reason  as the 5.56 round has been chosen over the 7.62 Nato round by the U.S. and NATO forces. \n\nSmaller round means more ammo for the same weight. Higher capacity firearms for the same weight means more sustained outgoing fire and less frequent reloading.   Having smaller bullets means less stress on the supply chain also. This is the reason why the former Soviet Union also switched to the 5.45 round from the 7.62x 39 round.\n When millions and millions or bullets are being used (as to equip and train a large army and in the scenario of war, cents saved per bullet in terms of production costs/ transportation/ carrying translates into SIGNIFICANT savings.\n\n, [B][B]the aim of military planners is NOT to kill an opposing soldier, but rather to seriously injure  so that MUCH more resources of the enemy aAlsore tied down in rescuing/ transporting and taking care of the injured soldiers. This is another major reason why no army uses hollow point bullets which are clearly more effective in terms of their stopping power.[/B]Un quote\n\nThe Geneva convention prevents use of soft point, Hollow point and such bullets which have an expanding jacket.\nHow ever the Armies cancel this out by keeping the center of gravity well back by the spitzer shape and use of steel core and some  times an air bubble or cavity in the nose like in case of  Russian 5.45X 39 ammo. This creates a marginally stable bullet in flight and on impacting an enemy the bullet tumbles immediately after penetrating creating  ghastly wounds. \nThe 7.62X39 is not as devastating as the 5.45 X 39 at upto 200 m on soft targets. \nThe 7.62X51 POF ammo is extremely powerful and to say the least most lethal and feared on the battle fields upto 600m and beyond. The mare Tak-- DUM sound ( typical signature of G 3 bullets at long range)  at the business end; makes enemy think soldiers twice, as it is literally like a small grenade exploding inside a torso\nThe soldiers in contact want KILLABILITY , the evacuation begins after the operation is over and re organisation completed.\nIf a soldier finds that the enemy bullets  will kill him, but his bullets will only wound the enemy, believe me the game is over at first contact. There can not be another MORALE lowering  thing  like this.\nThe 5.56 X45 is lethal upto 200 m the range at which the modern armies open up other than Snipers etc. At longer ranges they have many other weapons and weapon systems to engage with. The 5.56 bullet breaks up into three parts by design and creates a lethal effect.\n How ever engagements do take place at over 300 and sometimes 400 m with rifles and Squad autos where the 556 is found lacking and soldiers of the US infantry are unhappy with it. \nThat is why  the 6.8 X45 was developed and thousands of rifles issued but the conversion has been put on hold for some reason either a more devastating round or the planned dis engagement and economic belt tightening.\nThe .45 ACP is back again but only because its 230 grain bullet is subsonic and is fired at velocities of 830 FPS from pistols and about 1000 FPS from Machine Pistols and Sub Machine Guns which can be completely silenced. The increased use of silencers on SMGs and pistols precludes the use of 9mm which when fired at the reduced subsonic velocities to reduce its signature loses KILL ABILITY. \nA soldier in close combat has only one thing on his mind,   [B]kill instantly to avoid being killed.[/B]', ''),

I would strongly recommend that you do not use any ammonia based cleaners on it as it can harm the copper layer underneath nickel plating. that will destroy the top layer of nickel.\r\n\r\nwith normal use, like any decorative plating (such as chrome) nickel plating will eventually wear off. the best thing that you could do to protect the nickel finish is to handle it as less as you can. keep it away from your hands while gripping and handling. do not use it roughly.

(376982, ' @ Skeeter60 sb\nMany of your observations are correct if you take the view of the present. However, going by the timeline of the past,\n\nFirst of all, it was not the Geneva Convention of 1925 that banned JHP use , it was the first Hague Convention of 1899 (Declaration 3). @ that time FMJ''s were still regular FMJ''s without the modern fancy tech to make them devastating against flesh, compared to JHP, and hence FMJ''s were considered to be less damaging. The idea behind the convention was to make warfare more HUMANE and not to deliberately KILL. \n\nIt is only later that, as you rightly pointed out, that the modern lighter bullets of 5.45x39 caliber (which, agreed, causes debilitating injuries on  tissue) and also the 5.56x45 Nato caliber were adopted by modern armies.\n\nHowever, the transition to these calibers were made for economics/ ease of carry/ ability for a soldier to carry more rounds for the same weight etc reasons. \n\nThe design features to make them more lethal came afterwards to compensate for the potentially reduced damage due to smaller size.  You have rightly pointed out that the 7.62x51 ( .308) is a far more devastating round than a 5.56x45 nato round, however, the transition still took place in the 70''s for the reasons stated above by the U.S. and then much later by the Soviets in the 80''s who also quickly found the above mentioned points to be very advantageous. \n\nThe 6.5x39 Grendel round, while being extremely effective against amour and tissue,  has been put on hold for an indefinite period as the U.S. armed forces, possibly due to the large cost involved in the transition, and they have found that using a 62 grain  bullet for its 5.56x45 round is much more effective than the traditional 55 grain bullets which were proving to be less effective at halting  a skinny malnourished  Tango on drugs brandishing an AK. Now the U.S. is using the 62 grain bullet as standard issue and many of the complaints have reduced.  \n\n.45 caliber is also making a comeback due to the reason you have mentioned for some special forces use, However, overall, the soldiers in the conventional role are also preferring the regular .45 for its general use (non-subsonic / non suppressed) proven stopping power as compared with the the stopping power of a regular 9mm. The link in my post below is actually a petition by the soldiers to Congress imploring to adopt the .45 cal round as standard for a sidearm.\n\nAlso, the 9mm is pretty much ineffective against conventional body armour (with hard plates) in terms of immediate stopping power and hence even the world revered MP-5 first moved to a .45 cal (UMP)- rather unsuccessfully, and now to the MP-7 with its 4.6x30 round especially designed to punch through body armour.\n\nI once again reiterate that all things being equal, a larger round will cause much more damage than a smaller round under any circumstances.', ''),

(377199, ' [QUOTE=12GAUGE;215661]is this me or we are pitting a round (.45ACP) which just one (or may be few) military employs against a round (9mm) which the rest of the free world is using?\n\nRegards.\n\np.s. I am sure, the rest of the free world doesn''t have a clue how good a .45ACP round is. lols![/QUOTE]\n \n@ 12gauge: Brother. Judging the capability of a round in this discussion by the number of conventional military units around the would  would be a fallacy. \nA military, as an organization,  has its own thinking/ thought process when selecting a round as its standard military issue. This would include standardization, more loose tolerances  (in order for weapons to be able to take more abuse/less maintenance) , and compromise between extreme performance has to be made for good economics.\n\n\nUs, civilians and the ELITE military units (who are called to shoot in excess of 1000 yard mark with accuracy) have the luxury to go for more expensive, higher performance ''gadgets'' with tighter tolerances. Example are match grade barrels for one.  For example, the elite  snipers are issued (amongst many other top of the line sniping systems for varying usages) the M40 weapon system which is a heavily modified version of the already very accurate Remington 700 bolt rifle chambered in the .308 (7.62x51). Even the rounds they use are hand-loaded and they do not use OTC (over the counter ) factory loads for their use.  Even though a factory loaded .308 is dead accurate for most us.  I am also told that Elite sniper units would replace the barrels on their sniping systems after a couple of hundred rounds fired. \n\nThe key question here is what round is better at STOPPING power. I define Stopping power of a round as that which can reliably incapacitate, or "stop", a human target IMMEDIATELY. (this does not mean a shot in the head, or incapacitation after a few minutes of bleeding. The round should reliably and effectively stop a human IMMEDIATELY and a shot in the stomach and flesh should do the same).\nWhen it comes to a 9mm parabellum (7.65x22 mm) bullet vs a .45 ACP (11.43x23mm) bullet , it would be wise to analyze its performance based on observing the people who get to use handguns chambered for these rounds and who have had the most experience in using it against other humans.  The U.S. police forces are one such group who frequently use  handguns in such a scenario.\nWhile the majority of the police departments issue the 9mm parabellum weapons as standards, the bullets being used are everything BUT standard. They are usually HOT rounds of ''+P+'' rating that generate a much higher pressure when they go off (resulting in a higher bullet velocity and hence energy)   (there are standard rounds like the POF , then there is the ''+P'' rated rounds which are hotter and then finally there is the +P+ rated ammo which is the hottest / generating ultra high pressures(hot = generating higher pressure) .  In some states in the U.S. +P+ rated rounds are legal only for law enforcement use.  Then there are newer fancier bullets such as the Federal premium Hydrashok JHP bullets which are designed for max stopping power (as opposed to standard bullets in fmj or jhp design).  With such ''non-standard'' ammo, the 9mm becomes a more effective bullet at 1-shot stopping power ( bear in mind that all bullets CAN kill, but few bullets are "renowned" for their immediate stopping power and these are .357 mag and .45 acp to start with --there are many others but these are the most common renowned man-stoppers). .45 acp can also be +P+ but then it becomes MUCH harder to control an already difficult round to control (when compared to its smaller siblings). \nExperienced ''cops'' usually favour the .45 acp over 9mm parabellum as they know what constitutes a more effective. Rookie cops are always issued  9mm and with the +p+ rated bullets along with higher mag capacities of these weapons which makes taking follow up shots ''easier'' they are quite effective also.  Look at any police shooting in the U.S. and you would find that officers hardly ever shoot ONCE, they shoot and keep shooting till the target is down (this practice became standard around the time 9mm sidearms started becoming common). I remember there was a police shooting in New York city some time back where the ''suspect'' was shot more than 50 times by 7 police officers who THOUGHT that he drew a weapon at one of them!.\n\nAs i have mentioned before, i carry a 9mm handgun with Federal Hydrashock ammo and a .357 mag snubbie. Even though a .45 is ''better'' at stopping power, given that all variables are the same when compared to a 9mm, i still carry a 9mm handgun as i can go plinking relatively cheaply with my POF FMJ''s, i can practice more for a lesser price and it is easier on my hands, and it has a higher mag capacity for the same weight. \n\nSo even though a .45 acp is more of an effective round for SD, i (and countless others) still choose a 9mm for its other inherent benefits . But i would STRICTLY advise people using 9mm parabellum rounds for SD to use the BEST and hottest load their handgun would permit for their SD purposes (many handguns cannot handle +p+ loads) and NEVER EVER EVER use FMJ 9mm''s  for this purpose.', ''),

AOA.\nI was going to get a RWS 34 classic (price was 32k) but when I went to the shop, Badruddin and Son in Rawalpindi, I saw this sheer beauty and bought it without a second thought. It was very reasonably priced at just Rs 40k and I didn''t hesitate in getting this beauty.\n\nThe gun is very balanced, and although it''s weight is 8lbs as compared to the normal rws350 magnum''s weight of 8.20lbs, it feels very much lighter than the latter. The gun is very well balanced and feels like half the weight of the normal 350magnum.M.A I got a good piece and the recoil is almost half than that of the 350 magnum I had and it''s much more accurate due to this fact. Although I have just shot 3 pellets through it, really amused by this slim and fun-to-use airgun. It''s stock does not have a raised cheek-piece and that is what I like the most about it. With the other 350mag, I couldn''t aim properly as the stock would hit my jaws due to raised cheeck-piece and high recoil. It''s very comfortable to use and what I liked the MOST are the well-made fiber optic''s which simply outshine the normal 350 mag''s useless, cheap iron sights, and not to miss the TO-6 trigger.\nAt that shop, they had Gamo Shadow 1000 for Rs 21k, Gamo Whisper for 22.5k, rws 34 classic for 32k, rws 34 premium for 37, rws 34 professional for 35k, got mine the 350 Feuerkraft for 40k and they had the 460 magnum for 45k.....ALL NIB.\nHere are the pics:\n[IMG]http://i1203.photobucket.com/albums/bb399/B77W/rws350classic016.jpg[/IMG]\n[IMG]http://i1203.photobucket.com/albums/bb399/B77W/rws350classic017.jpg[/IMG]\n[IMG]http://i1203.photobucket.com/albums/bb399/B77W/rws350classic019.jpg[/IMG]\n[IMG]http://i1203.photobucket.com/albums/bb399/B77W/rws350classic018.jpg[/IMG]\n[IMG]http://i1203.photobucket.com/albums/bb399/B77W/rws350classic020.jpg[/IMG]\n[IMG]http://i1203.photobucket.com/albums/bb399/B77W/rws350classic021.jpg[/IMG]\n[IMG]http://i1203.photobucket.com/albums/bb399/B77W/rws350classic023.jpg[/IMG]\n[IMG]http://i1203.photobucket.com/albums/bb399/B77W/rws350classic022.jpg[/IMG]\n[IMG]http://i1203.photobucket.com/albums/bb399/B77W/rws350classic025.jpg[/IMG]\nthis pattern is just oiling\n[IMG]http://i1203.photobucket.com/albums/bb399/B77W/rws350classic024.jpg[/IMG]', ''),

The post is quite straight forward and based on facts that i know best. These are my opinions and one of my opinions is to use the hottest load for  SD as possible.   \n\nThe issue was effectiveness of  9mm parabellum vs 45 acp and this was a side note to something a member had asked.  \n\nYou are right that most quality weapons can take up +P and +p+ but it is to be responsible to inform everyone of the possible ''side effects'' especially when ALL readers may not be able to afford 50k plus handguns.  \n\nAlso while not many members here visit ranges often, there might be some , like me , who do so regularly.\n\n Lastly, i am quite strongly opinionated @ the fact that any firearms that i keep/carry are for use in the ''worst case'' scenario where its use would be to save my life or the life of my loved ones. For such a scenario i, personally, would want all advantage i can get in terms of having the most effective bullets i can get my hands on.  While , Alhamdullilah, i have  never been put in such a situation and i hope that Allah never puts me in such a situation requiring use of a firearm in self defense, i would rather buy the BEST and most powerful 18 bullets i can for my primary SD magazine  and  NOT have to worry about any POTENTIAL regrets about shortchanging my self defense cartridges for saving a few hundred rupees.\n\nThanks for the  kind words.', ''),

Let''s start in order:\nIn Bosnia most available guns are from Glock family, Ceska Zbrojovka, Smith&Wesson and Zastava. Also you can find beretta models but they are very rare. Prices are - Glock 17=650 euros; CZ 75B=600 euros; CZ 99=460 euros; CZ999=600 euros; CZ 75 SP01 Shadow=930 euros; S&W M&P9=600 euros!\nLong range shooting is a competitive shooting on 300 and 500m. We have a regional "Balkan league" in long range shooting and we organise competitions in Bosnia, Serbia, Montenegro and Slovenia. There are two classes in longe range: TR(tactical rifle) with calibers .223, .308, 8x57 Mauser and OPEN where all calibers from .223 to .338 Lapua are allowed. Most shooters are using bolt action rifles and many of them are custom made. Best ten shooters on 300m later shooting on 500m.

So that makes me eligible to bag 15 grouse per day. Possession limit is simply the limit of grouse you can have whether you have it with u or at home in the freezer, in total you should have no more than 15 birds at a time. Secondly, as i mentioned before that "WE" only had one shotgun because initially we were on a deer hunt. the total number of hunters were 4. i shot my limit and the others shot theirs. Thirdly, i said that we could have scored 40, so if one hunter can bag up  to 15 and you times it by 4, that makes it 60 grouse on a two day hunt. i am blessed with such good hunting in an area with healthy wild life population, the laws are strict here and us like all other hunters follow them and to be honest with you, one does not feel the need to go out of his way and get involve in such illegal activities due to the well organized and well managed hunting system. all you have to do is purchase your permits and head out into the woods. \n              hope that clarifies your concerns.\nBig Bore.', ''),

"[B]Us, civilians and the ELITE military units[/B]" are we kidding me? so... you think civilians use their handguns to shoot in excess of 1000 yard mark? where have you been doing your reading? lols!\n\n\n\nPause!, READ AGAIN! what is 9 mm in metric? you may consider this a trick question. ;)\n\n\n\nhave you ever seen a 9 mm hole (entrance or exit) vs a 45ACP hole? I take it that you haven''t. cause if you have then you would agree that there isn''t much difference between the two. \n\ninfact if you compare a 9mm HP hole to 45 FMJ hole you cannot tell them apart. if you truly believe that a standard 45ACP FMJ is good man stopper then a 9mm HP is also a good man stopper because it too makes the same size hole at similar energy levels. so using 45ACP is pointless at best.\n\nthe trick is not the use the biggest round to get the desired effect but to use the smallest/weakest rounds that gets the job done effectively. that is where 9mm wins hands down.\n\nRegards.[/QUOTE]\n\n@ 12guage:   Brother, I do not want to sound condescending. I am not aware of your age/ background/ experience but i would say this:\n\nyou missed the ENTIRE point of the post.   \n \nLet me sum it up for you again so you may understand what i am saying and this ''useless'' argument may be put to rest:\n\n1- I am a big fan of the .45 but i myself carry a 9mm for SD (for reasons i have amply explained in my post including ease to master/ economical/ widely available ammo). There is a difference between the two, but it is not like the difference between the sun and the moon .This is why 9mm parabellum is VERY widely employed the world over.\n\n\n2- A larger round, all things being equal, would cause more damage/ has  more stopping power then a smaller round. (a large  rifle round is more  effective than a handgun round and a larger handgun round is more  effective than a smaller handgun round PERIOD).  Kindly note i use the  word ''MORE''.\n  \n3- While carrying a 9mm SD i would carry, and STRONGLY suggest, that users  carry the hottest/ most proven  rounds/ cartridges  rather than run of the mill bullets. The advise against use of FMJ bullets was a blanket advise covering ALL bullets of all calibers carried for the purpose of SD in a handgun.\n\n\n4- a Bullet / ANY BULLET will KILL/incapacitate  based on shot placement/ number of hits. \n\n\nP.S. That line you quoted " Us, civilians and the ELITE military units (who are called to shoot in excess of 1000 yard mark with accuracy)"   should be read "  Us civilians who can afford the BEST ammo , as well as ELITE military units (who are called to shoot in excess of 1000 yards) do not use standard military issue bullets" .   I hope we can move PAST wasting time in analyzing  use of grammar and focus on the underlying key points.\n\n\nAlso, if you disagree with any of the FOUR points above, i would appreciate your effort in proving me wrong with  quoted facts , figures and research as we are all in here to share and learn. \n\nBest regards.', ''),

(377482, 'Review and thoughts on: SAIGA 12K shotgun Dear All\nThe following is my Saiga 12k that i have modified slightly for my purposes. This is my favourite bed side home defense and vehicle carry for SD weapon despite its little quirks which i shall touch  upon later.\n\nOriginally i wanted a 12k variant and bought one. The 12k variant has a  17" barrel  ([B]K[/B] for "korotkaya", "short"). It came with an AK-style  pistol grip and folding stock and a specially-designed safety,  preventing operation with stock folded (due to Russian gun laws, it is  illegal to own a weapon able to fire while being less than 800 mm long).This safety does not allow for the weapon to discharge when the stock is folded. I have modified this safety as there is no similar law in Pakistan. The weapon also came with wooden furniture.\n\nFirst and foremost i changed the front wooden handguard with a UTG rail system allowing me to put up accessories such as a Torch and later, maybe a laser.  \n [ATTACH=CONFIG]4246[/ATTACH]\nThe rear folding stock is different from usual Saiga''s and is an similar to the  modern AK rifle design that the weapon is derived from. I have also removed the wooden pistol grip and installed a rubber hogue grip which makes shooting this weapon even more of a pleasure as it reduces felt recoil even further.\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]4247[/ATTACH]\nI put a flash hider on the front of the barrel. The barrel comes threaded from the factory and has a protective screw on cover on it. \n\n\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]4248[/ATTACH]\n\nThe shotgun came with a standard ak-type side rail. I put up a standard AK side mount and put up a red dot reflex sight. The side mount is great , however, the disadvantage now is that the stock cannot be fully folded (the mount gets in the way, so this weapon has become very cumbersome to carry in the vehicle with a guard.  I am considering removing the rear stock altogether and putting a pistol grip on the front handguard rail.\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]4249[/ATTACH]\n\nI have mounted a Maglite LED XL 50 torch on the front. It is  operated from a  push button in the rear tailcap and is Extremely bright with 104 lumens and when pointed to someone''s eyes in a 10 meter range , would cause them to close their eyes. While there are other more bright torch options ,i found this to be satisfactory for my needs given its small size.\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]4250[/ATTACH][ATTACH=CONFIG]4252[/ATTACH]\n\nThe weapon comes with a push button system that keeps the bolt open. The bolt will NOT remain open after the last round. It has to be pushed up manually while holding the bolt back to keep the bolt open.  For HD, i keep the bolt open with a magazine loaded. This may not be the safest method, but if the bolt is kept close, it causes a problem with the shells.\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]4251[/ATTACH][ATTACH=CONFIG]4253[/ATTACH]', ''),
(377483, ' The Bolt holding button is the grey button on the rear side of the trigger. It is depressed inwards while holding the bolt back manually.

Other variants come with  fixed notch and post sights. I am told there are other types of sights also made but i have not seen them as yet.[ATTACH=CONFIG]4256[/ATTACH]\n\nAs mentioned in the post below, the weapon is usually unloaded and locked in a safe when i am not around. Otherwise, i keep it bolt open. This is not the safest way to keep it, but if the bolt is closed (without a round being chambered, i have found catridges to get seriously deformed. When in a vehicle, the weapon has a chambered round with the safety UP. Also i keep the my magazines filled to 10x rather than the full 12 to keep the pressure off the top most plastic rounds.[ATTACH=CONFIG]4258[/ATTACH]', ''),

(377486, ' My surefire 12 rounder mag next to the standard 8 rounder and a 5 rounder that came with the weapon. [ATTACH=CONFIG]4269[/ATTACH][ATTACH=CONFIG]4272[/ATTACH]\nPROBLEMS and QUIRKS:\n\nThere are two issues with the weapon:\n\n1- IF you keep the magazine loaded to capacity and load it in the weapon,\na) it is quite difficult to do so with the bolt closed. The spring pressure from the mag is just too great to be able to have a smooth rock and lock mag loading. \nb) Once the fully loaded mag is put in place, the top most plastic shells start to deform from their circular shape due to the pressure of the mag spring. The solutions are  i) not to load the magazines to full capacity, ii) to keep a round chambered with the safety on (i would not recommend everyone to do this, it is something that i do).\nc) when i eject a chambered round, it seems like it is abused fairly well. The plastic sidewalls seem like they have been rubbing against something quite sharp. The shells themselves get a little deformed possibly during the chambering process when they are stripped from the magazine and lunged into the chamber by the powerful bolt.\n\n\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]4270[/ATTACH][ATTACH=CONFIG]4271[/ATTACH]\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]4268[/ATTACH]\n\nLastly, the weapon has a  gas regulator adjustment system given on its gas tube and marked ''1'' and ''2'' .  Position ''1'' is for regular load cartridges up to magnum load.     Position ''2'' is to be used for using light loads- This would make the gas port MORE open or fully open to let more gas inside the gas tube to push the piston back to cycle another round.   However, i have never changed position on mine to ''2'' and i have used shotgun shells bearing numbers  00,  4,5,6 ( All Shaheen) so far the weapon has cycled perfectly.\n\n\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]4273[/ATTACH]', ''),

The magazine would load just fine in the weapon but the round would not chamber properly and hold the bolt back. Maybe this is unique behaviour to my weapon. The solution was to ensure that the round on top of the magazine is pushed back snuggly against the magazine wall.\n(Problem)\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]4275[/ATTACH]\n\n(Solution)\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]4276[/ATTACH]\n\n\nThis weapon a breeze to shoot, very little felt recoil with ability for very quick follow up shots.

(377706, ' Here I would like to put light on another issue. There have been two type of calibers came in Makarov. .38 ACP and 9x18mm. The first one has the caliber-diameter of .356" (9.02) and the later one has .364" (9.2 mm). Here in Pakistan both the ammunitions are available and present in the personal stocks. Firing the bullets of one caliber into the Makrov with different bore can create a problem. Baikal-442 is a 9x18mm pistol. One more thing is, Makarov is a pistol of largest caliber in the world, which operates with blow back mechanism. In the pistols with blow back mechanism, bullet stuck in the barrel is a common phenomenon. Fine tuning (Cleansing of the barrel) is a pre-requisite for smooth running of a Makarov.', ''),

He said that ideal pellets for the 350 mag are 13-16 grains.. 24.69 grains H&N rabbit magnums put too much strain on the spring and it breaks before time. I also saw reviews of these pellets on different sites and they all stated that these pellets are very in-accurate and only reasonable hunting groups can be achieved upto 10 yards.... At 30 yards, an air-rifle was making 6 inch groups using these pellets, so I think instead of wasting 2400 rupees on these pellets, I should have had gotten some other ones.', ''),

(377796, 'H&amp;N Rabbit Magnum II pellets- Brief Review AOA all,\n I decided to spare a few minutes of my time writing a review on these expensive and inaccurate pellets as I have a tin (200 pellets) of these in my inventory. In the beginning, I thought these big, fat pellets were the ''boss'' of all .22 pellets. But that impression was changed after the first shot in my 350 magnum and a few reviews from the net + the price.\nIn 3 months, I have just shot 8 of these pellets, or a more appropriate word for these mightier ones would be ''slugs''. They are very hard to fit in all air-rifles as the base of these slugs is 5.55mm whereas most of the other .22 pellets are about 5.52mm. This fact makes them not very comfortable to use and is bad for the rifle. Secondly, they are highly in-accurate and would receive a big fat 0 for long range shooting. As suggested by the manufacturers that their range is 5/5, this range gives you an accuracy of 0/5. From 10 yards, these rifles produce reasonable hunting groups only. From 25 yards and onwards, groups start dispersing all over the target and reach up to 6 inches at 30 yards and if we calculate what it would be like at 90 yards with my rws350 magnum, from these stats we find out that it would create 18 inch groups. These slugs have a rainbow-like trajectory with a huge drop after a reasonable distance. These slugs are fine use in PCP''s, but not for any kind of springers, even the magnum springers. They reduce the spring''s life due to heaviness like a boulder, and often make it in-consistent. However apart from the drawbacks, I like the solid shape of these, the small tip at the top of these ''slugs'' for penetration and the weight.\nIf you are shooting small to medium sized game with a powerful air rifle at close range, then these pellets would surely do the job. They have enough power to take-down unwanted critters like pests (rabbits and hares) and jackals ,foxes, piglets, etc.\nSurely not good value for money. However, they are cheaper in USA than in Al-Sayad Dubai.\nOnly if they could improve the accuracy of these. If you want something solid and powerful in .22 and have a powerful air rifle, try the H&N Barracuda''s or Beeman Kodiak''s (both are in the 21 grain range).\nHere''s a pic of my tin\n[IMG]http://i1203.photobucket.com/albums/bb399/B77W/pellets3.jpg[/IMG]\nRegards\np.s These facts/opinions are based on my research and interaction with the pellets, however they may vary with rifle to rifle and all ........ !', ''),

It is not a question of Legality but a question of sensibility and prudence. The Question is: "Should I purchase my first weapon from Chaudry Arms Dealer as well or should I go to other reputable arms dealers such as P.A.R.A or Buksh Elahi Traders etc.???" What do you guys suggest???\n\nI wish to buy a Taurus Pt-92 as my first weapon. Currently Chaudry Arms don''t have it with them, but they say that they will arrange it for me from their other shop i.e. Mokel Arms in Nila Gumbad. But I am worried about being my weapon NIB. I have learned from seniors comments on this forum that weapon in a NIB condition should be in a box and it is greased from factory. However, I was shown many weapons which were on display and they claimed all of them to be completely New. They were dry and not greased as said. I am Worried and Confused!!!

(378041, ' I just read the entire thread with quite a lot of interest. I don''t personally own a gun as yet, but am looking forward to getting a 9mm pistol. My personal reasons are: more ammo capacity than a .45 and cheaper ammo. Ofcourse, being new to handguns in general, my preference is based on my inexperience (I''d require lots of ammo for practice and a higher ammo capacity if things get hairy).\n\nBut one thing I''m a firm believer of is that, no matter what type ammo you''re packing, shot placement is king. Even a so-called "lowly" .22LR put between the eyes will put anybody down. Although I somewhat agree with Trajan that a .45 ACP may pack a more powerful punch than a 9mm (as per the Jeff Cooper gospel), the 9mm IMHO is equally adept at putting down a target; plus as 12Gauge pointed out, if you''re using 9mm JHP''s then you''ll definitely be punching above your weight.\n\nThe Romans were the first army to train their soldiers in "shot economy"; strike the head, neck or groin and your target goes down for the count. Same principal with modern ammo, hit any of the "Holy Trinity" and it''s game over. The reason I''d personally go a 9mm is because, quite frankly, its EXTREMELY difficult to hit such small body areas on a moving/hidden target (easier to hit the torso, but no guarantee that you''ll disable your target), and thus would need more rounds to achieve a critical strike. Ofcourse, I''m looking at a shootout-type scenario, and prudence dictates that I pray for the best but always prepare for the worst.', ''),

I have a VOLCANIC 12 gauge shotgun which is eerily similar to the Germanic (other than the fact that volcanic only came with one side folding stock and one barrel) and i find loading it to be a pain. The button on the side needs to be pressed which means that my left hand is tied down in a particular state keeping it pressed.  While this way of loading could be mastered, i do not recommend it and rather would stay with the conventional method found in other shotguns- which i find to be quicker and simpler in operation when it come to reloading especially under stress.\nAK47 brother, the weapon that is more efficient (hence better) in reloading, in my opinion, is the one that has fewer and simpler steps and i just cannot see that with the Germanica or Volcanic or any other weapon with a similar push button type requirement.', ''),

I have shot around 70-80 shells out of it mostly on lined up bricks and they consistently go down quickly and i am impressed at this quality coming from a reasonable priced reflex sight. I guess with a shotgun i dont really require an absolute zero like a rifle especially for 25 yards reflex shooting. \n\nAfter i remove the rear stock, i would put up a regular foregrip without the bipod.

(378125, ' [QUOTE=Trajan;216708]@ 12guage and AK47.  I have a VOLCANIC 12 gauge shotgun which is eerily similar to the Germanic (other than the fact that volcanic only came with one side folding stock and one barrel) and i find loading it to be a pain. The button on the side needs to be pressed which means that my left hand is tied down in a particular state keeping it pressed.  While this way of loading could be mastered, i do not recommend it and rather would stay with the conventional method found in other shotguns- which i find to be quicker and simpler in operation when it come to reloading especially under stress.\r\nAK47 brother, the weapon that is more efficient (hence better) in reloading, in my opinion, is the one that has fewer and simpler steps and i just cannot see that with the Germanica or Volcanic or any other weapon with a similar push button type requirement.[/QUOTE]\r\n \r\nThis is exactly what I have been trying to say all along. fewer steps involved translates to lesser probability of a screw up under high stress situation. I wonder why its difficult to understand such a simple argument. ;)\r\n\r\n[B][U]TO THOSE WHO BELIEVE THAT THIS IS NOT A DECISIVE FACTOR:[/U][/B]\r\n\r\nWell! to them I would say, this lack of feature comes at a higher price instead of a lower. Hatsan Combo which comes with a speed loader is available at lower price instead of higher. \r\n\r\nif a buyer wants to buy Germanica, he/she will be getting less features for more price. for a Hatsan, he/she will be getting more features for less price. This argument should be enough to make anybody understand which is a better gun. HENCE, A [B]DECISIVE/CONCLUSIVE[/B] FACTOR.\r\n\r\nRegards.', ''),

I guess with a shotgun i dont really require an absolute zero like a rifle especially for 25 yards reflex shooting. \r\n\r\nAfter i remove the rear stock, i would put up a regular foregrip without the bipod. There is no need for  a bipod in this weapon as i dont really need to hold it dead steady for long range shooting.

Let me ask in simple terms, and correct me where I am wrong:\n \n1) If you have say 4-5 licenses, all MOI, all NPB, and you submit separate application for each, do you have to attach copies of other[I] applied for [/I]licenses to each of the applications? Means, say you''re submitting 1 revalidation application for 1 NPB license, but you have 4 more, and the form says that you have to attch copies of other licenses, now will you attach a copy of each of other 4 licenses to this particular application, regardless of the fact that you are already applying for their revalidations separately?? I hope I managed to explain.\n \nDo you have to fill out 2 of those column 1-41 forms for each license? And attach 2 pictures to each, hence 4 pictures to each application?\n \nFinally, did you use blue ink in the retainer part??\n \n \nKindly attend, this is indeed one helluva "Janjaalpura", lolz!\n \n \nRegards.[/QUOTE]\n \n \n \n[FONT=Times New Roman]Yes bro  u did manage to explain. Actually, to my understanding, column 22 asks for the photocopies and info  of the MOI licenses , other than that u rgiving the particulars in the form. I think it is sufficient to attach the photocopies and other info (on a separate paper if u think appropriate). However if u wantto fill the separate form and pay the separate fee for each weapon., being on saferside, than no doubt u have to adopt the way u mentioned in ur post and me too, have presented all my forms in the same manner as all were PB. The logic behind that,obviously is to attach ur licenses to ur CNIC  record back at NADRA[/FONT]\n \n[FONT=Times New Roman] I didn&#8217;t use blue pen for retainer portion as it is never envisaged any where in the instructions, besides , NADRA people would scan the form and send them via their intranet system to their head quarters where they would finally reach at MOI for verification.

(379721, ' @Sparticas\nThe target is always where the sights are. There is no alternative. The only thing is that you make yourself so familiar with the sight shooting that by just using your hands in that position you will be sure that your sights are on your target and you hit the thing. This is all due to practice and no connection with real crossfire.  As other senior members have put the comments like Sir SKEETER60 that they have a relationship together but does not mean if you are perfect at the range then you will be perfect at the ground. And as I said in the previous post that tactics of wars/fighting are other things and just using guns is another. Guns are only the weapon we use in fighting.\n\nAgain regarding alternatives, like you asked that we find other then using the sights. Is all practice. You can see Pistol Shooters not following the sights but opening both eyes and following the target, what they actually do, is they have a practice to use the hands in that position and follow the target they are sure they will hit it. The expert shotgun users hardly use the sights such as beginners like me use when hitting a standby target but they are so quick that they pick the weapon in that angle, have a blink on sights and another blink on the moving target and bang ! \n\n\n\nIt is same that if you start learning how to use a Car and what is driving at the peak hours near Impress Market in Karachi !

After checking the licenses, sec 144 carry permission , weapons, they just counted the number of bullets i had and tallied it with the licenses carrying limit. no worries  . I guess what you have been told is an urban myth.\n\nJHP''s are renowned for better stopping power as they quickly expand upon impact when compared with their equivalent FMJ counterparts.\n\nFor illustration i would give a very simplistic example wherein a broader object with a larger area will cause more damage (to more of an area) than something that has a smaller area.

I concur, for normal medium sized hands, the grips are perfect and easy to get used to. The sighting radius (due to a longish barrel length vs other compacts) promotes greater targetability and inherent accuracy. Customary to most things Baikal, the roughness was both familiar and non-issue. With more and more rounds fired, the trigger, mag release etc should smoothen out. If the sturdiness and reliability of other Baikal weapons are anything to go by, this one ought to be both. Overall, an excellent conceable handgun, inherently accurate and expected to be very reliable in the long run. Mak ftw!', ''),

Thanks for finally getting around to sharing the eye candy too :) Had the pleasure of testing this gun out on the range with you. I concur, for normal medium sized hands, the grips are perfect and easy to get used to. The sighting radius (due to a longish barrel length vs other compacts) promotes greater targetability and inherent accuracy. Customary to most things Baikal, the roughness was both familiar and non-issue. With more and more rounds fired, the trigger, mag release etc should smoothen out. If the sturdiness and reliability of other Baikal weapons are anything to go by, this one ought to be both. Overall, an excellent conceable handgun, inherently accurate and expected to be very reliable in the long run. Mak ftw![/QUOTE]\n \nIts the second baikal piece that was used for review and range report. Hopefully the gun will get smoother with further shooting, you are again welcome to go with it.

Its not available in Pakistan. You would have to get it by some means from USA or UK. \r\n\r\nAnother model which has the similar capability is Vortex (Diamondback 2-7x35 Rimfire) scope.  The price is 249$ in US.\r\n\r\nNo Hawke scope is capable.  Even some Leoupolds dont sustain that recoil.  The only problem in Pakistan is that if even the best scope fails, it becomes difficult to send the scope back for warranty claim.\r\n\r\nI suggest you not to try any more scopes.  It is better to invest only once rather than throwing money for cheep scopes.\r\n\r\nThere is one more thing which I feel is even better than scopes.  It is "Williams FT-TK-AG Peep Sight".  You might have never used or seen one but the accuracy with these sights is amazing and is just like 4x scope.  The good thing about the peep is that there is no chance of its failure. Its price in US is 85$. You would have to get developed front sight rail to add a Williams Firesight.\r\n\r\nThe choice is yours. Above mentioned scopes or peep sight.  Scopes can fail but peep sight never.\r\n\r\nI am confident that the scopes I have recommended have the ability to hold POI in the best possible manner on 54 and 56TH.', ''),

(378795, ' [QUOTE=AK47;217351][B]@Pashasahab..[/B]..........Thanks for the continued write up. I trust our posts preceding would be of assistance not only to me but to the general lot, appreciated!\r\n\r\nAnyhow, I''m almost done up, [COLOR="red"][B]except for column 22 still[/B][/COLOR]! I understand you had a single license with 3 entries, and therefore 6 sets of photocopies - 2 for each as required - sufficed your submission. But what if you have say 5 separate licenses???? First of all that requires 10 sets of photocopied licenses to comply with the basic requirement of 2 sets for each license.\r\n\r\nNow, if you tick a "yes" in column 22, you''re required to provide photocopy of each of your subsequent licenses, right?? Would this now mean that one has to provide first the 10 sets (for 5 licenses) as basic requirement, and then additionally also have [COLOR="red"][B]ONE SET OF EACH OF THE ADDITIONAL 4 LICENSES[/B][/COLOR], if ticking "yes" to column 22?\r\n\r\nI am asking since this would mean that you basically need first the required 2 sets of each licenses, hence 10 sets for 5 licenses, [COLOR="red"][B]AND THEN 4 MORE SETS, ONE OF EACH OTHER  4 LICENSES[/B][/COLOR], to be attached to the particular one being applied for, as it appears from the requirement in clicking a "yes" to column 22??!!??!! This basically means 10 sets (basic) + 4 sets of each additional one, hence [COLOR="red"][B]10+16= 26 sets[/B][/COLOR]!!!!! I believe you now understand my issue in preparing it all up.\r\n\r\nOMG, where the heck are those writs in the courts? Lolzzzzzzzzz!\r\n\r\nI believe, someone should post a "proforma" scanned copy of a form filled up here for the easy understanding. I may do so, once all things have settled here.\r\n\r\n\r\nRegards.[/QUOTE]\r\n \r\nNo No... you don''t have to attach photocopies of any of your other licenses.... don''t do that. Just attache the copy of License of the weapon being Applied For in that particular form.', ''),

Stoeger has never been battle tested and one cannot trust his life on it...\n\nyes if you are firing in a controlled environment, stoeger will perform flawlessly... but you never know when and how bad things can go... as they say, "hope for the best but prepare for the worst"....\n\ngo to a gunshop, hold MP446 and CZ999 scorpion in your hand, which ever seems better to you just buy it...\n\nBTW u can get an mp446 for Rs 45,000-50,000... you just need to bargain professionally :)\n\nhappy buying!', ''),
