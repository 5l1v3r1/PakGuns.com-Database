In fact, you now have the advantage of better shot placement, since I have not met a person who does not have an easier time being accurate with a 22 than with any other caliber. With regards to those who make the argument about misfires and rimfires, I have not had any problems after shooting about 3000 rds of 22wmr. They were however all CCI brand, which i dont know if it is available to you, but it is considered quality ammo. But regardless, even if you do experience a misfire shooting rimfire out of a revolver, just keep pulling the trigger :)', ''),

(516115, ' [QUOTE=fezan;354043][B]Dear AK, how was you experience with stoeger cougar? what would you advise if i should keep this gun or go for a change. \n\nI am sorry but i am confused so thought to share this with you. i have got stoeger for last 2 years and am quite comfortable with the gun''s performance, targeting etc. BUT i want to upgrade to .45. \n\nso what would be your feedback?[/B][/QUOTE]\n\nFezan bro, let me be honest, I never managed checking the Stoeger''s accuracy capabilities.\n\nI sold it at some 150 shots in total, mostly fun shooting, not with a purpose to review it''s potential viz a viz accuracy. I still do remember however that my shots would land mostly to the right and up. I suppose this got to do with fine tuning yourself and your grip according to how the gun behaves.\n\nMoreover, my hands are smaller and the grip of Stoeger is pretty thick. \n\nI''d not suggest small handed shooters too thick a grip.  \n\nMy best assessment of the Stoeger was it''s incredible reliability. This handgun would just take anything fed and with no hiccups whatsoever. And my second attraction to it was it''s smooth, very easy field strip.\n\nI personally find myself uneasy with sub 4 inch barrels, reason why 3 of my handguns, Stoeger, CZ Rami and PT 145 had to vacate my closet.\n\nStoeger is not for the one wishing a range gun. For SD, even drunk men can hit a torso from 7-10 feet.\n\nFinally, as regards your .45 ACP aspirations, I feel this has nothing to do with keeping or releasing a 9mm Stoeger. This could be any handgun.\n\nOh yeah, let me assure you, a shot from a 1911 barrel for sure will hit better than a Stoeger''s.\n\n\nRegards.', ''),

(516578, ' [QUOTE=lifebreakking;354537]Scholars (may Allah be pleased with them) have disagreed about its  ruling; some permitted it while others prohibited it. However, the more  authentic of the two opinions is that it is Halal (lawful), because the  original ruling concerning eating animals is lawfulness, and only things  that are mentioned in Shari`ah (Islamic law) are prohibited. There is  nothing in the Shari`ah that indicates the prohibition of this animal.  In addition, it is a herbivore like rabbits and deer, not a carnivore,  so there is no reason for prohibiting it. The mentioned animal is a kind  of hedgehog with a coat of sharp spines. Ibn `Umar (may Allah be  pleased with him) was asked about eating hedgehogs, so he recited  Allah''s saying (Exalted be He),[B][COLOR=Blue] Say (O  Muhammad &#1589;&#1604;&#1609; &#1575;&#1604;&#1604;&#1607; &#1593;&#1604;&#1610;&#1607; &#1608;&#1587;&#1604;&#1605;): "I find not in that which has been  revealed to me anything forbidden to be eaten by one who wishes to eat  it, unless it be Maitah (a dead animal) or blood poured forth (by  slaughtering or the like), or the flesh of swine (pork)[/COLOR][/B] [Surah Al An`am 6:145]\n(Part No. 23; Page No. 36)\nAn old man said, Abu Hurayrah narrated that the Prophet (peace be upon him) said, [B][COLOR=Blue]It is one of the noxious animals[/COLOR][/B]. Ibn `Umar said, "If the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) had said this, it is true, then."[Related by Ahmad]\nThis indicates that he (may Allah be pleased with him) had no idea  whether the Messenger of Allah had said anything about a hedgehog. It is  also clear that he did not believe the mentioned old man. This Hadith  was ranked as Da`if (weak) by Al-Bayhaqy and other scholars due to  anonymity of this man. Thus, it is concluded that its lawfulness is true  and its prohibition is a weak opinion. Allah (Glorified and Exalted be  He) knows best.\n\n[B][U]Footnotes:[/U][/B]\n\n[1] This was published in the book entitled, "Fatawa Islamiyyah",  compiled by Shaykh Muhammad Al-Musnad, vol. 3, p. 389; and the magazine  of the Islamic University in Al-Madinah Al-Munawwarah.[/QUOTE]\n+1 brother.

(516370, 'VB Practical - My new addition... Salam All,\nEvery once in a while one stumbles on to something special, something unique.  This was the case here.  This is the Italian VB Practical in 9mm.  I saw it at Sheikh Salim Ali in Lahore store over 12 years ago, it was well over priced at that time... for that time; I believe that it was for sale for about 360K/rs then.  I couldn''t afford it.  I knew what it was as I had been familiar with VB pistols for sometime.  I used to own their model USA and another 9mm about 20 years back.  My how time flies but you never forget the good moments.\nThree weeks ago, a friend from Karachi, who bought this weapon 7 years ago called me to tell me that he was selling his Kimber (another gun that I was supposed to buy but he got to it first).  I told him to forget about the Kimber and to show me something that I may like... he asked and I told him.  Initially he laughed but like I always say... ''there IS a right price for EVERYTHING in this world... EVERYTHING'' - when I got done - he couldn''t say no anymore.  I got the firearm dropped off to me on Saturday morning.\nIt was not used but the years of taking it out of box and putting back in and playing with it - some of the corners had lost some bluing.  There were NO signs of firing as the barrel showed no signs of finish wear.\nNormally when I buy something, I disassemble and then clean and then put back together and then fire it; however, in this case I couldn''t wait.  I just lubed the slide and went to the range.  Today was a tiring day, fired airpistol after three weeks, then fired my Ruger Single Six, and lastly fired the VB.  I was tired by that time but still managed two 15 round strings of single handed fire at 25 meters... I didn''t adjust the sights... I only improvised.  Well, low and behold the results are there as proof.\n[IMG]http://i1109.photobucket.com/albums/h427/pyramids99/IMG_1511-1.jpg[/IMG]\n[IMG]http://i1109.photobucket.com/albums/h427/pyramids99/IMG_1509-1.jpg[/IMG]\nI did a set on the plates however the guy recording seemed to be zooming everywhere except where I was shooting so that was a no show.\nI got home and then slowly stripped the gun, hey, I am gonna take care of it like it did me first time out.\nI lovingly took it all apart and began to see what was the charm.  This gun is a hybrid... lower matches the Beretta 92 CC and the barrel lug system matches the Sig P210.  The trigger is fully adjustable for pre and post.  The barrel with the compensator removed still get the accuracy from the slide bushing... something the engineers forgot to do on the CZ Czechmate.  The beavertail on this gun is removable.  There are pre drilled holes for the scope mount.  The rear sight is adjustable and has a clear view.  The levers are large and very elegant.\nI have found a new love for this family of guns... if the Germans make Mercs, Porsches, and such - then welcome to the world of Ferrari and Lamborghini... lolz.  Those plates ARE gonna beg me to stop shooting them.  Below are the pics, I took them BEFORE the cleaning.\n[IMG]http://i1109.photobucket.com/albums/h427/pyramids99/efe57dd8-9a0b-4b96-9a03-0dcbe88fdf0a.jpg[/IMG]\n[IMG]http://i1109.photobucket.com/albums/h427/pyramids99/fdc10819-668d-48f2-b596-7b66aa55a8a1.jpg[/IMG]\n[IMG]http://i1109.photobucket.com/albums/h427/pyramids99/536713fc-d6f8-4e37-a54a-1bc19a6dc48c.jpg[/IMG]\n[IMG]http://i1109.photobucket.com/albums/h427/pyramids99/c98dfe10-3fbe-4396-bfa0-339d5489c11e.jpg[/IMG]\n[IMG]http://i1109.photobucket.com/albums/h427/pyramids99/b144a850-a1b9-44f0-8eee-f1e8f0bb0fd1.jpg[/IMG]', ''),

(516644, ' Hi Guys, \n\nI think I am a bit late to the party, but here''s my $0.02. Prhaps most of you dont know, but I''m a well preserved relic of the past. over the years, starting 30 years ago to be precise, I have had a fair number of airguns pass through my hands. The first was an underlever, tap loading BSA, a pre World War 1 model. It was my paternal grandfather''s gun and he wasn''t its first owner. It was the family airgun from which my grandfather and all his brother''s started their hunting career. Anyways, it was a good gun, better than most Pak made airguns of the 1980s. In 1986, I got a BSA Meteor, with which must have shot over a few thousand birds if not more. In 1997, I got myself a few more airguns - an HW80, an HW30, an HW45 and  BSA Supersport. The Supersport soon found a new home. \n\nThe HW80 is a great gun. I have had mine for about 16 years now and it still packs quite a punch. It is a difficult gun to shoot accurately at first as it is quite hold sensitive, and pellets sensitive too. I have tried a variety of pellets through it and the most accurate ones so far have been H&N Barracuda Match, which are over 20 grains each. \n\nThe HW30 is a regular workhorse. Its a small, and accurate little gun, and what it lacks in MV one can make up in good shot placement. It works the best with RWS Superdome pellets which weigh about 7.9 grains if I am not incorrect. \n\nI have changed the HW30''s mainspring and seals twice. The first time I dropped in genuine seals (breech and piston) but a Jim Maccari spring, spring-guide and spring tar. That made a world of difference. The HW30 felt like a totally different gun. Not much more powerful, but certainly much more accurate and consistently so. It also had a smoother cocking movement. \nWhen  the second change was due, Mr. Maccari was nowhere to be found online and when he was finally located he didnt answer any emails, so I had to use the factory replacements (sourced from Al-Sayad in Dubai).\n\nIn 2011 I acquired another HW30 in a rather beat up state. This gun needed new seals as the previous owner had liberally squeezed copious amounts of sewing machine oil into every orifice which that gun had. I managed to get a new piston seal from Dubai, but not a breech seal. So I went to shop that sells hydraulic equipment parts and got O-rings (Japanese) of the same inner dia and outer and the as the breech. Next I pulled out the old breech seal and put it one O-ring, but that sat very low in the groove, and wasnt sealing at all, so I popped in the other one too, and viola, it worked!\n\nIn my humble opinion, and bitter experience, accuracy is a lot more desirable than power. I have spent a lot money getting Ox mainsprings and Titan mainsprings and what not, and still have at least eight springs lying somewhere. \n\nIf you want good results, read the owner''s manual of your gun carefully and follow it. Work on your shooting stance and hold, your trigger squeezing. Find the best pellets for your guns - the ones with which it gives you the best group and then stick to them.  If you have the opportunity to tune your gun, tune it for accuracy and consistency, and if you can get a few more fps out of it, consider it a bonus. If you have a gun with an adjustable trigger, dont mess around with unless you know what you are doing. \n\nA little not on pellets. Perhaps I am preaching to the choir here, but there is no one best pellet for every gun. Even two HW80''s,  both 0.22 cal, may behave differently with the same pellets One may shoot one hole groups with H&N FTS while the other may be spraying the same pellets in a clover leaf. So dont just take anyone''s word for which is the best pellet. Get as many different pellets as you can and then test your gun with each of them until you find those which give you the best results, and then stick to them.\n\nLast but not the least, do NOT let desi mistris ruin your guns. It will serve you well to either learn gunsmithing yourself or then go a mistri who has the same levels of cleanliness as a surgeon. \n\nHAPPY SHOOTING!', ''),

(516459, ' Scholars (may Allah be pleased with them) have disagreed about its  ruling; some permitted it while others prohibited it. However, the more  authentic of the two opinions is that it is Halal (lawful), because the  original ruling concerning eating animals is lawfulness, and only things  that are mentioned in Shari`ah (Islamic law) are prohibited. There is  nothing in the Shari`ah that indicates the prohibition of this animal.  In addition, it is a herbivore like rabbits and deer, not a carnivore,  so there is no reason for prohibiting it. The mentioned animal is a kind  of hedgehog with a coat of sharp spines. Ibn `Umar (may Allah be  pleased with him) was asked about eating hedgehogs, so he recited  Allah''s saying (Exalted be He),[B][COLOR=Blue] Say (O  Muhammad &#1589;&#1604;&#1609; &#1575;&#1604;&#1604;&#1607; &#1593;&#1604;&#1610;&#1607; &#1608;&#1587;&#1604;&#1605;): "I find not in that which has been  revealed to me anything forbidden to be eaten by one who wishes to eat  it, unless it be Maitah (a dead animal) or blood poured forth (by  slaughtering or the like), or the flesh of swine (pork)[/COLOR][/B] [Surah Al An`am 6:145]\n(Part No. 23; Page No. 36)\nAn old man said, Abu Hurayrah narrated that the Prophet (peace be upon him) said, [B][COLOR=Blue]It is one of the noxious animals[/COLOR][/B]. Ibn `Umar said, "If the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) had said this, it is true, then."[Related by Ahmad]\nThis indicates that he (may Allah be pleased with him) had no idea  whether the Messenger of Allah had said anything about a hedgehog. It is  also clear that he did not believe the mentioned old man. This Hadith  was ranked as Da`if (weak) by Al-Bayhaqy and other scholars due to  anonymity of this man. Thus, it is concluded that its lawfulness is true  and its prohibition is a weak opinion. Allah (Glorified and Exalted be  He) knows best.\n\n[B][U]Footnotes:[/U][/B]\n\n[1] This was published in the book entitled, "Fatawa Islamiyyah",  compiled by Shaykh Muhammad Al-Musnad, vol. 3, p. 389; and the magazine  of the Islamic University in Al-Madinah Al-Munawwarah.', ''),

Let me put it this way, though I still deem the Glock an over-rated handgun as per our local market trends, I simultaneously do agree that a person requiring genuine SD measure, believes in [I]hot status [/I]carry 2-4-7 and at the same time wants to have reduced weight load for EDC''ing and with as close to 100% reliability as possible, the qualitative solution lies in the Glock, nevertheless.\n\nYou''re absolutely right, it was a matter of time, mainly. I bypassed the Glock last year due to other priority investments and sought a cheaper Steyr M9. The Caracal landed coincidentally and filled the spot over the Steyr and now finally I believe I ended up on the track with originally desired destination for the start.\n\nAnd yes, the modification possibilities with the Glock had always been an underlying cause of attraction to me.\n\n\nThanks again, GH bro, for the welcome.\n\n\nRegards.', ''),

(544338, ' [QUOTE=treble;368044]You might be right .\n\nDiesel engines combust fuel slower so they are only suitable for heavy duty vehicles like that of RMR land cruiser.\nPetrol engines burn fuel much faster so they are good for vehicles under 3000cc ,\n\nDiesel or petrol engine must be selected upon the need of the buyer , if the terrain is extremely rough diesel and if a little forgiving terrain then petrol .\nI have driven jeeps in places where even man can''t hike and diesel engines give much better performance .[/QUOTE]\n\nAgreed, diesel engines are best for serious 4x4''s, especially the older more basic diesel engines..\n\nOlder diesel engines like the 4.2L found in certain older Toyota''s and Nissan Patrols were very well suited for off road use. They delivered their power at low revs, so when inching slowly forward over rough terrain there is no need to keep revving the engine to get the vehicle to move properly.\n\nAlso, these diesels were very high compression engines, which again is a benefit for off roading as it means when going down hill in low gears, with the foot off the accelerator, the engine works as a break and holds the vehicle back and at a sensible speed. This means very little use of the normal foot break is required, which avoids it burning/or wearing out on long descents.\n\nThese older diesels were also very reliable and lasted a long time. The needed very few electrics and no computers.  There down side is that the tended use a lot of fuel and could be noisy and dirty. They were not so good for long trips on  good roads.\n\nModern diesels are nearly the opposite and are very similar to petrol engines. They tend to be smaller with some pick-ups now coming with 2L turbo diesels. They are much more fuel efficient but they are designed always to be run at high revs (similar to a petrol engine) so they are not so easy to control when going very slow off road. They also rely on lots of electrics and computers to run them, again like a modern petrol engine..Because they run at high revs, they also do not last as long and tend not to be as reliable as the old engines and also need more specialized mechanics to work on them.\n\nThere is a compromise though and they are the engines like the older 2.8L diesels found in the Toyota Hilux, the Isuzu Trooper,  and the Diahatsu Fourtrack . These tended to combine the best of both worlds and offer decent fuel efficiency and reasonable power at low revs. They stopped using these in new vehicles in the UK and Europe though as they don''t meet the latest standards for exhaust emissions ie they are still too dirty. These engines were well suited to medium sized 4x4''s but were not really powerful enough for the very big Land Cruisers or big Nissan Patrols. Mercedes also made very good diesel engines like this such as the ones found in the old Merc taxis you see around the world..\n\nPeugeot are another company that made good basic diesels in the 1.8L, 1.9L and 2.2L class. They are very well suited to putting into the smaller Suzuki Jeeps such as the SJ413, although it does involve a lot of work...', ''),

(516791, ' Gentleman, to be honest with you I have never chronied of my guns, but the fact of the matter is that there is no noticeable difference in energy or accuracy despite 16 years have passed by. If anything, the gun is probably as accurate or more as it was on day one. The first bird I shot with this gun was at about 45 yards and it''s head was plastered on the tree where it was sitting. The last one was a pigeon that I took at a similar distance inside a big warehouse. This bird was hiding inside the open portion of a 4 inch high wiring duct, and I got it too with a head shot. \r\n\r\nThis gun is more accurate than I am. The only care I have taken of it, is to oil it regularly but sparingly ( I use a 10cc syringe loaded with Hoppe''s gun oil), and make it a point not to let any oil get inside the cylinder or on the mainspring. \r\n\r\nOveroiling attracts dust, and that causes wear and tear, so go easy on the gun oils. \r\n\r\nSecond last but not the least, though I dont have scopes on any of my airguns currently, but I do have a few on my centerfire and rimfire rifles, and one very useful tip I have discovered is that prior to mounting the scope on the gun one should optically centre it on both axes, i.e. horizontally and vertically.  To do this, all you need is old and sturdy shoe box, a spirit level, and a wall about thirty feet away.  Jogee knows how to do this, I explained it to him, so I shall request him to explain the rest of the procedure to you gentlemen.\r\n\r\nFinally, Jogee jee, you live in glass house, ''nuff said! ;)', ''),

(517816, '9mm v. 45 and other silliness... Ok, no other silliness, just the 9mm v. .45 silliness:\r\n\r\nThe Deadeye Method \r\nI was musing the other day on the 9mm v .45 ACP debate. My opinion remains unchanged- the shooters’ ability to shoot has a far greater impact on the defensive use of a firearm than the caliber. One argument for why you should use a .45 over a 9mm is that the surface area of the .45 is 63% bigger than the surface area... of the 9mm. When the .45 punches the hole through you it damages a surface area 63% larger than that of the 9mm. While true, and potentially convincing, I likened it in my head to two students. One scores 10% on a test and the other scores 16.3% on the test and the one is talking trash on the other because he scored 63% more on the test… \r\n\r\nI took this idea and went to work with it.\r\n\r\nI am an average sized dude at 5''11" and, ahem, a bit over 200 pounds. I put a ruler to my chest and abdomen. There is an area on the front of my body which is 10” by 23” where if you shot me I would REALLY not appreciate it much. You would shoot it with a bullet which is either .452” across or 9mm across.\r\n\r\nUh, hmmm, different standards of measure: Let’s use the metric system. So them there bullets would be either 9mm or 11.48mm across. These circles have a radius of either 4.5mm or 5.74mm.\r\nThe frontal surface area of my “I really don’t want you shooting me” area is 254mm by 584.2mm which calculates to 148,386.8 square millimeters. That’s right almost 150,000 square millimeters.\r\n\r\nThe surface area of them bullets is 64.62 square millimeters for the 9mm and 103.5 square millimeters for the .45. For the really sharp readers you can already see the point.\r\n\r\nThe 9mm punches a hole which is 64.62 square millimeters divided by 148,386.8 square millimeters. That 9mm is only 0.04% of the surface area of my “please don’t shoot me zone.” The .45 is only slightly better at .06975% of the surface area of the same area.\r\n\r\nI gave the bullets far more credit than they deserved. It’s like they took a 10,000 question test and one got 4 questions right and the other got… ok, 7 questions right. And the friends of Mr. I Got 7 Questions Right, are talking heap big trash on the friends of the guy who only got 4 questions correct. That’s pretty pathetic, don’t you think?\r\n\r\nSo, the surface area is 63% larger argument really doesn’t work for me since the original hole was so paltry to begin with. Now, consider this… Most of the gun-board commandos can’t shoot.\r\n\r\nThese guys puffing their chest and stroking their ego because they are a .45 fan-boy are missing that bulls-eye by 4”, 6” or even 12” all the time. To convert that to metric- they are missing by 101.6mm, 152.4mm or even 304.8” with a bullet that it 2.48mm larger in diameter. Let that sink in. They invest hours crafting an argument as to why they are better because they use a bullet 2.48mm larger in diameter, but miss by 100mm to 300mm. Their inability to shoot has an effect 41 to 123 times greater than their bullet diameter does.\r\n\r\nLearn to shoot.\r\n\r\n[url]https://www.facebook.com/#!/TheDeadeyeMethod/posts/556470631040646[/url]', ''),

Then you may apply a layer of oil treatment along with Nasa Rust-O-Nil.\n\nBut even then if you feel like taking it to workshop, then Brother Trajan has recommended a nice name and person who can handle anything in a good way.

(517295, ' [QUOTE=whiteatom;353768]assalam o alaikum to all bros N I have a very sad story to tell and I also need advice from the seniors over it, I got my 1 NPB license and 1 PB license made from a dealer here in Lahore, everything went perfect and I got my NPB license first on which I purchased a stoeger couger it was my first gun ever and I loved it, then I got an PB license made up but I think i kant discuss it here so lets just leave it up, now the bad luck happened with me that I dropped my wallet off it includes my CNIC, my ATM and my precious nadra issued both licenses cards, now I have got my all things back and also applied for the duplicate issue of my both licenses cards, I applied In January 2013 but still I got nothing and my dealer says that still MOI is not re-issuing the licenses and my application is still pending, its a lot frustrated as I cant even take my stoeger out anymore or shoot with it .. I have the following questions from the seniors ..\n\n1. Now can I easily sale my stoeger if I dont get my licenses duplicates issued? and what will be the legal way of selling it as its still on my license and on my name (even though I lost the license) and also i didnt register the FIR for it as Police simply said its a very hectic process and I need to at least give them with my license numbers or a copy of my license cards but unluckily I just didnt even have a copy of them or dunt even remember my license numbers as I was a novice and got very excited to see my licenses, didnt even bother to write down my license numbers, so an advice to you all guys always keep a copy of your license cards .. so can I sale my stoeger now? cuz I think if i dont get the duplicates issued may be I can apply for a new license once licenses are opened up and then buy a new gun for it, as keeping my stoeger right now is illegal I know that which makes me a bit dump too and if I dont get my duplicate licenses issued in next 2 months I will surely want to sale it up ..\n\nThanks guys ..[/QUOTE]\nbro i thnk i can help u with u r both licences or i can help u to sell them but if u r true then if not bro i can''t bcz u know its a matter of weapons and where r u from if u r karachi then i can help u if not i can''t :(', ''),

I did and he stated this:  Moeen bhai, 150 piece kia hai, mera time zia karna hai na.  Give me an order for 1000 pieces and I will give you each part for 800/rs!  or if you can wait and afford diecasting then I can give you on an order of 2000 pieces a rate of 500/rs each!  This is how it all works whether here or abroad.  So expect to pay higher prices as I don''t expect 1000+ customers per part... but atleast you can get the parts.  I will also be unloading the originals once the parts are made up to par of international standards.  There is no difference in the steel or alloy used there or here if one sticks to the proper international standards.  A billet of 7075 alloy untreated T6 out of Karachi costs about 9000/rs!  And its dimensions are 12"x2"x8", that was two years ago, dunno what it is now but I am sure its higher and not lower.\nWhat happens here is people tend to lower the price because of local manufacture and hence cause their own demise at the hands of sub standard parts.  This is why DAK thrives.  If they went into quality manufacture (which they can do) one will see a drastic decline in all the many manufacturers.', ''),

(517605, 'RWS 54 Airking with Bipod Many Thanks raja sb, Khilji, Mastermind and Naweed\n\nFor the purpose of bench shooting, I have installed a foldable bipod on my 54. The two legs can be extended from 6 inches to 10. On one of the international gun forums, I saw this guy who had installed a bipod with Uncle Mikes&#8217; kit through drilling a hole in the frontend of the fore grip. I didn&#8217;t want to make any alterations to the gun so instead of drilling a hole, I just replaced the front screw (which was about half inch long) with a screw bolt (measuring 2 inches in length and of same gauge). I placed rubber padding in between the bipod and the wood so that the finishing is not ruined in any way. The challenging part of installing this bipod was that the lower portion of the bipod had groves which would get tightened before the 2 inch long screw could reach the base and that resulted in a slight PLAY. I had to use a file to remove the grooves from the lower end of the screw bolt so that the only tightening takes place where it&#8217;s actually needed. \n\nThe results are as following: \n\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]19958[/ATTACH]\n\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]19959[/ATTACH]\n\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]19960[/ATTACH]\n\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]19961[/ATTACH]\n\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]19962[/ATTACH]\n\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]19963[/ATTACH]\n\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]19964[/ATTACH]\n\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]19965[/ATTACH]\n\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]19966[/ATTACH]\n\nI will be taking it to the range tomorrow, inshAllah; lets see what it has to say to a piece of paper :D.', ''),

When we talk about spare parts, now a days it’s getting tough & tough to buy parts online from abroad. \r\n\r\nAnd now Moeen bhai has taken the concept to an extreme level. Its regarding my CZ Czechmate, I wanted to shoot my Czechmate without the red dot sight but along with the compensator. The current production Czechmate I cannot do that. Because if I remove the CZ red dot and put the factory or competition rear sight on it then I have to remove the factory compensator from the gun as well and have to put the CZ weight which has got the front sight built on it. If I don’t put this on then the gun is without the front sight. The whole fun of firing the Czechmate with compensator is gone if you remove the red dot and are using rear sights. And there is no one in the International Market who is manufacturing or selling Czechmate Compensator with front sight.\r\n\r\nBut wait there is only and only [B]ONE GUY[/B] in the [B]WORLD[/B] who has [B]DONE[/B] it for me.

(517883, 'Defensive Shooting myth buster! When was the last time you saw a picture of a shooter using a one-handed grip? On most firearms-related websites, advertisements, TV show and movies, shooters are shown using a two-handed grip. Thumb position and stance may vary, but*the general message is clear: two-handed is the &#8220;best,&#8221; the only &#8220;proper&#8221; way to shoot a pistol. Maybe so. For target shooting or competition, two-handed shooting works just fine. If it wasn&#8217;t optimal for gun control, no one would shoot two-handed at the range. In its 2003 Combat Pistol Manual, the US Army recommends two-handed shooting for engaging an enemy at less than five yards and for night firing . . .\nUsing a two-hand grip, the firer brings the weapon up close to the body until it reaches chin level. He then thrusts it forward until both arms are straight. The arms and body form a triangle, which can be aimed as a unit. In thrusting the weapon forward, the firer can imagine that there is a box between him and the enemy, and he is thrusting the weapon into the box. The trigger is smoothly squeezed to the rear as the elbows straighten.\nThere is no proof of the general advantage of two-handed shooting in close quarters defensive shooting situations. Common sense suggests the opposite: a shooter may not be able to extend both of his or her arms far enough forward to shoot two-handed in a close-quarters life-threatening situation.\nFrom 1854 &#8211; 1979, two-hundred-and-fifty NYPD police officers were killed in the line of duty. Of these, only one officer was killed at a distance beyond 25 feet&#8212;by a sniper 125 feet away. Ninety-two percent of the fatal confrontations occurred within*15 feet. Ninety-six-point-four percent went down under 25 feet.\n*\nDistance equals time, or lack thereof. If you don&#8217;t have the distance/time to assume a &#8220;proper&#8221; combat stance and grip, you won&#8217;t do it. The New York Police Department&#8217;s long-term study of thousands of police combat cases confirms it: most officers engaged in an armed confrontation fired with their strong hand. This YouTube video demonstrates the point:\n\nThe two-handed grip is useful and accurate in non-combat situations. It may be the preferred method for shooting in combat. But real life says that most shooters in close-quarters life-threatening situations &#8220;revert&#8221; to a one-handed grip. *Not recognizing that fact for training and, thus, reality, could cost you your life.\nAs good as it gets\nI want to be clear. There is nothing wrong with using the two-handed grip in combat*per se. The pics below were scraped from a video of a robbery in Florida. They show a guard using a two-handed grip while moving and shooting and killing an armed robber.*In the first two images, we see that the guard appear (bottom of the screen), acquire his gun and move to confront the robber.\n\n\nWhen the robber points his gun at the guard one-handed, the robber is shot, falls down, and dies on the floor.\n\n\nEven though the guard&#8217;s grip is &#8220;correct,&#8221; note that his gun is not at eye level, he&#8217;s not using the sights, and his thumbs are pointing up, not forward along the frame (as recommended by my firearms instructors).\nAlso, though the guard was brave and the stakes could not have been higher, note that he was attacking and not reacting to a life threat. Forget CSI and all the other cop shows with official firearms advisors and endless retakes. In the real world, this is about as good as it gets, most of the time.\nSights Unseen\nMany of the pictures on websites show handgun shooting at distances that would make a sniper proud. If there are photos of targets, they show nice tight little groups.*Getting good groups at longer ranges is good for target shooting, competitions and showing your friends. But that kind of pistol shooting has little to do with the reality of or the danger of close-quarters life-threatening situations.\nThat&#8217;s because sight shooting is best used for distance shooting. While it&#8217;s good to be able to hit distant targets, again, studies show that &#8220;sight shooting&#8221; won&#8217;t or can&#8217;t be used in close-quarters life threatening situations. Here&#8217;s what L.W. Seecamp, a gunmaker that makes small pistols without sights, says about distance shooting:\nThe ability to shoot targets at 25 yards using sights sadly seems to provide little or no advantage in close combat . . .\nThe 25 yard shooting proficiency test for carry qualification required by many issuing authorities is absurd. It&#8217;s a request to perform a feat that would land you in jail if you ever tried to perform it &#8216;in self-defense.&#8217;\nIt&#8217;s like passing a driver&#8217;s test that requires you to slalom between traffic cones at 120 miles an hour. Seventy-five feet shooting proficiency is not too much to ask from a police officer who may be firing at a barricaded target, as the ability to drive at high speeds is not too much to ask from a Trooper pursuing a fleeing vehicle, but it&#8217;s ridiculous to ask it of civilians.\nShoot an &#8216;assailant&#8217; at 75 feet. Then try to find a lawyer good enough to keep you out of prison.\nTo bring this closer to home (so to speak), if you are going to be attacked, the attacker will most likely not attack you from across the street. The attack will be up close and personal.*As for home defense, if you measure how big your rooms are, you will know the distances which you should train at the most.\nHere&#8217;s what the NRA says about self-defense shooting:\n. . . the ability to keep all shots on a standard 8 1/2 inch by 11 inch sheet of paper at seven yards, hitting in the center of exposed mass, is sufficient for most defensive purposes.\nHere is a pic of a target that closely represents one in the NRA&#8217;s Guide To The Basics Of Personal Protection In The Home that was published in 2000.\n\nIf you have a gun for self-defense, you should know how to operate it and shoot it safely. Most importantly, you should be able to shoot it effectively one-handed, without the use of the sights.*To not master this skill could be the biggest&#8212;and last&#8212;mistake of your life.\nThere are plenty of so-called Point Shooting methods that can be used for effective close-quarters combat. There is the method developed by Fairbairn, Sykes, and Applegate; Quick Kill, and the one I favor, AIMED Point Shooting or P&S.', ''),

For practices on ranges one must resort to all postures as God knows when the situation determine which mode. To further utilize the utility of this thread some one must highlight different types of range practices, regards', ''),

(517921, ' Just looking at the pix, I''d be hard pressed to tell the difference between a Beretta and a local! Anyways, I do agree with ED Bro, increasing the original caliber of any gun is a dicey proposition at best. But if you already bought it and like it, just keep in mind that it is a clone of unknown quality, which had its chamber and barrel altered to shoot a different caliber. i think most would agree that only the difference in physical dimensions of the 30 bore was considered, but not the difference in energy that the 30 puts out. Although it may sound like criticism sometimes, I''m sure everyone is concerned about your safety, and it would just be wise and in your best interest to be extra cautious when shooting this special pistol.', ''),

So here is the process \n\n[B][U]Shimming the Scope [/U][/B]\n\n[U]Reason[/U] \n\n-- I have used three chinese type scopes and observed that if used without shims they loose zeroing. The one i sent u had the least effect as i tried rectifying the root cause in it (rather did it for once )  but i think the jerks in transportation has put it back to its original state \n\n[U]Why[/U] \n\nin these scopes there is an internal tube ... on two sides it is controlled by horizontal and vertical screws while from the opposite direction there is a metallic strip acting as a spring or counter-force ... open the front cover and remove lens now look into it you''ll understand the description given ... if the screws are not tightened adequately the strip doesn''t give enough pressure and then the internal tube slips on it every now and then\n\n[U]Questions[/U] :\n-- yes zeroing means that screws are at a fixed position but that can be done, without compromising zeroing but by adding shims to rear mount .. explained ahead \n--- you''ll know when the pressure applied by screws is enough they will be more tough while turning clock-wise\n\n[U]remedy [/U]\n\n-- earlier i used a few tools and increased tension of the metallic strip (it was placed as such that the tension was increased i guess it  has lost that position ) without taking it out .. a tricky process not advised as u might damage tube\n-- use shims to elevate rear of scope .. very easy \n\n[U]Using shims [/U]\n\n[U]Logic[/U] : the shim underneath the scope in rear mount will raise it from rear ... making its point of focus lower on the ground .. turning the elevation screw clock wise, will bring it to zero position but this time it will put more pressure on metallic strip as well (as compared to no shim)  and your scope will not loose zeroing ...

When U try and change them then sooner or later the slide will go. U have done 100 rounds. I suggest u field strip your gun and inspect the locking lugs under a micro scope.

(518265, ' [B][U]Quality Control Issues With Hatsan Quattro Trigger[/U][/B].\n\nToday while target practicing at home, after 20 or so shots, as usual, I cocked the gun, loaded a pellet, took aim, pushed safety, pulled trigger, trigger came back and went flail. No fire. I checked safety and again tried to fire but trigger was flail (loose), no fire yet. started thinking, what had happened, possibilities. Either something in trigger is broken, or its a trigger sear jam.\nI removed the pellet out of breach. Then removed the stock and scope to inspect the trigger. apparently everything was ok but a sear seemed to have jammed. I noticed pinkish brown factory grease too over it. I gave a flick to this sear with a small screw driver and gun fired. ( pellet was already removed so no damage to surroundings at least).\nI liberally washed this goo like thing from trigger sears as much as I could without opening the trigger assembly. Then wiped it and applied some gun oil over the sears. Fitted the gun again in the stock. Cocked, Loaded a pellet, fired, gun went smoothly as before.\nFired 6-7 more pellets, trigger jam did not happen again.\nSo, The Quattro Trigger of Hatsan does have quality control issues. Although not big ones, an experienced person can take care of these issues, but in the hands of a novice some accidents might happen.\nI will not recommend Hatsan for a beginner after this experience.\nAny moderately experienced air gunner can easily tackle such issues. and some one more experienced can de-assemble the trigger, polish the sears and issue will be resolved for sure. So not a big issue but for a beginner it could be dangerous.\nNow Hatsan 99 will stay home for 100 or so shots and if it goes smooth, only then it can go to the field again.\nApparently the problem seems to have gone. I will further check it tomorrow.', ''),

All HIRA ARMS did was lost a customer who was going to order atleast 3 weapons from them, but lost business due to their own attitude and poor customer service. Their loss.  \nThe man who answered the phone, whoever he was was an absolute joker and made a fool out of himself.

Must be my luck.\n\nI was quoted Baikal for 58k. Beautiful gun, a bit bulky. CF-98 was the best fit in my hand. And my price range was way higher. cf it is, but i just love the class/shahska of baikal. Was quoted 42k for CF98, i believe i could haggle a little for 40k. but can you confirm the baikal''s price. That thing is such sesky stuff though. \n\nCF-98 was best fit in my hand and being a first time gun owner i think im better off with CF-98.[/QUOTE]\n\nBeing an ambassador for the TP9, I''d still suggest you let your hands do the decision making. Whatever feels right, balances right and grips comfortably is the gun for you. We can spend days going back and forth abt the pros and cons of various makers, but inthe end it is the individual feel that helps. I really love the CZ Duty and the Caracals, however only in someone else''s hands. Love the way they shoot and the way they look, but again, in another''s hand... :) really tried to force myself to go for either and was even willing to tighten the belt and raise the budget but in the end couldn''t force my hands to like the feel or grip. The TP9 just felt like it was custom built for me, love at first grip!\nSo go with what ur hand says, and good luck!

At the closest - [I]and despite of being a totally different platform handgun[/I] - it may eventually land up in the closer vicinity of CZ handguns -[I] price-wise - [/I]as per our market trends over here in Pakistan[I].\n[/I]\nSee you soon[/SIZE][/FONT][I][FONT=trebuchet ms][SIZE=3].[/SIZE][/FONT]\n\n[/I]Regards."\n[/COLOR]\nHad there been no recall issues or the exploding slide.. our opinions would have been totally different.. I`ve shot about a 100 rounds on the cougar at different occasions and I personally own Caracal... Cougar is an amazing weapon and if I have enough bucks, I would definitely like to own one of them...but SC being way superior? Common bro.... :) \n\nI would not exchange my Caracal F for free with a Stoeger if I had the opportunity... why? well my F holds more firing power (18 rounds vs. 15 in Cougar and Barrel length of 4.09" in F compared to 3.6" in Cougar) the trigger on Caracal is better in my opinion (very crisp) and also I felt that the reset is better in F.... the list goes on and on.. and according to the experience I had, I found Caracal to be alot more accurate compared to Stoeger...\n\nBut then again, it`s pointless to compare SC with Caracal because they both serve different purposes...', ''),

Even standard ball is issued in different loads and weights for different purposes; the most unique of which being the Mk262, topped with a 77 grain Sierra Match King bullet, it is usually employed by designated marksmen. Then there are rounds such as the M200 to simulate live fire, and M862 for short range training. Different types of tracer rounds, from the standard M196, to M996 for night vision tracing, to the long range M856 incendiary rounds. There are even different variations of AP ammo; in addition to the famous "green tip" (M855 62 grain steel penetrator), theres the 58 grain M202 tri metal penetrator, and the M995 with tungsten core. That''s all I can recall at the moment, but there are more variations. My point is, when comparing ammo in that context, it''s not as simple as saying caliber X does this, or it can only do that. To compare caliber Y with caliber X, all the different roles and purposes that the ammo will serve needs to be considered.', ''),

(519069, ' IMHO, In our country, hunting is not regulated properly (it''s an international issue as well). The debate (an old debate) is always erupted due to poor and selective implementation of rules. The arguments of privileged and non-privileged hunters always come from two different poles. There is always a difference of opinion but the things should be run in a smooth way otherwise this would cause entropy and nothing else.\n\nSide by side, we need to conserve our resources as well. This is a global issue. If we will try to culminate all the natural fauna at once then there would be a scarcity of the resources in the future. Again, Yes,  a good hunter is always a good conservator and he should be. \nWe need to educate our people and to regulate the things. Yes, if somebody has done something wrong, he should get educated and this can always be done by community awareness programs. This forum is an excellent podium for this purpose.\n\nIf somebody hunts and then eat the meat as a food, there should not be any problem in it. I could not find any difference in slaughtering of captivated animals and shooting/hunting of birds/animals. \nYes, the intent of hunting should be for food purpose and I believe that when hunters take a lot of risk and search bushes and marshes for their hunted bird/animal, they actually try to get the hunted one for food. Another example is, Hunters always receive demands from their friends and neighbors "Humain bhi Murghabi kaa gosht dainaa", so primary purpose is always the food.', ''),

My friend didn&#8217;t reply any of the above quarries.\n  While searching the info about the NP 42/CF98 , the most of \n  info I found on internet was shared on Pakistan based Gun \n  forums and there was a little knowledge available internationally . The reason behind it appears to be  the \n  import restrictions imposed By most of the western countries on Chinese arms . \n\n  However I stumbled across  a rare article published in an international Gun Magazine which is being shared below by way of &#8220; COPY &#8211;PASTE METHOD&#8221;without comments    \n\n  \n\n     [FONT=&amp][B]CHANGE IN CHIN[/B]A (page one )\n\nTwenty years in the making. The Chinese Type 92 pistol is a guaranteed success---thanks to the sheer size of its customer base.\n\n[B]by Timothy Yan published in Handguns magazine [/B]\n\nOf all the modern handguns in the world, very little is known about the new Chinese QSZ 92. It is short for ''Qing-Bing-Shi, Shou-Quiang,Zi-dong, 1992-shi'' or ''Small Arms, Handgun, Automatic, Type 1992." This is the story of the Type 92, China''s polymer service pistol.\n\nWhen the US military adopted the Beretta 92SF in the mid-1980s, the Chinese military took notice. It too was looking for a modern design to replace its old service pistols.\n\nThe Chinese military standard-issue handguns at the time were the Type 51/54 copies of the Russian tokarev TT-33 in 7.62 x 25. High-ranking officers and non-combat personnel were given the Type 64 compact pistols, a modified copy of the Walther PPK. The Chinese Special Forces used the unique Type 67 sound-suppressed pistol. Both were chambered for the Type 64 7.62 x 17 round, a rimless and slightly hotter derivative of the .32 ACP.\n\nAll three of those pistols can trace their origins back to the 1930s but all were obsolete by the 1980s. \n\nThe research for the new Chinese military handgun began in 1987. Originally the 9mm version and the 5.8 mm. version were separate developments. One was led by Liu Ming of the Small Arms Research Institute 208 outside of Beijing, and the other was headed by Qing Shang Sheng from the Chang Feng Machinery Company, also known as the Arselnal 236.\n\nBoth teams were merged into one in 1994 when the project was formally designated as the QSZ-92 Handgun Development. The 9mm. model was completed in 1998. The 5.8 mm. caliber variant was finished in 2000. Cheng Feng machinery Company located in Chongqing, Sichuan province, manufactures all models of the Type 92 series. During the research phase, there were initial prototypes resembling a mix of Sig-Sauer and CZ with the common Browning-type tilt-barrel lock and in alloy frames. That comes as no surprise since both the Sig-Sauer P226 and CZ75 had been copied by NORINCO for export at the time. However, those European-esque prototypes didn''t last long. Once the new pistol project went into the development phase, a new polymer frame design was used. \n\nThe production models emply a polymer frame to reduce weight and increase durability. Itg also allows the grip to be formed more ergonomically to fit the average Asian''s hand size and shape.\n\nThe centerpiece of the Type 92 is actually a metal sub-frame that inserts into the polymer frame in a similar fashion as the Smith &Wesson M & P. Most of the components ---the trigger, hammer and safeties---are integrated into this metal subframe. The magazine release is reversible. \n\nThe standard sight is the three-dot type with luminescent inserts. The proprietary accessory-mounting rails can be modified with the optional bolt-on, low profile 1913 Picatinny rail adapter. The slide release is on the left side and also functions as the takedonw pin. \n\nThe firing mechanism consists of double-action trigger with an external hammer. The single-action trigger pull is rated 3.37 to 6.74 pounds. The double-action trigger pull is an atrociously heavy 14.6 pounds, like the Chinese Type 64 PPK clone. \n\nThe primary safety is the frame-mounted ambidextrous safety and decocker. The additional safety is the hammer block and the firing pin safety that lowers only when the trigger is pulled all the way back. The double-action trigger gives the Type 92 the second-strike ability and makes it safe to carry with a loaded chamber[/FONT]\n\n  \n  \n  [FONT=&amp]PAGE 2[/FONT]\n  [FONT=&amp]Comparing it to the Beretta M9, the QSZ-92 is seven ounces lighter and over an inch shorter. Both the width and height are a quarter inch less. The grip and controls are more ergonomic for a majority of hand sizes.\n\nThe Chinese Type 92 is actually more similar to the newer Beretta Styorm PX 4, which also sports a polymer frame. And like the PX4, the Type 92 uses a less common ROTATING-BARREL LOCKING MECHANISM (empahsis mine.---bloodysam), which the Chinese found to be superior to the Browning-style tilt-barrel lock.\n\nThe rotating-barrel lock was first patterned by US Army Major Elbert Searle in 1905 and actually went up against Browning''s design in the trials that eventually led to the selection of the 1911 by the United States. The short-recoil version of the rotating-barrel lock was developed in 1907 by Karel krnka, a retired captain of the Austro0Hungarian army with a long family tradition in firearms making.\n\nQSZ-92 9 mm.\n\nMost of the Type 92s that have been produced are the 9mm version, which marks China''s re-adoption of the 9 x 19 Luger cartridge. Due to early German military influence, China was actually one of the first countries to adapt the 9mm. round after World War I. It continued using it until the 1950s, when the Russian calibers replaced it.\n\nThe Chinese military required that the new 9mm. round would have to out-penetrate the old Tokarev 7.62 x 25. The new Chinese DAP92-9 -9mm. cartridge accomplished that by featuring a 124-grain FMJ with a hardened-steel penetrator and loaded to +P pressure. The velocity is 1,181 fps from the 4.33 inch barrel.\n\nThe DAP92-9 can penetrate 1.3 mm. of helmet steel plate and two inches of pine plank behind it as 50 meters. For sound-suppressed requirements, a 150-grain sub-sonic load at 1,050 fps velocity was developed. There''s also a 1,410 fps +P+ high-velocity load made for the PDW type gun.\n\nAs mentioned, the Type 92 is short recoil-operated with a rotating-barrel lock. the chrome-plated, hammer-forged barrel is built on imported Steyr-Mannlicher hammer-forging machinery. \n\nThe barrel sports a big cam lug that rotates the barrel by engaging an angled track in the barrel guide block. Eight small locking lugs on the barrel mate with locking recesses machined into the slide''s interior. The chamber is fully supported.\n\nThe magazine is a 15-round double-column with dual feed lips. A standard lanyard loop is on the left bottom rear of the grip. \n\nThe early production Type 92 lacks a loaded-chamber indicator. Its sights are also 2mm. lower, and the front sight is on the barrel bushing instead of the slide.\n\nThe Type 92 weighs 26.8 ounces with an empty magazine. The QSZ-92 is availabel for $270.00 in large military and law enforcement orders. It was also selected by the Bangladeshi military to replace its Type 54.\n\nQSZ-92 5.8 mm.\n\nThe 5.8mm. version is similar to the 9mm. version in most area. It chambers the DAP92-5.8 5.8 x 21 bottle[/FONT] [FONT=&amp]\nneck high-velocity cartridge. The round features a 46.5 grain FMJ projectile with a hardened steel penetrator and lead-plug composite core.\n\nThe muzzle velocity out of the 4.53-inch barrel is 1,575 fps. The round can penetrate 1.3 mm. of steel helmet steel and two inches of pine plank at 50 meters. That penetration capability increases to 100 meters when fired from a 9.84-inch barrel at 1,738 fps.\n\nThe other major area of difference from the 9mm. model is the locking mechanism. The QSZ-92 5.8mm. model uses retarded blowback operation. The 9mm model''s eight barrel locking lugs and the two locking cuts inside of the slide were ommitted in the 5.8mm. variant.\n\nThe difference between retarded blowback and the delayed blowback, such as the original Searle design, is a locked breech. The retarded blowback action on the Type 92 5.8mm. has an unlocked breech. After the round is fired, it uses the turning of the barrel to slow down the slide.\n\nThe 5.8 mm. feeds from a 20 round double-column, dual-feed magazine. It also has a rounded trigger guard and lacks the star motif on the grip. The 5.8mm. model is slightly lighter than the 9mm. version. The closest thing we have to the QSZ-92 5.8 mm. and the 5.8 x 21 ammo. is the FNH Five-seveN and its 5.7 x 28 cartridge.\n\nQWS-06 (Per magazine article, this pistol is the replacement for the Type 67 sound-suppressed pistol. It is said to be essentially the long-barrel variant of QSZ-92 5.8 model wityh some modifications and comes issued with a detachable titanium alloy sound suppressor. I will omit the rest of this section and continue on to the NP42.-bloodysam)\n\nNP42 and CF98 (page 4)\n\nBoth the NP42 and CF98 are export models of the QSZ-92 9mm. NP stands for Norinco Pistol and CF is short for ''Chang Feng,'' its manufacturer. The NP42 is made to tighter tolerances and uses a higher-grade barrel, but it''s also more expensive. Some of the early NP42s lack the accessory rail. The NP42 has a NORINCO logo on the grip instead of the star motif on the military model and on the CF98. \n\nThe CF98 and NP42 have the following enhancements compared to the military model: a larger ejector port; restyled hammer and firing pin safety; a buffer inside the collapsible recoil spring guide rod; and ejector-mounted loaderd-chamber indicater; and taller sights. (The last two features also found their way back into the main production lodel of the QSZ-92.)\n\nThere''s an addtional logn-barrel model with a 4.73-inch barrel that weights 1.1 ounces heavier. It features additional front serrations on the slide.\n\nThree additional magazines are available for the export models. The new 15-round double-column magazine has a single feed lip that''s commonly used by Western handguns. For the restricted markets, there are two new 10-round double-column magazines in either dual-or single-feed lips. Those new magazines also work in the QSZ-92 military model.\n\nSince the QSZ-92 will never be imported to the US all the hands-on feedback comes from Pakistan, where the imprted CF98 and NP42s have been hot sellers. (And for this report I give special thanks to Taimur Khan, a Pakistani gun enthusiast and proud owner of the CF 98.\n\nThe CF98 and NP42 can be purchased from major Pakistani importers for $350 to $500 depending on the model, finish and---more importantly in that part of the world---your bargaining skill.\n\nThe higher-end NP 42 usually commands a $50 to $100 dollar premium over the CF98. In the Pakistani market, the CF98''s price is half that of polymer Tauruses and Glocks, and one-third that of the Beretta Storm PX4 and Smith and Wesson M & P.\n\nThe over-all shooters'' impressions of the CF98 is that is is comfortable in the hand with an excellenct three-to-four poiund trigger, and it has amild recoil and good accuracy. However, it does require a couple hundred round of break-in period, and its fit and finishing are not up to US standards.\n\nOne Pakistani user has fired more than 10,000 rounds through his CF98. The barrel shows little wear and is still accurate. The pistol handles the cheapers plinker ammo to the military-grade +P+ pressure 9mm made for the MP5 without a hiccup. The submachinegun load does increase the felt recoil by quite a bit, but the word is its''s manageable.\n\nThe CF 98 was tested from the bench by one of th Pakistani owners. Of the two CF98 samples tested, one proved more accurate at close range while the other shot better at distance.\n\nThe test ammunition used during the testing was the Pakistan Ordnance Factory-produced 2Z ball, which is not a very accurate round by our standards.\n\nFive rounds were fired at each distance with the following results:\n\n10 meters: 1.25 inch and 2.2 inches\n20 meters: 3.0 and 2.8\n30 meters: 8.5 and 5.3\n\nSince the Pakistani military has stopped issuing sidearms to its officers in the last few years, many of those military officers bought their own CF98s as back-ups to their current-issue MP5 or Type56/AK folders. The CF 98 has also been popular with Pakistani law enforcement personnel, who prefer it over their issued old revolvers or worn-out Type 54/Tokarevs.\n\nBy the time the Type 92 series ceases production sometime in the distant future, it will certainly be one of the most produced handguns in history---simply due to the vast size of the Chinese military, security forces and law enforcement.\n\n-end of article[/FONT]', ''),

I seek value for money in everything I purchase and this gun sure provides that. The other gun that has caught my eye recently in similar price bracket is Hatsan mod 99. Its been holding up well so far (Im referring to the one Adam purchased) and if it continues to perform well, then these two guns will gives Dianas a run for their money at least here :)\n\nOn a side note, hopefully I''ll see you tomorrow eve (with the scope) and will bring the Hatsan along :)[/QUOTE]\n\n\nInsha Allah bro.. will be looking forward to that... will coordinate with you... and of-course I realize that Gamo Shadow does lie in Mid Power range of air guns with about 650 FPS where has your Canon has reached upto 900 fps... hehehehehe, no comparison bro.. but within its league this gun is extremely good value for money...\n\nThe intresting part is that for GamoShadow, I have been quoted from 24k up to 32k by various dealers, Can u just imagine that....

(519729, ' The real issue is not that a product failed, but the dilemma lies in how the failure is being resolved. Admittedly I am not familiar with business practices in the region, but IMHO Caracal''s actions and reactions have been completely unprofessional. If its been confirmed that a product has caused bodily harm to a customer during regular use, the first thing the company should have done was compensate for monetary loss and injury. If that had happened in a timely fashion, I''m certain the affected party would be much more willing to downplay the situation, and we may not even be having this discussion now. But since that did not happen, a representative of the company most certainly should not have been on this forum antagonizing the matter. Then, once a recall notice is issued, the facilities, beauracracy, and resources to carry through with it should be in place, immediately upon publication of the notice. There should be no delays, or excuses of any kind once the company makes a public announcement to do something. No reputable company would survive long, let alone prosper, conducting business this way. It just seems to me like Caracal is just dragging this matter along hoping people would get over it eventually. If the market is fine with that, then so be it. But otherwise, if legal proceedings are not an option, a national boycott would be the only way to get what''s deserved.', ''),

Experience the Monster (Hatsan Sniper)\n\n3.

It is accurate enough to create tight groups but the deflection is there... On any scope, so much adjustment would definitely make the scope tube free and unstable, hence the gun is going to fire left right and center... one of the temporary solutions is to adjust the windage to the extreme right...\n\n[B]Encounter with the moster Hatsan 125 Sniper:\n [/B]We didnt shoot much form this gun and Jog3ee has already done a slight detailed review in his thread (link below)\n[URL]http://www.pakguns.com/showthread.php?9476-Hatsan-125-Accuracy-and-Performance&p=357824#post357824[/URL]\nWhat he mentioned in his thread and what I will mention again here is that...... Me and Ch_Adnan both witnessed Jog3ee take down two crows with one shot and they both instantly fell down dead, INSTANTLY.... this gun has crazy amount of power..and the trigger, all u need to do is touch it.... I fired two shots my mistake... before i even aimed properly..an amazing weapon and strictly for a pro..\n\n[B]Installation of Scope on my Shadow:\n\n[/B]I purchased the scope that Jog3ee originally got on his Hatsan Sniper... He was kind enough to do a proper installation job on my gamo and took his sweet time to zero it... slow and steady... must say our brother deals with his passion very professionally..\n\nAs soon as he was done zeroing it, he asked me to try for my first group with scope... and so I did.... the distance was around 13 yards... \n\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]20257[/ATTACH]\n\nThe shot on the extreme left was a mistake.. else the group had been even tighter...

(519797, ' [QUOTE=Fudgepacker;357793]The real issue is not that a product failed, but the dilemma lies in how the failure is being resolved. Admittedly I am not familiar with business practices in the region, but IMHO Caracal''s actions and reactions have been completely unprofessional. If its been confirmed that a product has caused bodily harm to a customer during regular use, the first thing the company should have done was compensate for monetary loss and injury. If that had happened in a timely fashion, I''m certain the affected party would be much more willing to downplay the situation, and we may not even be having this discussion now. But since that did not happen, a representative of the company most certainly should not have been on this forum antagonizing the matter. Then, once a recall notice is issued, the facilities, beauracracy, and resources to carry through with it should be in place, immediately upon publication of the notice. There should be no delays, or excuses of any kind once the company makes a public announcement to do something. No reputable company would survive long, let alone prosper, conducting business this way. It just seems to me like Caracal is just dragging this matter along hoping people would get over it eventually. If the market is fine with that, then so be it. But otherwise, if legal proceedings are not an option, a national boycott would be the only way to get what''s deserved.[/QUOTE]\r\n\r\n+1 Fudgepacker.\r\n\r\n\r\nA national boycott seems like a dream.

Hey! every one loves the cat right??\r\n\r\nWhy should the company bother anyway?  As of last time I checked the market. The prices have increased from being in the 70s to the 80s in thousands in Pak rupees.  \r\n\r\nSince the customer is willing to pay more why bother to go ahead with the recall?\r\n\r\nOn this forum as well as beyond I keep imploring people to wait till the issue is resolved at least.

It''s not often that ED Bro isn''t right, but when it happens, you have to jump on it :)\n\nAnyways, 2nd strike is definitely nice to have, but shouldn''t be a deal breaker if you like everything else about the gun, because in all my  fighting pistol training I''ve always been taught to "tap rack bang" after an FTF and not to attempt a second strike. It''s so obvious most people don''t think about it, but ill never forget it after an instructor told me, "once you run out of ammo, or a failure occurs, your gun immediately becomes a brick... then what?".

(519826, 'Taurus .357 mag, Model 627 Dear Fellow and Senior members, \r\n\r\nI would seek for an expert opinion here. I am getting a deal of .357 mag taurus revolver in six inches, model 627 TRACKER, lot 2009 on a current market price (90K). \r\n\r\nNow the issue is that this piece is without porting feature, i.e. small holes created on both sides of the barrel towards end - For reduced recoil. I believe this is because it is an old stock (2009) as recent both models (608 and 627) come with this feature. \r\n\r\nSo i would need an advice if i should take this deal or not ? is it worth spending this amount? or should i go for Model 608 instead. will NOT HAVING PORTING feature make alot of difference in using this handgun?\r\n\r\nI am so confused, kindly help by guiding me. I don''t want to miss the deal as these day six-inchers are somehow limited in the market. For a long time i was looking for one and finally found this. I would be really grateful for the help and guidance.', ''),

(519910, ' Yes, as I mentioned this is a "Non AO" (fixed parallax) scope. From the factory parallax was set at 100 yard. I adjusted the objective lens to set the parallax at abut 60-70 yards. Now at full 9x magnification it gives use-ably clear image from 30 to 100+ yards. when it comes to 10-11 yards, it can not focus when at 9x (obvious), so when I have to shoot at 11 or so yards, I decrease the magnification to 3 or 4x, and image gets clear.\nParallax or focus of objective can be further adjusted to bring more close but then at longer ranges it will not focus clearly at 9x. So it is best to set the parallax of non-AO scopes at 60 or 70 yards to use full (9x) magnification in the field.\nAs far as Diopter adjustment (eye piece rotation) is concerned, as I use -2.75 spectacles so I had to adjust it already \nto make the reticle clear. And to my humble knowledge, eyepiece rotation will make the reticle clear. Does it effect the target image, I have no idea, but I think it will not.', ''),

I was quoted a final price of 100k for the Duty by Fahad at Ahmed Traders. Didn''t really focus on the Caracal due to the slide explosion issue, but I think the guy at Point Blank quoted 75k. TP-9 quoted at Rs. 75k.\n\nI really want to check out the P01 but it wasn''t available with either dealer nor did they have a Stoeger.

I wanted to buy one when they were about US$25 less expensive a couple of months ago, but I was short on cash and have been watching the delivered price inching up even since I bought mine last week.\n\nI have a couple of US$200 military surplus Yugo M57''s that are two of my favorite shooters, but the 7.62x25mm cartridges are about the same price as .357 magnum rounds, so they can be expensive to shoot. Zastava has been exporting newly manufactured M57''s and the slightly more expensive 9x19mm M70A''s that come with a factory designed slide mounted safety that is supposed to work nicely compared to the add-on frame mounted safety in the older imported pistols.\nFirearms from the Serbian plant have a good reputation as far as I can tell. The slim, simple, and rugged design of the steel Tokarev style handgun is my main attraction, and 9x19mm Luger would sure let me send more lead down range for the money.  The fit and finish look good to me. The plastic stocks have some minor flaws and scratches, but the metal appears very nice inside and out. \nI have small hands and the slim single stack Tokarev design feels great, as always.

(520135, ' [QUOTE=il.bill;358160]I recently received a new Zastava M70A chambered in 9x19mm Luger. The cost was US$320 delivered. I wanted to buy one when they were about US$25 less expensive a couple of months ago, but I was short on cash and have been watching the delivered price inching up even since I bought mine last week.\n\nI have a couple of US$200 military surplus Yugo M57''s that are two of my favorite shooters, but the 7.62x25mm cartridges are about the same price as .357 magnum rounds, so they can be expensive to shoot. Zastava has been exporting newly manufactured M57''s and the slightly more expensive 9x19mm M70A''s that come with a factory designed slide mounted safety that is supposed to work nicely compared to the add-on frame mounted safety in the older imported pistols.\nFirearms from the Serbian plant have a good reputation as far as I can tell. The slim, simple, and rugged design of the steel Tokarev style handgun is my main attraction, and 9x19mm Luger would sure let me send more lead down range for the money.  The fit and finish look good to me. The plastic stocks have some minor flaws and scratches, but the metal appears very nice inside and out. \nI have small hands and the slim single stack Tokarev design feels great, as always. As they say ''the proof of the pudding is in the tasting'', and I have not yet been able to fire the pistol, but I am looking forward to running some (relatively) inexpensive 9x19mm ammo through it soon.[/QUOTE]\n\nWell 7.62x25mm rounds here are cheaper then 9mm... 7.62x25mm or .30 caliber is the favorite one of our street criminals :D By the way, welcome to PakGuns!', ''),

Thank you all for your kind words and warm welcome.\nSurplus 7.62x25mm ammo with corrosive primers from Eastern Europe was once plentiful and inexpensive in the US. Is has almost disappeared from the market, and the only .30 caliber cartridges I can now find are Boxer primed Sellier & Bellot or Winchester. The 9x19mm Parabellum ammo is by far the most popular centerfire caliber for sale here. I can purchase 100 rounds of 9x19mm for what 50 rounds of 7.62x25mm costs. I have very limited international experience and had no idea that the .30 caliber was less expensive anywhere.

It includes its speed of burning. If speed of burning is too fast, it makes a stronger backward shock(recoil), blowback and also decline of muzzle velocity. It also demages the barrel, even barrel or chamber could be brusted. If it is too slow, it results in burning some powder out side the muzzle.(you can guess the result)[/COLOR]\n[COLOR=#333333]Powder must be smokeless and clean.[/COLOR]\n\n[COLOR=#333333]2: Load; It mean shots in the cartridge. Shape, surface, size affect the performance. If shape is not good round, shots will spread earlier and group will also affected. If surface polish in not good, shots'' speed will be reduced due to air friction and its group will also be affected. Shot size makes its range and grouping. Different sizes are used for different birds and animals at different ranges, if size of shots in a cartridge is not same, it is a sign of low grade cartridge.[/COLOR]\n[COLOR=#333333]3: Wads; Wad and seals (or Plastic cup) are used to seal the pressure of burning powder and to absorbe most of backward shock(recoil).

(520578, ' [QUOTE=Trajan;342786]My dear brother Baderjanjua\nFirst of all congratulations on your purchase. Your acquisition is truly a fine weapon. \nI would however, give you a heads-up on the following issues, since you mentioned that you would be keeping the weapon as a SD weapon in a vehicle:\n\n1- The .357 magnum round from a snub nose causes a HUGE muzzle flash. The ported model directs a big portion of that flash upwards. Hence if you are shooting it from a position where the ports would face you (very easy to do in a vehicle when pointing the weapon slightly upwards from the seat position to say the window), you MIGHT be exposing yourself  to burns yourself. If you happen to shoot from the driver side towards the passenger window, you might be risking burning the passenger , even if the muzzle if far clear of the passenger. \n2- The .357 magnum from a snub nose produces a very loud report. I have had the unfortunate experience of shooting the same without hearing protection in the OPEN and my ears were ringing for a considerable time. I can only assume that shooting the same in an enclosed place (such as indoors or within a vehicle) could cause serious damage to the hearing.\n \nThe above are my personal opinions in view of my experience with this weapon. I would not want a fellow pakgunner to be in any harms way.\nI would recommend that you do your own research on this.\n\nBest regards[/QUOTE]\n\nDear Trajan, would you recommend a model without portholes over ported ones? consider 6-incher 627 tracker for this case..', ''),

(520587, ' Fezan: I keep a snubbie in .357 in stainless steel and without ports. The heavier weight of the revolver makes it a bit more manageable without the ports.  Also, i have put hogue rubber grips on it which makes a BIG difference in reduction of felt recoil from this small beast. \n\nI am not a big fan of the ports on small barrels (upper muzzle blast,  reduction in muzzle velocity of the bullet, possibility of being blinded by the bright upwards flash if shot in the dark, more felt sound from the blast , possibility of self burning if fired in a confined space pointing upwards -such as from inside a vehicle etc). The ported snubbie is Titanium if i am not mistaken and the ports are needed to keep the kick down on the lighter metal.\n\nIt is a terrifying weapon to have as a BACKUP weapon and conceals very easily.\n\n\nHaving said that the ports on a 6 incher are not bad since, i take it, that the use would be recreational on a range and the reduction in recoil will be most helpful in reducing shooting fatigue. Loss of velocity would not be that significant.', ''),

(544309, 'Another one bites the dust :p This is what a magnum powered airgun can do to the sturdiest of scopes!! Mind you this is my most trusted Center-Point 4-16x40AO scope, which is an airgun rated scope and has lasted 2500+ shots on my Hatsan mod 125 sniper. But today, this is what happened. Which further reiterates the fact that even the most sturdiest of scopes DO fail on air guns. Another one of my quite expensive "NON-airgun rated" scope did not last 300-400 shots on it. The scope still works fairly well on shorter distances (up to 30-40 yards) but beyond that (60+ yards) the group opens up quite dramatically, and is rather waste of ammo due to wide open groups at that distance. So for now I''m back to pen sights till I buy another one.\r\n\r\nI wasn''t able to hit my target at 70 yards and began to worry as the groups would open up to 3-4 inches. The gun was dieseling quite a lot as i used it after a month and it wouldn''t settle despite having shot over 50-60 pellets. So I ran the JSB heavies through it and after 10 odd shots the dieseling had subsided (it cme back with lighter pellets but not as much). I cleaned the barrel, took of the moderator, tried heavier pellets, all in vain!! Same result every time. On shorter distance (15-20 yards) the groups would  squeeze to under 1 inch but still not as it used to shoot. Frustration really kicked in and I thought there might be something wrong with the barrel or internals. \r\n\r\nAfter few more shots something rattled and upon inspection I discovered that the, the illumination switch was hanging on the side. I took off the scope, shook it and it produced slight rattling sound. I shot a group at 15 yards with open sights and to my relief it was as tight as it would shoot at distance with scope. I adjusted the open sights as they hadn''t been in use for a long time and I was back in business :D finally, nothing wrong with the rifle but the scope I believe has served its purpose :p It still works but in that condition it wont last long before being damaged further.\r\n\r\nThe gun is dieseling which worries me still and I''ll most probably visit Khilji on Wednesday to open it up and clean it as i suspect we kind of over lubed when we opened her last time.', ''),

(520605, 'Categorization of Guns The dilemma, a newbie like me, while deciding to buy a weapon, faces is to categorize the weapons available in the market. After months of market search and discussion with seniors, I have developed an easily understandable categorization.\r\n\r\nTo make the decision process easy and for ease of understanding for most of newbies like me, let''s divide the weapons in 5 categories, staring from "A" being high-end to "E" being low-end. The rating will not include local made weapons as they are not worth considering (at least to me). Let''s start:\r\n\r\nA Category: I will put all exotic custom built weapons produced by specialized companies. In this list, I will put brands like Holland & Holland, James Purdy, Boss, Some Products of Beretta & Browning, Blazer, Merkel and etc. These weapons are mostly made to order by hand and by using best available materials, tools & techniques and craftsmanship. These weapons are result of decades of research & development and experience.\r\n\r\nB Category: In this Category, I will put all production weapons produced by centuries old companies mostly based in Europe like Beretta, Browning, Beneli, Heckler & Kosch, SigSaur, some products of CZ and etc. These weapons are produced after specialized research and best metallurgy, tools and techniques. \r\n\r\nC Category: In this category, I will put mass production but well-reputed, reliable and reasonably priced weapons produced by famous companies based in Europe, US and East Europe like AyA, Winchester, Remington, CZ, Francchi, Vepr, Mossberg, Fabarm and etc. These weapons are result of years of research & development and have good metallurgy but are made to address the need of masses.\r\n\r\nD Category: In this category, I will include mass production weapons which are produced by some reputed companies but the designs are inspired / replicas of weapons falling in B category. There are some indigenous designs as well. The metallurgy, tools and techniques used to make these weapons are very good and there is some amount of research & development is also involved. In this category, I will include weapons made by Cottage Industry in Europe, East Europeans, Russian, South American and East Asian companies like Baikal, Taurus, Marocchi, Saiga, Tula, Armscor, Daewoo and etc.\r\n\r\nE Category: This category includes replicas made by Turkish and Chinese companies. These are simply good copies are famous weapon mostly falling in "B" and "C". The metallurgy, tools and techniques used to produce these weapons are good but there is no research & development behind these guns as the designs are simply copied. In this category, I will include weapons produced by Norinco, Hatsan, Akkar, Canik55 and etc. Please do not confuse the reputed companies which have shifted their production to Turkey. They will continue to fall in "C" category.\r\n\r\nLet the debate on categorization begin........', ''),

(520654, ' [QUOTE=SZBR;358602]Okay that is pretty early for closing. If you guys are willing to reschedule to Saturday afternoon it would be awesome!!\n\nQuestion: I was wondering that when a deal is "finalized" will the dealer retain the gun for you or they want immediate payment? Do they want cash payment or CASH cheque will also do?\n\n\n\nHeld both a Stoeger Cougar and Taurus PT-92 yesterday. Both felt good in my hand but to my surprise I really like the SS look for the PT-92! \n\nGoing through various threads (on various forums) that compare these guns, my takeaway was that they are both equal in reliability & innate accuracy. Further, the PT-92 is apparently exactly the same as a Beretta PT-92 and made using the same techniques and modeling tools, etc. So if it comes down to either of these I will be going for Taurus PT-92.\n\nStill looking to get my hands on a CZ 75 P01 though!\n\nQuestion: If budget is not a problem, should I go for CZ Duty or Taurus PT-92?\n\nRegards.[/QUOTE]\n\nbrother... understand it like this, both Cougar and 92 were original Beretta designs and makings... Beretta shifted cougar''s plant to Turkey for cheap labour and its now sold a Stoeger Cougar. While Tauras is selling copies of Beretta (I am sure they are licensed) 92FS as PT-92 and PT-99... You can still spot many similarities in both guns as if they are from same families. Now here is a deal about those 2, 92FS/PT-92 and PT-99 are full frame pistols while Stoeger cougar is a standard sized. So if you are also planning to conceal-carry, try to holster both of them under your shirt. \n\nSo in simple words... both are beretta designs and makings... Now one is sold as Stoeger and other is sold as Taurus.\n\nyeap... give me your email we can make a plan for saturday.', ''),

The R8 does have finish and feature options that could easily increase its price.\n\nThe idea of producing a modular rifle is not new, nor is it unique. The simplest modular approach may be the single shot products of Thompson Center where stocks and barrel swaps control chamber and long gun/handgun configurations. The Krieghoff Semprio is an inline bolt action repeater that, through interchangeable barrels, can be configured to a long list of standard and magnum cartridges. Even Savage brought interchangeable barrels and bolt heads to budget bolt action rifles. What is different from one company''s product to another is the approach taken to constructing a modular system, how the concept is executed and the quality and performance of the finished product. In this regard, the R8 is a standout.', ''),
(520662, 'My new BLASER R-8 IN 7MM WIN MAG Some magazine details...\n\nMagazine inserts are made of fiber filled plastic and fit inside what Blaser terms a "spare magazine". No tools are required to remove the insert from the magazine or the spare magazine from the R8. A magazine insert is supplied with each barrel\nMagazine inserts serve a couple of important functions. The first is to reliably feed cartridges based upon their size and geometry, the other is to establish proportional bolt travel for the R8. A considerate feature when a rifle has so much potential bolt stroke capacity. Each magazine also has a safety position that locks it into the receiver so it can''t be released by simply squeezing on the side release tabs. In this configuration, the gun''s bolt is opened and the rifle is loaded from top side rather than directly into the magazine.', ''),

Though she only fires PCP weapons with help. Her enthusiasm shadows that of my 7 year old nephew who i originally took to the range and he is least interested in firearms.

Instead we should support our brothern in arms in getting their guns replaced. If we kept on unreasonably bashing the gun and destoryed their market, the supplier / importers will loose interest and I am afraid the replacement will become a dream.\n\nTill date, they have fulfilled all their promises in a timely manner. They have published the findings of their investigation on their website within a month. They have called back faulty guns and have promised to provide parts for guns falling under 1st recall. Things take time and we must show some patience. We know they are fullfilling their promise in USA. Let''s wait for our turn. Things don''t happen overnight. I took them an year to launch Caracal in our market. There are limitations in the system. There are issues pertaining to fresh import of guns and parts. There are issues regarding establishment of after sales service centres.\n\nFor example, it has been 6 months and we have not seen fresh import of turkish weapons. It took 2 years to import CZ999 / EZ9. This is to give idea how our system works.\n\nSo, I will request my brothers to use words carefully.

The R8 does have finish and feature options that could easily increase its price.\n\nThe idea of producing a modular rifle is not new, nor is it unique. The simplest modular approach may be the single shot products of Thompson Center where stocks and barrel swaps control chamber and long gun/handgun configurations. The Krieghoff Semprio is an inline bolt action repeater that, through interchangeable barrels, can be configured to a long list of standard and magnum cartridges. Even Savage brought interchangeable barrels and bolt heads to budget bolt action rifles.

This round came in existence in 2001 as a competition to FN 5.7 x 28. For details on comparison and ballistics, you can simply google it. The round is mainly used in HK MP7 and UCP pistol.

Semi auto (Autoloader)\r\ngood for all-around use however most recommended for dove and waterfowl hunting\r\n\r\n2. Side by Side\r\ngood for all-around use however most recommended for upland\r\n\r\n2. Over and Under\r\ngood for all-around use however most recommended for sports shooting\r\n\r\non a purely theoretical standpoint a semi auto is considered the ideal all-around shotgun as it provides the opportunity to enjoy all types of hunting and shooting sports.\r\n\r\nTIP:\r\ngo to a shop which has all three of them. pick''em up one by one. mount and try to get the feel of the each type of shotgun.

(521352, ' While it is important to keep the barrel clean. It is also important to keep the breach and the muzzle crown, especially the latter, absolutely defect free. A defective muzzle crown will totally ruin the accuracy of any rifled barrel. Furthermore, airgun barrels are usually not as hard as firearm barrels. Therefore, one should be very careful during the cleaning process, not to nick the barrel by using inappropriately sized rods and brushes. \n\nAfter going through many commercially available cleaning kits, and wrecking them - the cleaning rods were always the weakest link. I got my own cleaning rod made. Quite simply, all I did was get a one yard long length of 5mm diameter stainless steel rod, machined a handle out of 12mm thick rod and welded that to one end of it. The other end has a male thread on it, one that fits the Hoppe''s cleaning brushes that I have. \n\nI learnt the hard and expensive way, but if you want to have a sturdy and dependable cleaning kit, simply get the appropriate sized nylon  and phosphor bronze brushes that you need and get your own cleaning rod made. Mine cost me all of Rs. 800 compared to the Rs.2000 I paid for the Hoppe''s aluminum rod. \n\nWith regards to cleaning oils, I have found Rust-o-Nil by NASA (not the space shuttle guys), to be even better than WD40. And if you have the patience, then even better is 50% automatic transmission fluid mixed with 50% kerosene oil. A liter of each will cost you about Rs. 300 in total, and the two liters of cleaning oil that you thus make, will last a lot longer and cost a lot cheaper than a 400ml aerosol spray of the cheapest cleaning oil. \n\nI reccommend cleaning  the bore after every tin of pellets, i.e 250 shots or 500 shots. This way you will avoid any stubborn lead deposits and will not need to use hard metal brushes, (which can potentially damage the barrel, if used incorrectly), to clean the barrel.  After you have thoroughly rogered the barrel with the nylon brush, run a few cotton patches through it, until you get one that comes out absolutely clean.  (The best cotton patches are made from old white T-shirts and vests).\n\nOnce the barrel is absolutely clean, run a lightly oil patch through it (use Hoppe''s gun oil), and you''re good to start shooting again.', ''),

Making the case with a hollow rim provides the space for the   chemicals. \n\n 	            Priming compound is a mechanical mixture of lead styphnate,   antimony sulfide, barium nitrate, and other chemicals.  This  combination will create heat and gas  when struck sharply. For rimfire  cartridges, raw wet priming mix is placed  directly in the hollow rim  cavity. Binders provide all the holding power that  keeps the primer in  place. Some rimfire mixes differ from their centerfire  counterparts by  the addition of a frictionator (helps ignition in the rimfire  system),  which may be finely ground glass. The priming chemicals are blended in controlled  facilities, often  by remote control. Adding water to the mix makes it less  dangerous to  handle and allows the mass to be shaped. Even with these  precautions,  transporting primer mix is hazardous; cartridge cases are moved to  the  primer chemistry facility rather than moving the primer mix to the case   loading location.\n	\nThe priming process steps are as follows:\n\n 	\n[LIST=1]\n[*]The wet mix is forced into small holes in a  nonsparking metal charge plate that sets a fixed volume of mix in each hole.\n[*]The filled plate is placed over a tray of  rimfire cases; the tray has the same hole pattern as the charge plate.\n[*]A third plate with multiple pins, corresponding  to the hole pattern in the charge plate, is pressed through the charge plate.\n[*]The individual disks of priming mix fall into  the cases.\n[/LIST]\n 	To ensure that the mix is uniformly distributed into the  hollow rim  cavity of the case, both downward and centrifugal force is applied  during  the spinning operation. A rotating spinner quill enters each  case, causing the  case to spin at high speed. The working end of the  quill forces the wet mix  toward the cavity and the spinning distributes  the primer mix to uniformly fill  the cavity.\n\n 	Voids in the mix in the rim cavity can cause a misfire. Most   manufacturers have stringent visual or electronic inspection procedures  that  reject any cases that do not have the proper distribution of  priming mix.                                                                      \n\nAfter spinning, the cases are placed in low-temperature  ovens to  eliminate the moisture. Before moving to the load line, the cases are   tested for primer sensitivity. A sample of dried cases from each lot is   selected.  The cases are placed in a test  machine with a vertical  cartridge chamber  beneath a steel ball of known weight.  The ball is dropped on the cases  from a series of heights. At each height  setting, the operator notes  the percentage of cases that fire. As the height  increases, the energy  applied to the case becomes greater, increasing the  number of fired  cases. Eventually, the height reaches a point where all cases fire.\n\n 			 	By applying standard statistical procedures to the data  matrix of  fired cases and corresponding heights, a value is generated that can  be  compared to published specifications for primer sensitivity. If that  value  falls within specifications, the cases are released for loading.', ''),

(521538, ' [B]21-04-13: A Day spend with Khilji in his workshop\n[/B]\nFrom the very first time I met Khilji at the PG get together in Karachi, I saw him as a super intelligent person.... a person who knew and understood airguns atleast in terms of its mechanics more than anyone I have met so far...\n\nAnyhow after trying several experiments with my Kral and unable to find any solutions, yesterday (Sunday, 21-04-13) I finally decided to met Khilji at his workshop..... and tell you what... just getting to his workshop was an experience in it self..... over 15 mins of twists and turns in lanes in which my mehran could hardly fit.... and once I had completely lost my bearings and had absolutely no idea where I was, we finally ended up at our destination... I almost forgot to mention...along with me was Ch_Adnan, a firearm enthusiast who is now starting to realize how interesting and fun airguns can be....\n\nConsidering it was lunch time, Khilji immediately made arrangements for some very nice Biryani served with chilled Pepsi...and trust me guys, it was awsome....\n\nlater we tried out some shots from Khilji`s Diana 54 and Webley and Scott (Synthetic Stock).....\n\nAnyhow, later Khilji shared with us few of his self created gadgets which included:\n\n[B]Custom Made Zeroing Stand:\n\n[/B][ATTACH=CONFIG]20577[/ATTACH]\n\n[B]2 Inch Spinner Targets:\n\n[/B][ATTACH=CONFIG]20578[/ATTACH]\n\nAnd the most interesting of all was.......Khilji is currently working on a project and is very confident about its sucess Insha Allah... he is working on developing a PCP Rifle and below is a picture of his unfinished project\n\n\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]20579[/ATTACH]\n\nNow is that awsome or what.... He targets to develop an Airgun which is able to do around 1100 fps....\n\nAnyhow getting back to Kral..... the mystery was solved by Khilji is just 5 mins and I just don''t know how I missed it in all this time... below is a picture, try to figure out whats the fault....\n\n\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]20580[/ATTACH]\n\n\nYup.. U got it... the front sight was slightly tilted towards the right side....causing the deflection... the barrel was never bent...however the front sight on my Kral did not have a screw for adjustments so it had to be twisted by applying pressure... and with a couple of twists and turns we were able to align it right in the middle...... just because of the way the silencer/supressor was attached to the barrel, it just appeared that there is no way it was going to loose its center, but I suppose the loading of over 1500 to 2000 times gradually turned the silencer/suppressor enough to cause the resulting deflection of 5-6 inches....\n\nAs soon as we were done aligning, tried several shots and the gun was shooting even better than ever.... next using Khilji`s Chorony we checked out the velocities for all the airguns...\n\nWebley was shooting at an Avg. of 880 fps\nDianna 54 was shooting at an Avg. of 820 fps\nKral was shooting at an Average of 420 fps\n\nKhilji made another inspection and realized that the Breach seals of my Kral were completely burnt and a lot of pressure was releasing from there.... He asked one of his technicians to make a Teflon Seal for my Airgun.. Teflon is a white plasticy material known for its extremely high temperature resistance and low friction.... Immediately after the seal was inserted, we checked in Chorony again and guess what... this time my Kral was doing an avg. of 525 fps...... and rise in over 100 fps straight up.....\n\nBy the time we got done with the seal, it was almost evening and we decided to head back..... Khilji was kind enough to gift is 2 inch target spinners to me along with approx a 100 card pieces to be used as airgun targets (perfect groups were coming on these cards, no extra tears at all).....\n \nIt was a great day spend with Khilji, got to learn alot of new things... and this was yet another great experience with another very humble and courteous Pak Gunner... \n\nNext projects: Khilji did notice that my Kral spring was totally dry.... the next time we are going to lube the Kral and see how it performs after that... also very anxious to find out the fps at which my new Gamo Shadow is spitting....\n \nShoot Safe and have a nice day...', ''),

The good news is where as a few comments have been made about it being a bad shooter no has has claimed that it is unreliable or has FTF/FTE issues. \r\n\r\nI came across this gun a few years back, shot a 1000 odd rounds though it and moved on. I remember thinking it was a decent handgun and a good shooter. Infact I bought one for my brother as a home defense gun. The gun has a 19 shot mag capacity with a SA/DA trigger and a 4 inch barrel. The sights are fixed and a cocked and locked style safety and decocker are also present. The gun weighs around 900 grams, is well machined and the finish is good. \r\n\r\nThe trigger is a little hard and takes 5/6 shots getting used to. The back sights although fixed can be manually adjusted with a hammer if required. \r\n\r\nThere is nothing new or unusual about the gun, it''s a 92/99 with a one inch shorter barrel. I took some quick pictures posted below to do the rest of the talking.\r\n\r\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]1784[/ATTACH][ATTACH=CONFIG]1791[/ATTACH][ATTACH=CONFIG]1790[/ATTACH][ATTACH=CONFIG]1785[/ATTACH][ATTACH=CONFIG]1786[/ATTACH][ATTACH=CONFIG]1787[/ATTACH][ATTACH=CONFIG]1788[/ATTACH][ATTACH=CONFIG]1789[/ATTACH]\r\n \r\nTargets were shot at 15M.

(521860, ' Furthermore, if the gun is already rusting, then first get rid of the rust by spraying WD40 on the rusted parts, and then leaving them overnight. The best way to do this, is to first leave the gun out in the sun for an hour, ideally in locked car under the rear windshield. It will get pretty hot.  So take the gun out and immediately liberally spray it with WD40. Once the gun is no longer hot to the touch, clean up the oil on the stock etc, and then put it back in the car for another hour of sunbathing, (make sure you put a few old newspapers under it). This practice ensures that the oil seeps down  to the very bottom of the rust and loosens it.  Before you take the gun out, look through the rear windshield, and see if any oil is visible on the metal parts, specially the rusted ones. It shouldnt be, it should have all seeped in. \n\nSo assuming that the oil has all seeped in, take the gun out and get to work on the rusted parts with a patch of steel wool. Rubbing it in a gentle motion without much downward pressure, before long you will have gotten rid of the rust but not the bluing!  If the rusting isn''t very bad, then use fine steel wool, but if it is, then first use coarse steel wool, then medium grade, and finally fine. \n\nTo clean your steel wool patch while working, pour some kerosene oil in a small bowl and rinse the patch in it from time to time. (Dispose of the kerosene safely once you are done). \n\nWhen you feel you have taken off all the rust, clean the gun with a soft cloth or tissue and have a good look at it in the sun and also feel the barrel and receiver with your hand to check if you have missed any spots. \n\nOnce you are assured that you have done your best. Get down to cleaning the gun with alcohol swabs, so that there is not trace of oil left on it anywhere. The best way to do it is to remove the action from the stock. Take off the trigger guard, front sights, rear sight, and any other accessories that can come off and clean those too.  Plug the muzzle with an cotton tipped, vaseline dipped earcleaning bud, and cover the cocking lever slot and trigger with masking tape. Then spray the action and the barrel with primer, wait for it to dry, and then spray it with paint. \n \nThe best primer and paints to use for rust protection are the marine grade ones. Failing that regular mild steel primer and spray can oil paints will do too, but dont forget that several thin coats are better than  a few thick coats. Oil paints dry quite slowly to begin with and a thick coat hardly ever dries fully, not unless you put it in the oven.', ''),

Another attempt to deprive the good guys with their right to bear firearms.\n  [URL="http://tribune.com.pk/story/539109/hurriedly-enforced-new-arms-law-challenged-in-court/"]\n[FONT=Georgia][B][B]KARACHI: [/B]While the outgoing government hurriedly enforced the Sindh Arms Act 2013 – in light of the Supreme Court orders to restore peace in city – its legality remains doubtful.[/B][/FONT]\n[FONT=Georgia]The Sindh High Court (SHC) has issued notice to the Sindh Assembly secretary, chief and law secretaries to file their comments on this by April 29. On Monday, residents Syed Sakhawat Ali and Advocate Khursheed Khan went to the high court to challenge the legality of the new law.[/FONT]\n[FONT=Georgia]They submitted that the Sindh Arms Bill 2013 was tabled in the provincial assembly for a debate on February 21. “But there was no debate at all, thus the bill was bulldozed,” said the petitioners. “The then acting governor later signed the bill, converting it into law on February 27.” They claimed the law has been enforced since March 1.[/FONT]\n[FONT=Georgia][IMG]http://pullquotesandexcerpts.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/1094.jpg?w=625[/IMG][/FONT]\n[FONT=Georgia]According to the petitioners, the legality of the law was entirely questionable as there are many lacunas. Under Section 23(a) of the act, anyone found possessing a weapon even with a valid licence can be booked and arrested. “Such act is made an offence liable to be punished with a jail term,” they pointed out.[/FONT]\n[FONT=Georgia]Sections 24 and 25 of the act also carry 10 years of jail imprisonment each, which is an injustice to those citizens who possess weapons with a valid licence, the petitioners argued. They pleaded the court call the entire record of the assembly proceedings during which the bill was presented. Till then, the operation of the arms law should be suspended, they requested.[/FONT]\n[FONT=Georgia][IMG]http://pullquotesandexcerpts.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/the-petitioner.jpg?w=625[/IMG][/FONT]\n[FONT=Georgia]After hearing the petition, the bench – headed by Justice Faisal Arab – issued notices to Sindh Assembly’s secretary, acting secretary, chief secretary and the law secretary to file replies by April 29.[/FONT]\nhttp://tribune.com.pk/story/539109/hurriedly-enforced-new-arms-law-challenged-in-court/[/URL]', ''),

I had some extra time so I visited by buddy David (owner of Glock Knowledge store) at old salom area of bangkok. I''ve known David for a while since I''ve been buying stuff from him in past but always he was in regional Glock office in Hong Kong so we talked on phone while his rep would deal with me at Bangkok store. At first, It took me some to convince him to sell me Glock stuff with help from office referenLce. Because he said he does not usually entertain foreigners especially from our part of world. But was very polite about it and simply told me at first that he didn''t want any liabilities due to politics. \n\nBut anyway I finally got to meet him in person. We had a blast! Since I went early in morning, he gave me 3 hours with him  since he was training. He offered to teach me basic functionalities and almost complete break down into 30+ parts and reassembly. It was just amazing being taught by a professional. He also showed me some Glock training videos. He told me, he got all training in Austria. He turned me into an amateur Glock Gunsmith (just kidding). \n\nHere are some of stuff I purchased. Mostly original OEM parts and a few aftermarket.\n\n[IMG][IMG]http://i1063.photobucket.com/albums/t511/gunfreak2/2CB489F4-B8B7-41EC-A732-BFE7983533BC-19919-00000EC1B4F11D71_zps90fb2a57.jpg[/IMG][/IMG]', ''),

(628755, ' [QUOTE=Enigmatic Desires;466489]I dont want a short barrel. I already have handguns for that. i want a rifle that is an actual rifle not a cross between a rifle and an SMG.  Whats teh big idea about the fake barrel anyway.. If people dont want 18 inchers.. they can have em chopped off when ever they want..[/QUOTE]\nED short barrelled rifles serve a very different purpose to 18 inched long barrelled rifles. If you want to run it in a competition like IDPA having a shorter barrel makes it much easier to manoeuvre and manipulate the rifle around. Also in my own personal experience even a 7.5 inched AR-15 can shoot out to 300 yards without a magnified optic very accurately. There is not much advantaged gained when you''re moving from 16 to 18inches of barrel. If you move to 20 then yes there is more advantage gained. A 14.5 inched AR is just as accurate as an 18inch AR within the 300 yard range and rarely are you going to take it past that range. The .223 round is built for CQB scenarios within a range of 400 yards, although an 18 inch barrel is more accurate than its shorter counterparts but only slightly and it makes the rifle heavy and hard to manipulate in competition. Which is why Im trying to find shorter Barrels for the PAR MK3 but the authorised distributors refuse to import even an extra 14.5inch barrel for me. If ANYONE knows someone who could get me a 14.5 or less barrel for the PAR MK3 id greatly appreciate it, id even buy them lunch!\n  The affective range of a handgun and that of a rifle round, the controllability of a rifle and a handgun and the lethality of the round of a handgun and a rifle.

As duty was a new design this was the problem they faced, but they fixed it later. That''s exactly whats happening with Caracal. The flaw was with C model in only limited numbers.

(522228, ' Who says that they don''t care about customers? Were they not worried about their customer, they would not had issued recall and posted the same on their website. They heard one complaint and they recalled their entire production even without investigating the issue. It was only confirmed after investigation that there could be an issue. So, they carried on with recall. Has anybody heard about recall on this or any scale by any so called big company? The answer is big [B]NO[/B].\r\n\r\nNow some will say that the same recall was not issued in Pakistan. True! But blame your distributor not Company because Caracal USA is also distributor not company itself. Kindly, note that recall notice issued by company was for entire world not just for USA. Anyhow, in the end, Caracal Pakistan also reluctantly announced that frames of the gun will be replaced.\r\n\r\nNow, some will say that they were reluctant to issue second recall. I disagree. Why? Because as and when issue was taken up with the company, they issued recall worldwide. It is to be noted that the issue took some time as there was misunderstanding at both ends.\r\n\r\nAgain, in case of 2nd recall, they company was so concerned that they first issued recall of entire production. And after investigation, they pinpointed the affected guns. Has anybody seen such act by any so called big company? The answer is again [B] BIG NO[/B].\r\n\r\nNow some will say that they didn''t keep their promise. No Sir! They have kept their promise is USA and keeping in view the timeline, I can be easily said that the issue will be take some time as there are few formalities / hurdels to be delt with.\r\n\r\nFor everybody''s knowledge, kindly look at the issue in this way that the issue was highlighted as the affected person knew that there is someone who will listen.

(522237, ' @Jibz....Brother, this is exceptional work. Regardless if it worked perfectly or not, if it was tried by someone earlier or not, it still shows that you have the brilliance to ''think'' & courage to ''apply'' your imagination. Wonderful. Such projects tickle ones imagination and let the creative brain cells multiply all along.\n\nAnother commendable thing is that you identified, understood & accepted the shortcomings of this design. The design you have developed and can be made very rigid with some additional linkages or the one that has been mentioned by @Umair Bhaur. But the fact remains that line of sight will always be resting at a different axis in connection to line of fire as the recoil / rail mechanism is floating on the stock. At short distances it might work but at distances more than 30m it will not be accurate as you have already concluded.\n\nThe easiest solution to this issue is to have an air-gun grade scope. From my personal experience, I have not seen any airgun breaking scopes as yet let alone 52 or 54. I have a Norconia scope mounted on 54 for the last 7 years or so, and I do not even recall when was the last time I had to readjust it. Shoots perfectly.\n\nAll the best.', ''),

Truly amazing and genius of you..... anyhow the other day I went to meet Khilji, who also happens to be one of our PG brothers, he has developed a spinner target (with 2" plates) and Ideal for shooting up till 15 to 20 meters.... and he was courteous enough to just gift it to me like that...This swinger is so much fun that I have for the moment totally forgotten about creating groups on paper...\n\nHowever I do intend on giving this spinner a paint job... below is the picture of the spinner[/QUOTE]\n\nThank you brother. This is a nice stand u have got there. The plates look larger than 2" or is it just the foto impression! \n\n\n[QUOTE=arawan;360105]@Tareen, Excellent effort, very nice\n\nHickok45 also has same kind of stuff.\n\n[23/04/2013 10:13 PM] [URL]http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03oXMTKRfnU&feature=youtube_gdata_player[/URL][/QUOTE]\n\nThanx a lot brother. And WOW, what a range this guy is enjoying. Some are very nice ideas for rifle & airgun shooting.\n\n\n[QUOTE=Kashif Baig;360120]Tareen sb, I always admire your out of box thinking and as usual you have come up with this unique yet simple idea of devising this target stand. I have one query though, i.e. how do you carry this stand with you at the range? I mean from the pics it looks quite large to carry easily in your car or jeep. Or perhaps you are using it at your backyard. Secondly, what steel gauge you used for making those plates and can these handle any bigger caliber as well and if not what gauge you cosider using for bigger bores like 7mm and above.\n\nRegards[/QUOTE]\n\nThank you very much brother for liking the effort. \n\nThe stand''s dimensions are H3'' x L3'' xW2'' so I can fit three of them in the back of a Pajero stuffed in each other. Cannot be transported by car though. As it is going to be a one time transport to my farmhouse, no worries. Originally, I designed one that was collapsible but inherently unstable due to moving hinges. I''ll be putting them there permanently. \n\nThe gauge or thickness of the plates is about 3.5mm to be precise (with paint ;-0 ). It seems to be very appropriate for strength and for that audible chime when low power air gun pellets & rimfire bullets hit them at a distance. Thicker the plate, lesser the chime ;-) & lesser the swing. So lesser audio - visual effect on hitting the target. \n\nFor centerfire calibers, 10 mm should be the least thickness depending on the distance. Closer the distance,thickness should be more. I have no experience with such thick targets, so my input will be mere theory on that. Getting it hardened would extend its life for taking couple of hundred shots in the same spot.\n\n[QUOTE=Avais;360152]A good project brother, However it requires some safety measures to avoid any prospective risk of ricochet.\n1. You may place the face of steel plates slightly downward. This will stop reverse ricochet of the bullet and any ricochet particular will tend to move downward.\n2. There must be thin steel sheets on the sides extended at least one feet of frame facing the shooter. This will stop any ricochet particulars flying left or right.[/QUOTE]\n\n\nThanx a lot Avais Bhai. As i have mentioned, the nearest stand will be at 50 meters from the shooter and I''ll be shooting airgun & .22LR & WMR on them only. Being in an isolated private zone, I think we will not have any issues with ricochet, backstop or similar safety concerns. InSha Allah. \n\nSecondly, the plates are on bearings and will tend to move back & upwards providing somewhat downward rebound angle to the bullets.\n\nThanx again for your valuable input.  \n\n[QUOTE=Ch_Adnan;360261]very nice tareen bro.[/QUOTE]\n\nThank you brother.\n\n[QUOTE=joney;360273]Exact that point came into my mind.\n\nVery well done tareen sir.. i think this target stand will be permanently fixed on the range as it isn''t handy enough to carry on each visit.[/QUOTE]\n\nThank you so much brother [B]joney.[/B]&#8203; Yes, it will be permanently fixed on the range. \n\nI have tried to answer the concern in response to Avais Brother''s reply.\n\n[QUOTE=sadatpk;360277]v nice work Tareen sb[/QUOTE]\n\n\nThank you so much brother.', ''),

These are handguns... not so easy to move around and not so easy to deal with...legal regulations and restrictions, corrupted governments...  It is going to take time, now what we can do is pray to Allah to make the replacements easy for them and us...\n\nAs far as dealing with Arabs is concerned... brothers don''t go for perceptions or listen to something just because people say. I work in International marketing department and am dealing with brothers from Jordan, KSA, Yemen and Kuwait. They have a few bad habbits alright, but good and bad people are everywhere. In general they are far more active than us. And I am not talking about the selected few, I am referring to the general population. \n\nI even have Arab friends from KSA, Oman, Egypt, Sudan and Iraq. Most of them are here to do medical, some of them have settled here for years because they like Pakistan.\n \nOther than that I have also spent time in the holy cities of Mecca and Madina, so trust me guys I know arabs... Good and Bad people are everywhere so lets stop discriminating our brothers here alright? We are educated and learned people and so we should not form biases based upon ethnicity, nationality by cast. These things don''t mean a thing.... \n\nand what do I have to support my statement..? The Holy Quran... Allah SWT says:\n\n[COLOR=#000000][FONT=Times New Roman][49:14] [/FONT][/COLOR][SIZE=2][COLOR=#000000][FONT=Verdana]O mankind, We have created you from a male and a female; and We have made you into tribes and sub-tribes that you may recognize one another.

(522621, 'Comparison of Steoger Cougar and Caracal-F Okay since I owned Steoger Cougar, yesterday I decided to add Caracal-F in my collection. This thread is about a comparison between these two guns as I have always wondered but now since I own both, I will post some pictures of comparison here so other people can have an idea while senior members can provide me with their output as well.\n\nFirst things first... If I recall correctly I bought SC last year during august for Rs. 62500/= (with rails) and prices of Caracal at that time was around 75k or so. I didn''t buy caracal that time because I was a total newbie here and wanted a gun with manual safety + decocker. But today market scenario is different... SC without rails in market has asking price of Rs. 85000/= while caracal-F I bought yesterday at Rs 73000/=. So its clear that there has been a certain surge in value of SC while a piece with rails is very difficult to find in market.\n\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]20723[/ATTACH]\nLooks...\nBoth guns are of the same size as I compared them.\n\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]20724[/ATTACH]\nSlides...\nSC on left, hammer fired pistol.\nCaracl-F on right, striker fired pistol.\n\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]20725[/ATTACH]\nBarrels... and as I know longer barrel means better accuracy.\nCaracal-F''s barrel on left while SC rotating barrel on right.\n\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]20726[/ATTACH]\nEven though SC has smaller barrel but it has bigger recoil spring then Caracal-F.', ''),

Because it was the cheapest i.e. USD 250/- a piece. Initially, Caracal was selected but the price of USD 350/- a piece proved deal breaker.\r\n\r\nIt happened in last decade that Glock has started being rated among primeum pistols in Pakistan. Otherwise, back in 1998, Beretta was available for 100K and Glock for 65K. At that time, I knew nothing about guns. I just chose Glock for the looks but then I had no use of it except recreational shooting / aerial firing. So, got bored of it and exchanged with Honda 125 which was of 85K.\r\n\r\nHa ha ha! No!

A certificate was issued by the Bundeswehr Technical Center for Weapons and Ammunition (WTD 91) in May 2006 after the pistol successfully complied with the NATO D14 standard, the German Federal Police Standard and the German Federal Armed Forces Technical Purchasing requirements. These tests are the most stringent test protocols ever devised for a service firearm.\n\n\nBy the end of 2006, Caracal International L.L.C .was incorporated and registered as a company in Abu Dhabi. With that, the foundation of a pistol manufacturing industry was established for the first time in the GCC.\n\n\nThe pistols were unveiled at the International Defence Exhibition, IDEX 2007 in Abu Dhabi. In February 2007 25,000 Caracal F pistols in 9 mm were ordered by various armies and security forces of the Gulf Cooperation Council countries. The Caracal pistol is now the new service pistol of the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Jordan as of April, 2008. The United Arab Emirates and Algeria established on November, 17th, 2008 a joint committee in order to test the Caracal pistol for further adoption by Algeria.\n \nThe Caracal pistols were originally slated to be introduced into the European market and made available to Austrian customers in early 2009; this was rectified at the IDEX 2009 exhibition, when Caracal announced that an export line to Italy was to be started with "the first samples delivered immediately after the IDEX". The Caracal pistols have been introduced on the Italian civilian/sport shooters market during the 2009 EXA expo (Brescia, 18–21 April 2009), and are being imported by the Italian arms company Fratelli Tanfoglio S.N.C.\n\n\n[URL]http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caracal_pistol[/URL][/FONT][/COLOR]', ''),
(522538, ' I just wanted to record my observation and I did that.\n\nRegarding rust on CZ, it is hard to believe that it is rust. Because, the way these guns are packed / greased, there is very little chance that they will be rusted. It is another story that someone kept them after degreasing. Secondly, rust on blued parts is hard to believe. Have said all this, it is difficult to confirm without physical inspection or watching high quality pictures.\n\nAnyway, if it is rust and it is minor, you can get rid of that by using any good CLP and then keep the gun oiled. If it is serious, talk to your dealer.\n\nDid you check serial # on packing? Is it different as well? If it is, there could be mix of packing in the shop.\n\nThe dot shown in picture uploaded by Trigger_happy78; it could be manufaturing process related as I have read somewhere that frames of CZ are manufactured through MIM technology. The mark may be result of manufacturing process used.', ''),

(522703, ' Salam to every one,\n\n\n1. I did a little on line research - rusting is found in some CZ pieces - NIB; at times it also develops over a period of use (approx. 150 bullets per month for 4 - 6 months i.e. after six hunderd shots). It is either due to the steel forging process employed by CZ or some other metal (Carbon Steel / Copper / alloy combination. But the experts on those forums take it very lightly & suggest using solvents & the like. So if your serial on gun and box and the shoot target matches - feel safe. But ensure that the patch / stain does not grow. Also bad machining with sharp edges is considered normal with CZ guns (except feed ramp - which is always exceptional).\n\n\n2. Before making actual purchase please ensure:\n\n\na. That the dealer has good reputation.\nb.  If it is your first or second gun, then take someone senior, who is well versed with the arms (hand gun or else) you intend to buy.\nc.  Un-assemle the gun and take a look inside; of the interiors as well as parts. Here your experienced companion should really shine.\nd.  Use a white piece of paper / mobile light for checking the inside of the barel.\ne.  Do multiple times: Dry fire  / rake the slide / magazing release / fall / bullet feeding the magazine / slide locking on empty magazine.\nf.   Match the numbers i.e. serial on gun and box and the shoot target.\ng.  If any part or portion, say the magazine is discoloured (as in additional paint or artificial shine) it may represent usage. \n\n\nI am sure that seniors can further expand this list.\n\n\nHowever all may not apply in all conditions / specially in case of knock-offs (which are technically NIB).\n\n\nNIB means new in box gun, which has not fired more than a couple of rounds from point of origin (factory / delaer) & primarily consists of original parts (though it may have some additional / altered parts - as per customization service - for eg. CZ Customs improves the gun by making alteration in sights, trigger etc as per customer''s request).  \n\n\nPlease let me know if one needs [U]to check anything more specific to purchasing Shadow in Karachi.[/U]\n\n\nRegards,\n\n\nAlirablm', ''),

C.V joint grease (mostly Molybdenum Disulfide Grease or Moly grease or MOS2 grease) is a high quality grease which can be (just as easily) used in some firearms related applications however mostly such grease is available in NLGI-2 grade which in my humble opinion is too thick for the job.\r\n\r\nif one is in pursuit of perfection instead of following "just to get it over with it" approach, in that case, I would suggest that one should mix it with some high quality oil to thin it down to the level of mayonnaise (NLGI-0). mixing it is easy. just add oil in small quantities and whip the whole mixture like you do with an egg. keep checking. stop mixing oil when typical mayonnaise type consistency is achieved.

C.V joint grease (mostly Molybdenum Disulfide Grease or Moly grease or MOS2 grease) is a high quality grease which can be (just as easily) used in some firearms related applications however mostly such grease is available in NLGI-2 grade which in my humble opinion is too thick for the job.\n\nif one is in pursuit of perfection instead of following "just to get it over with it" approach, in that case, I would suggest that one should mix it with some high quality oil to thin it down to the level of mayonnaise (NLGI-0). mixing it is easy. just add oil in small quantities and whip the whole mixture like you do with an egg. keep checking. stop mixing oil when typical mayonnaise type consistency is achieved.

In my opinion, it shoots better, and handles better than the older cz75 and the newer B full-size CZ''s I have shot. Everything between the straps looks exactly like a CZ75 to me. The alloy frame is awesome, and the slide is a little lower profile than I remember a CZ being. The trigger system needs a little work to lighten the DA pull, which I already ordered a spring kit for. The SA is fine for me. There is a little takeup, but that doesn''t bother me. On my second mag ever through the pistol, I shot a fist size group @50 ft. On the 3rd I hit 8 double taps on target area from 75. Followups are fast and easy.

(on my phone now) basically, had problems, didn''t like they way it was made, and the big problem was the way the barrel didn''t lock up straight more than half the time. The trigger mechanism, the machine work on the slide, and the barrel lock-up issue were all related to poor workmanship and poor engineering. It''s possible the later ones were better produced (mine was really early), but I still argue the engineering is terrible. I know two other people with similar stories.

I''ve been on many gun forums and have not come across one where there is such a popular and enthusiastic club for a $3000-3500 hand gun! I know a lot of shooters, and maybe 1 of them has a $5000 pistol (Nighthawk custom 1911), otherwise the max would be about $1500-1800 (usually Kimber 1911''s and special edition Sigs). For a plastic gun, I personally would only spend a max of $700, and the last time I did that (for an SA XD Tactical) I felt ripped off. Regardless, it is an interesting illustration of supply and demand, along with local market characteristics. Also curious as I have yet to hear of anyone mention the G20 and baby 29 on this forum.

Its difficult for an unarmed target to run and save his life as bullets can reach you far :P\n4. One will need a lot of courage in killing someone with stone or knife. as its easy to to just chamber and "Tha Tha Tha".

WOW!\nWhat I mean by that is, Pakgunners truly are serious enthusiasts. I''ve been on many gun forums and have not come across one where there is such a popular and enthusiastic club for a $3000-3500 hand gun! I know a lot of shooters, and maybe 1 of them has a $5000 pistol (Nighthawk custom 1911), otherwise the max would be about $1500-1800 (usually Kimber 1911''s and special edition Sigs). For a plastic gun, I personally would only spend a max of $700, and the last time I did that (for an SA XD Tactical) I felt ripped off. Regardless, it is an interesting illustration of supply and demand, along with local market characteristics. Also curious as I have yet to hear of anyone mention the G20 and baby 29 on this forum.

Taurus had entered in this market for not that long ago, and used surplus tooling from S&W to make excellent revolvers.\n\nOn 870 express combo, you should have gotten a deer (short) slug barrel which is smooth. A rifled barrel can be added for about $100 buck new but remember you will be limited to use sabots only in a rifled barrels. You are limited to shoot slugs through smooth barrel. Sabots are 3 to 4 times expensive than regular slugs. I think last time I bought they were $12 for a box of 5 while slugs were $2.50 for 5.\n\nWhen I comes to guns, I am a kind of hoarder, I keep them and keep buying more.

WOW!\nWhat I mean by that is, Pakgunners truly are serious enthusiasts. I''ve been on many gun forums and have not come across one where there is such a popular and enthusiastic club for a $3000-3500 hand gun! I know a lot of shooters, and maybe 1 of them has a $5000 pistol (Nighthawk custom 1911), otherwise the max would be about $1500-1800 (usually Kimber 1911''s and special edition Sigs). For a plastic gun, I personally would only spend a max of $700, and the last time I did that (for an SA XD Tactical) I felt ripped off. Regardless, it is an interesting illustration of supply and demand, along with local market characteristics. Also curious as I have yet to hear of anyone mention the G20 and baby 29 on this forum. Is 10mm not available in Pakistan, or just not popular? Interested in opinions because I just ordered my first one in the form of a 3rd Gen G20 SF.[/FONT][/SIZE][/FONT][/COLOR]\n[SIZE=4][FONT=arial]\n[/FONT][/SIZE]\n[/FONT][/COLOR][/QUOTE]\n\nGood to hear from you Fudgepacker. The prices of Sigs, HKs, Glocks Berettas are on sky high in our part of the world, I bought my 1st Glock 17 for almost 4800 US$. We do have some relatively reasonably priced brand guns from Czech Republic, Turkey, Serbia, Russia, Brazil, China etc. \n\nRegarding Glock 20/29, well 10mm ammo is not available here that''s why dealers are not importing the 10mm Glocks or other brands in 10mm. The most common calibers used/liked here in Pak. are 7.62x25 and 9mm. While .45ACP is also favorite of many people but not as much as 9mm or 7.62. Now days .40 S&W is also getting popular among the gun enthusiasts.', ''),

(523261, ' I hope not to take this thread off course, since my current 40 cal is a Springfield Armory XD that replaced a G22. But  regardless,  I was actually instantly excited for you when you mentioned the .40SW because it is my favorite caliber. But to qualify that statement, it is only in regards to recreational shooting. I like it because I enjoy high recoiling guns, and with all else being equal (weight, size, shape of gun), the 40 is the "snappiest" among 9, 40, 45, and even equal to a 10mm (depending on load), so for me it is the most fun to shoot. The 45 is a very close 2nd however, especially shooting paper targets, because I like the noticeably bigger holes they make :) \nHowever, if we are speaking practically, many consider the 40 to be a "compromised" round, which some people feel is a good thing. I will explain. When it comes to choosing a caliber for fighting, in all the pistol craft, tactical shooting, and self defense courses I took, the majority of trainers I''ve come across share the viewpoint that IF you had the choice, either choose "big"(45) or choose "a lot of" (9mm). So thats the theory Ive learned to follow, and therefore the 40 is a compromise between the two choices. But like I said, some people see the 40 as being a bit of both. Personally, for self defense in an urban environment, I prefer 9mm because you have the advantage of carrying a lot of rounds (with a G17 for example, you have more firepower than someone carrying a 1911 AND a spare mag), and with high quality defense cartridges these days, you have all the penetration and stopping power you''ll ever need to take down a robber or a car jacker. Anyways, that''s just my opinion. Please let me know how you feel about it and if you have a different point of view.', ''),

Although not appreciable at first glance but again we made it at there best. It was an effort of complete day. .  . .   We did nothing but just polish them with leather....

(523539, 'Post-Season Hunts Hunting season''s long gone for me and wasn''t much left to do in terms of shooting.\nSo I decided to get some pests (BIG ONES) and then Oriental Turtle Dove/Russian Dove (Labair) season is here so had a go at them couple of days ago.\n\nThe hunts were with my BSA Superten, .22 caliber, tuned to 28 foot pounds of energy----> shooting 16gn AirArms Field Diabolos at 880 fps. Can be tuned to much more power but won''t get much shots per fill so not worth it.\n\nShot 2 boars, one huge one, and 2 jackals. Got a jackal and a boar on camera.\nEye shots on boars, ranges 11-13 yards, brain shots on both jackals.\n\nShooting setup\n[URL=http://s1203.photobucket.com/user/B77W/media/21april13008_zps8ae7663b.jpg.html][IMG]http://i1203.photobucket.com/albums/bb399/B77W/21april13008_zps8ae7663b.jpg[/IMG][/URL]\n\nSo this was one of the boars\n[URL=http://s1203.photobucket.com/user/B77W/media/wildboar003_zps449c978f.jpg.html][IMG]http://i1203.photobucket.com/albums/bb399/B77W/wildboar003_zps449c978f.jpg[/IMG][/URL]\n\nOne of the jackals\n[URL=http://s1203.photobucket.com/user/B77W/media/21april13014_zpsf0a874ec.jpg.html][IMG]http://i1203.photobucket.com/albums/bb399/B77W/21april13014_zpsf0a874ec.jpg[/IMG][/URL]\n\nDecided that''s enough check on the pests.\n\nFew days ago got invited by a very good friend to his lands for the migratory Labair/Russian doves. \nSo went there, spent a good 7 hours exploring the area, mostly reccee as it wasn''t done prior to the hunt and it was a relatively un-touched area.\n\nWe enjoyed watching and hearing the partridges (There were SOOOOO many PARTRIDGES in the area).\nSo we had to first find Russian Dove areas, which we were successful in doing. But those cunning lil birds were completely hidden in thick Kikar trees and were absolutely camouflaged. We got to see around 21 of them, that was when they out of nowhere flew out of the trees we wouldn''t even imagine they''d be perched in.\nLater 2 of the doves that flew out of trees circled around and sat on a leaf-less tree 60 yards away.\nI stalked closer taking cover behind trees, range finder showed 30 yards then. Took an upper body shot and got the only bird of the hunt! But it was well worth it!! All the money and time spent reaching there.\nThough the partridges, especially black males were very tempting but we didn''t shoot them as its off season, decided to keep a hunt in Winters.\nAll in all a great trip, very beautiful setting, cool weather, good walk in nature rich in flora and fauna----> saw 2 jackals, a hare, 10 black partridges, 4 grey partridges, 22 labairs in their habitat.\n[URL=http://s1203.photobucket.com/user/B77W/media/5af3d9df-5287-47d1-adf8-3a055dc84a42_zpsd9084392.jpg.html][IMG]http://i1203.photobucket.com/albums/bb399/B77W/5af3d9df-5287-47d1-adf8-3a055dc84a42_zpsd9084392.jpg[/IMG][/URL]\n[URL=http://s1203.photobucket.com/user/B77W/media/labairhunt026_zpsb1ede505.jpg.html][IMG]http://i1203.photobucket.com/albums/bb399/B77W/labairhunt026_zpsb1ede505.jpg[/IMG][/URL]\n[URL=http://s1203.photobucket.com/user/B77W/media/labairhunt027_zpse2539c26.jpg.html][IMG]http://i1203.photobucket.com/albums/bb399/B77W/labairhunt027_zpse2539c26.jpg[/IMG][/URL]\n[URL=http://s1203.photobucket.com/user/B77W/media/labairhunt018_zps76ba6c12.jpg.html][IMG]http://i1203.photobucket.com/albums/bb399/B77W/labairhunt018_zps76ba6c12.jpg[/IMG][/URL]\nReady to cook\n[URL=http://s1203.photobucket.com/user/B77W/media/labairhunt046_zpsb345ca11.jpg.html][IMG]http://i1203.photobucket.com/albums/bb399/B77W/labairhunt046_zpsb345ca11.jpg[/IMG][/URL]\nIt was delicious!', ''),

(523703, ' [QUOTE=Enigmatic Desires;294517]The mak cannot be chambered to the 9x 19 para cause its a straight forward blowback design. usualy good for light calibres only.[/QUOTE]\n\nActually with the flexibility and capabilities of the local manufacturers, it''s quite feasible, and would be highly desirable as well IMO, as the 9x18 is also the downfall of the Mak for me. It is most probably not available in Pakistan, Hi Point pistols are all blowback, and chambered in everything from .380 to .45 and everything in between. They just make the slide heavier to delay the breach opening. Even the venerable MP5 uses a  blowback action, all be it with a more advanced form of delaying slide movement by using rollers. Regardless, I would be extremely interested in seeing a "true" 9mm Mak. I really hope someone decides to get one custom made... can you tell I''m looking at you ED :)', ''),
(523704, ' [QUOTE=babaz7;361083]yes your right, we pay 3000-3500$ for a 700$ glock, but we also pay 3000$ for a gun that is proberly banned in canada or if its not costs in excess of 15,000$, so that balances it, you get glocks,sigs,hk''s for less we get full auto weapons for less :)[/QUOTE]\nYes I do realize that, and in some ways our market has us spoiled. We don''t look twice at anything that doesnt have a brand name and lifetime warranty, nine out of ten stores sell online, so if one place reduces prices, everyone else will match it if they want to keep doing business. Bottom line variance for any given gun may vary by $100 at most from one side of the country to the other, and you don''t need a "reference" to get those prices. I appreciate the differences in how our markets operate, but what bothers me, is that guns like Sigs, Glocks, and HKs are supposed to be tools... mass produced tools. They are for the everyday man to protect a home... like a hammer used to build a home. Its not supposed to be a luxury. We''re not talking about custom, gold plated one off, "safe queens". Whereas full auto is really just a novelty, since it can''t be used for self defense (without destroying your house, or killing every other innocent bystander on the street), nor can it be used recreationally for fun, target practice, or hunting (can''t shoot at most ranges except for special events, can''t shoot on public land ie. in woods or open fields). But even if all that was possible and the guns were cheap, it would still be cost prohibitive ammo wise. An M4/M16/AR15 has a sustained cyclic rate of approximately 800rds/min. We can get .223 ammo for about $8 per box of 20... that means a full mag is finished in 2 seconds, and cost $12... or $320/minute :0\nAnyways, the full auto fans here generally just use a Bumpski stock which does extremely well at mimicking a true full auto. Or go to a machine gun show and rent a guns to shoot, or go to special ranges. For all you full auto freaks, you must visit Las Vegas. I forget the name of the range, but there you can drive around in an suv with a roof mounted "''Ma Deuce" 50 cal and chase down a remotely controlled car to shoot and blow up :)', ''),

In 6 incher, both 608 and 627 work fine. Because of mass and weight, both revolvers are able to absorb massive recoil of .357 mag in an effective way. 608 is little heavy and beefy than 627 but it suits you if you have big hands. One added advantage is an extra round capacity as mentioned by Aquarius. On the other side, 627 is sleeker and little less in weight. but it all depends what suits your hands and feel more comfortable.\n\nHowever, one thing i would like to suggest definitely. that is, try to get one WITHOUT porting feature. Porting feature balances recoil somehow but it is only effective in snubbies/ 2inch barrels. 06 incher can handle the recoil on its own as per characteristics given above. BUT porting makes the bang super-sonic. Models with porting makes more sound than without porting ones. My revolver came without porting and that was one of the reason for buying it. I took the deal after discussing porting feature in detail here (Thanks to our fellow PG members). \n\nSo in my opinion, having a six incher in .357 is a class in its own BUT beware of the super-sonic boom it produces on each pull. ONE MUST USE EAR PROTECTIONS IF YOU ARE FIRING .357 else it can damage your hearing/ear-drums very badly. One of my friend on the range didn''t believe me and fired .357 without ear protection. After that, for next two days he kept crying of ear pains.. lol\n\nBut this should not discourage you by any means from buying .357 mag. As i said earlier, it is a CLASS which makes you distinguished  and proud..', ''),

Recently, one of my friend bought a G2 and we tried it on the range next day. I discovered a problem on the day that if you long press the trigger, the slide wont get back properly. After each pull, you have to push it back in to fire next round.

(523983, 'Royal Arms Company (Lucky star market survey series Royal Arms Company\n(Lucky Star Arms survey series XI)\n\nThis outlet is the factory outlet of the RAC brand of manufacturers in Peshawar. I got interested in them when I was in the market for local clones of the Taurus PT 92 series. \n\nI traced them to Shahid Watch company, MA Jinnah Road and fro then onwards to Decent Arms Co and finally their factory outlet behind the main Lucky Star Arms Market.\n\nWas all this hassle worth it? \n\nIn a nutshell yes! \n\nIf you keep aside the argument that ALL clones are rubbish then yes there is more eye candy there then anywhere else I have ever seen.  These people take Authenticity to extremes. From boxes to the actual weapon itself.  To manuals and mags.  By and large most of the authentic looking clones  in the market such as the Berretta Storm local clone at Noor Arms co (asking price 120k) and the Glock (asking price 100k again at Noor Arms Co.) the P 909 without rails in Matt black that I have fired at Mega Armoury asking 30k.  \n\nThe PT 92s going for 45k at Shahid arms co as well as Decent arms for the same price.  All of these weapons originated at Royal Arms Co. Being a factory outlet they supply to the whole market.\n\nSince I could not eliminate the I/O error I keep getting from my laptop. I have decided to upload em from my office computer.  (Surreptitiously of course) \n\nHabibullah the young proprietor is highly appreciative of forum members and always insists on taking us to his office for tea and drinks.  He has promised good discounts for Forum members. \n\nSo far Agha 007 has purchased an RAC product. He has so far fired around 70 80 shells without a hitch. He would be in a better position to comment on it. \n\nI have personally witnessed a .30 ak 47 type receiver  and AR 15 type adjustable tactical stock , drum Mag, manual safety and quad rail equipped  hybrid thingy shooting 400 + rounds without a hitch of local ammo at the airmen club. I straight away fell in love with it. And will shortly be acquiring a license for it. \n\nHabibullah does not believe in back dated licenses. However one licenses re-open the rates he has given are so low that I remain sceptical that he will actual be able to deliver.\n\nHe also does excellent copies of the Akdal M1919 for around 28 to 30k or so.  Also does hybrid shotguns that I have never seen. I really liked the wood on his KA 47 type seies of shotties complete with drum mags. \n\nI have been pestering him to make the Vepr 12 clones as well!\n\nHe does loads of SxS shotties as well. Unfortunately RAC does not manufacture rifles and wheel guns of any sort whatsoever :( \n\nAnyways enough words. Now for some Eye Candy:\n\nThe top one is a Girsan M 21 if I recollect correctly, while the bottom one is the P 909 Taurus. The Taurus is extremely authentic it comes complete with instruction manual and accassories.  Asking price for the Girsan was 27k and the Taurus was 22k', ''),

Primary purpose is self defense and secondary is  obviously sports/shooting.\nin lahore we have Hira Arms and ParaCompany. Please let me know if they  can provide License? They are really far and cant visit them without  preparation. i need license which can cover lahore, atleast 100 rounds,  best if NPB so that i may use the same for 9mm and .30\n\nI hope i didn''t ask any thing irritating\n\nThanks[/QUOTE]\n\n\nWelcome to the forum bro....\n\nWell.. I`ll make it very simple for you... with 9mm you have Alot more options as compared to 30 Cal for handguns and it''s the modern day most widely used pistol amo as well....your options for 9mm Handguns will start from around 39-40k...\n\nHowever with 30 Cal, your options will start from 20K so if you are really tight on budget you can opt for a 30 Cal..But there is a catch...9mm bullets will cost you between Rs 36-40 atleast whereas 30 cal will cost you around Rs. 40-45 \n\nAnother major difference is that in 9mms your Mag Capacity is alot more than 30 Cal... Different 9mms can hold from 13 rounds up till 18 rounds where as 30 Cal can hold 9 rounds....\n\nThese are few very basic differences... there are more technical ones but you need to inform us regarding your use and budget so that perhaps we can recommend you from there.... but these are few very basic differences...\n\nHope this info helps', ''),

You can see my review and experience here\n[URL]http://www.pakguns.com/showthread.php?9256-My-new-zigana-M1911-45-acp[/URL]\n\nThe reason i parted with it was because of these issues. \n1) This model had fixed sights which i didn''t like. They were all black and very small. I like sights with some kind of dot system, weather 2 dot or 3 dot. Or adjustable rear sight with FO front sight ;). The sights on this gun were fixed to the slide and cannot be removed. \n\nSecondly the Mac-Gar mags that came with this gun started giving me problem later on. On the last round i use to have a FTF problem. \n\nThirdly the grip safety on that failed me couple of times so i got scared that i might have accidental fire. Besides I''ve used a friends Taurus PT1911, and its much better looking and well built gun then Tisas Zigana M1911. So i''d advise you to try Taurus PT1911.

Fired a 100 rounds at the gun club last week and I must say the trigger is shitty at best. Please advise what I can do to make it lighter and with lesser creep if at all anything. Please keep in mind at I usually carry it so don''t want a really light one. \n\nIt could be that I am used to firing 1911''s and sub consciously comparing the triggers. Same range session when I put the Glock back and picked up my Dan Wesson I seriously thought why did I waste my money on the Glock. \n\n- Usman', ''),

Have they disassembled the bolt yet[/QUOTE]\r\n\r\nBro, in my humble opinion you are only over-confusing yourself. if fault finding is your mission then I''m afraid that you''ll find some sort of a problem/fault/defect in all production guns. in that case, for a problem free gun you''ll have to move up from "production gun" or "assembly line" gun to one of those premium shotguns. unfortunately, autoloaders are not premium products.\r\n\r\n[QUOTE=hsnmz;362365]here is another pic of where the chamber usually gets damaged, but it does not occur in all A400. While this problem is quite common in all shotguns that have rotating bolts including Extrema II and Benelli. The pic is of an A400 Xtreme[/QUOTE]\r\n\r\nBro, its not a problem really. extractors are usually heat treated meaning they are much harder than the chamber''s lip. which is a good thing. as a result the lip will deform over time as it wears out. infact, the more it wears out the better as it will make it easy for the extractor to ride up and sit at this lip. th lip serves only as a resting place for the extractor once the gun is in battery. therefore any wear here will not effect the working of the gun.\r\n\r\nin my humble opinion, this thing happens in every autoloader shotgun where the bolt locks directly into the barrel. some will notice it while others don''t.\r\n\r\nRegards.', ''),

You might be able to pull it off with a subcompact or a pocket pistol, but anything larger and the gun will make a very evident bulge. Also, the gun (unless it''s a subcompact) tends to bite into your abdomen if you bend over or crouch to pick up something.  \n\nThe advantage of the 4 o''clock position is that any bulging or printing can be easily concealed by your elbow.', ''),

(524687, ' The trigger on a Glock really can''t be compared to a 1911''s single action with a straight pullback trigger thats directly connected to the sear via two trigger bars. That gives it the "break like a glass rod" feeling which the Glock is incapable of possessing because of its "half double action". The first portion of trigger travel will always have to finish cocking the striker before releasing it, hence it will always be two stage, have take up, and creep. Regardless of whatever modifications are done, the Glocks trigger can only be lightened. All factory triggers I''ve measured (2 gen 4s, 3 gen 3s, and 1 first gen) come in around 7.5lbs to 6.5lbs and the "-" connector will reduce that by about 0.5lbs. Its noticable, but just hardly, so if you can get the connector for about $10 give or take a couple, then its well worth it. I believe the best advise for someone getting into Glocks in Pakistan is... don''t expect a $3500 trigger because its NOT a $3500 gun. If you still end up buying into the hype; then get used to it! Don''t try to modify it into something it isn''t. Personally, I would never pay more than $1500 for a "plastic" handgun. \n\nIm in Canada and on some items our prices may be 10-15% higher than our neighbors down south. Correct me if im wrong, my understanding is that brands like Glock and HK aren''t "officially" distributed in Pakistan hence the ridiculous prices, but regarding the list Jagga posted overall, the only one that seems reasonable to me is the CF98, which is around what we pay for most Norinco pistols.', ''),

(524779, 'Taurus PT809 revisited. AOA, Fellow Pakgunners.\r\n\r\nThough there is already a thread running regarding review of Taurus Pt809 which belongs to midreestaj bro,i have decided to express my views towards the fine craftsmanship Brazilians have come up with :)\r\n\r\nTaurus 800 series is a direct descendant of famous 24/7 OSS. As a full-sized service handgun it’s proven to be rugged and reliable yet concealability was the issue. Taurus responded by taking some of the ergonomic features of the 24/7 OSS, adding a few innovations, trimming the size and weight, and introduced a new line of mid-sized (i call it mid sized) semi-auto handguns. The result was the Taurus 800 Series that was introduced back in 2008.\r\n\r\nThe PT809 is built on a polymer frame with a forged steel slide with a black Tennifer finish. A captive recoil spring with a full-length stainless steel guide rod in a cylindrical hard polymer tube which holds the recoil spring in place.\r\n\r\nThe empty weight is a relatively light 28.2 ounces. The ramped barrel measures 4 inches approx, providing an overall length of 8.25 inches, a height of 6-inches, and a width of 1.14 inches. An integral rail allows for easy mounting of light or laser. Capacity is 17+1.\r\n\r\nThe backstrap features Taurus aggressive ribbed checkering, while the rear portion of the side panels are smooth. The ribbed pattern continues on the front portion of the side panels and wraps around the front strap, where two slight projections create a subtle finger groove effect. Right and left side memory grooves channel the trigger finger to the proper position. Whenever i grab my pt809, shooting grip is automatically achieved which makes it a naturally comfortable handgun. \r\n\r\nThree interchangeable backstraps of different sizes are supplied in the box. They are changed by drifting out a solid retaining pin at the lower portion of the backstrap, which also serves as a lanyard loop, and sliding a different size insert into place. I have average-sized hands and the backstrap that arrived on the gun was an excellent fit for me, so I felt no need to try the other two sizes.\r\n\r\nAs PT809 was derived from the Taurus 24/7 OSS series, but the firing mechanism is quite a bit different.This is a traditional DA/SA design with an external hammer and has repeat strike capability and trust me it works for atleast. When the hammer is fully lowered it provides a lengthy DA pull with a slight, but noticeable, stacking at the rear of the stroke. Trigger Pull is 10.5 pounds in double action mode. \r\n\r\nWith the hammer in the SA mode the pull weight is a relatively crisp at 5 pounds approx. The trigger is smooth faced and nicely rounded.\r\n\r\nA frame-mounted ambidextrous safety allows the gun to be carried DA or SA (cocked and locked) and the safety can be engaged to block the trigger in each hammer position. The frame-mounted safety has a third position that also serves as a decocking mechanism. With the safety engaged in the up position, depressing it to the middle position disengages it. Push it further down to the third position and it decocks the pistol. The PT809 also includes an internal firing pin block that prevents the firing pin from moving forward until the trigger has been moved to its final firing position.\r\n\r\nCompleting the operating controls are ambidextrous slide and magazine releases. A loaded chamber indicator peeks out from the upper side of the extractor when a round is chambered.\r\n\r\nThe PT809 does not have a magazine disconnect safety, and will fire with the magazine removed. The double stack magazines are solidly made with right side witness holes at 5, 10 and 17 rounds and are a drop-free design. A finger extension base plate provides a comfortable rest for the support hand and also makes magazine insertion very positive. A magazine loader is provided, but I didn’t need it. Finger power alone was enough to easily get all 17 rounds into each of the two supplied magazines.\r\n\r\nSights are NOVAK 3 dot white pattern and are fixed.They are cut a bit taller than many other sights and allow a generous amount of light around the front sight. I found them very quick to acquire.\r\n\r\nThe PT809 is supplied in a plastic lockable case with a foam-lined pads with two magazines, a bristle bore brush, magazine loader, two additional interchangeable backstraps, and two keys to activate the Taurus Security System lock, which is located on the rear portion of the lower right rear grip panel.\r\n\r\n\r\n[B]Final Verdict[/B]\r\nWell over 400 rounds went down through it, i never faced any FTF or FTE. All of this ammo was not used in one day range session but took a whole year. lols... I have used POF, Russian gray steel case (notorious for hard primers) Russian green case, Chinese red box, Chinese Blue box Sellier and Bellot HP and Federal FMJ but the PT809 delivered.\r\nThose who compare Taurus pt809 with Glocks and Sigs, please keep in mind that those weapons are four times the price of Taurus PT809 . This  handgun has proved itself to me and is my daily carry gun. I can trust my life with it. \r\nIt is not a piece of junk but a modern combat weapon yet providing all the features anyone can expect from a desirable handgun.\r\n\r\nOver to the pictures...', ''),

This is the main reason as to why most 22 rounds fail.  \nAs for .50CAL''s point regarding cheap ammo purchasers, that is very very true.

When there is a cartridge the bolt slows down and after feeding a cartridge  the Extractor  slips over the cartridge rim and gently sits on the breach face.\nWhen there is no cartridge the bolt goes forward with full speed and the extractor bangs against the breach face causing this  apparent damage. All automatic pistols and shotguns must be closed gently by hand when there is no cartridge; by releasing the bolt  and gently letting the bolt forward by hand  and you will never see this.\nBy the way before you snap at me with the question, what happens when the last round is fired? \nThe bolt stays back locked.', ''),

When there is a cartridge the bolt slows down and after feeding a cartridge  the Extractor  slips over the cartridge rim and gently sits on the breach face.\r\nWhen there is no cartridge the bolt goes forward with full speed and the extractor bangs against the breach face causing this  apparent damage.

Caracal is certainly a nice firearm and with Muslim inheritance (coming from UAE), however I don''t recommend you a caracal as your first handgun. Because #1 its striker fired gun, you cannot decock it by any mean unless you remove mag, and rack the slide to eject bullet and then "dry fire" to decock it. And ultimately when you decock it as I have mentioned but you forget to remove mag (which has further bullets in it), the round in chamber will be ejected but a new live round will be chambered. Trust me! There are dozens of firearm experts on forum, but mistakes can happen!\n\nAlot of people have sold caracal because to them its not convenient to keep live round in chamber and rely on nothing but that tiny plastic clip on trigger. But those with guts still carry conceal-carry caracal.\n\n2. CZs I heard are good firearms but I personally have no experience of them so can''t say. \n\n3. PT92/99 are full frame pistols and they cannot easily be concealed. However did I read you have "quite big hands"? so it might be possible for you, so you can check that out. Tauruses are made in brazil.\n\n4. Stoeger Cougar, I will still recommend you to take a look at this gun, when I was a total noob myself... I choose SC as my companion and I never regret it, no matter it has fallen with chambered round, fired 3K+ rounds, etc... I am satisfied with its performance and reliability... plus it has everything u need like external hammer, manual safety and decocker as well as DA/SA trigger.', ''),

Limited magazine capacity.\n3. Difficult to load without first cocking the hammer.\n4. If you want to lower the hammer with a round in the chamber the hammer which lacks a hammer spur is prone to slipping and causing an AD ( accidental discharge ) many officers and men have died due to this reason only, including a very dear friend Capt Atif and another young Capt from the Army shooting team; these two I personally know about there were many more.\n4. Hollow points are prohibbited by Geneva Convention.\n5. The grip angle is poor and the gun is slow to point and shoot.\n6. It was designed with the Browing design  as its parent, There are many good innovations like the encapsulated trigger assembly, the inverted feed fingers or guide rails which ensure feeding through the cheapest and poorly made magazines and the cheapest means and cost of manufacture which was the over ridding clause for the Russians.\n7. There is no safety on it, there is no firing pin block on it and by modern standards it is now relic.\n\nRange of a hand gun depends on the accuracy of the pistol and the ability of a shooter, a good shot will be able to hit man sized targets at a 100 yards while shooting deliberately taking time, and in battle conditions may be only 15 to 20 meters, and an average  person/ soldier  can take deliberate shots at no mmore than 20 yards and in battle conditions at no more than 7 yards or so ( these distances are purely my guestimates; but then I do have some experience with hand guns and infantry men, 55 years and 30 years in that order ). \nMy advice buy a better pistol which is safe and dependable.[/QUOTE]\n\nvery nice say sir. plz compare .30 vs 9mm?', ''),

(525797, 'The Beginning... Firstly, hats off to the owner, moderators and members of this forum for developing such an amazing online community. When I began my search for a 9mm handgun a month ago the only handguns I knew about were Glocks, Taurus, Walther, Beretta and S&W. Through this community I was introduced to Stoeger, Canikk, Zastava, Sarsilmaz, Baikal, Caracal and most importantly CZs. \n\nAfter much contemplation I ended up buying a CZ 75 SP-01 Shadow and again through this awesome community I found out that there was in fact a problem with the first piece that I got - promptly had it replaced as suggested by some kind members. Also got a good rate on the gun and licence issuance/conversion compared to what I would have paid as an uninformed buyer.\n\nFollowing the PG tradition, I would like to share pictures of the beginning of my new-found fascination with firearms. Please forgive the poor quality of pictures as I am new at this.\n\nThe Shadow\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]21219[/ATTACH][ATTACH=CONFIG]21218[/ATTACH][ATTACH=CONFIG]21216[/ATTACH][ATTACH=CONFIG]21220[/ATTACH]\n\n\nI''ve bought this gun primarily for HD and also for range shooting, which I have not had the chance to do yet due to the turbulent situation in Karachi and mostly due to lack of free mornings.\n\nThe Walther\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]21221[/ATTACH][ATTACH=CONFIG]21222[/ATTACH]\n\nThis gun was a gift from someone who had bought it in 1990s; do not know the exact manufacturing year but it has < 100 rounds through it. I plan to make this my EDC once I have fired around 2-300 rounds through it and gotten comfortable with handling a firearm.\n\niA plan on expanding my collection once the means are available, but the first objective is to fire 1000+ rounds at the range to get an idea of what "shooting" entails.\n\nOnce again, thank you all for being an extremely helpful and supportive community.\n\nRegards.', ''),

MOI license in Islamabad was quoted as 26,000 and 45 days to get it. A provincial license in Dadyal was quoted as 5000 and 5 days to get it. I was tempted to get a provincial but then there was the problem of getting an authentic gun from Dadyal, ideally Taurus 24/7, and finally how I would get this gun from a provincial license transferred onto a MOI license. The NICOP card is fine to get a license. If any one is able to give me more information that would be good.\n\nIncidentally I went to International Arms in Islamabad, which was closed, but Draz Khan and Son, (Markaz 6) was good for Taurus, they quoted 82,000 for Taurus 24/7 gen 1.', ''),

So I thought no-one replied and by chance checked my current post just now.\nI have just been in Pakistan visiting relatives last 2 weeks, my family live in Dadyal, and I visit once or twice a year.\nIn fact I visited a few gun shops, but in the end didn''t get a license as there was so much conflicting advice. MOI license in Islamabad was quoted as 26,000 and 45 days to get it. A provincial license in Dadyal was quoted as 5000 and 5 days to get it. I was tempted to get a provincial but then there was the problem of getting an authentic gun from Dadyal, ideally Taurus 24/7, and finally how I would get this gun from a provincial license transferred onto a MOI license. The NICOP card is fine to get a license. If any one is able to give me more information that would be good.\n\nIncidentally I went to International Arms in Islamabad, which was closed, but Draz Khan and Son, (Markaz 6) was good for Taurus, they quoted 82,000 for Taurus 24/7 gen 1.[/QUOTE]\n\nVisit your local DCO Office and find out how much will an "All Pakistan" license issued from your local DCO Office cost you. Dont go by yourself take some1 local with you, must be some1 bold confidend/ and loud spoken and most important some1 who knows the local system otherwise if they see your Nicop they make their own judgement  and often will try to treat you as an outsider and will may try to rip you off.........but that usually happen if you see the reception staff I.e clerks/ PA''s etc, they are usually ruthless and arrogant ones unless you can put them in their place........ My best advice is go straight to the DCO office, see the DCO, Introduce yourself and ask him directly, him being the educated and professional one should hopefully treat you the way one should be treated principlly....\n\nIf you manage to get that License, problem solved. In certain ways I prefer that over an MOI License as it is alot easier and quicker to change weapon on that Licsense comparing to an MOI License and also the License itself cost less than half the MOI License price.

I also like Piranha F but found more fans of TP9 here.[/QUOTE]\n\n\nTp9 in a very good handgun indeed. However from the description you are giving of your self, when ever you go Gun Shopping, do look consider Viking and Caracal F.... If you are looking for something which is a bit more concealable yet gives a decent performance at range, you might consider a Stoeger Cougar, that gun has a fairly decent grip as well for big handed people...\n\nYou may consider and conduct further research on all of the above mentioned guns...\n\nMy Personal Preference is Caracal F...Why..? Well below is an analysis\n\n[B]Pros:[/B]\nAn extremely crisp trigger without any creep (4 pound constant trigger as compared to a 5.5 pound Glock trigger). Without any bias, IMHO, this gun has the most crisp trigger as compared to all of the above mentioned\n\nLow Bore Axis: which results in extremely low recoil and excellent for follow up shots. Again amongst all the above mentioned, this gun recoils the least\n\nExtremely Accurate and this is not just a personal observation. Almost all those who have shot with a Caracal F agree upon this.\n\nThis point is probably an extension to the point mentioned above. Caracal Fs come with a 4.1 inch barrel which is longer than most of the regular handguns. However Pt92s come with a 5 inch Barrel.... a longer barrel results in more accuracy and range but any weapon with too long a barrel might become problem to conceal\n\nThe gun is Polymer made and weights only 750 grams as compared to its counter Rival Glock 17 which weights 650 grams.. However all of the above mentioned handguns weigh more than Caracal.\n\nCaracal has extremly slim profile (Even slimmer than Glocks) which again makes them comparatively easier to conceal\n\nThe Full size Caracal F is slightly shorter than the Full size Glock 17 and just slightly longer than the Sub Compact Glock 19 which again supports in its Conceal\n\nCaracal F holds 18 Rounds, None of the above mentioned guns including Glocks hold that much fire power\n\nA Torture test was conducted by Armi on Caracal Fs. They shot 5000 rounds within 92 minutes through this gun without any failures. Further our very own Cheif conducted a torture test on this weapon as well. You can check out the Caracal Club or directly Youtube to find links of both.\n\nThis handgun was designed by Wilhelm Bubits who at one time was part of the Glock team and later joined Steyr to develop models M and S with them and Caracal F is his final design\n\nCaracal F holds 3 extremely tough and stringent certifications which only a few handgun manufactures such as Glock or Sig hold. Again you can check out the details of these on their website\n\n\n\n[B]Cons:\n[/B]This gun is not for you if you don''t handle it like a professional. It comes without any Manual Safety. However it does have the 3 Safeties which are Trigger Safety, Drop safety and firing pin safety. But if you pull the trigger on a cocked gun, it''s gona shoot and ain''t nothing gona stop it..\n\nThere has been an optional recall called on Caracal F''s due to doubt in drop safety functionality. You can read details on their website\n\nThis gun comes with 2 sight Options. Quick sight (QS) and Straight 8 or 2 dot sights. The QS are excellent for short range follow up shots but do not have satisfactory results with slightly increased distances so no fun at the range. Straight 8s or 2 Dot sights are excellent sights but they may require some time getting used to', ''),

A real Value For Money IMHO) ...........\nIn Pak its around 40,000-45,000 depending on area/ dealer, bargaining etc. Again prob the cheapest exported 9mm with good reputation and reliability.\n\nIf you just want A pistol and want a cheapie with good performance then NP22 is a real Value for Money. If you want abit of a show Off Piece and want to spend extra then TP9.\n\nIn my Opinion: At this stage. Considering a rough and tough SD/HD scenario or situation I''d personally trust and prefer NP22 more..... (thats my Opinion, No offence to the TP9 lovers). Others may disagree.......[/QUOTE]\n\nNO offense taken :) however, hearsay and experience are two different, and often opposite things! :)\n\nFor one thing, the TP-9 only has a decocker, and no other safety mechanism... this is absolutely fine by me since I would feel uncomfortable knowing there are knobs and levers on my gun which might have to be manipulated before firing it, and which can be the precious time difference between life and death.\n\nsecondly, even though the trigger has a creep in it right out of the box, once the TP-9 is broken in (approx 250-300 rounds) the trigger smooths out, as did mine.\n\nit swallows and spits out whatever ammo you give it :) the high quality and world renowned Mec-Gar magazines ensure zero FTF too.\n\nHowever, the key is to keep an immaculately clean and spotless gun, well lubricated and functioning at all times. Even the best gun in the world will malfunction if it has a grimy barrel and/or slide etc.\n\nI have dropped my TP-9 in dust, on gravel and concrete and the magazines lick the earth regularly during every range session, ofcourse they are all cleaned thoroughly after each use.\n\nPolymer frames are tougher and longer lasting than steel and give the added peace of mind when it comes to rust issues.\n\nHaving stated the obvious facts, I will agree that it all depends on personal choice and comfort. A few of my friends hate the look, feel, weight and functioning of my gun and claim it to seem like a plastic toy :) \n\nGood luck to you in whatever you decide to get :)', ''),

I had made a couple of suggestions to Caracal about the recall and otherwise and they invited me to their factory / head office in Abu Dhabi today to discuss things further. \n\nIt was a fruitful 2 hour long meeting and they were kind enough to have all the top management of Caracal attend including the GM of Caracal Mr. Sultan Aouda, marketing and production heads among others.\n\nI communicated all our concerns in person and made it clear the Khan brothers are quite decent guys (and personal friends of mine) and were looking for nothing more than an apology for being termed as blackmailers and frauds while they were on the right. As far as the recall is concerned I made it clear that a lot of us are anxious to get replacement guns ASAP as for some they are the only defensive weapon they own and till the company replaces it they cannot defend themselves confidently. They assured me that they are doing their best to make the replacement process as quick as possible. I apprised them about the complexities of a recall in Pakistan and suggested the best ways forward. Although they have not given me any time frame commitment they are hopeful that the recall should start soon.\n\nThere was some post on the forum and the issue raised at the Karachi GTG about certain Caracal C serial numbers guns being replaced while others are not. I raised this point with them and reminded them that we were promised an ''unconditional'' recall of ALL Caracal C''s via their letter and we are looking forward to just that. They said they were committed to the promise of unconditional recall of ALL C''s in Pakistan.  \n\nOne of my main suggestions was the formation of a centralized customer service/complaint department. Hopefully in the future all complaints will be handled by Caracal staff themselves instead of distributors which will go a long way in increasing the quality of customer service. Also after the recall we might see service centers and spare parts availability in Pakistan. \n\nMany other points were raised and discussed in detail. Caracal seems to be a forward looking company and once the recall is underway InshAllah PakGuns and Caracal both look forward to a close relationship. \n\nThe G.M, Marketing and Production heads assured me that they are now quite aware of our concerns and it''s a priority for them.\n \nLots of talk has been done, now let''s wait and watch the quick & practical implementation of the steps discussed today and before.', ''),

(526618, ' dear all,\naoa after going thorough several threads on Zastava EZ9 decided to give it a try as a friend of mine is already using it. I must say the first impression was very impressive a solid professional hand gun . Fired few clips and instantly decided it is a must have piece for me cause the reliability, and other features match any top of the line brand and as a matter of fact you can trust this gun on anything it won''t let you down. I am bit confused on the magazines issue as it came as a surprise to me when one of the dealers today confirmed me that the magazine for NP 42 fits perfectly in EZ9 which i am not aware of , Any senior member can shed some light on it that would be a great help and i would be much obliged. Have bought this gun and already tested it yesterday and must say its a real time "WOW" handgun. I would appreciate if any fellow gunner would help me out in getting original magazines for it from anywhere in the country regards to all.', ''),
