Take away everything related to guns for a second.\r\n\r\nA moving object has kinetic energy... when an object contacts another object and slows down it transfers that energy into the other object(basic theory of physics energy cannot be created or destroyed) \r\nSo now... You take a water jug, place a pencil standing up, touching it, and flick the other end... the energy of your flick is transfered into the jug, into the water, out of the jug, and knocks the pencil over... Hydrostatic shock, the water is not moving(static) but transfers the energy in a form of a shockwave into the pencil.\r\n\r\nNow apply it to guns, hit a watermelon with a rifle...it blows out the sides in addition to a exit hole... the shockwave of the bullet suddenly hitting a liquid medium(watermelon internals) transfers energy through it until it blows the skin out on the watermelon, releasing all the energy which intern throws the flesh out of the watermelon.... hydrostatic shock.\r\n\r\nAnd.. on another point which I typically hear, pistol bullets don''t create hydrostatic shock.. I believe this is a false statement... based on what I stated about transfer of energy, yes they do, BUT!!! they do not necessarily have enough energy to create ENOUGH hydrostatic shock to destroy tissue/only move it aside(temporary cavity)\r\n\r\n:)\r\n\r\nshocking isnt it ?[/QUOTE]\r\n\r\n[b] Interesting indeed rather then shocking. !

Introduced at the latest IWA expo in Nuremberg, Germany, this standard .9x19mm-Parabellum semi-automatic handgun is a prototype coming from a factory called "Daudsons Armoury", known as DSA, and located in Peshawar, Pakistan (see them at: [url]http://www.daudsons.org/);[/url] despite of its location, and the nature of the products displayed on its website, DSA operates with newest, state-of-the-art CNC machineries, and doesn''t manufactures only civilian weapons but it''s also a HUGE Pakistani defense contractor: at the IDEAS 2002 asian defence expo, DSA introduced the "AGL-40", a reliable 40mm automatic, belt-fed grenade launcher that ressembles to a rogue copy of the US-made MK-19 (there''s a picture of the DSA AGL-40 at: [url]http://www.pakdef.info/ideas2002/[/url]). \n\n\nThe design of this "DSA-9" pistol is evidently ripped off from a notorious Austrian product engineered by a man called Gaston... in fact it is a knock-off from the GLOCK 19. It is a mix of several generations'' Glock models, the trigger guard is different, but the slide will be probably made of metal instead than polymer, at least when the gun will enter production. No other news about this gun are available by now, except that this pistol has already been "coveted" by the Pakistani government as a possible widespread Paki Military/LE service pistol for the near future.', ''),

Introduced at the latest IWA expo in Nuremberg, Germany, this standard .9x19mm-Parabellum semi-automatic handgun is a prototype coming from a factory called "Daudsons Armoury", known as DSA, and located in Peshawar, Pakistan (see them at: [URL]http://www.daudsons.org/);[/URL] despite of its location, and the nature of the products displayed on its website, DSA operates with newest, state-of-the-art CNC machineries, and doesn''t manufactures only civilian weapons but it''s also a HUGE Pakistani defense contractor: at the IDEAS 2002 asian defence expo, DSA introduced the "AGL-40", a reliable 40mm automatic, belt-fed grenade launcher that ressembles to a rogue copy of the US-made MK-19 (there''s a picture of the DSA AGL-40 at: [URL]http://www.pakdef.info/ideas2002/[/URL]). \n\n\nThe design of this "DSA-9" pistol is evidently ripped off from a notorious Austrian product engineered by a man called Gaston... in fact it is a knock-off from the GLOCK 19. It is a mix of several generations'' Glock models, the trigger guard is different, but the slide will be probably made of metal instead than polymer, at least when the gun will enter production. No other news about this gun are available by now, except that this pistol has already been "coveted" by the Pakistani government as a possible widespread Paki Military/LE service pistol for the near future.[/QUOTE]\n\nI really hope it is worth it.....Our lads in the forces need a good reliable handgun.....nice share bro.', ''),

In other words its "a jack of all trades but master of none".\nAs for the Omega shindig, its a nice way of saying its got a firing pin plunger system built in which adds to trigger weight whilst providing additional safety.\nFinish is personal preference in my opinion these days as most firearm finishes are of good grade.  I doubt any of us will be ever using our guns at, in, or around a salt water or any other variant.

Recoil should be understood in a practical way, theoretical recoil is one thing and FELT Recoil and recovery is an individual experience. How ever the following will help:\n1.One can not add weight or compensaters to SD guns, there fore one should choose lighter bullets in the caliber one is using , making sure it functions flawlessly. \n \n2.First of all strengthen your grip. Use a grip excerciser as often as you can , start by doing 25 reps at a time once a day and then increase the reps and the number of times. \n\n3.Do weight training with dumb bells and in a gym if possible, in a month or two your grip and arms would be strong enough to soak up recoil and your recovery will be fast and on target in shorter times progressively. \n\n4. Improve your stance. Keep your feet atleast as wide as your shoulders or a bit wider.\nCover your right hand  with your left hand and ensure you extend your arms straight, locking your shoulders and elbows. Push forward with your right hand and pull in with the left, this will form a shock/recoil absorbing arrangement.\nKeep both thumbs on one side and not touching the trigger finger.\nBend your knees slightly and ensure your hip joints are a bit forward of your heels.\nWear hearing protection and train regularly after getting fit.\nYou will be surprised at the amount of reduction in felt recoil and recovery by doing nothing to the gun but TUNNING yourself.

Push forward with your right hand and pull in with the left, this will form a shock/recoil absorbing arrangement.\nKeep both thumbs on one side and not touching the trigger finger.\nBend your knees slightly and ensure your hip joints are a bit forward of your heels.\nWear hearing protection and train regularly after getting fit.\nYou will be surprised at the amount of reduction in felt recoil and recovery by doing nothing to the gun but TUNNING yourself.

You can easily, I would say very easily change the bore or simply make it written as "One NPB Weapon or One NPB Pistol/Revolver" by submitting your license with an application of change of bore at the Arms'' Section of the related District office. Once you get the bore changed, take it to Section Officer (SO) Arms at Home Ministry, Peshawar. There you would have to submit the form and then fee of 2000+ (little bit above it) in Bank and the mean time your license would be converted into ALL-PAKISTAN by writing / stamping "VALIDATED FOR ALL PAKISTAN". If you need number, I would also provide you with the number of SO Arms. Now a days there also stamp a URL and Phone number for verification of licence, if required.

[B]A humane and personal account Of Cecil Chaudhry: the man!\n[/B][URL="http://pakpotpourri2.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/paf-ali-kazim.jpg"][IMG]http://pakpotpourri2.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/paf-ali-kazim.jpg?w=225&h=300[/IMG][/URL]By: Group Captain Ali Kazim(R) (Awarded Tamgha-e-Basalat in 1965 war)\n\n \n\nCecil Chaudhry, or Guppoo (for his  treasure of anecdotes that never exhausted) as he was known to his  friends, died on 13th April 2012. So ended my 53 year old relationship  with him. Cyril, his elder brother was my course mate when I joined  P.A.F Academy Risalpur in 1957. I recall, during one winter break,these  used to be pretty short, Cyril invited some course mates to spend the  break at his house. It was a big house. The “boys” bunked in a big sized  room with extra mattresses and comforters.That is when I met Cec. Cec  he remained to me always.My friends planned to go out,to proverbially  paint the town red. Cec asked me to stay back. Stay back I did  having immediately struck a cord with him.We went for a walk till we got  to a Church compound.Sitting on the steps of the main building, out  came a flask from his hip pocket. One swig and it was offered to me.That  was my first taste of scotch! Ofcourse drinks were not banned back  then.We  ended up at the Burt Institute where a dance competition was arranged.  Cec’s partner was already there. He was a great dancer, light on his  feet. They went on to win the first prize.\n\n\n That day was the start of a beautiful friendship!\n\n\nMost  know Cec. as a war hero. He was; especially the mission at Halwara in  1965. I would like to share here the events of that fateful day of 6th  September, 1965.  Prior to the 1965 war, PAF was operating in the Runn  of Kutch from Mauripur Air Base. The Air Force was convinced that war  with India was inevitable and therefore was prepared. We knew our  targets, our formation composition and from which field to operate. The  time over target (TOT) was simultaneous for all assigned targets. In 1964  I was posted Test Pilot and Quality Control Officer at Mauripur, thereby  posted out of No 14 Squadron. I was under the command of Officer  Commanding Maintenance Wing and not The O.C. Flying Wing. However, I  flew Runn of Kutch missions, whenever required and was to be attached to  32 Fighter Wing, Mauripur, in case of war. On the morning of 2nd  September, I was No. 3 in a 4 aircraft formation  lead by Shaheed ‘Butch’ Ahmed and reached Sargodha around 7 am.  I went back to Mauripur on the  5th of September and on the 6th morning took off from Mauripur under  the leadership of Sqn. Ldr. Azim Daudpota (Later Air Marshal Daudpota,  SJ) in a large formation which was to land at Risalewala and my assigned  target was IAF Base Halwara, whenever the strike was ordered by the Air  Staff. However, we were told to proceed to Sargodha where we parked the  aircraft (F-86''s) in the strike area pens.\n\n\n On the afternoon of 6th September,  preemptive strikes were ordered  as planned earlier. Here, I must mention that the Indian Army had  launched a massive attack, backed by Amour to capture Lahore and have a  drink in the evening at Punjab Club/Lahore Gymkhana. Our Army was not  prepared for such a massive onslaught. PAF had not planned for any  extensive Air Support for our Army in this sector but the very  sovereignty of Pakistan was at stake. The PAF, under the command of  dynamic leader like Air Marshal Nur Khan, was ordered to neutralize the  Indian Army designs. Despite our meager resources, our second to none  fighter pilots flew continuous mission the whole day.\n\n\n [URL="http://pakpotpourri2.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/group-picture.jpg"][IMG]http://pakpotpourri2.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/group-picture.jpg?w=530&h=417[/IMG][/URL]\n [I]No. 14 Squadron PAF Masroor! Can any one recognise these faces\n[/I]\n[I]  — with Ali Kazim 28 GD, [URL="http://www.facebook.com/akazim1"][COLOR=#000000]Ali Kazim[/COLOR][/URL], C/T  Aslam, Afzal Choudhary, Baseer 32nd GP(P), S/L Rafique  Shaheed, Rafique, Saleem (Mullan), F/L Saleem Iqbal, Saleem 26GD, Zahoor  33rd GD(P) (late) and Moin 27GD MO THE PO.[/I]\n\n  \n\n\nComing back to the strikes on IAF Air Bases. Well past  the time that the aircraft should have taken off to strike Halwara, I  was told that I was required for briefing by Sqn. Ldr. Rafiqui for  the Halwara strike. Rafiqui Sahib was briefing, as he sat on the ground. Hardly  a few minutes had passed when Flt. Lt. Yunus Hussain walked in. He had  just come back from a mission from Lahore. Rafiqui Saieb asked me,  ‘Kazim, if you dont mind, let me take Yunus, he is my Flight Commander and  you follow in the 2nd wave”. So I got up and went for briefing of the  2nd wave of four that was to be lead by Sqn. Ldr. Moin ur Rab (Later Air  Vice Marshal,). We were briefed and were to fly the aircraft that had  been brought that morning from Mauripur. We were shocked to find that  they had neither been refueled nor rearmed!.\n\n In the meantime, some of the senior colleagues had approached the  Base Commander, (late) Air Commodore ‘Mitty’ Masud, HJ, to call off this  mission as it was too late and Halwara would be up in the air with all  their aircraft. It will be pertinent to mention here that on this day,  6th September, at around 1400hrs. we had sent an F-104 to Halwara to check out  the activity there and that would have warned them that something was  up. Additionally, other IAF Bases had already been struck therefore  there is no doubt that Halwara was ready to face a strike by PAF and  would not be taken by surprise like the other bases.\n\n\n Regarding calling off the mission, to the best of my knowledge, the  Base Commander had agreed and called Air Headquarters to permit  cancellation of mission by them. Certainly not the Air Chief, I am sure.  Rafiqui, the lion hearted , began his take off roll and during the take  off one formation member had a technical failure and was forced to  abort take off. That left three Sqn. Ldr. Rafiqui (leader), Flt. Lt. Cecil  (No.2) and Flt. Lt. Yunus Hussain (No.3). When this formation was heading  for Halwara, Sqn. Ldr. M.M. Alam was returning from a mission and he  called up on the radio and asked Rafiqui Sahib not to proceed as he had  spotted a large number of Indian fighter aircraft in the vicinity of  Halwara. But Rafiqui and his colleagues had already signed and  delivered a cheque in the name of their NATION where the amount column  had said, ”Up to and including My Life.”  Rafiqui, lovingly called "Raf"  by his mates, carried on  knowing full well what was the expected outcome. In the Air Combat of 3  vs innumerable, Yunus was shot down, Rafiqui shot down 2 before his  guns jammed and he handed over the lead to Cecil who shot down 3 and was overwhelmed, disengaged and used all the skill at his command to evade  the pursuing IAF Fighters and landed at Sargodha with the sun setting  on a day which we, the colleagues of  Shaheed Sqn. Ldr. Sarfraz Rafiqui,  HJ. Shaheed Flt. Lt. Yunus Hussain, SJ. and Gp. Capt. Cecil Chaudhry, SJ,  S.Bt. (RIP) will never ever forget.\n\n The evening of 6th September, 1965, was our Sham-e-Ghariban. Cecil  and I stood next to the mess swimming pool, which was as empty as our  hearts. The night was dark and quiet, the lights were dim and the  sadness was just so loud. We just just stood in silence. A silence that  spoke louder than words. Then Cec broke the wall of silence saying,   ”Why are they saying that my leader is alive?” I replied, “Cec, you  were there and you know the gloom in the heart of all pilots and men, a  bit of hope is required to let them sleep. We have to fight again, come  sun rise”.\n\n As I write this, a tribute to one of the bravest man I knew, and  all those who gave up their lives for our motherland, I reaffirm, that  the men of the Pak Armed Forces pledge their lives to the Nation.That blank  cheque the motherland can call upon any time, to deliver!', ''),

You can easily, I would say very easily change the bore or simply make it written as "One NPB Weapon or One NPB Pistol/Revolver" by submitting your license with an application of change of bore at the Arms'' Section of the related District office. Once you get the bore changed, take it to Section Officer (SO) Arms at Home Ministry, Peshawar. There you would have to submit the form and then fee of 2000+ (little bit above it) in Bank and the mean time your license would be converted into ALL-PAKISTAN by writing / stamping "VALIDATED FOR ALL PAKISTAN".

(423612, ' @ H.G\n\nWhat a waterfowl hunter could wish??? Birds decoying right in front of hideout with low velocity, heedlessly and feeling unscarred. \n\n  Let me conclude the unattended query. \n\nFirst of all, i would like to mention that we have a good duck hunter around, needless to mention its &#8220;URIKA&#8221;, the best. \n\nI appreciate his good game spirit and nice bags continuously, my gratitude&#8217;s 2 him. I hope he will also bear a good experience towards wings game and his contribution will be an asset for us all. \n\nComing back to the subject question, let me explain my (personal) strategy with associate. I hope my personal experience needs some cushion of apologies by the critics.\n\n\nSince times, I have earned that decoying the birds is not adequate in hunting but their proper landing as gunners need is the key factor. Getting maximun number of birds from each flight makes the real difference otherwise everyone is equally good with guns.\n\nI have seen buddies spreading 100 decoys without any trajectory resulting minuscule number of ducks from each flight. One can succeed in decoying the birds into the spread but not at desired place nor within needed velocity and at right place. Sometime ducks lands ahead of decoys or unreachable areas. Shooting them result in just few birds or waste of a good flight. Its most often and those who are in duck shooting will agree.\n\nDynamics of decoy spread is little interesting, I never has any fixed shape in mind, its on spot decision always depending upon the birds approaching that day or the best in mind while its dark. Sometime, it needs to change your plan several times during the shortest possible time. \n\nRemember each decoy of the spread has its importance. Just holding decoys in numbers will never fruitful. Key factors to keep in mind is birds route and where u wants them to decoy. The place where you will get them. \n\nSetting decoying zone is known to every hunter and its common thing for every duck hunter but many factors involved which often ignored like birds approaching spread, wind direction, climate, mojo setting, hide setting, landing zone  bla Bla Bla. \n\nLet me share the crux of the decoy spread for me. \n\nHave you observed my spreads they are far different from orthodox spread, groups or specific landing zones. I have set route for birds to enter in between. The lines straighter and regardless of any fixed pattern like X, W, J or any other. I have confidence that the birds will decoys at the foremost trap set with a higher velocity and slow down and decrease height until it approaches the landing area and most often birds follow the instruction &#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;. Hahahahhaaha  \n\nTry to set the trap away from your den, let them fall under fixed route. Your guns will be empty for sure.\n\nRoute trajectory should be set against the wind always, regardless of everything.\n\nView should be clear for each decoy from the approaching area.\n\nEach decoy should have his separate place. A smallest spread can provide an excellent view following this instruction.\n\nBest Decoys should be at leading side where birds will decoy first.\n\nTrap should have set in a way that bird should not focus to your hideout while decoying.\n\nCalling should be fully controlled, decrease wile birds approaching you rather stop calling if you are sure they are coming at right place. Add a little feeding or single low quack if they erect.\n\nWe often set pattern of decoys in a shape that birds entering spread will see added decoys each moment. It means from one to many and a landing whole nearer to hideout. \n\nMost important is the wind factor at this particular time, lading zone should set in a way that the birds flight should directed towards your hide while reaching it. They must pass over the hideout when you start shooting. \n\nMojo&#8217;s play vital roles in wing shooting these days but often seen there adverse reaction too. \nIt&#8217;s a separate debate but in most cases set them in way that flight should reach them while just landing at them directing you otherwise get ready for bad result from each flight. Never set them in landing holes rather in the direction the birds should be insisted to into landing zone from your planed area where guns waiting them.\n\nIt&#8217;s a little laborious discussion but if one could get even a single thing which results his success will be an honor for me.\n\n\nThis was all experience of decoys deployment while we setting our trap without any \nhesitations. However, people are much more experienced here share their own. \nPlease no arguments as its my personal query asked by H.G. no debate in favor or against please&#8230;..  \n\n\nLove u all', ''),

Unfortunately, due to some unofficial reasons, the CC Islamabad didn''t excercise the powers for a single time. I personally met him, as having long family terms with him, regarding the issue. He said that they are soon going to hand over their licences to NADRA too (almost very soon in a month or two) and then they would declare all licences as All-Pakistan against a separate fee. In the other case, he said, if they couldn''t make-up with NADRA, still they would start granting and Validating licences as ALL-PAKISTAN, after May-June, INSHA ALLAH.', ''),

(423672, ' Chishti Sahab \nWhere do you intend using the tents?\nAltitude and temperature?\nRainy or snowy area?\nAre you back packing? Camping next to your vehicle?\nWhat is the intended duration  and purpose of camping out?\nThe answers to these questions are a must before I can be of any help. For back packing up in the northern areas a 2 or three men tent which weighs around 2.2 KG is required, it should be fire retardent and breathable ,otherwise your life would be miserable as water from your own bodies and clothing will condense on the inner roof and drip on you all night, you will be wet and cold. For temperatures lower than 5 degrees C you have to get a breath able Gore tex inner tent, these are available abroad or at the Expedition shops in Gilgit and Skardu, these are very expansive abroad but mountaineers sell or gift these to the porters and you can buy one from 10 to 20000/-.\nFor higher temperatures ordinary parachute cloth tents are ok but come wet weather the moisture inside will be too much to breath and every thing will get wet from the moisture given off by the body.\nAgain these parachute type tents must have a porous inner with (Jali ) type large patches to let moisture go away. \nAll tents are highly INFLAMMABLE and a lot of dangerous accidents take place due to negligence. In any case fires are lit around camps and some of our brothers are unfortunately suffering from the smoking habbit.\nCanvas tents are only good for camping next to the vehicle as these are heavy.\n The breathable Gore tex tents become warm with body heat as it lets out all the moisture but traps hot air and makes you comfortable. An insect proof mesh is a must and one can regulate temperature by opening or closing zippers. The floor should be sturdy but not heavy and the poles are flexible carbon fiber or kevlar re enforced, the pegs are plastic for use in snow and aluminum for soft ground.\nVango, Northface, Karrimor and numerous other companies specialise in very expansive but fantastic tents worth their weight in gold in the wilderness when it rains and snows and the temperatures get as low minus 40 degrees celsius.\nIn hot weather one requires shade, insect proof mesh and not much more. I have spent years in tents from canvas to Gore tex and I also have a collection of tents from two men to about ten men weighing from 2kg to 50 kg.\nPlease take my advice fire hazard is very real.', ''),

(423802, ' @ Prince..Thanks for the comprehensive reply Prince, nice to see you after a while!!\n \nThe detailed statement has left some queries in my mind which I’ll be posting point wise below, anticipating some further guidance from you. May be I’ll sound a bit dull or blazed out even. However, please note that these questions are raised solely with the intention of learning the art. There is absolutely no offense or argumentation..\n \n\n[LIST=1]\n[*]My first question is relevant to Mojo placement. What I got from your statement is to place them right next to your hide just before the declared Landing area. Of course one has to deploy the decoys in form of a straight line starting from the farthest point from your hide, with the intention that ducks will start losing height and velocity once they reach them and by the time they cross it and reach the landing area, what they’ll see is a landing mojo right in front of them which not only will tempt them to land in your designated zone but also it will help them to keep the emphasis on your decoy spread and not the hide….Right??\n[/LIST]\n \nHowever, I have seen people placing Mojo’s in relatively deep water right next to the decoys which will be approached by the incoming birds at very first instance. Of course they have their own theory to it that a landing Mojo at that place will help to minimize the height and speed of ducks coming towards you, and they will be at their slowest as they reach the striking zone. Please advise your take on that?? May be this has something to do with the location at which you are hunting or something else, your comments will be a lot helpful of course..\n \n\n[LIST=1]\n[*]What is the ideal number of decoys to be used in your opinion, of course you are right in saying that hundreds of them can be used without having adequate results…Also, should this vary as per the hunting location or type of location e.g. rivers or small ponds or shallow “Chumbs”\n[/LIST]\n \n\n[LIST=1]\n[*]One of the most important point that I came across is “landing zone should set in a way that the birds flight should be directed towards your hide while reaching it. They must pass over the hideout when you start shooting” I am sure this will be very helpful in my future outings as people generally tend to make their hides just at the corner or “Noki” of the baraita without giving much consideration to the direction of wind or incoming birds. What I am getting is try and even shift the hide as per the wind direction and decoys employed to ensure that their chests should be pointing towards you at the time you pull the trigger..Right??\n[/LIST]\n \nHowever, I am a bit confused by a picture of yours which is there in my first/original post where you have set the decoys in a slightly curved line (the one in which we can see the hills in the background). As it is only offering one side view as per my observation which I guess is the Left side of your hide, you must have noticed the movement from LEFT to RIGHT at that point of time. Now if we consider this, your landing area should have been right in front of the hide and incoming ducks will not cross over your hide unless you have some wide water spread on your right….. It’s just an assumption on the basis of what I see in order to understand the concept, shall be grateful if you can shed some light on the complete picture or post it if you are having it with you.\n \n\n[LIST=1]\n[*]One more thing, I am yet to shoot a mallard at a river site as they just don’t give you a chance when in flock, as most of the other ducks like pintails, pochards and gadwalls do. The most the’ll do is to pass/cross over your head at a height which is out of range. You must have hunted several in these kind of situations, is there anything special about it like decoy settings, types of decoys used, hide formulation, calling etc.\n[/LIST]\n \nLooking forward to have your valuable comments…Cheers!!!!\n \n [ATTACH=CONFIG]9893[/ATTACH]', ''),

Without any chemistry simply places it against the wind within 15 yards from your hideout, however, in case of shy ducks this is separate rocket science but let&#8217;s first talk about migration (IN-OUT). \n\n Its not that easy to define without diagrams really but let me simplify further. Assume your hide is directed towards EAST (Let Sun Rises from East) at an open river (Water Flowing up or down) or open marshes.\n\n Wind blowing N->S (Left to right), let&#8217;s assume birds are also approaching you from North (or any side) they will always prefer to land against the wind i.e. (S->N), however, few bullet teals sometime give u surprise but rarely. \n\nNow preference for me will be discriminate all rules and I will try to set a trajectory is way that \n\n1 - The maximum view of decoys could be provided birds approaching from South.\n2 &#8211; Landing zone should &#8220;NOT&#8221; set in front of my hide i.e. (Which was directed towards EAST). \n3 - It will be now set at the southern side of the hideout. \n4 &#8211; Mojo will be set at the northern side of the lading hole (may be too close to hide, it can be few yards sometime). \nSimplest Trap set now. Most birds will cross your hideout N->S and encircle it from S->N with reducing height and velocity. \n\nA good bang will be result often &#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230; \n\nThis is common thumb rules which is shared here but try it. Never make landing zone towards EAST nor set you spread for alluring ducks coming from east. It will provide you driven shots often which hardly results good from each flight.\nCheers', ''),

What I got from your statement is to place them right next to your hide just before the declared Landing area. Of course one has to deploy the decoys in form of a straight line starting from the farthest point from your hide, with the intention that ducks will start losing height and velocity once they reach them and by the time they cross it and reach the landing area, what they’ll see is a landing mojo right in front of them which not only will tempt them to land in your designated zone but also it will help them to keep the emphasis on your decoy spread and not the hide….Right???? \n[/LIST]\n\n@ HG\n\nGoodness me, it’s a comprehensive questionnaire ………… Ahahhahahaa\n\nOK, no worries let me conclude whatever I can contribute in tranches please. Come what may with TABLEGH is with you now ….. Hahahahhaa ………………… \n\nLet’s discuss about first query, when u feel its clear with you, we will discuss further.\n \n\nSimply deploy the mojo / mojo’s where you suppose its finish point (Time to Bang) for landed birds. Without any chemistry simply places it against the wind within 15 yards from your hideout, however, in case of shy ducks this is separate rocket science but let’s first talk about migration (IN-OUT). \n\n Its not that easy to define without diagrams really but let me simplify further. Assume your hide is directed towards EAST (Let Sun Rises from East) at an open river (Water Flowing up or down) or open marshes.\n\n Wind blowing N->S (Left to right), let’s assume birds are also approaching you from North (or any side) they will always prefer to land against the wind i.e. (S->N), however, few bullet teals sometime give u surprise but rarely. \n\nNow preference for me will be discriminate all rules and I will try to set a trajectory is way that \n\n1 - The maximum view of decoys could be provided birds approaching from South.\n2 – Landing zone should “NOT” set in front of my hide i.e. (Which was directed towards EAST). \n3 - It will be now set at the southern side of the hideout. \n4 – Mojo will be set at the northern side of the lading hole (may be too close to hide, it can be few yards sometime). \nSimplest Trap set now. Most birds will cross your hideout N->S and encircle it from S->N with reducing height and velocity. \n\nA good bang will be result often ……………… \n\nThis is common thumb rules which is shared here but try it. Never make landing zone towards EAST nor set you spread for alluring ducks coming from east. It will provide you driven shots often which hardly results good from each flight.\nCheers[/QUOTE]\n\nGot it & Bingo!!!

I went looking for a Weihrauch HW100 but these too we''re sold out.\nFinally, I decided to import an airgun.

(423833, ' I had an opportunity to meet Mr. Cecil Chaudhry way back in 2001 (I had just started my very first job and Mr. Chaudhry was the principal at St. Anthony''s School, here in Lahore). I was working on a project regarding the PAF''s role in the ''65 War and Mr. Chaudhry was gracious enough to grant me an interview.\n\nI had initially planned the interview to be an hour long, but the man was an absolute treasure trove to knowledge, and the next I knew we had been talking & chatting for four hours straight! He spoke on everything; how he joined the PAF, his deep friendship with Sqn. Ldr. Rafiqui (he almost broke down while recounting the moment over Halwara when he realized that Sqn. Ldr. Rafiqui had made the ultimate sacrifice), his experiences in both the Wars, his views on the IAF, opinions on the current political and socio-econimic condition of Pakistan, his favorite books, cars, etc.\n\nI''d like to retell the most interesting story he told me. Some time after the ''71 War, Mr. Chaudhry was sent to Iraq on deputation as an instructor. The IAF had also sent a group of instructors. Upon landing, him & his wife were invited to a dinner reception for all the new instructors (both Pakistani & Indian) hosted by the C-in-C of the Iraq Air Force. That evening, at the dinner reception, while talking to a group of Iraqi officers, somebody tapped him on the shoulder. He turned around and saw an IAF officer standing before him, smiling. The IAF officer asked if he was Cecil Chaudhry. Upon confirmation, the IAF officer broke into a grin, offered his hand and introduced himself as A. R. Gandhi (forgive me, I forgot what Mr. Gandhi''s rank was at the time). Mr. Chaudhry shook his hand and asked how Mr. Gandhi knew him. The latter''s reply stunned Mr. Chaudhry. [B]"You see, Sir,"[/B] began Mr. Gandhi, [B]"you shot me down over Halwara!"[/B] He was then introduced to Mr. Gandhi''s wife, who quipped cheerfully, "Thank you for not killing my husband!" Both Mr. Chaudhry & Mr. Gandhi became life-long friends. Mr. Gandhi later went on to become C-inC IAF!\n\nI will not profess to knowing Mr. Cecil Chaudhry personally. I will, however, admit to what a great honour it is for me to have spent time in the company of such a great man.\n\nI once read an epitaph, written for Werner Voss (a German WWI ace who, with 58 kills, was killed in action in 1917 at the age of 20). I would like to repeat here;\n\n[B]"Rest peacefully now, brave knight,\nmay the clouds welcome you in their final embrace."\n\nPakistan Zindabad![/B]', ''),

There are lots of associate who are far experienced and their expert opinion may add some knowledge to novice like me also.\n\nFor you perusal please:- \n\n4 &#8211; Ideal number of decoys varies according to situation always. For example, widespread open water may need 5 dozen or more decoys sometime. \n\nUsually 3 dozen decoys are more than enough in most situations. They may work more than 100, if properly placed. As we discussed in above simply try to set the pattern in a way that each decoy should have its own appearance while ducks approaching them. \n\nIn marshes, always place groups of decoys and open lading zone nearer 2 u. These groups some time placed at 40 yards to make them visual in dense marshes by birds passing over head. These groups should set in a ways that no adequate landing zone should left around them as an option to decoy landing birds. Landing zone should open near you and insisting birds to sit there. \n\nWind factor will be again vital here, otherwise ducks will cross you with greater speed and shooting may result in loss of many birds in the marshes or koondar. However, it inevitable, you always suffer a good number of ducks especially winger.\n\nUsually, mojo cannot be places at such places due to deep water or bogging but mojo is not that necessary in marshes where birds expected to stay. Your call will do the trick, as soon as birds crosses your spread call them with single quacks or feeding chuckle. Never call birds that are eager to enjoy your guns i.e. in marshes usually your call works at a unbelievable height and birds will respond to your call with closed wings often and reach you like a rocket. \n\nTry never shot highly declining birds, swinging down barrels never results too good. Let them encircle your trap and enjoy shooting.\n\nThese are personal experiences / judgments please, open for debate always.\n\nAs you said u r know to H1, feel free the meet sometime. It doesn&#8217;t look appropriate to reply in such a way that people start chanting slogans &#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;. \n\nAnyhow, what else do you want to share??? if unanswered.\n\nMallards are the cleverest birds while flying over open water. Open Hideout barring height over 2 feet will be a challenge for them, they are not gadwalls for sure&#8230;&#8230; haahahaha &#8230;&#8230; \n\nTry a low height hide always (Where mallards flight pasing over), if hunting in open water, results will be changed. \n\nMallard is the easiest birds in marshes but the most intelligent species while fly over open water especially in flocks greater than 5 birds. \n\nEnjoy game !!!!!!!', ''),

I live in karachi , and my Police station , home department and the DCO office are located 10 to 15 kms away . Now starts the real story " how can a person living in loralai . karachi , gawdar or kalam get an MOI license legally . THe procedure is as follows fill up the form an get it approved from u r local mna . take a trip to Islamabad . go to MOI and the S/o arms acknowledeges u r application . and sent a request to u r area ssp office for police verification through pakistan post . Upon receipt the SSP office marks the request to the SHO of U R police station . The ASI visits u r neighbourhood and gets u r antecedents verified . THe whole process is reversed ans somehow u r application reaches s/o arms in MOI . For this whole period of time u r in islamabad . or say after tracking u r application take another trip to islamabad deposit the fee and then get the book finally . This MOi license process is the most bogus procedure and its has been designed that you go to a dealer and just pay him 15 to 18000 ( that was 02 years ago ) and bingo . green books where splashed all over the country and guess what all of them went through  thsi ordeal hahaha .

Superb.\n\nI liked your unbiased opinions, and it''s my pleasure to have been of assistance to convince you into a great buy. Caracal handguns speak quality.\n\nLet me just come to some main points:\n\n1) The recoil reduction as if compared to the Duty is not only due to the added 95 grams. It''s the ergonomics, gripping comfort and lower bore axis combined, and course the slightly added weight also.\n\n2) The slide lock problem is strange. Try Denovo bro''s prescription and feed back here. \n\n3) The longer trigger reset is now confirmed to be Caracal F specific. This is not so with the C models. They''re perfect. Try shooting a full mag of rapids as fast as you possibly can and video clip it here for comparison to the 15 shots string with the C in my clip. This will confirm the trigger reset delay in the F model, if any.\n\n4) The slide catch release is indeed hard. I agree. Try oiling this mechanism a bit, also from the inside.\n\nIn any case, and wishing you the best of joy with your F, I cannot withhold that my personal choice would have been in the favor of the C model, which is available with traditional sights. Wonder if you came across it there at PARA.\n\n\nHappy shooting bro.\n\n\n\nRegards.[/QUOTE]\n\nThanks Ak47 bro for the lovely comment. I did try firing full mag as fast as I can.

Read a lot of reviews on this gun from this forum and others, some folks on youtube also say that its better then Glock and that it has an excellent trigger comparing to Glocks and that its at par with Walther PPQ. Ak47 bro, a senior member and a seasoned gun enthusiast thinks a world of this gun. So had to see whats all the fuss is about. No doubt after reading all this and watching all the videos on youtube, this gun caught my attention and this itch had to be scratched. But it also meant that i had to give up my Duty in the process. After alot of discussion with Ak47 bro and watching 1000 rounds endourance test by Abaas bhai i decided to go with it. So when i heard that Caracals are available in Lahore i went to Lahore and got this gun. I bought it from PARA for 75k. other dealers were willing to even come down from this price but i got a very good deal at Para by selling my Duty and getting this gun. The first moment you hold a Caracals in your hand you cant let them go. They are very comfortable and the grip is awsome. The C model felt better in my hand then F but i didnt like the Quick Sight system. Sorry Ak47 bhai i really tried ;). Besides i always like full frame guns. The Straight Eight sights also need getting use too. You guys will see in my shooting Pics. Here are some thing i like and dont like about this gun when comparing it with Duty. I dont like the finish on the Slide, its shiny and smooth and its very slippery when you have oiled the gun or ur hands a sweaty. I liked the finish of Duty very much and after 600+ rounds fired no scratches or any sign of wear. But i lets see what happens with Caracal. I like the polymer on this gun, its much better then Cz''s polymer. I doesnt flex when mag is removed and you grip tight or simply its more sturdy and comfortable. \r\nCaracal has a lower bore axis even then the Cz and therefore the recoil is less and the gun is easy to control. I''m comparing it with duty guys, and its my opinion. So relax! The felt recoil also be the case that Caracal F is heavier then Duty and also bigger so hard to conceal. Duty is 700 and Caracal F is 790grams when Duty is 770. Even caracal f is bigger and heavier, surprisingly it has a slimmer profile. Caracal also has more fire power 18 rounds vs 16. Trigger of Caracal is definitely a winner, but it needs getting use too. \r\n\r\nTecnical Specifications:-\r\n\r\nSlide length                                                              178mm\r\nBarrel length                                                             104mm\r\nHeight                                                                      135mm   \r\nWidth                                                                       28mm\r\nWeight                                                                     790 g\r\nCaliber                                                                     9mm\r\nMagazine Capacity                                                     18\r\nGrip Frame                                                               Synthetic\r\nTrigger System                                                         Short Double Action\r\nTrigger weight                                                          2.2 kg\r\n(constant)\r\n\r\nTrigger travel                                                           8mm\r\n(Constant)\r\n\r\nInternal Safety (trigger,                                             3\r\ndrop and firing pin)\r\n\r\nOptional Manual Safety                                              1\r\nCocking Idicator                                                       1\r\nMagazine Catch                                                        Ambiextrous\r\n\r\nThe Box and contents:\r\n\r\nThe box is better made then a Cz''s, you only get the gun along with two mags and a user manual.

Superb.\n\nI liked your unbiased opinions, and it''s my pleasure to have been of assistance to convince you into a great buy. Caracal handguns speak quality.\n\nLet me just come to some main points:\n\n1) The recoil reduction as if compared to the Duty is not only due to the added 95 grams. It''s the ergonomics, gripping comfort and lower bore axis combined, and course the slightly added weight also.\n\n2) The slide lock problem is strange. Try Denovo bro''s prescription and feed back here. \n\n3) The longer trigger reset is now confirmed to be Caracal F specific. This is not so with the C models. They''re perfect. Try shooting a full mag of rapids as fast as you possibly can and video clip it here for comparison to the 15 shots string with the C in my clip. This will confirm the trigger reset delay in the F model, if any.\n\n4) The slide catch release is indeed hard. I agree. Try oiling this mechanism a bit, also from the inside.\n\nIn any case, and wishing you the best of joy with your F, I cannot withhold that my personal choice would have been in the favor of the C model, which is available with traditional sights.

So i''m satisfied.  One point though i wanted to make was; i wanted this weapon three months ago but price was outrageous at 150k. The importers and shopkeepers were too greedy and ruined the market. Now that the price has crashed(good for consumers), it will take time to recapture the demand since mentally we all feel that the weapon is bad since price has crashed yet it may not be the case. So i suggest to all Pakguns brothers who were waiting for the sub 60-70k price range to avail the opportunity while it lasts since im sure the the new shipment may cost 5k-10k more due to $$ value.

(424516, ' [QUOTE=Skeeter60;261968]Chishti Sahab \nWhere do you intend using the tents?\nAltitude and temperature?\nRainy or snowy area?\nAre you back packing? Camping next to your vehicle?\nWhat is the intended duration  and purpose of camping out?\nThe answers to these questions are a must before I can be of any help. For back packing up in the northern areas a 2 or three men tent which weighs around 2.2 KG is required, it should be fire retardent and breathable ,otherwise your life would be miserable as water from your own bodies and clothing will condense on the inner roof and drip on you all night, you will be wet and cold. For temperatures lower than 5 degrees C you have to get a breath able Gore tex inner tent, these are available abroad or at the Expedition shops in Gilgit and Skardu, these are very expansive abroad but mountaineers sell or gift these to the porters and you can buy one from 10 to 20000/-.\nFor higher temperatures ordinary parachute cloth tents are ok but come wet weather the moisture inside will be too much to breath and every thing will get wet from the moisture given off by the body.\nAgain these parachute type tents must have a porous inner with (Jali ) type large patches to let moisture go away. \nAll tents are highly INFLAMMABLE and a lot of dangerous accidents take place due to negligence. In any case fires are lit around camps and some of our brothers are unfortunately suffering from the smoking habbit.\nCanvas tents are only good for camping next to the vehicle as these are heavy.\n The breathable Gore tex tents become warm with body heat as it lets out all the moisture but traps hot air and makes you comfortable. An insect proof mesh is a must and one can regulate temperature by opening or closing zippers. The floor should be sturdy but not heavy and the poles are flexible carbon fiber or kevlar re enforced, the pegs are plastic for use in snow and aluminum for soft ground.\nVango, Northface, Karrimor and numerous other companies specialise in very expansive but fantastic tents worth their weight in gold in the wilderness when it rains and snows and the temperatures get as low minus 40 degrees celsius.\nIn hot weather one requires shade, insect proof mesh and not much more. I have spent years in tents from canvas to Gore tex and I also have a collection of tents from two men to about ten men weighing from 2kg to 50 kg.\nPlease take my advice fire hazard is very real.[/QUOTE]\n\nnicely explained sir.', ''),

(424521, ' Hi\n\nI have perused the posts and would comment as follows:\n\nUnless you are likely to be hunting at dawn or dusk then anything over 40-45mm in objective (front end/second number in the specification) is wasted. 50mm objective lenses maximise light gathering opportunity if you need it, however, the compromise is the additional weight for the benefit.\n\nRegarding magnification (first number when reading the specification) as said before the higher this is the more difficult it is to hold the binos without ''wobble/shake''. To overcome this you need to use an aid to hold steady - such as ''shooting sticks''. Generally speaking 7-8.5 magnification covers just about most field/hunting use, unless you are out on the plains/in the mountains. An important point to remember is that you may be able to see quarry/a target a long way off but can you place your bullet on it without wounding or capable of making up ground/stalking nearer........\n\nI use Swarovski 7x42SL binos and will be getting a back-up Zeiss/Swarovski in 10x soon.\n\nAn important fact to note in any optical equipment is the quality of the glass and the coatings on the lenses - in quality optics (both scopes and binos) these will ensure that there is no ''flaring'' or optical issues when you look through them. Cheaper optics (Chinese/Phillipino/Taiwan etc) can only compromise.\n\nAs the saying goes ''buy once and cry once''.\n\nFinally, it is a good idea to match the quality of any scope with your binos - no good seeing a target through the binos and not as clear or clearer when you come into the aim.', ''),

Almost all precision shooters do that due to having control on everything.  It is for tight groups and minimum drop in trajectory for ''the'' gun. This is a whole different field and is not necessary for shooting guns. Since variation is user controlled and an intentional or unintentional load can be put together which may be out of ''a'' gun''s limits. This is why warranties are void on some brands of weapons if reloads are used.\n\nThis is an opposite of commercial ammo where strict quality controls ensure that tight specifications are followed, but it is still for ''a'' gun.', ''),

Any Magnum calibre is going to take getting used to and practice at longer range will be essential - this should be factored in or get closer to your quarry. The majority of people would be far better off with with a lesser calibre that they are accurate with on a regular basis.\n\nMy understanding over here is all Remington rifles need some after market improvement - especially the triggers.\n\nSwedish Sako or Tikka (slightly cheaper but same manufacturer) rifles shoot well straight out of the box. I understand Japanese Howa rifles likewise. Lightweight rifles are probably not a good idea in a larger calibre as some weght is required to asisst in managing recoil.\n\nRead up on the late American Jack O''Conner - a .270W user who shot just about everything with it - perhaps the saying ''beware the man with one rifle - he will know how to use it'' was coined from him!\n\nRegards', ''),

No dispute over any point except regarding few.\n\nIt will not cost 3.5 Million, even if imported and taxes / duties are paid. Secondly, each Member parliament and APUG officer are allowed / previlleged to import one tax-free weapon. I have made myself three times sure and have confirmed several times about .50 stands NPB. The law you are mentioning is "1965 West Pakistan Arms Ordinance" in which it is written that any Weapon above .44 would be termed as Canon (somewhere it is .46) in any case there are much higher calibers are wether endorsed as NPB or PB. I have already received 4 tax-free Arms'' licences by commerce Ministry issued for four privileged persons. As far as ban issue is concerned a renowned Gun-Dealer / Importer (who is importing) has told me that I have to pay 4500 US$ extra (nothing if I still get a Tax-Free .50) for importing it, by third country. The one option is that a person could also import himself directly if he//she is in the country of purchase after 3 formalities to come-up with there. Beside this, there are two other legal options available. [B]In short, the problem which is delaying all this process is that I am trying to include 1500 rounds in one of the permits as to be imported tax-free so I also get .50 rounds tax-free. Otherwise it is of no use for me.[/B]  \n\nThere is one man in Karachi, a low-ranked officer (non-gazzeted) of Sindh Police having D.E (.357) he is demanding 650G.

The M1935 is simply an M1934 modified to fire .32ACP ammunition.\nThe M1935 is a single-action semi-automatic blowback pistol that fires the .32 ACP ammunition. It is made out of carbon steel with plastic grips. It is fitted with a manual safety and when the last shot has been fired the slide is retained open by the empty magazine. The magazine capacity is 8 rounds. As this pistol was built for the Italian army, all parts were interchangeable, which simplified maintenance and manufacturing: a first at the time.\nThe M1935 was purpose built and designed for the Italian armed forces, however it was also sold to the civilian market and issued to the German forces in 1944 and 1945.\nFitted with the Beretta style open slide, the M1935 has a very reliable feeding and extraction cycle. It was made with few parts and is very simple to maintain. The M1935 is a very robust construction with long service life if properly maintained.\nThe Beretta M1935 was captured in huge numbers during World War II from Italian and German armed forces by allied soldiers, who liked it because of its small size, rugged design and good construction. Many of these captured pistols are operational to this day and widespread in the US, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, France and in the United Kingdom. The M1935 is compact and easy to hide, with ammunition available for it.', ''),

Bullet is inside barrel when firing pin strikes the primer. Barrels are made of steel, so far. So assuming that a steel frame may be strong enough to take the beating is invalid. However, rest of the pistol being polymer or steel does make some difference. Depending of the magnitude of explosion taking place, pieces of steel pistol will be much more deadlier than a polymer. Make no mistake, that polymer is safer, it would not. It may be somewhat less damaging due to its being more brittle than steel in this situation.\n\nReloading is not illegal, people are doing it for a very long time, in fact I learned it from my grand father long time ago.

(424976, 'Sniper The Sniper\r\nOne shot one kill\r\n\r\n\r\nThe actual word is originated in India where the hunter used to shoot single long distance sniper. Later, in 1770 British Indian adopted the word sniper. Kill With single shot.  The word applied to sharp shooter. Even before British rule In India, Great Emperor Jalal-udin Muhammad Akbar shot the Rajpoot commander during the siege of a fort in Panipat. Akaber could not breach the the fort. Altitude  of the fort was high and Akaber was stood below; just with single shot, Akbar won the battle. Churchill was hit by an Afradi sniper. The ball nicked his ear. Later Churchill wrote in his Biography that if that sniper bullet was half an inch to the right; their would had not been a Prime Minister called Winston Churchill of England. Then he  requested to be transferred to South Africa during the Boer War where he was arrested but escaped.. \r\n	Sniper are great marksman with the rifle . In WW1, British  used snipers. They were mostly the hunters. Later German used the snipers. German used Gwere Mauser 98. They were excellent. British were surprised how German can approach so closely and  kill their officers. British used 194 Enfield or Lee Enfield rifle. Later British used powerful rifles such as 375 and 458 because, German soldiers crawled behind a thick steel plate which Enfield could not penetrate. These rifles were loaned by Big Game British Hunter mostly from India.\r\n	In WII Russians were the best. especially the women. Russia trained 28000 women. One of the great marks women was Rosa Shinana . She used 189/30 Misn Naqgnat. Her confirmed kill were 500 Germans. When she killed a German commander at 1900 meters, she received the highest medal by the hand of Stalin himself. Russian were the first who issued rifle scopes. German used Zeiss 4x39 scopes later.\r\n	In 1975, during the Viet Nam war, I was drafted at the age of 23 years under the law called “Draft Bill” which is now abolished. Many young Americans fled to other countries not to be drafted. Americans actually against the wars. Only Congress can authorize the Commander in Chief, the president of USA; if the war is justified. But, President can authorize what is called police actions. It means only limited war and for short period of time and only limited military actions by small forces. Congress had authorized three wars: WWI, WII, and Desert storm. Iraq and Vietnam are not full fledge wars; these are called mission or police actions by the President.\r\n	I was not fit for anything but military saw in me good marksmanship with rifle. I am lousy with pistol but quiet good with rifle and shot guns. Therefore US army sent me to sniper school with promise to send me to any college free after I finish 2 years duty.  Fortunately, Viet Nam war ended in 1975 and I requested to be discharged while army keeps its promise. I went to college graduated with BA and MA then medical school. I am now Neuro Psychiatrist. I can treat neurological disorders as well as Psychiatric problem along with General medicine. It took me eleven yaers to finish and I used to study 16 hours a day. I still have to go to either seminar or school of medicine for three days every year to keep up the current knowledge. \r\n	Snipers are silent killers, they are master of hiding, wear ghille suits but their fatality rate is almost 80%. Because they are the most dangerous soldiers. Only lucky one come back alive.\r\n	Modern snipers has other mission too. Reconnaissance, signal, direct the artillery and the Air force. Usually each company has it. There are two snipers, they take turns. The other one direct his buddy, the distance, wind speed, ambient, the target and communication. Carlo Hatcheck a Mexican American had 93 conformed kill during the Viet Nam and he killed an officer from 2500 meters; established a record', ''),

One most noticeable feature of the Strike One pistol is its extremely low bore axis, which helps to control recoil and muzzle rise during rapid fire.\n\n\n[TABLE]\n[TR]\n[TD][B][FONT=Helvetica][SIZE=3][FONT=Helvetica][SIZE=3]Type \n[/SIZE][/FONT][/SIZE][/FONT][/B]\n[/TD]\n[TD="width: 71%"][FONT=Helvetica][SIZE=3][FONT=Helvetica][SIZE=3]Semiautomatic, Single Action (pre-cocked) \n[/SIZE][/FONT][/SIZE][/FONT]\n[/TD]\n[/TR]\n[TR]\n[TD="width: 29%"][B][FONT=Helvetica][SIZE=3][FONT=Helvetica][SIZE=3]Caliber(s) \n[/SIZE][/FONT][/SIZE][/FONT][/B]\n[/TD]\n[TD="width: 71%"][FONT=Helvetica][SIZE=3][FONT=Helvetica][SIZE=3]9x19 Luger/Parabellum, 9x21 IMI, .357SIG, .40SW \n[/SIZE][/FONT][/SIZE][/FONT]\n[/TD]\n[/TR]\n[TR]\n[TD="width: 29%"][B][FONT=Helvetica][SIZE=3][FONT=Helvetica][SIZE=3]Weight unloaded\n[/SIZE][/FONT][/SIZE][/FONT][/B]\n[/TD]\n[TD="width: 71%"][FONT=Helvetica][SIZE=3][FONT=Helvetica][SIZE=3]750 g \n[/SIZE][/FONT][/SIZE][/FONT]\n[/TD]\n[/TR]\n[TR]\n[TD="width: 29%"][B][FONT=Helvetica][SIZE=3][FONT=Helvetica][SIZE=3]Length \n[/SIZE][/FONT][/SIZE][/FONT][/B]\n[/TD]\n[TD="width: 71%"][FONT=Helvetica][SIZE=3][FONT=Helvetica][SIZE=3]210 mm\n[/SIZE][/FONT][/SIZE][/FONT]\n[/TD]\n[/TR]\n[TR]\n[TD="width: 29%"][B][FONT=Helvetica][SIZE=3][FONT=Helvetica][SIZE=3]Barrel length\n[/SIZE][/FONT][/SIZE][/FONT][/B]\n[/TD]\n[TD="width: 71%"][FONT=Helvetica][SIZE=3][FONT=Helvetica][SIZE=3]128 mm\n[/SIZE][/FONT][/SIZE][/FONT]\n[/TD]\n[/TR]\n[TR]\n[TD="width: 29%"][B][FONT=Helvetica][SIZE=3][FONT=Helvetica][SIZE=3]Magazine capacity \n[/SIZE][/FONT][/SIZE][/FONT][/B]\n[/TD]\n[TD="width: 71%"][FONT=Helvetica][SIZE=3][FONT=Helvetica][SIZE=3]17 rounds \n[/SIZE][/FONT][/SIZE][/FONT]\n[/TD]\n[/TR]\n[/TABLE]\n[/FONT][/SIZE]\n[FONT=Calibri][SIZE=3][COLOR=#000000][IMG]http://i1256.photobucket.com/albums/ii491/jahangir-58/strike1.jpg[/IMG][/COLOR][/SIZE][/FONT]\n[FONT=Calibri][SIZE=3][COLOR=#000000][IMG]http://i1256.photobucket.com/albums/ii491/jahangir-58/strikeone.jpg[/IMG][/COLOR][/SIZE][/FONT]\n[FONT=Calibri][SIZE=3][COLOR=#000000][IMG]http://i1256.photobucket.com/albums/ii491/jahangir-58/strikeoneb.jpg[/IMG][/COLOR][/SIZE][/FONT]\n[FONT=Calibri][SIZE=3][COLOR=#000000][IMG]http://i1256.photobucket.com/albums/ii491/jahangir-58/strikeonewithextendedbarrel.jpg[/IMG][/COLOR][/SIZE][/FONT]\n\n[FONT=Calibri][SIZE=3][COLOR=#000000][IMG]http://i1256.photobucket.com/albums/ii491/jahangir-58/strikeonea.jpg[/IMG][/COLOR][/SIZE][/FONT]\n[FONT=Calibri][SIZE=3][COLOR=#000000][IMG]http://i1256.photobucket.com/albums/ii491/jahangir-58/tumblrljdimeqamj1qd56mo.jpg[/IMG][/COLOR][/SIZE][/FONT]', ''),

A spot was needed.\n\nAnyhow, Mishaq bro, yes, it is fibre optics. But it cannot assist anything in total dark, though it''s a bit better than traditional sights in low light conditions, as long as it''s getting some source of light.\n\nLet me just state, fibre optics front sights are not available here in Pakistan  as of now for the traditional C model with conventional sights set up. So far, only QS models have these.\n\nThe front sight on Caracals is dovetailed, and with after market add ons it may sometimes be possible to install fibre optics front sights, once these are imported.\n\nAs for the F or C choice, well, try them out both, though I''m sure you''d feel more comfortable with the C''s grip, lest you need a full sized. Difference, however, is barely 3 shots and 1cm to the barrel.\n\n\nBut the C is already having 15 shots capacity to it and a barrel of close to being 3.75 inches, so difference is not [I]significantly [/I]much here, though C is much more concealable, and offers a much better grip, feel-in-hand, at least in my opinion.\n\n\n\nRegards.', ''),

Reason why I''ve never believed in manual safeties. \n\nAs for the trigger, well, I''m still of the opinion that it''s the man who fires the gun, and it can''t go off by itself. We have our personal reviews here where a loaded Caracal was abused and thrown down on different soils, with no letting off.\n\nIf one is not proficient with guns, any gun can be dangerous.\n\nThe built in trigger safety is enough IMHO. Moreover, as per our own survey here, most people don''t carry loaded chamber. For those who do, I agree there''s a psychological effect on carrying a Safe Action chambered, but I don''t find the 4 lbs trigger any [I]sensitive[/I] as such, it does require an intent of fire.\n\nLet''s see what TH and Ameer bros have to say on this.\n\nRegards.', ''),

(425508, ' S & W Revelover \n\nThe Smith & Wesson Model 10, previously known as the Smith & Wesson Military & Police or the Smith & Wesson Victory Model, is a .38-caliber revolver developed from the Smith & Wesson .38 Hand Ejector Model of 1889. In production since 1899, it is a fixed-sight, six-shot handgun with a fluted cylinder. Over its long production run it has been available with barrel lengths of 2 in (51 mm), 3 in (76 mm), 4 in (100 mm), 5 in (130 mm), and 6 in (150 mm). Barrels of 2.5 inches (64 mm) are also known to have been made for special contracts. Some 6,000,000 of the type have been produced over the years, making it the most popular centerfire revolver of the 20th century.\n\nIn 1899, the Army and Navy placed orders with Smith and Wesson for two to three thousand Model 1889 Hand Ejector revolvers chambered for the M1892 .38 U.S. Service Cartridge (aka .38 Long Colt). With this order, the Hand Ejector Model 1889 became known as the .38 Military and Police model of 1899.[3] That same year, in response to reports from military sources serving in the Philippines on the relative ineffectiveness of the .38 (Long Colt) cartridge, Smith & Wesson began offering the Military & Police in a new chambering, the .38 S&W Special (aka .38 Special) &#8212; a slightly elongated version of the .38 Long Colt cartridge with increased bullet weight (158 grains) and increase in powder charge from eighteen to twenty-one grains of black powder.[3]\n \nIn 1902 the .38 Military & Police (2nd Model) was introduced, featuring substantial changes.[1] These included major modification and simplification of the internal lockwork and the addition of a locking underlug on the barrel to engage the previously free-standing ejector rod. Barrel lengths were 4, 5, 6, and 6.5 inches with a rounded butt. Serial numbers for the Military & Police ranged from number 1 in the series to 20,975. Most of the early M&P revolvers chambered in .38 Special appear to have been sold to the civilian market.[3] By 1904, S&W was offering the .38 M&P with rounded or square butt, and 4, 5, and 6.5-inch barrels.\n \nThe .38 S&W Military & Police Model of 1905 (4th Change, introduced 1915) incorporated a passive hammer block and enlarged service sights that quickly became a standard across the service revolver segment of the industry. Heat treatment of cylinders began in 1919.[4]\n\nAfter World War II, Smith and Wesson returned to manufacturing the M&P series. Along with cosmetic changes and replacement of the frame fitting grip with the Magna stocks, the spring-loaded hammer block safety gave way to a cam-actuated hammer block that rode in a channel in the side plate (Smith 1968). In 1957, Smith and Wesson adopted the convention of using numeric designations to distinguish their various models of handguns, and the M&P was renamed the Model 10.\n \nThe M&P/Model 10 has been available in both blued steel finish and nickel finish for most of its production run. The model has also been offered throughout the years with both the round butt and square butt (i.e. grip patterns). Beginning with the Model 10-5 series in the late 1960s, the tapered barrel and its trademark ''half moon'' front sight (as shown in the illustrations on this page) were replaced by a straight bull barrel and a sloped milled ramp front sight. Late model Model 10s are capable of handling any .38 Special cartridge produced today up to and including +P+ rounds. You can identify this late model by the implementation of a five screw assembly, four screws along the side and one in front of the trigger guard.\n \nAs of 2007 the Model 10 was available only in a 4" (102mm) barrel model. The Model 10''s stainless steel (Inox) counterpart, the Smith & Wesson Model 64, is available in either a 4" (102 mm) or a 3" (76 mm) barrel.', ''),

(425859, ' Bullet Penetration and Ricochet Mechanics\r\nAsset Properties\r\nCertain assets need to have the ability to be denoted by the level designer as "not penetrable." The\r\nFollowing assets will have a "Not Penetrable" property added to them in the Unreal Editor:\r\n• Individual BSP faces\r\n• StaticMeshActor\r\n• Material\r\nBullet Penetration Rules\r\nEvery material has two attributes: Damage Reduction and Deviation. Damage Reduction reduces the\r\ndamage a bullet does per inch of material it passes through. Deviation determines how much the bullet\r\nchanges direction per inch of material it passes through. These effects are determined by the total\r\nthickness of the material.\r\nWhen a bullet impacts a material, the thickness of the material will be determined. The damage reduction\r\nbased on material thickness is applied to the bullet. If the bullet can still do damage, then it will penetrate\r\nthe material. When the bullet exits the material, the deviation is applied to the bullet’s direction to\r\ndetermine its new path. A round will not penetrate any item that is over 15 inches (20 Unreal Units) thick\r\nand will not penetrate more than three surfaces regardless of material type and thickness.\r\nExamples with 5.56mm Round:\r\n• 1 inch Dense Metal door: by default, the round will not penetrate the material.\r\n• 4 inches of concrete/brick: damage reduced by 120%, does not penetrate, no deviation\r\n• 2 inch hard wood door: damage reduced by 10%, deviates 10 - 14 degrees.\r\n• 2 inch Drywall on each side: damage reduced by 4%, deviates 2 - 6 degrees\r\nRicochet Mechanics\r\nEach individual bullet has 15% chance to ricochet off dense metal, mud brick, stone/ceramic tile, and\r\nconcrete/brick. The base ricochet angle is the opposite angle of impact. The final ricochet angle is a\r\nrandom angle anywhere within that angle of impact in both Y and Z dimensions. This allows a bullet to\r\nricochet up or down from its original path. A bullet will only ricochet if it hits a surface within 15 degrees of\r\nthe material plane, and it can only ricochet off a maximum of three surfaces.', ''),

The military (USA) prescribed either hammer down on an empty  chamber (Condition 3), or loaded, cocked and locked (Condition 1).  Carrying over a live round with hammer on half cock bypasses TWO  safeties, since there isn''t another hammer safety and the thumb safety  can''t be activated when the hammer is on half cock.\n\nThe ''half-cocked'' position of the hammer on the 1911(and ANY other  auto-loader) is there for ONE purpose ONLY, to catch the hammer and  prevent it from discharging the chambered cartridge in case the hammer  slips.It is not meant for extended use.', ''),

Is this deliberately done or a limitation of 1911 design?[/B][/QUOTE]\n\nMore than anything negated in the design, your own purpose and manner of carrying the handgun negates any practical use. 1.st of all, why would you like to have safety on, hammer down, round in chamber? Can your gun fire from hammer down position?\n\n2.nd, if you''re not comfortable with a round in the chamber, you can always carry it the traditional way, uncocked/unchambered. But when there''s a round inside the chamber of a 1911, it''s ideal carry mode is [I]cocked n'' locked[/I].\n\nIn the absence of a decocking option, one has to be very careful with the high sprung hammer, short travel trigger of a 1911, when making the hammer come down with resistance force.\n\nI''d say, the 1911 handgun is probably the safest weapon to be carried loaded chamber, as long as the carrier is proficient with guns.

I know, one can always argue that CZ-999 has a slightly longer barrel therefore it must have some advantage in the accuracy department. however I must insist that the advantage is mitigated by the longer sighting radius of the Caracal. plus, if barrel length is directly proportional to accuracy then CZ-Rami should be offer least accuracy. I am sure you know thats not the case.', ''),
(426192, ' [B]Third:[/B] we thought may be standard accuracy tests are not relevant here. so we decided to do a rapid fire drill. five rounds were fired with Scorpion then five rounds were fired with Caracal.\r\n\r\n[B]Here is the video:[/B]\r\n[video=youtube_share;uG-WxcX0Y7I]http://youtu.be/uG-WxcX0Y7I[/video]\r\n\r\nas you can see from the video, scorpion performed flawlessly whereas Caracal miss fired one round again. it was a light primer strike. I wonder why it did that. when we used the same round in CZ-999 Scorpion it went bang without a hiccup.\r\n\r\n[B]Scorpion''s group:[/B]\r\n[IMG]http://i998.photobucket.com/albums/af103/12gauge-pakguns/Scorpion%20vs%20Caracal/ScorpionFast.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\n[B]Caracal''s group:[/B]\r\n[B][IMG]http://i998.photobucket.com/albums/af103/12gauge-pakguns/Scorpion%20vs%20Caracal/CaracalFast.jpg[/IMG][/B]\r\n\r\nagain you can see that Scorpion continues to impress with its ability to print better groups than a Caracal. I wonder if its the heavier bulk of the scorpion that aided it in achieving that. but what happened to lower bore axis of the caracal? Don''t you think it should have helped by directing the recoil forces straight into the hand of the shooter. lowering felt recoil and bringing the caracal back on target quicker. significantly increasing the second shot accuracy in the process. what happened?\r\n\r\nif you look at the videos carefully, you''ll find that Ameer Sb. our respected member is experiencing greater recoil with caracal. may be this particular Caracal was not supplied with the advertised "extremely low" bore axis.\r\n\r\nAnyways, just wanted to share this bad news with you in hope that you''ll find time to explain what happened. I hope that this was an isolated incident rather than a norm. Don''t want to see Caracals getting their A$$es whooped  them by Scorpions every time.\r\n\r\nRegards.', ''),

I am sure you know thats not the case.[/B]               [/COLOR]          [/QUOTE]\n\nFirst of all thanks for a great share, nice to see you guys active over here.\n\nCZ 999 has always proved a remarkable weapon with respect to accuracy. There''s nothing new here or any cause of new[I] jubilation.[/I]\n\n I personally observed this on using a CZ 999 in Haripur, belonging to brother of Syed Adeel bro and I was amazed at my own shots in rapid fire, making almost a scar like group, as if cut out with a razor.\n\nNow to barrel lengths. Course, it affects. As far as CZ Rami is concerned, it''s CZ''s unique twist rate playing the effect, as I recall some senior respectable''s comments somewhere in our threads.

That would have brought it to the 1.5X action, roughly, like the Caracal''s 4 lbs trigger.[/I]\n\n[B]2.nd. The weight of the handgun[/B].[I] I believe we have a difference of at least 200 grams.[/I]\n\n[B]3.rd. As mentioned, the barrel lenghts[/B].

Combat weapon vs CC SD weapon.[/B][/COLOR] [I]One is an adopted weapon in use by Serb forces, other is meant for concealed carry SD/Duty use.[/I]\n\nYou can''t carry a heavy, bulky, full sized forces weapon like the CZ 999 for your daily SD carry with any any ease, especially not with our national attire, so hence these guns serve completely different purposes.\n\n[COLOR=#ff0000][B]Therefore, as you can see, the only common thing between these two guns happens to be that they were GUNS. Just like apples and oranges are FRUITS, lolz![/B]\n[/COLOR]\nAs far as Caracal''s shots are concerned, it seems Ameer bro needs some  tuning in to the Safe Action trigger pull, as I''m sure he''s more used to DA/SA handguns. Shots are landing on the upward scale. Still, the shots  are enough to eliminate any threat from 15 mtrs with a CC weapon. The shots from the CZ 999 are outright awesome.\n\nAs regards the 2 misfires, well, with my Sarsilamaz Kilinc 2000 L, this ammo (Polytech-Chinese blue box) gave me a couple of  misfires too, but were shot out on 2.nd attempt. I agree therefore with 12G bro''s assertion that it''s an[I] isolated incident[/I], till Ameer bro reports more on the use of other ammo.\n\nThe lower bore axis is not supposed to be the solution to all the world''s problems.\n\nThanks again for a wonderful share.\n\n\nRegards.', ''),

Lolz!\n\n Now, is this gonna be a full 15 rounder, or should I do it off with a jab to the left and a single upper cut in round 2? Hahahahaha! You know tall men are very prone to a cut from below, hahahaha!\n\nAnyhow, jokes aside, I''ll spare my crucial weapon for another occasion, so let''s wink off from here and enjoy the shots by both outclass weapons from each segment.\n\nLet me just be brief with a couple of comments, however. I agree fully with Mitho bro that with SD CC weapons, you do compromise a bit of accuracy for the better concealment, carry ease. Rest is customization to the Safe Action trigger, which Ameer bro proved well in his second shoot.\n\nI''m also of the opinion (Don''t hang me up, but it''s just my feeling) that 12G bro managed talking Ameer bro into the 15 mtrs range, knowing well the CZ''s benefit here. Call it kind of "match fixing", hahahaha! Caracal as SD weapon and for break-in should have been used from 10 mtrs, ideally.\n\nLet me also just state that economy is not all when choosing a handgun. 12G bro is gradually moving more towards being an economist than a gunner when he feels that target prints and accuracy should be directly proportional to amount invested. There are other considerations involved when selecting a handgun. Hence, I deem the mention of Sarsilmaz Kilin, etc, by 12G bro as totally irrelevant here. I was merely passing on comments with respect to the Chinese ammo.\n\nAs for the lower bore axis, well, on the overall plane, it may contribute only to 5-10% less recoil, better accuracy, and nobody ever said it was cutting edge technology.\n\nFinally, let me just use the opportunity to please respected 12G bro, that I''ve always liked the CZ 999 as a rugged, tough, durable and wonderful weapon in the budget range, but have issues with it''s carry ease and bulk grip. Maybe if he preached a bit less about it being the worlds finest handgun and took off his excessive "rowdiness" in getting it involved in every fight and on every avenue, I might one day consider one for the glove box of my car, hahahaha!\n\n\n\nRegards.', ''),

Well today i went to range while keeping warm feelings and i was under the apprehension that may be it will refuse to make me smile but it went totally opposite i left range with a smile back to home. \n\nHere is the detail. \n\nShot 150 rounds zero FTF and FTE. No malfunction occurred during test. We Had two same TT''s one with compensator and other without it. The reason we wanted to take a keen look at the pressure release of TT with compensator or without compensator.\n\nAccording to my seniors and national gold medalist''s Mr Billal thanks to him for joining me today and Mr Irfan Who brutally shot single hand rapid fire with tt and showed us result of compensator. \n\nI would also like to thank Abbas bhai who contributed on our request to test this invention. \n\nWell according to me the recoil reduced to 30%  as i was holding it too light but i was amazed that according to my seniors, champions and our beloved Abbas bhai recoil is reduced more than 60% wow this is amazing recoil killer machine. :P .\n\nI am so happy it didn''t let me down at the range. The kick i used to feel while shooting with TT its all resolved now. It''s very smooth and pressure has started to release from upper points of the compensator. When you shoot it force TT to bend down and make you feel low recoil. I will post videos shortly so you can see the difference. \n\nUmer bhai we missed you at the range :)', ''),

Come on bro, your line of thought has become a bit too obvious by now, you seem to just need an excuse to vent something out.\n\nI wonder to ask the gentlemen at the range if they ever gave the Caracal a chance for a reloading with the same rounds for a second strike? How do we know if these two rounds from this crappy ammo wouldn''t misfire in any other handgun?\n\nOne cannot rule out anything, -or exceptional cases- but reliability by itself has never been any issue with Caracal.\n\n\nRegards.', ''),

Do a couple of more sessions as the one above, then proceed, that too for the 15 mtrs. 25 mtrs would be more of fun shooting, so far.\n\nAlso, nice suggestions for Ameer bro there.\n\nI''d just like to say, what I have been observing from dry-firing/dry-sighting lately, that the upward shots like those Ameer bro got from his initial session can be controlled by lowering your head in aiming position, so that right sided cheek-bone (for the right handed shooter) is kind of resting on your shooting arm just ahead of your shoulder. This is just like when using shotguns where head should ideally be lowered to max possible limits when aiming.\n\nIf you try to just aim with your head down to rest with your shooting arm and then subsequently lift your head just a bit up whilst still keeping the gun in the same position, you''ll find that you now have to move your arm with the gun correspondingly much up to be back on target! Now do this in reverse order again and you''ll find that you were aiming upwards with head lifted! It''s a simple exercise.\n\nI am not an experienced shooter, nor any lecturer. These were just my simple drawing-room observations. We usually shoot with head up, not resting on the front deltoids, and this - i[I]f I''m not very wrong, seniors would know better[/I] - would tend to make our shots hit on the upward scale of the target.\n\n\nRegards.', ''),

Do a couple of more sessions as the one above, then proceed, that too for the 15 mtrs. 25 mtrs would be more of fun shooting, so far.\n\nAlso, nice suggestions for Ameer bro there.\n\nI''d just like to say, what I have been observing from dry-firing/dry-sighting lately, that the upward shots like those Ameer bro got from his initial session can be controlled by lowering your head in aiming position, so that right sided cheek-bone (for the right handed shooter) is kind of resting on your shooting arm just ahead of your shoulder. This is just like when using shotguns where head should ideally be lowered to max possible limits when aiming.\n\nIf you try to just aim with your head down to rest with your shooting arm and then subsequently lift your head just a bit up whilst still keeping the gun in the same position, you''ll find that you now have to move your arm with the gun correspondingly much up to be back on target! Now do this in reverse order again and you''ll find that you were aiming upwards with head lifted! It''s a simple exercise.\n\nI am not an experienced shooter, nor any lecturer. These were just my simple drawing-room observations. We usually shoot with head up, not resting on the front deltoids, and this - i[I]f I''m not very wrong, seniors would know better[/I] - would tend to make our shots hit on the upward scale of the target.\n\n\nRegards.[/QUOTE]\n\nDear AK bro, this post of urs is really confusing to me.

Even there are variations in 226. The German one and the US one, a second hand German 226 sells for nearly twice as much as a new 226 made in the US, these are two different guns from the inside. The Tac Ops is US made but being a 226 it is good.\n\nThe 250 is a DA only polymer gun and failed several trials in the US. A Rami beats the 250 and the 229 hands down.\nThe 228 is a great gun but the 229 is again a lemon.\nIt is a very lengthy discussion to discuss the how and why some are not so good or poor and some excellent.\n\nThe pride of my 9 mms is the Sig X6 made in Germany. The manufacturing process, the machining , extractors \nthe slides and magazines are all totally different; unknown to the unsuspecting. German made Sigs are hard to get and expansive; these are much more accurate, reliable and last a life time. The US made ones have slides made of sheet metal stampings where as the German ones are forged and the parts made by CNC lathes, the US ones have the parts shrunk fit and then brazed and held in place with a pin which needs to be replaced every 5000 rounds. The German Sigs extractor is hidden inside the slide and can be hand removed or adjusted (experts only please), the German Sig has a controlled feed and will never slip over a case rim.\nWell hope I gave you some of the differences.', ''),

I was basically trying to say the same, just couldn''t figure out how to explain it: Head against shoulder, or shoulder against head, whatever, but my point was that there should be a "contact" here. You further reinforced the whole move with the "[B]locking[/B] of the[I] kisser [/I]there", lol! Thanks.\n\nAs I wrote, these were just some drawing room observations of mine, I''m still a novice practically.\n\nI wrote this because I''ve observed many shooters do not keep the head and shoulder close to each other, or ''locked" as you stated. I''m of the impression that this disturbs one''s line of sight and gives tendency for aberrations of placements, possibly more towards the upward scale, when the head is off and above shoulder, or shoulder is not pushed up against the head. Yet you should be the better one to analyze this.\n\nBtw, loved your tone, reminds me of my football coach long back, when he was trying to explain me the rule of "off-side" in soccer. He kept saying: "[I]You don''t lure the defenders and receive a pass behind their back, but you take the pass and [B]run[/B] past them[/I]", lolz!\n\nAnd you know what, I got a month or so left over here, before I start roaming the greener pastures. Would love to see you over here again and we''d spend less time on the sofa for this time, more in the field, if you''d please, lolz! I need and would appreciate some basics from you.\n\n[B]@Mian Jee/TH.[/B]..............Lolz! Now you just gave me a perfect idea, this would be the next "command" my dog needs to learn: "Carry my gun". lolz!\n\n\nRegards.', ''),

IMHO if one wants to learn then the cheapest ammo and sub 50k gun is more than enough.. make it an escape goat to learn about the different things and do drills continuously. and if possible buy a good competition grade gun and use good ammo in it.

But anyways both shooting is from today at PNS Khi from 15m. 25 rounds of chinese ammo from CZ999 and 20 rounds of Russian from HK. Four rounds from HK were wash because this weapon has a LEM SA/DA trigger which one has to get used to in the begining.  I specially took pic of HK barral from inside. This is one reason it is so expensive worldwide. It is different from all weapons glocks, sigs etc.  But guys seriously i was very very impressed by the CZ999.

Baikal MP153, Hatsan Escort, Beretta A303 (used/gd condition), Lanber semiauto would be good options to look for in market in that budget. Fakhre Alam Lahore was selling a Lanber semi few months bk for Rs100K. But Marroccchi (over under, Italian make only) if available at the prices above, should be the best option. I called Marrocchi''s dealer (Buksh Elahi Lahore) and they didn''t have any...said all stock sold to dealers at wholesale rates. Probably you would see those guns appearing in market after sometime at the start of next hunting season at higher rates.

I for one, would like to see front cocking serrations (for cosmetic appearance only) and removable back-straps/back grip panels to accommodate different grip sizes.\n\nRegards.[/QUOTE]\n\nsir i agree with you too. I would also like to see a bigger slide stop/release lever, as one on these are very small. I don''t think removable back-strap/ grips are needed as the grip is very comfortable and one can always use huge rubber grips or other add on grips to suite their hand size.', ''),

(427528, 'Marsh Duck Shooting I started duck shooting at a place called Sattoki (off Lalliani canal, Kasur road Lahore) back in 76/77. it was a large lake 4 to 10 feet deep bordered on one side by village Sattoki and on the other side by a sprawling marsh fringed with rice fields towards canal end. Methodology for the morning shoot was for the gunners to line up at the border of marsh and the lake, and intercept ducks flying over from the marsh after night feeding to the lake side for day''s rest. Later on everyone got dispersed to their respective favourite spots with their bunch of decoys and then serious gunning would ensue till 11 or 12. Most of the shots taken were between 15 to 25 yards, and my limited supply of 8s and 6s exacted a very heavy toll on unsuspecting birds at point blank range. We were so selective at that time to have avoided shooting Shovellers and Pochards while concentrating on Pintails, Mallards, Widgeons and the like. Later on we shifted to Islamabad and I bid farewell to the marshes around Lahore and Chunian after 10 years of duck hunting. Now came a switch to river shooting with its newer requirements and techniques, even though I keep visiting marshes of Mianwali etc for ducks driven over "Rassi" or rope. Notwithstanding the very successful shoots in this newer form of shooting for which now i am fully geared including trailers, boats, OBMs, rafts of decoys etc, but still sometime pangs of remorse on an almost forgotten art of marsh shooting over decoys surfaces and I wish to try out the form of hunting  I grew up on once again. the only regret is ......its not there anymore.

(427549, ' Yes this situation is almost with everyone. I learned and started duck shooting with my father (May Allah bless his soul with peace ) in late seventies. We used to shoot selected ducks over marshes, rotten paddy fields and saims in district Gujrat, Jehlum and Sialkot. There was no concept of shooting over river beds except few people who had a technique of "TULA". Whereby the experts floats in the river streams hiding them behind the rubber tube well cammo with marshes and grass. I witnessed an old shikari who retrieved 32 mallards in two shots from a double. But this technique never fascinated our team. I remember when we arranged mallard decoys from Germany in early eighties, lot of shooters were unaware about these devices. We started using these devices along with duck calls in the marshes and the results were unbelievable. Had we conceived the idea of duck shooting over river beds during those days? this would have been fantastic as the duck migration was at least 10 times better than the recent days.\nNow everything is gone. The main reason is the major decline of water flow in the rivers, availablity of guns to everyone and building of Nallas in the marshes and saims for the cultivation. Now i am looking green fields even the houses on many places where we used to shoot mallards and pintails.\nThese are memories of good days which could never be fainted and we will continue to share this with our next generation.', ''),

Interesting documentation handed in there by TH bro! \n\nHence, this should explain why Caracal trigger is felt much crispier than Glock''s by those who have used both, never mind the bit of movement in the Caracal, it''s the end result that counts, the better feel of letting off.\n\nAnyhow, to draw some lines, I hope my bros here won''t mind some realistic assessment, now that the inevitable has already happened in the preceding posts, the comparison again between the two cousins, Glock and Caracal.\n\nI am of the opinion that whilst Caracal and Caracal users don''t have any inferiority complex vis a vis Glock and Glock users, the latter for sure seems to have a "superiority complex" vis a vis the former. This- [I]in my humble opinion[/I] - due to a [I]psychological effect[/I] of over-priced Glock acquisitions here in our country.\n\n[COLOR=#0000cd]It is quite natural to believe as a purchaser, that when one has paid a high price to avail any particular item, one has availed something precious in the hands, the quality of which is kind of "directly proportional" to the amount invested.

Not so, when you select between two $500 handguns.[/COLOR]\n\n[COLOR=#ff0000][B]I''m therefore of the conclusion that one must seek to get out of this "placebo effect" to kill the superiority complex in order to evaluate anything else than Glock objectively.\n\nWhilst it is perfectly ok to take pride in a 350k handgun as piece of collection, the question rather is, should we downplay equivalents reasonably or with defensive prejudice? After all, the entire success story did not start with the present Gen 4, but rather long back with the Gen 1.[/B]\n\n[/COLOR][COLOR=#0000cd][B]Moreover, one must keep in mind also, that the Caracal is a 20% deal actually, when comparing it to it''s closest, genetic counterparts. \n[/B][/COLOR]\nFinally, let me say- with all due respects, course- that, as far as Pakistan is concerned, and if Caracal handguns popularity and supply lines keep a consistent level as of now, you''ll find gradually that Caracal market share has quite a terrain to gain here, Glock the same to forfeit, less the die-harders.\n\nThis is a positive development for our gunners and one must have an open mind for it, there has been too much of plunder since too long by now.\n\n[COLOR=#ff0000][B]My post is a purely objective assessment and should not be felt as anything else.

And you''re welcome to disagree.\n\n[/B][/COLOR]\n\nRegards.[/QUOTE]\n \n\nAllah O Ghani yeh jeenay marnay kee muhazab majboori ;) can complete this verse if you are interested AK bro ;)\n\nThanks TH bro for the video, never knew Caracal has a complete block housed in the slide unlike Glock & has UNIQUE lateral (horizontal) firing pin safety unlike any other pistol in this world; good for Caracal not my cup of tea for at least next 5 years ;) can discuss this issue technically at length but no one seem to listen or argue technical aspects so lets sing together... long live the Caracal ;)\n\nI am clear now on why Caracal trigger feel more like a double action revolver trigger; its his horizontal bitchy steel return spring striker safety that has to be wrestle around to push aside.\n\nBut I still am waiting to hear something technically explained on slide wobble/rattle/shake/tremble issue.', ''),

(428055, ' Hello All\n\nSome more answers -\n1. Not sure what is meant by ''What place in UK?''\n2. UK Firearms Law is probably the most prohibitive in the world as you  (the individual) has to demonstrate ''good reason'' and evidence of  permission(s). The Police verify this as well as the suitability of ''the  land'' for the calibre of rifle(s). Even if this is in order  ''conditions'' are placed on the Firearmsarms Certificate (FAC) which  limit what you can do - for example: ''said rifle can only be used for  shooting of foxes/deer/whatever on this land''. Each rifle needs its own  ''case''. The Government advice to Police Services stipulates which  calibres are suited for what - any departure requires a robust case.  Refusal of FAC application is appealed at the High  Court................Furthermore, any minor legal infringement is used  to take away the FAC and hence the firearms - seen as ''reducing  firearms''.\n3. Hunting so requires access to private land - either paid for or  through personal contact. Visitors can use an ''estate rifle'' but will  need to have this organised/paid for in advance. Your own rifle can be  brought in to the UK but will need additional paperwork/time/evidence of  booking from the person taking you out. You will need to demonstrate  ''competance and safety awareness'' with the firearm before anyone will  take you out (mandatory test with rifle on range).\n4. I also started many years ago with an air-rifle, before acquiring my FAC and first centrefire rifle.\n\nL', ''),

I bought my first rifle and shotgun the day I turned 18, and my first 1911 the day I turned 21.  Illinois has much more irritating laws than Indiana.\n\nA license is required to carry, but it''s $25 for 4 years or $120 for life, is accepted in 24? other states.  No training is required; we assume one is a rational adult.  Carry is open or concealed, "Any handgun legally possessed under 26" total length."  No license is needed to purchase, own, or carry in the vehicle''s cargo area, or locked in a case, or to transport to the range or store.  Minors under 18 must be supervised by an adult.\n\nWe still currently have (largely ignored) bans on switchblades and throwing stars, but we''re trying to make those laws go away.  I can carry anything from a pocket knife to a machete to a sword to hadnguns or rifles or stuff that makes some militaries envious.\n\nAnd thanks.  Actually, "Curiosity: Alien Invasion" was on Discovery UK in a longer format (2 hours as "When Aliens Attack") (There is also a National Geographic show with the same title.  They are not related), and my kids both acted in the show.  There are great closeups of both of them.  The US version is available on Youtube.

Please skip to the bottom if you want the verdict.\n\n\n[SIZE=200][COLOR=#0040FF]REVIEW – Daudsons Armory Semi Auto Shotgun[/COLOR][/SIZE]\n\n\n\n[size=150]\n\n\nDaudsons Armory is known for making low cost shotguns. Their Security and Shooter brand of pump action shotguns provide OK value for money despite their shortcomings of low quality finish. Up til now semi auto shotguns were missing from their line up conspicuously. Recently they introduced a semi auto model based on Winchester design salient features of which I would present to you.\n \n\n\n[B][SIZE=150]BASIC SPECS[/SIZE][/B]\n\n\nGauge: 12 Gauge\nType: Gas Operated  Semi auto\nBarrel : 26 In\nBarrel Material: 4140 Chrome-Moly Steel\nMag Capacity: 4+1\nChokes: 3 flush screw-in type chokes (IC, M, F)\nFurniture: Wood \nSafety location: Behind the trigger guard\nFinish: Barrel  blue, Receiver Powder coated\nSights: brass front bead\nSlug firing Capability: Supposedly Yes\nPrice: PKR 27,000 with single barrel and wood furniture (without hard carry case). With extra  barrel ( 21 or 28 in ), complete fiber furniture and hard carry case factory price rises to 34,200 PKR.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[B][SIZE=200][COLOR=#FF0000][I]REVIEW[/I][/COLOR][/SIZE][/B]\n\n\n[B][SIZE=150][COLOR=#800000]Packing:[/COLOR][/SIZE][/B]\n\n\nReviewed gun came in an elegant hard carry case. Its design is odd as it houses a assembled gun. Disassembled gun carry design would have reduced its size. Case is too big for easy storage. Case contained 03 chokes and its tool and a pistol grip which is not useful in my opinion with a 26 in barrel package. \n\n\n\n\n\n[IMG]http://i542.photobucket.com/albums/gg405/sqnldr_shariq/dsa/DSC02349.jpg[/IMG]\n\n\n\n\n[B][SIZE=150][COLOR=#800000]Finish, Looks and Quality of Manufacturing:[/COLOR][/SIZE][/B]\n\n\nGun looks good with wooden furniture, deep blued barrel and CNC machined receiver which is made  using imported bar stock aircraft grade aluminum alloy.  The bolt handle, bolt, cartridge elevator and trigger are finished in  chrome. The aluminum receiver is powder coated.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[IMG]http://i542.photobucket.com/albums/gg405/sqnldr_shariq/dsa/DSC02392.jpg[/IMG]\n\n\n[COLOR=#FF0000]Finish is good at some places but can be much better. Coating on receiver and barrel chips off very easily which is really annoying. These pics are of the specimen which is hardly 100 rounds used and boxed mostly but still coat has started to chip off. Similarly wood to metal fitting is poor at best and butt has developed a crack already  :angry-fire: [/COLOR]\n\n\nLook how coating is chipping off around trigger gaurd\n\n\n[IMG]http://i542.photobucket.com/albums/gg405/sqnldr_shariq/dsa/DSC02363.jpg[/IMG]\n\n\nA big chunk of coating has came off where bolt strikes receiver\n\n\n[IMG]http://i542.photobucket.com/albums/gg405/sqnldr_shariq/dsa/DSC02364.jpg[/IMG]\n\n\nNotice the crack in in the wood of stock.

Receiver is made of aircraft grade aluminum and CNC machined. Quality of machining is good but again coating can improve a lot. Bolt is also machined nicely with good chroming. Bolt sliding in receiver is smooth and speed is OK. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[B][SIZE=150][COLOR=#800000]Trigger:[/COLOR][/SIZE][/B]\n\n\nIt has a reasonably good trigger with minor creep. \n\n   \n\n\n[B][COLOR=#800000][SIZE=150]Stock & Fore end:[/SIZE][/COLOR][/B]\n\n\nStock and fore end are of OK quality walnut  . Wood checkering is of fine detail but its deforming quickly  :angry-fire: . Fit and mount is OK. Butt pad provided good cushion but doesn''t look much durable.\n\n\n[IMG]http://i542.photobucket.com/albums/gg405/sqnldr_shariq/dsa/DSC02360.jpg[/IMG]\n\n\n[IMG]http://i542.photobucket.com/albums/gg405/sqnldr_shariq/dsa/DSC02353.jpg[/IMG]\n\n\n\n\n[B][COLOR=#800000][SIZE=150]Safety Mechanism:[/SIZE][/COLOR][/B]    \n\n\nIt has a button safety located just behind the trigger. It locks the trigger and is convenient to operate while shooting / hunting. [COLOR=#FF0000]Unfortunately my guns safety button is malfunctioning and does not slide to safe position[/COLOR]. Talk about reliability  :angry-fire: . Not expected out of a DSA offering.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[B][COLOR=#800000][SIZE=150]Sights:[/SIZE][/COLOR][/B]    \n\n\nIt comes with routine brass bead front sights. Not good for low light conditions but adequate nonetheless.\n\n\n[IMG]http://i542.photobucket.com/albums/gg405/sqnldr_shariq/dsa/DSC02372.jpg[/IMG]\n\n\n\n\n[B][COLOR=#800000][SIZE=150]Magazine:[/SIZE][/COLOR][/B]    \n\n\nIt has a tubular magazine with a capacity of 4 shells (5 with one in the chamber). Don''t know of any extended Mag option.\n\n\n\n\n[COLOR=#800000][SIZE=150][B]Reliability:[/B][/SIZE][/COLOR]\n\n\nIn first 100 or so rounds fired  no issues came up. Firing pin strikes are deep, defined and consistent. Extraction is quite strong. Malfunction of safety switch has dented my confidence quite a bit. I have not tested game loads as yet so can''t comment on this aspect. \n    \n\n\n[COLOR=#800000][SIZE=150][B]Maintenance:[/B][/SIZE][/COLOR]\n    \nCompared to a Baikal, its a very complicated gun to disassemble and re assemble. Mag tube screw cannot be opened without a tool. \n\n\n[IMG]http://i542.photobucket.com/albums/gg405/sqnldr_shariq/dsa/DSC02397.jpg[/IMG]\n\n\n \n[SIZE=150][B][COLOR=#800000]Suitability for the Purpose[/COLOR]:[/B][/SIZE]\n\n\nIt is an OK gun for occasional hunt and clay shooting. I find it quite heavy and its not as balanced as an MP-153 IMO.  Its high weight and imbalance ( at least to me ) does not make it very suitable for hunting or clay shooting but its low price may make some to over look these factors.  \n     \n\n\n[B][COLOR=#FF0000][SIZE=150]Price and Value for Money[/SIZE][/COLOR][/B]\n\n\nPiece of S***.

Now magazine tube is no more attached to the receiver. When I move the bolt with bolt release button then barrel and mag tube just fly out and whole gun just disassembles  :angry-fire: \n\n\n[SIZE=150]It broke from the place where mag tube is threaded on the receiver.[/SIZE]\n\n\n[IMG]http://i542.photobucket.com/albums/gg405/sqnldr_shariq/dsa/DSC02384.jpg[/IMG]\n\n\n\n\nThis gun has hardly fired 100 rounds. Such a major failure this early is totally unacceptable.\nQuality of mag tube metal is poor. Looks downright flimsy. Threads on the other end are also in poor state. \nI am amazed how DSA quality control accepted such poor quality of a part which is under great stress. Mag end which failed is the only place which takes all the stress when bolt slams forward during firing.\nI am saddened when I say that this gun is not safe to fire till the time failed part is strengthened by DSA.\n\n\n[COLOR=#FF0000][SIZE=200]Update: Nov, 2011[/SIZE][/COLOR]\n\n\nAfter repair I shot down two kites with it and was happy with its performance. But then this happened!!!\n[IMG]http://i542.photobucket.com/albums/gg405/sqnldr_shariq/Snapbucket/2011-11-29214329.jpg[/IMG]\n[SIZE=150]\n\n\nI  had to cut the barrel  by two inches and have been using it since then.\n\n\n[COLOR=#FF0000]Another issue.[/COLOR][/SIZE]\nNow I am experiencing Failure To Feed occasionally. No matter how much I bolt it, Cart refuses to leave the mag tube then inexplicably it starts to feed again.  Missed the second wild dog due to this failure.\nI am glad I did not sell this gun to my colleague. Poor work by DSA.\n\n\n[SIZE=150]\n[COLOR=#FF0000]Another issue.[/COLOR][/SIZE]\nIn the last 45 to 50 rounds fired, during which I have shot many kites / dogs, I experienced two failure to fire   \nI was using shahine LG rounds. I was chasing a dog during both occasions and I had to clear the FTF and go for another shot. Could not find the ejected shell later so not sure whether carts had proper pin strike or not. BTW I have never experienced a FTFire in a Shahine Cart with a clear pin strike in years of use.\nI have thoroughly cleaned the gun and I hope problem does not duplicate.\n\n\n[SIZE=150]\n[COLOR=#FF0000]Another issue.[/COLOR][/SIZE]\nOne more problem to report!!!\nYou can see in the picture that metal just broke and it needs to be welded back. \nWhat a POS product.

Bro, I must insist that you should ask anyone of them if I had any monetary gain out these favors which were given purely as a friendly gesture.\r\n\r\nanother thing that I would like to clear is that "neither I am a dealer nor I ever intend to be". lets get this fact straight before moving on. may be you should reconsider the direction at which you are pointing your finger. Thank God I paid heed to PG seniors advice and stopped doing you and others further favors.\r\n\r\nBro. barrels are always the most weakest at the threads because there is not any meat left after cutting the threads. however the way it blew clearly shows excessive pressure build up. kindly allow me to refresh your memory that you told me that prior to firing your last cartridge you fired a weak round. usually such rounds leave wads stuck inside the barrel which act as barrel obstruction for the next cartridge causing catastrophic pressure levels.\r\n\r\nRegards.', ''),

As-Salaam-O-Alaikom Wa Rehmatullahi Wa Barakatuhu!\n\n\nStoeger Cougar, CZ 999, CZ Duty, CZ 75D Compact a.k.a CZ P01\n\nI have short-listed the above four firearms based on my research on this forum and others. Please help me select one of them to buy. My budget allows me to get the Stoeger Cougar and the CZ 999. But, I love the CZ 75D Compact and also CZ Duty. So, if you all suggest that I buy one of the latter two, I can increase my budget to buy one of them. \n\nIf the CZ 75D Compact was available easily and I did not have to go to Fakhr-e-Alam in Peshawar to buy it, then that would be the only option.\n\nThe CZ Duty is a polymer frame, and although I love its sexy looks, I would prefer to go for a metal frame weapon. It is only a personal preference. And also, it did not "completely" fit my hand when I held it at a gun shop. My last finger, or "pinky", was not comfortable with its grip.\n\nThe Stoeger Cougar is without doubt a very reliable weapon, but somehow, its rotating barrel is not very "comforting", because it is not conventional. I am one of the people who think that a weapon should be such that is based on conventional designs because they are tried and tested and have proven their worth. Stoeger Cougar has also proven its worth, but this is just a personal preference of wanting to go for conventional designs. By the way, I loved the grip of the Stoeger Cougar when I held it in my hands in a gun shop.\n\nThe CZ 999, Skorpion or not, I don''t know, is also a very trusted weapon as I read on this forum. Again, I do not like the feature on this pistol which allows me to switch from a revolver trigger mode to a semi-automatic pistol trigger mode, and vice versa, as I dont want "shashkay" in the firearm. This is because in the time of need, this option may hinder the functionality of my weapon, which is a NO NO. This again is why I like the conventional ways/designs in firearms. And clarify, if you please, what is the difference between the CZ 999 and the CZ 999 Skorpion and which one of these does NOT have the revolver to pistol or "R & P" option. I know this is not a firearm made by the company CZ based in Czech Republic, but by Zastava Arms, Sebia.\n\nPlease help me select one of these firearms based on your knowledge and expertise. And suggest a good IWB holster for the firearm you suggest, and its availability, also. My normal attire is kameez shalwar and I will be positioning my weapon at 9 o''clock, or on the left, positioned for a RIGHT-hand draw. This is the way I like it.\n\nP.S. This will be my first firearm.\n\nThanks in anticipation.\n\nAs-Salaam-O-Alaikom Wa Rehmatullahi Wa Barakatuhu!', ''),

(429107, ' [QUOTE=AzamAgha44;265810]I started duck shooting at a place called Sattoki (off Lalliani canal, Kasur road Lahore) back in 76/77. it was a large lake 4 to 10 feet deep bordered on one side by village Sattoki and on the other side by a sprawling marsh fringed with rice fields towards canal end. Methodology for the morning shoot was for the gunners to line up at the border of marsh and the lake, and intercept ducks flying over from the marsh after night feeding to the lake side for day''s rest. Later on everyone got dispersed to their respective favourite spots with their bunch of decoys and then serious gunning would ensue till 11 or 12. Most of the shots taken were between 15 to 25 yards, and my limited supply of 8s and 6s exacted a very heavy toll on unsuspecting birds at point blank range. We were so selective at that time to have avoided shooting Shovellers and Pochards while concentrating on Pintails, Mallards, Widgeons and the like. Later on we shifted to Islamabad and I bid farewell to the marshes around Lahore and Chunian after 10 years of duck hunting. Now came a switch to river shooting with its newer requirements and techniques, even though I keep visiting marshes of Mianwali etc for ducks driven over "Rassi" or rope. Notwithstanding the very successful shoots in this newer form of shooting for which now i am fully geared including trailers, boats, OBMs, rafts of decoys etc, but still sometime pangs of remorse on an almost forgotten art of marsh shooting over decoys surfaces and I wish to try out the form of hunting I grew up on once again. the only regret is ......its not there anymore.

If laborers can''t have corn knives, it would cause all kinds of problems.\n\nSome cities (like Chicago) have ridiculous laws.  They ban almost all martial arts weapons and require "registration" of knives, except they use the same requirements as guns*.  However, since the federal laws on guns are not set up for knives, they can''t record things like "serial number" or "caliber."  The law is largely ignored--there are full page ads in their phone book for all of that stuff, even though it''s illegal to sell in city limits.  A worker may use his job as "affirmative defense" (meaning he''d still be arrested, but could tell the judge) for a pocket knife. Technically, in Chicago, it''s illegal to take a knife from the store to your car.  Of course, this has greatly reduced crime in Chicago.:doh: Well, not really.\n\n*The cities require registration.  The federal gov''t and 47?/50 states do not.\n\nMost knives imported from Pakistan are stated as "hunting knives" on the box, for both Customs payments, and to deal with stupid bureaucrats who don''t know what knives are.', '');

(429585, ' Salam All,\n@HellAngel - Hmmmmm I should get out more often and visit all the localities.  I just now came upon this thread - something that I overlook all the time until you mentioned Project.  Thats what caught my eye.\nFor starters Bravo, very very well done.  You have a knack for these types of things.\nNow, for some input I do hope you will NOT mind me stating as this project still CAN get even better.\n-Bushing comps - although very nice looking do NOT provide the full compensation recoil.  Reason being this: as the bullet enters the compensator - the gases follow.  As the bullet is crossing the compensator muzzle or EACH chamber there is a restriction baffle again to force the following gases to find another way out forcefully and that is via the vents.  In the muzzle bushing compensators there are less gasses being trapped as the muzzle hole of the comp is too large - it has to cycle over the barrel with the slide.  The recoil decrease which you are feeling is strictly the weight of the comp.. Also, had this comp been attached to the barrel - the slide would not have cycled as the lockup would have been weight biased... hence, many comps are now made from aluminum.  Furthermore, had this comp been designed to trap and divert gases properly you would have also needed a weaker set of recoil springs as required for proper cycling of slide.  See the attached pics below.\n\nThe multi chamber comp below is from Carver Comps, its aluminum for light wight, and gives very good compensation per chamber(s), hence it requires a 9lbs recoil spring as compared to the standard 16lbs recoil spring.\n[IMG]http://i1109.photobucket.com/albums/h427/pyramids99/1-7.jpg[/IMG]\n[IMG]http://i1109.photobucket.com/albums/h427/pyramids99/9-2.jpg[/IMG]\n[IMG]http://i1109.photobucket.com/albums/h427/pyramids99/8-1.jpg[/IMG]\n\nThis is my reverse engineered multi chamber comp for the TS, its all steel.  It too required me to retire the stock TS recoil spring and use something weaker.\n[IMG]http://i1109.photobucket.com/albums/h427/pyramids99/2-6.jpg[/IMG]\n[IMG]http://i1109.photobucket.com/albums/h427/pyramids99/6-2.jpg[/IMG]\n\nThis is a multi chamber comp, this is part steel and part aluminum.  This is the only comp anomaly I have seen as it mounts to the frame and the barrel slides in upon lockup into the comp.. It does NOT require any alteration to the gun(s); hence very efficient to move it around from gun to gun specifically Beretta 92 (without rails)\n[IMG]http://i1109.photobucket.com/albums/h427/pyramids99/4-2.jpg[/IMG]\n[IMG]http://i1109.photobucket.com/albums/h427/pyramids99/3-6.jpg[/IMG]\n\nNow having said all this we can move on to the grip.  There needs to be a recess cut where the trigger guard ends and the grip begins.  This is a critical area as it allows the hands to come up higher.  See how much you can shave off there.  Then let me know I will send you something to put on the front and rear grip strap which will make this gun want to stay in your hands and never slip.\n\nLast but not least - This is a GREAT Project Path you are on. Forget the Benson Dabbi - I myself have quit smoking (as you get older as a smoker your hands shake more). Plan on the khuwari. But remember the results that will await you in the end are going to be even more mindbogling.\n\nSoooo here are my "two bits" - I do hope I was clear in the concepts somewhat. Feel free to contact me if you like at [EMAIL="paradigms67@hotmail.com"]paradigms67@hotmail.com[/EMAIL].\n\nP.S.  Lolz, The TS is no longer called that anymore... Its now known as ANUBIS...

(429444, 'A few shameless Jackasses Salams,\n\nJust to inform you brothers there are a handful of shameless jackasses from Karachi who were banned from our forums for defrauding members by gaining their trust and then charging them an arm and a leg for items that were worth half of what they were selling them for. \n\nAs a courtesy we gave them a respectable way out by asking them to leave without banning them, when they did not, we still out of respect changed their passwords, only when their selfish and self serving activities continued off the forum and they started to get illegal did we add ban status to them.\n\nI have ignored their idiotic (read Begairat) stance of joining our forum again and again under different nicks to try to sell our brothers here over priced stuff via email. We have banned atleast 15 clones combined. They being utterly shameless don''t get that [B]anyone banned once is banned permanently[/B] regardless of how many nicks with which he joins. \n\nNow I have had enough, if that''s the way you want to play it then fine.\n\nIf the shameless member in question joins again then, we will report the following to the authorities:\n\n1). Details of how firearms are being transported from Peshawar to Karachi.\n2). Buying weapons for business on a armed officers licence.\n3). Making fake (copied) armed officers licences.\n4). Selling weapons by treating armed officers licence as a Firearms dealer licence. \n5). Details of the "investors" behind this person. Including phone numbers, web addresses and home addresses of all. \n6). Selling of Military issued ammo to public.\n7). Offering to sell unlicensed automatic weapons to anyone in Karachi. (This offence alone is tried by anti terrorist court).\n8). Private persons selling fake (reloaded) ammo and without licence. \n\nI am pissed off at a lot of things this bunch of miscreants has done  in the past two/three years. I have always remained quiet and respectful. This is my [B]only and last and final warning[/B] to you. One more screwup on our forums and we will make that phonecall.\n\nThink about it.\n\n[B]@All Brothers/Members on the forums.[/B] \n\nThe above warning is meant only for a handful of people who have been long banned from our forums. Normally I am never strict and quite easy going but when I hear someone even remotely connected to PakGuns is doing something illegal I lose my cool and do all I can to stop it. The very [B]REASON [/B]this forum exists is to promote "[B]LEGAL, SAFE AND EDUCATED USE OF FIREARMS[/B]" . Anything which does not fall in that description does not belong here and we have nothing to do with it. \n\nAlso I have repeatedly requested all [B]NOT [/B]to purchase anything from anyone at PakGuns unless the ad is posted at our GrandBazzar section. The reason for this is for everyone''s safety and to ensure that no illegal/unlicensed weapon is ever sold via PakGuns or any of it''s reference. Also some dealers join as members and try to pickup ''customers'' from our forum by giving their email address or asking to for theirs. This is wrong and we have/want no part of it. \n\nPrices and every deal [B]MUST[/B] be open and on the forum for [B]ALL[/B] to read. There has never been anything hidden about PakGuns or it''s member''s dealing. If someone offers to sell you something over email, don''t buy.

(627736, ' [QUOTE=common man;464737]On Friday 31 November 2014 i went to Chief Commissioner Office G11 Islamabad. Had a detailed discussion with the officer dealing the arms license and carry permits. I asked for the procedure of obtaining carry permit. He asked do u have any life threat. I said no. He asked do you have any FIR registered of an attack on your life. I said no. He said then there is a no permit for you. I asked that i need to carry my NPB weapon for security reasons and current law and order situation. He said that you do not need any permit for carrying NPB in concealed manner whether on person or in car. Permit are only issued for Display of weapon. All pakistan permits are issued from MOI and provincial are issued by respective DC office.\n\n\nI inquired about carrying NPB while 144 is imposed. He said if the 144 notification states that Carrying is banned then you cannot carry, otherwise you can carry in concealed manner. In 144 general notification, permits for displayed carrying are suspended. In short he said carrying of NPB weapon is allowed in concealed manner only. For display/brandishing of weapon, permits are issued. And currently none are being issued from MOI and DC office.\n\n\nI asked for the policy document if any. He said MOI has it.Now I am planning to visit MOI for the most wanted policy document so that we all can know the policy for the firearms handling lawfully.\n\n\nSecondly I was travelling in Islamabad two days back, near Serena, with 2 of my friends in my mehran when i was stopped at checkpost. The police constable asked us to step out. Which i did. He did a body search, before he could feel the weapon on me , i told him that i have a weapon. He asked me to show. I took it out, said that i will unload it , unloaded it and handed over to him. just the gun. He had a deep look to it. Asked me to show the license. which i did. he matched the number. He asked about the number of rounds i am carrying. i said 15, he asked for the magazine, which i handed over to him. He felt the weight of the magazine. and handed over the gun and magazine to me and started examining the license. Meanwhile i loaded the gun in front of him and holstered it. He returned the license to me. I smiled and said thank you to him sat back in car and left. Rangers were also present on that checkpost.\n\n\nthought of sharing this incident with you all.[/QUOTE]\n\nThanks for share this', ''),

Ch., brother I think you are mistaken with spotted dove which we see around on thorny bushes and trees. Apart from the size there is also a big difference in the look. Spotted doves carries dark brown and black spots on its back whereas in case of oriental turtle dove there are brown and grey half circles. As far as the speed of the oriental turtle dove is concerned it depends upon the envoirnment where they fly. In case of landing on medium high trees they comes low in a moderate speed however in case of tall trees and passing birds the speed is compatible or little more than the ordinary doves.', ''),

The 90/10 Principle Click to advance\n2. Author: Stephen Covey Discover the 90/10 Principle It will change your life (or at least, the way you react to situations)\n3. What is this Principle? 10% of life is made up of what happens to  you. &#8230; 90% of life is decided by how you react&#8230; & how you react is  YOUR decision\n4. What does this mean? We really have NO control over 10% of what happens to us.\n5. We cannot stop the car from breaking down. The plane will be late  arriving, which throws our whole schedule off. A driver may cut us off  in the traffic.\n6. We have NO control over this 10%. The other 90% is different. You determine the other 90%. How?... By your reaction.\n7. You cannot control a red light. However, you can control your  reaction. YOU can control and decide how you react. Let us use an  example&#8230;\n8. You are having breakfast with your family. Your daughter knocks over a  cup of coffee Onto your business shirt. You have no control over what  has just happened. What happens next will be determined by how you  react.\n9. You curse. You harshly scold your daughter for knocking the cup over.  She breaks down in tears. After scolding her, you turn to your wife and  you criticize her for placing the cup too close to the edge of the  table. A short verbal battle follows. You storm upstairs and change your  shirt. Back downstairs, you find your daughter has been too busy crying  to finish her breakfast and getting ready to go to school. She misses  the bus.\n10. Your spouse must leave immediately for work. You rush to the car and  drive your daughter to school. Because you are late, you drive 40 miles  per hour in a 30 mph speed limit zone.\n11. After a 15-minute delay and throwing $60.00 traffic fine away, you  arrive at school. Your daughter runs into the building without saying  goodbye. After arriving at the office 20 minute late, You realize you  forgot your briefcase. Your day has started terrible. As it continues,  it seems to get worse and worse. You look forward to coming home.\n12. When you arrive home, you find a small wedge in your relationship  with your wife and daughter. Why? Because of how you reacted in the  morning . Why did you have a bad day?\n13. A) Did the coffee cause it? B) Did your daughter cause it? C) Did  the policeman cause it? D) Did you cause it? The answer is &#8220;D&#8221;\n14. You had no control over what happened with the coffee. How you  reacted in those 5 seconds is what caused your bad day. Here is what  could have and should have happened.\n15. Coffe splashes over you. Your daughter is about to cry. You gently  say: &#8220; It&#8217;s okay, honey, you just need to be More careful next time.&#8221;  Grabbing a towel you go upstairs and change your shirt. You grab your  briefcase, and you come back down in time to look through the window and  see your child getting on the bus. She turns and waves. You arrive 5  minutes early a cheerfully greet the staff. Notice the difference?\n16. Two different scenarios. Both started the same. Both ended  different. Why? Because of how you reacted . You really have no control  over 10% of what happens in your life. The other 90% was determined by  your reaction.\n17. Here are some ways to apply the 90/10 Principle. If someone says  something negative about you, do not be a sponge. Let the attack roll  off like water on glass. You do not have to let the negative comments  affect you. React properly and it will not ruin your day. A wrong  reaction could result in losing a friend, being fired, or getting  stressed out.\n18. How do you react if someone cuts you off in the traffic? Do you lose  your temper? Pound on the steering wheel? (a friend of mine had the  steering wheel fall off) , Do you curse? Does your blood pressure  skyrocket? Who cares if you arrive 10 seconds later at work? Why give  someone else the power to ruin your drive?\n19. When you decide how you react, you decide whether the the issue is  worth undertaking the stress. Just the fact that you control the  situation and its not a forced situation will enhance your positive  energy exponentially Millions of people are suffering from undeserved  stress, trials, problems and headaches. We all must understand and apply  the 90/10 Principle. It can change your life! &#8230; Enjoy it... It only  takes willpower to give ourselves permission to make the experience.\n20.

(430159, ' [QUOTE=Moeen;267865]Salam All,\n@HellAngel - Hmmmmm I should get out more often and visit all the localities.  I just now came upon this thread - something that I overlook all the time until you mentioned Project.  Thats what caught my eye.\nFor starters Bravo, very very well done.  You have a knack for these types of things.\nNow, for some input I do hope you will NOT mind me stating as this project still CAN get even better.\n-Bushing comps - although very nice looking do NOT provide the full compensation recoil.  Reason being this: as the bullet enters the compensator - the gases follow.  As the bullet is crossing the compensator muzzle or EACH chamber there is a restriction baffle again to force the following gases to find another way out forcefully and that is via the vents.  In the muzzle bushing compensators there are less gasses being trapped as the muzzle hole of the comp is too large - it has to cycle over the barrel with the slide.  The recoil decrease which you are feeling is strictly the weight of the comp.. Also, had this comp been attached to the barrel - the slide would not have cycled as the lockup would have been weight biased... hence, many comps are now made from aluminum.  Furthermore, had this comp been designed to trap and divert gases properly you would have also needed a weaker set of recoil springs as required for proper cycling of slide.  See the attached pics below.\n\nThe multi chamber comp below is from Carver Comps, its aluminum for light wight, and gives very good compensation per chamber(s), hence it requires a 9lbs recoil spring as compared to the standard 16lbs recoil spring.\n[IMG]http://i1109.photobucket.com/albums/h427/pyramids99/1-7.jpg[/IMG]\n[IMG]http://i1109.photobucket.com/albums/h427/pyramids99/9-2.jpg[/IMG]\n[IMG]http://i1109.photobucket.com/albums/h427/pyramids99/8-1.jpg[/IMG]\n\nThis is my reverse engineered multi chamber comp for the TS, its all steel.  It too required me to retire the stock TS recoil spring and use something weaker.\n[IMG]http://i1109.photobucket.com/albums/h427/pyramids99/2-6.jpg[/IMG]\n[IMG]http://i1109.photobucket.com/albums/h427/pyramids99/6-2.jpg[/IMG]\n\nThis is a multi chamber comp, this is part steel and part aluminum.  This is the only comp anomaly I have seen as it mounts to the frame and the barrel slides in upon lockup into the comp.. It does NOT require any alteration to the gun(s); hence very efficient to move it around from gun to gun specifically Beretta 92 (without rails)\n[IMG]http://i1109.photobucket.com/albums/h427/pyramids99/4-2.jpg[/IMG]\n[IMG]http://i1109.photobucket.com/albums/h427/pyramids99/3-6.jpg[/IMG]\n\nNow having said all this we can move on to the grip.  There needs to be a recess cut where the trigger guard ends and the grip begins.  This is a critical area as it allows the hands to come up higher.  See how much you can shave off there.  Then let me know I will send you something to put on the front and rear grip strap which will make this gun want to stay in your hands and never slip.\n\nLast but not least - This is a GREAT Project Path you are on. Forget the Benson Dabbi - I myself have quit smoking (as you get older as a smoker your hands shake more). Plan on the khuwari. But remember the results that will await you in the end are going to be even more mindbogling.\n\nSoooo here are my "two bits" - I do hope I was clear in the concepts somewhat. Feel free to contact me if you like at [EMAIL="paradigms67@hotmail.com"]paradigms67@hotmail.com[/EMAIL].\n\nP.S.  Lolz, The TS is no longer called that anymore... Its now known as ANUBIS... All hail ANUBIS!  Lolz.[/QUOTE]\n\nAslamualikum Moeen Bro, \n\nThis is an absolutely great information you leaked from your extraordinary experience. I really appreciate you for being here in this thread. \nWell Moeen bro i was really impressed by your evolution project and wanted to conquer some place in this field. I like .30 Caliber and its magnum like power. I had a same vision in mind which you explained for trapping gasses more but i did not get tools and apparatus for the compensator you shared. As my current compensator is hand made. \n\nI have some pending things to work on. 1= 1.5 " long barrel which i can get it threaded from the front but how and where i don''t know :P. 2= Long Guide rod so it can be fitted in Compensator. 3= Recoil spring. etc etc. Then ready a new compensator like yours :). Lets see if i get lucky enough to avail these tools and accessories. I hope it would be definitely mind blowing for TT.\n\nThanks Moeen Bro please let me know if long guide rod helps to break recoil i want to make sure i am not wrong. \nAnd i will send you an email if any help needed :) thanks for your help', ''),

(430620, 'Cell Phone Snatching The incidents of cell phone snatching at gunpoint are increasing day by day. An average of 70 to 80 cell phones are snatched and stolen in a day in Karachi alone. In most cases the perpetrators kill their victim on resistance. In many cases the perpetrator while snatching the cell phone also snatch cash and other valuables from their victims. News of cell phone snatching at gunpoint and killing the victim on resistance is now published in the newspapers almost daily. The main reason of cell phone snatching is that it can be sold in the black market little less than its cost in the open market, which ranges from Rs 1000 to Rs 100,000 depending upon its quality. Moreover it is such a small item that once snatched or stolen it can be carried by the snatcher or thief undetected. Therefore cellophanes have become an attractive item for the criminals.\n\nCell phone can be snatched from any person, anywhere and at any time where the snatcher is sure of his success and has a safe passage to escape. The people most vulnerable to cell phone snatching are those who travel alone in car, motorbike riders and pedestrians on the streets or in the busy markets. People generally don&#8217;t dare to resist with the cell phone snatcher for fear of being killed by him and give up easily. This goes in favour of the snatchers as such the crime of cell phone snatching is spreading rapidly. So far the police have not been able to prevent this crime, which is their primary responsibility. Similarly the government has also not paid any attention to this menace. The citizens have therefore started feeling insecure while carrying their cell phone.\n\nThese cell phone snatchers fall into three categories: Firstly the professional criminals who are either involved in illegal cell phone business for themselves or working for some terrorists/underground political organization as their paid agent. Secondly the opportunist criminals who may either be unemployed youths or students of school/colleges who have indulged in bad society and need money. Thirdly the drug addicts who are always in search for making the money by any unfair means. \n\nThough cell phone snatching has become inevitable but its impact on the victim can be reduced by taking certain precautions. \n\n1) Do not carry an expensive cell phone so that if at all it is snatched the loss of money spent on it will be less.\n\n2) Always carry your cell phone in a way that it is not visible to the people and put it on vibration instead of bell or buzzer so that it does not indicate presence of cell phone with you.\n\n3) Avoid attending calls on your cell phone if you are passing through or in an area suspected to be unsafe. You can however respond to the caller once you are out of that area.\n\n4) Avoid using your cell phone while traveling in the car and always keep the doors of your car locked and windows rolled up. You are most vulnerable to cell phone snatchers and robbers while stopped at an intersection.\n\n5)Do not carry more cash than it is necessary. Keep between Rs 500 to Rs 1000 in your purse and rest should be carried hidden with you in some other way so that if your purse is also snatched the entire money is not taken away.\n\n6) Do not carry more than one credit card in your purse. Keep remaining credit cards, ATM cards including their pin codes, your NIC and driving licence separately hidden with you in some way.\n\n7) If you are confronted with a cell phone snatcher/criminal remain calm and try to look confident. Do not quarrel or try to resist and let him take what he wants from you, but do not volunteer to give him anything.\n\n8) If your cell phone is snatched inform immediately the company which provided the connection to your cell phone to block the SIM and lodge an FIR with the nearest police station. Remember you can be caught and prosecuted if the police intercept conversation by a terrorist or criminal on your cell phone number.\n\nLastly the police in plain clothes should start the campaign of hunt down the cell phone snatchers in the guise of an ordinary citizen. A reward for the police personnel for catching a cell phone snatcher may also be announced by the police highups. This will prove as a great deterrence for cell phone snatchers as well as other street criminals.\n\nThe above precautions suggested can reduce the risks of cell phone snatching, save the life and minimize the loss.', ''),

(430847, ' under sections 96 to 100 of the Pakistan Penal Code (PPC) which concerns the right to defend himself when attacked. However, out of these the most concerned sections are 96 to 97 of the PPC. I like to explain these sections for the general information of the readers. Section-96 (PPC) declares, &#8220;That nothing is an offence which is done in the exercise of the right of private defence. The reason for this is that the law does not require a citizen, however, law-abiding he may be, to behave like a rank coward on any occasion. So, if a man is attacked he need not run away; he would be perfectly justified in the eyes of the law if he holds his ground and delivers a counter attack on his assailant provided always that the injury which he inflicts in self defence is not out of proportion to the injury with which he was threatened&#8221;. \n\nSimilarly, section-97 (PPC) is regarding the right private defence of the body and property. \n\n(I quote) \n\n&#8220;Every person has a right, subject to the restrictions contained in section-99 (PPC) to defend: - First: His own body, and the body of any other person against any offence affecting the human body; secondly; The property, whether movable or immovable, of himself or of any other person, against any act which is an offence failing under the definition of theft, robbery, mischief or criminal trespass or which in an attempt to commit theft, robbery, mischief or criminal trespass&#8221;.', ''),

My friend’s friend felt pity and gave his cellphone to the person. The stranger went a few paces away and made a call. He came back, thanked and returned the cellphone.\r\n\r\nThe same evening the Islamabad police arrested the owner of the cellphone. It was later revealed that the stranger had made a call, asking for ransom for the release of a person he had abducted.\r\n\r\nThe friend of my friend is an industrialist and well-placed in the higher circles of Islamabad. He remained in the lock-up for a fortnight and has now been released on bail.\r\n\r\nI would advise my countrymen to remain vigilant for their own safety and not to let anyone have access to their cellphones. In case of cellphone snatching or if the cellphone is lost, immediately lodge an FIR with the police as it can be misused by\r\ncriminal(s) or terrorist(s) for nefarious activities.\r\n\r\nIf a call made from the snatched or lost cellphone by criminals is intercepted by intelligence agencies or the police, the name and address of the owner of cellphone can easily be traced through SIM.

If you have chance dont hesitate to practice toothi ! \n\nBut the problem is not the bad guys believe me. Including me most of the common people with not much long and tough sources, hesitate of police more then the bad guys. Because if the bad guys overpowered you or killed you you will be history and your case will be food to cockroaches. But if you kill them the police in most of the cases do not believe you and put on you cases which you never heard.  [b] This is the general mindset and unfortunately the bitter truth[/b]. And specifically mobile snatching is concerned, if you resist there are only two ways and strictly no third option 1. CT kill T 2. T kill CT ! Shots will be on vital places from both sides in such close quarter combats if you get any kind of chance. \n\n@Rizshu\nHe was a Major sahab and not a riff-raff. Police cannot make false cases.

Someone was shown a loaded gun whatever the reason is, mobile snatching or playing chor sipahee, but the time you hold a gun on someone the reason is , [color=red]Give this to me or I kill you![/color]. now what, he is challenging to kill you, how do we it is justified he just wanted to take my property (mobile) and leave be unhurt ? Do law allows me to attack first before I am shot ? I heard from people, and discussed many times in this forum as well, [b] if the bad-guy is armed and attack/tries to attack then you should first shot him on the leg.

(431081, 'CZ-75 P07 Duty ... revelation of awesomeoness There is no need to review CZ Duty after Abbas bhai''s, Anthrax bro''s and TH78 bro''s detailed and expert reviews but just my two inexperienced cents about my new purchase.\n \n[B]The love that materialized [/B]\n \nWhen I was planning to buy my first handgun then CZ or any other such handgun was not even on the list. I was searching for 70K gun and had PT92, Baikal, Stoeger in my mind and my heart with Taurus PT 809. I did window shop the market couple of times and when I was finalizing between Baikal and Stoeger I had the opportunity at one shop to check out CZ Duty. The grip fitted in my hand just perfectly and the slim compact look was awesome. The guy was demanding 110K final so it was just a dream for me at that time. I went for stoeger and started managing my funds to buy it. Finally got the chance to buy it at 85K and I sold my Stoeger for 55k (bought for 58K) and purchased CZ-75 P07 Duty from Peshawar. And this time my love materialized. :)\n \n[B]The impressions without firing[/B]\n \n[B][I] In and out of the Box[/I][/B], It came with two standard magz of 16, some manuals stuff and a CD, a cleaning brush. That&#8217;s it.\n \n[B][I]Safety/Decocker[/I][/B] Its with a safety however t there is an option to change the safety with decocker and as per manual its quite easy to do, even user can do it without needing help of gunsmith etc. I am fine with safety bcuz manual "decocking" is not that science and therefore "decocker" is not required badly. Though I do quite fine with manual decocking with my dad''s tees bore and with empty CZ but today when I decocked it manually with a live round, hammer got slipped and hit the firing pin from more than halfcocked position. Didn''t fire the round.\n \n[B][I]Hammer[/I][/B] is not hard. Its easy to cock and decock.  \n \n[B][I]Grip[/I][/B] is awesome. It fits in my hand as if it is made for it. Serrations on the grip make it perfect for sweaty hands. It just doesn''t slip even when hands are raining sweat.\n \n[B][I]Slide[/I][/B] is not polymer and its not black either. Its kinda greyish black. As the slide and barrel is metal that&#8217;s why when mag is empty, the gun in hand drops forward bcuz of the weight of barrel and slide. But when mag is loaded with around 10 bullets then its balanced. When the slide is locked back then barrel does not appear to be steady straight. Its kinda tilted upwards from front side. Donno why is that.\n \n[B][I]Magzines[/I][/B] are easy to load. Loading Stoeger''s mag was quite hard. But CZ Duty''s were fine however couldn''t load the 16[SUP]th[/SUP], tried twice on both the magz and then left it for some other time. Mag drops free easily. You guys will be surprised to know that Sig P226''s mag fit in, load the bullet in chamber and extracts it perfectly.\n \n[B][I]Disassembly[/I][/B] takes time, atleast its kinda difficult than Stoeger. It cud have been quite better. Guiding rod is plastic and spring is just pain in ass. It took me half an hour and still cudn''t put it back. I thought I am one big jerk to buy a handgun and can''t assemble it. Opened youtube and found everyone complaining about the spring, relieved tried again and did it on second attempt. I am now scared of disassembling it again just bcuz of that bloody spring.       \n \n[B]Had the opportunity today to visit my frnd''s village for some firing. So here are some range details.[/B]\n \n[B]Ammunition[/B]\n \n1. Chinese Brown box (11)\n2. Chinese Red box (15)\n3. WCC Nato (15)\n4. Armscor JHPs (10)\n\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]10541[/ATTACH]\n \nDidn&#8217;t have enough time so could only manage to fire 51 rounds. No problem whatsoever. No FTE, no FTF.\n \n[B]Cherry Popping[/B]\n \nThis time I thought not to deflower my handgun thru "flat nosed" ammo (Chinese :p) or "no nose" philpo ammo (Armscor JHP) so the only option left was WCC NATO and Chezh Republic''s beauty''s cherry was popped thru US''s WCC Nato rounds.\n \n[B]Performance at 10 meters[/B]\n \n5 WCC Nato rounds went first. Remained on 7 o clock from target, one was a flyer. There was a smell of burning gun powder after WCC rounds, never happened when i fired chinese rounds with stoeger.\n\n5 Chinese red box next. 3 bull''s-eye. 1 at 8 o clock near bullseye and one again far at 7 o clock. The slide didn&#8217;t lock back this time.\n\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]10542[/ATTACH]\n \n11 chinese brown box next. 2 were damn in the bullseye, and 3 were smelling the boundary, so I will say 5 were bullseye :p, 4 were at 6 o clock, 1 was at 3 o clock and one was flyer.\n\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]10543[/ATTACH]\n \n10 armscor JHPs next. 2 bullseeye, 1 was quite near so lemme say 3 bullseye :p, remaining seven managed to be on the chart, literally everywhere like cricket fielders, long thirdman, short thirdman, back on boundry at midwicket, long on and long off.\n\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]10544[/ATTACH]\n \n10 WCC Nato rounds next.

I am lovin'' it :p\n \nNow time for being a little controversial here :p\n \n[B]CZ Duty VS Caracal[/B]\n \nBeing a new learner and novice, I think I should be using hammer fired handguns to be familiar with guns and stuff. If hammer or no hammer is not a problem and I shud pick one based on internet reviews, I''ll go for CZ Duty with my eyes closed. Personal choice, no offence meant.\n \n[B]CZ Duty VS CZ 999[/B]\n \nWell, that&#8217;s an awkward comparison. Charade GTTI or Baleno are cheaper than VTI, could outrun vti oreal, and their consumption is quite better than VTU but still people buy VTI oreal, are they stupid or what or there are few things like brand loyalty, or ego, or lust for having good thing whether not it outperforms its cheaper competitor. Its as simple as you read it. So, if price is not the factor, CZ Duty anytime of the day. No comparison whatsoever. :p\n\nHere are pix of my queen :p\n\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]10546[/ATTACH][ATTACH=CONFIG]10548[/ATTACH]\n\nDenovo bro, Naved bro, any help for pix ...

(431178, ' [QUOTE=Rizshu;269124]under sections 96 to 100 of the Pakistan Penal Code (PPC) which concerns the right to defend himself when attacked. However, out of these the most concerned sections are 96 to 97 of the PPC. I like to explain these sections for the general information of the readers. Section-96 (PPC) declares, &#8220;That nothing is an offence which is done in the exercise of the right of private defence. The reason for this is that the law does not require a citizen, however, law-abiding he may be, to behave like a rank coward on any occasion. So, if a man is attacked he need not run away; he would be perfectly justified in the eyes of the law if he holds his ground and delivers a counter attack on his assailant provided always that the injury which he inflicts in self defence is not out of proportion to the injury with which he was threatened&#8221;. \n\nSimilarly, section-97 (PPC) is regarding the right private defence of the body and property. \n\n(I quote) \n\n&#8220;Every person has a right, subject to the restrictions contained in section-99 (PPC) to defend: - First: His own body, and the body of any other person against any offence affecting the human body; secondly; The property, whether movable or immovable, of himself or of any other person, against any act which is an offence failing under the definition of theft, robbery, mischief or criminal trespass or which in an attempt to commit theft, robbery, mischief or criminal trespass&#8221;.[/QUOTE]\n\nThanks Dear for nice informative information.', ''),

I tried my best to like a gun below 65k. but whateva gun i held in my hand i just couldn''t forget the feeling of holding Duty. thank God i had enough cash in pocket to buy it. One more thing, the feeling and looks of Caracal F are also great. But didn''t buyt it coz i don''t like the safety mechanism. Even if i would have bought the Caracal F, it would have been a compromise due to cost saving measures. I disassembled this gun with out any problem. its very easy but i couldn''t change the safety. as my Duty had De-cocker safety installed and i wanted to change it to trigger safety.', ''),

The video is in no way professionally made nor in presentation style. I was in hurry, had guns to clean and just got the camera rolling.

You''ll notice some minor errors in speech (Muzzle end/breech end/tacops/tac sport mixup''s) as I was more engrossed in cleaning than talking.\n\n3).

Built in the USSR in the early 1960''s, it is a standard Model 1891/30 infantry rifle cut down to carbine length and stamped 1891/59 on the receiver... the only Mosin to have a model designation like that stamped on it.  \r\n\r\nThis one is missing the original stock, which was a standard wooden 91/30 stock and handguard cut down to fit the new configuration.  Some of these rifles have had all arsenal marks scrubbed off of them and only the designation 1891/59 stamped on the receiver.  This particular rifle has a 1940 receiver made in the Soviet Izveshk arsenal, and is very nicely finished as most pre war guns are.  \r\n\r\nThe stock is an aftermarket sporter stock, and I have a clamp on scope mount I plan to install that does not require drilling into the rifle.\r\n\r\nNobody is quite sure what the 91/59''s were made for. There have been reports of some coming into the United States as trophies from Vietnam War, and some documents to suggest many of these rifles were meant for issue to internal security troops.  Why they were built is something of a mystery, as the USSR had a huge inventory of both model 1891/1938 (M38) and the 1891/1944 (M44) carbines which featured a side folding bayonet. Perhaps this was an early socialist "make work" project which kept local workers busy?  Many of the ones imported into the United States have been reported to come out of Bulgaria.\r\n\r\nThe bore on this rifle is nearly pristine, although a little dark.

(431935, ' [QUOTE=zainulabdeen;196340]Hussain Ali , brother u are right ,that  under the provisions of related fire arms law, the  retainer has the right of temporary possession only and that too , in the presence of original licencee. previously any body , being a servant / guard could become a retainer but if my memory serves me well, that provision has been done away with and now only a person having blood relation with original licencee could become a retainer. this redical change has been made by the home department after several case laws/ precedents of apex courts  were brought before it. now there is a contrast between the interpretition of such law, as  , as per the text of the relevant  provision/ section of concerned law envisages the retainer as a temporary possession holder, not entitled to use the weapon but in a case, when the original licencee went inside the court , giving his weapon to the retainer to hold it and to wait outside, and retainer was attacked by the opponant party, the retainer fired back and repulsed the attack by critically injuring the assailants. the case of 13d (a.o) was registered against the retainer being not authorized to  use the weapon and lower court sentensed the retainer. the matter eventually brought before apex courts and it was held that retainer was justified in in firing back in self defence as well as covered by a retainer ship as he could not wait to be killed only because he was a mere retainer not legally competent to use weapon. there were several such like  precedents and thus the home departmrnt was compelled to change the policy and limit the retainership to blood relatives only. and unlike old policy , this has a provision , through case laws , being binding on police & all other govt agencies ( thus the introduction of new retainer policy mentioned to above), to use the weapon by the retainer in self defence situations[/QUOTE]\n\nThen what is the latest amended law on this after making the provision of retainer can only be a bloodrelated person ? Does it give the retainer the authority to use the weapon in terms of self defence or still the authorities are same as to take care of the gun not to use it. ?', ''),

(432040, ' I''m also considering benjamin maurauder and getting it for $400 as opposed to $480 listed on PA :p [url]http://www.airgunsofarizona.com/BenjaminPCP.htm[/url]\nthe problem is to go through the hassle of filling it up :/ i reckon in pakistan you''ll have to rely on the manual hand pump for filling up your gun. Based on what i have searched average GOOD POWERFUL shots per fill range between 20-30 for different guns and after that the power starts dropping considerably. Also, it takes a lot more pumping if you use up a lot of your reservoir. I think you should also consider the HATSAN BT65 [url]http://www.youtube.com/user/AirGunWeb?feature=watch[/url] . After the gun cost you need to keep in ming the cost of a decent scope, mounts (as most PCPs come without sights) adapter/connector, along with a reliable pump (the best in my opinion is the HILL pump as they are built to last a lifetime). The pump alone should cost you approx $300 (HILL pump) and 200$ (Benjamin, Axsor or any other pumps).\nas opposed to that a springer is good to go anytime (no pumping and extra costs) :p so im really confused right now :p BTW for your desired range and quarry why dont you go for .22 firepower :p', ''),

(432045, 'Taurus 608 .357 mag - Hallmark of Accuracy For a long time i wanted to add .357 Magnum to my collection, and decided to buy one. Just few days later i talked to Denovo87 bro and asked him for his expert opinion, then later talked to bbiillaall bro for his, and he advised me to buy a 1911 first. He said bro if you didn''t fire a .45ACP then you haven''t fired anything and no doubt the .45ACP is a awesome caliber. After that i was so much confused that i couldn''t decide what to buy. i made up my mind that i''ll decide what to buy at the shop after seeing and handling both guns. When i got to Lahore, I was inclining more towards the .45acp. But to my surprise the prices of Taurus 1911 had skyrocketed and i could find Taurus 1911 without rails, i didn''t like the one with rails, i think the the ugly rails of Taurus ruins the 1911 looks. Second choice was Zigana 1911, couldn''t find that too. So decided to go for the 357. Now faced another decision, either to go for sleek and better looking 627 Tracker or Big, Beefy, Hunky 608 with a extra round capacity. So again confused, but decided to go with the 608, because it had more weight, so lesser recoil expected. Extra round of 357, more the marry. The best thing was 608 was with ported barrel and the 627 wasn''t. Also like the balance of the 608. It was balanced in the middle and the 627 was bit nose heavy, and i had already decide to buy one with 6.5 inch barrel. These were big guns and i''m not a big guy so 608 seemed a logical choice. After firing the gun for the first time at Sialkot after the Caracal vs Glock Showdown, i was in love with this gun. The accuracy of this gun is mind boggling. We all were hitting everything we were aiming for, be it the Pepsi bottles or the empty Shaheen shotgun shells. It was killing targets. There is almost no muzzle rise, the felt recoil was less then the 9mm, all because of the weight and ported barrel of 608. Ah! don''t even get me started about the sonic boom the .357 mag creates and the sound is it makes. Awesome! The 608 is a so fun to shoot and acuraacy of the gun is so phenomenon that i can shoot this gun all day no problem. The trigger in SA mode is so light and crisp that you can only see it to believe it. The DA pull is long and heavy but manageable. Infact the SA pull of the trigger is so light that i still can''t get use to it, and it keep shooting the gun low.

(432094, ' @eemmads: I am no gun expert, brother, but physics says that the heavier the object, the tougher it is to push it. You see, when the projectile/bullet leaves the firearm with speed, that is called "action" and newton''s third law of motion says that every action has an equal and opposite reaction, so the force with which the bullet leaves the firearm exerts the same amount of rearward force on the firearm which gives a jerk to the firearm and consequently, the shooter''s hand. So yes, the logic applies to firearms aswell, that the heavier the firearm is, the lesser the recoil will be. I hope this helps explain why the gun''s weight affects the recoil.

(432107, ' [QUOTE=Vigilant;270367]@eemmads: I am no gun expert, brother, but physics says that the heavier the object, the tougher it is to push it. You see, when the projectile/bullet leaves the firearm with speed, that is called "action" and newton''s third law of motion says that every action has an equal and opposite reaction, so the force with which the bullet leaves the firearm exerts the same amount of rearward force on the firearm which gives a jerk to the firearm and consequently, the shooter''s hand. So yes, the logic applies to firearms aswell, that the heavier the firearm is, the lesser the recoil will be. I hope this helps explain why the gun''s weight affects the recoil.

But unlike the web, the karhanoo market shopkeepers differentiate the panels differently, as given below:\r\n\r\n&#8226;	China panels | No warranty : 1 watt = ranging from Rs 70,  80, 90, 100, 120 and 170\r\n&#8226;	German (assembled by Akhtar company Pakistan) |with warranty: 1 watt  =  Rs 200\r\n&#8226;	German (assembled by Madina company Pakistan): 1 watt  =  Rs 190\r\n&#8226;	US panels | with warranty : 1 watt = 180 and 255.\r\n\r\nThe variations in rates made me confuse, I don&#8217;t know which to buy. I need suggestions from technical persons and please answer me:\r\n\r\n1)	What makes china panel so cheap.

There are photovoltaic cells inside it made of different kind of materials.\r\n\r\nDifferent materials give different efficiencies and also different material have their cost. Silicon photovoltaic cells are cheaper, and other more efficient materials such as GaAs (gallium-arsenide) are more efficient and hence more expensive. Its all terms of efficiency, and solar cells give less then 50% efficiency in ideal conditions, so when its 10 watt you consider it 5. Same efficiency is the concern for a mono crystal semiconductor or a poly crystal. Same goes to China or Germany. Chine one also will never be fail, but its all about efficiency. Maybe you get just 100 watt output at bright sunlight from China made when its NIB. And you get 150watt output from the German made. Both will give you output. Even if you buy poly crystal as well. Always buy double power panels of your need.\r\n\r\nSecondly, you said you do not want Battery. Brother, battery is must if you want to use Solar panels. Because solar panel do not give you uniform output and it will burn out all your equipments if you try to work out directly. Sometime high power, sometime low !. You definitely need batteries.', ''),

But I think commercial available panels are all made up of silicon. Because its the cheapest raw material and it is the most widely used material in semi-conductor technology. But even Silicon made panels are of different quality. There are fabrication types, some are fabricated better some less.

A charge controller control how the solar panels charge the batteries. Solar Panels gives you direct DC power, you need to store it somewhere to use it. Charge controller just like our home UPS controls if the battery is fully charged or not. If its fully charged it breaks the connection using a Relay from Solar panel to stop over-charging\r\n\r\n[QUOTE=Khan381;270626]Sir, UPS used are mostly of 1kva or 2 kva.. how will 300 watt panels charge UPS?[/QUOTE]\r\n\r\nPanels never charge UPS not even a UPS is a chargeable device. Brother it is the battery which is charged. The rest of the process is same of UPS as a charge controller and as dc/ac inverter.\r\nYou have UPS at home, There is a Battery, and a UPS. The main (220V AC) is connected to UPS, what it do, it converts (220V AC) into 12V DC and supply this charge to battery. While the charge controller controls this process. Then the output of battery is connected again to UPS which supply this to inverter again from 12V DC to 220V AC when the MAIN line turns off (loadshedding time) and battery acts as a source.\r\n\r\nIn solar panel the output is already non-uniform DC and you do not need an inverter to give input to the battery. Though you need some mechanism to synchronize with Battery voltage.\r\n\r\n* I am just a student on this subject, and only have experience limited to university lab projects.', ''),

There are lots of associate who are far experienced and their expert opinion may add some knowledge to novice like me also.\n\nFor you perusal please:- \n\n4 &#8211; Ideal number of decoys varies according to situation always. For example, widespread open water may need 5 dozen or more decoys sometime. \n\nUsually 3 dozen decoys are more than enough in most situations. They may work more than 100, if properly placed. As we discussed in above simply try to set the pattern in a way that each decoy should have its own appearance while ducks approaching them. \n\nIn marshes, always place groups of decoys and open lading zone nearer 2 u. These groups some time placed at 40 yards to make them visual in dense marshes by birds passing over head. These groups should set in a ways that no adequate landing zone should left around them as an option to decoy landing birds. Landing zone should open near you and insisting birds to sit there. \n\nWind factor will be again vital here, otherwise ducks will cross you with greater speed and shooting may result in loss of many birds in the marshes or koondar. However, it inevitable, you always suffer a good number of ducks especially winger.\n\nUsually, mojo cannot be places at such places due to deep water or bogging but mojo is not that necessary in marshes where birds expected to stay. Your call will do the trick, as soon as birds crosses your spread call them with single quacks or feeding chuckle. Never call birds that are eager to enjoy your guns i.e. in marshes usually your call works at a unbelievable height and birds will respond to your call with closed wings often and reach you like a rocket. \n\nTry never shot highly declining birds, swinging down barrels never results too good. Let them encircle your trap and enjoy shooting.\n\nThese are personal experiences / judgments please, open for debate always.\n\nAs you said u r know to H1, feel free the meet sometime. It doesn&#8217;t look appropriate to reply in such a way that people start chanting slogans &#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;. \n\nAnyhow, what else do you want to share??? if unanswered.\n\nMallards are the cleverest birds while flying over open water. Open Hideout barring height over 2 feet will be a challenge for them, they are not gadwalls for sure&#8230;&#8230; haahahaha &#8230;&#8230; \n\nTry a low height hide always (Where mallards flight pasing over), if hunting in open water, results will be changed. \n\nMallard is the easiest birds in marshes but the most intelligent species while fly over open water especially in flocks greater than 5 birds. \n\nEnjoy game !!!!!!![/QUOTE]\n\nExcellent Detail .

(432704, ' Dear Members,\n\nAs per law & constitution of Pakistan we have 2 NPB Arms Lic issuance authorities\n\n1. Ministry of Interior MOI or Federal Govt.\n2. Home Department or Provincial Govt.\n\nUpon application federal can "Approve /Issue" NPB Arms Lic lic to any individual and this lic is known as MOI Lic or Federal Govt. Lic\n\nProvincial Govt. (All 4 Provinces) also Approve /issue NBP lic upon request of individual.\n\nThe difference is, when a federal govt. issue a lic it can be issue to any part of the country therefore it has the "Valid For All Pakistan" status.\n\nProvince issues a Lic "Valid for that Particular Province" but when one needs to travel from one province to another then we request the provincial Govt. (Upon official Fee) to allow us to carry our lic & weapon to another province....thus this permission is know as "All Pakistan Carrying Status" of provincial Lic.\n\nNow to your question, of Carrying & Purchase......................\n\nKeeping in view that status & issuing authority, MOI lic allows you to purchase from anywhere in the country......provided you fulfill the "Prerequisite" of NBP registration & follow-up on DC /DCO entry....(So you are restricted to your home town technically).\n\nProvincial Lic allows you to purchase with the "Issued Province /Area City /District of Approval" ............but prerequisites are the same ...i.e NBP & DC /DCO etc.......... (So you again restricted to your home town technically".....\n\nNow talking about "Carrying" both the Lic allows the lic holder to carry within the "Limits of Approval Authorities"............but the "Problem child is "Section 144 Banned on Weapon Carry /display" law.....................\n\nSo, under such condition law, both the Lic enjoy the same "Ban" & both needs "Section 144 Exemption Permission" to carry ................\n\nYes the difference is there while "Renewal Fee" and freedom to carry etc............but I always think why MOI lic is "Without" the Lic holder picture ???\n\nRest is all same as per law and legally both enjoys the same "Allowed Limits" as per City /District Govt......\n\nHopes this clear......\n\nRegards', ''),

However to the best of my knowledge neither of them are being issued at this point in time. Though they should be in a week or two.  Once you get the licence you would have to have them registered at the National bank (In case of Home Department ones) and local post office for the DC ones (However the true picture will emerge only once they actually start being issued) However weapons purchased on ALL licences in Karachi have to be registered at your Area Police Station.', ''),

The Smith and Wesson you are talking about is the Sigma, it is NOT a Glock Copy, it costs about $300 in the States, and is sold here at a ridiculous price of 110k (over $1200) because there is an embargo on weapons to Pakistan from USA. The Taurus is not a Beretta Copy, the complete manufacturing plant was purchased by Taurus from Beretta alongwith the RIGHTS to manufacture the pistol, so it is not right to call it a copy.\r\nNow coming to Daudsons, in my personal opinion the weapons made by them are of much better quality than our other local manufacturers, but still not as good in finish as imported weapons. Coming to your point, even though I dont know for a fact that shotguns are sold for 330k in the uk, but I''m sure if they are then they must be good because that translates to around 2200 GBP, and to my knowledge you can get some really good options in this price range, like various Beretta shotguns. Now, Daudsons Shotguns maybe really good, but are they better than Beretta Shotguns? Highly unlikely, simply because of almost 500 years of experience that the people at beretta have. :)\r\nNow, my point is that this handgun is cheaper than most foreign brands beacuse it lacks finish, fit and judging from the these 2, I would say functionality as well. The PB rifle you are talking about is a German design and is manufactured under license i.e the manufacturing technology/skills have been sold by H&K to POF. The beretta clone/copy on the other hand, is just a copy. What I fail to understand here is if you have to copy, why copy a design that is very sensitive to the quality of materials involved. The beretta 92fs is one of the most successful combat handgun of all time, but people who are into weapons will have to agree that the locking lug, and where it locks to the slide is the most sensitive part in this gun, it is where the gun is most prone to breakage, an issue that Beretta has ALMOST removed by using materials of the highest possible quality. Can POF ensure that such a failure will not happen in this gun? only time will tell, that too if someone takes it upon themselves to test this weapon to its fullest. I still dont understand that if a weapon was needed, why didnt POF manufacture something that used the Browning Breech Lock Principles(like the Browning Hi Power, or the CZ 75) or even a modified  Browning Breech lock(like the Sig or the Glock). They are easier to make, and much more robust. I''m not really sure where I read it, but India makes a copy of the Browning Hi-Power. \r\n\r\nAnd Brother, I have no idea about tanks, so I''d rather stick to what I know. :D\r\n\r\nPS. I hope that this handgun turns out to be reliable and robust, but they definitely need improvement in the finishing department, internal as well as external.\r\n\r\nRegards.', ''),

The Gamo hunter extreme does deliver those high numbers but with PBA pellets, using which you''ll achieve velocity but you can say goodbye to accuracy. The pellets are WAY OFF the target the fps will drop by 200-300 on lead pellets. A 350 mangum will outshoot a Gamo anytime, once you''ve mastered your artillery hold. Another issue with Gamos is that their parts are manufactured and china and the guns are assembled in Spain. Although some chinese made airguns ARE worth your money (e.g SAG), however given the budget i''d opt for a European made gun (thats just my preference though) as i KNOW i can rely on my guns for years to come.', ''),

I have cancelled the itch by applying itch relief lotion.\n@Doc Pistol - Salam and thanks for the comments.  But you should know when mentioning Very senior members... that I am one of them.... I have been around Glocks literally since the inception/introduction of them in the US.  In 1986, I owned TWO Glock 17Ls ported.  In 1987 when I was called by one of the distributors (Gun South, Selma Alabama) to book the new Glock19 for 375$ - I booked Six.  I shot my first IPSC match with Glocks and the 1911.  I remember buying my first Glock21 in 1991.  Sir, I was there when North Central Florida SWAT team first tested the Glocks for durability.  Having said that lets move on to Caracal, I first saw their pistols over two years ago here in Pakistan as did Dr. Zakir.  I have disassembled this pistol on many occasions.  Its nice but NOT the best.  The company may have been started by RICH people or business entity but that does not in my book nor will it EVER convince me that this is a great product.  \nI am one of those who loves to tinker with things to make them even better and then moving on to the next thing.  I saw the Caracal, the dealer is a friend, he offered a very good price, I got the itch... then again I have many itches, two of which I will be displaying here on PG by Monday.\nSoooo good query but not good on the supporting statements.\nHowever, keep up the good work.', ''),

I got their number from their website and I called, a lady picked up and ask I asked about license she redirected me to some guy and he refused about licenses as it was something illegal I was asking him about saying "No idea we don''t make them, you can try market"...\n\nGuys I am not good at bargaining at all :(!\n\nThen I decided to reach a dealer my self, since it was point less to call anymore (I was feeling stupid).

Anyway I was thankful to them for all the help, they sent a guy along me to photo studio since I needed 4 passport sized photos that I didn''t have...  I paid them 10k advance for the license. He told me that I can get license for around 14k from saddar too but they might turn out to be fake so why take risk.\n\nAnother point I was worried about that I didn''t want my license to be allocated from any political part quota, (just wondering some dealers might use their sources in parties to acquire licenses easily for their customers)... Possible? That is why I decided to pay 20k to some reputed dealer instead.\n\nNow at this point when I am already looking into the guns so I can buy one as soon as I get my license...

If zeroed closer, the second zero would be too far for air rifles. If it''s zeroed to more than the above mentioned distance, the first zero would be too close.\n\nIf yours is zeroed at 20 yards, the second zero would be around 60yds (about as much a moderately good airgun would be useful for hunting) and b/w the two mentioned distances, zero error is so less that you''ll easily hit dove and pigeon sized objects.\n\nAlso the crow didn''t come down like a stone, I was playing around with mildots, it hit somewhere else and it fell down the tree and had to be finished off.

Its good to hear that the gun is going strong. Do keep us posted as the rounds increase. :)\r\n\r\nAsfandyar bro, you are mixing two things up.\r\nFirst let us talk of handguns. As compared to PK9, we have quite a few options.... firstly the chinese TT, it costs 22-24 k and is a time tested, battle tested handgun. It is also cheaper than the PK9. Then there is the M57, another reliable TT but a tad expensive. Other options are yet a little more expensive, like the CZ999, Canik, NP22 etc. At around 50k, these are tested platforms.\r\nComing to shotguns, POF doesn''t make any. You yourself stated that DSA shotguns are good, so why dont you go for their double barrel shotgun, which should be less than 20k? Simple, its because the Baikal is a BETTER option.\r\nI guess it all depends on the intended use of the weapon. A weapon for SD/HD is something that you dont want to take a risk on. Similarly, a serious hunter would also take his gun very seriously. If you still have some spare dough,well then I guess its perfectly fine if you decide to buy a new weapon and test it out. :)\r\n\r\nAnd.....Like I said earlier, nothing would make me happier than seeing a Pakistani Handgun selling like hot cakes in US and Europe. :D\r\n\r\nRegards.', ''),

(433238, ' [QUOTE=Kamranwali;271350]Salam All,\n@Soldier Bro, thanks for the reply. Its good to hear that the gun is going strong. Do keep us posted as the rounds increase. :)\n\nAsfandyar bro, you are mixing two things up.\nFirst let us talk of handguns. As compared to PK9, we have quite a few options.... firstly the chinese TT, it costs 22-24 k and is a time tested, battle tested handgun. It is also cheaper than the PK9. Then there is the M57, another reliable TT but a tad expensive. Other options are yet a little more expensive, like the CZ999, Canik, NP22 etc. At around 50k, these are tested platforms.\nComing to shotguns, POF doesn''t make any. You yourself stated that DSA shotguns are good, so why dont you go for their double barrel shotgun, which should be less than 20k? Simple, its because the Baikal is a BETTER option.\nI guess it all depends on the intended use of the weapon. A weapon for SD/HD is something that you dont want to take a risk on. Similarly, a serious hunter would also take his gun very seriously. If you still have some spare dough,well then I guess its perfectly fine if you decide to buy a new weapon and test it out. :)\n\nAnd.....Like I said earlier, nothing would make me happier than seeing a Pakistani Handgun selling like hot cakes in US and Europe. :D\n\nRegards.[/QUOTE]\n\nAgreed with you brother. :)', ''),

These accidents do happen every place even in USA if your Rifle or Ammo is faulty or you are not careful enough about safety issues before discharging your rifle.\n\nI have noticed some of us are not safety minded when it comes to weapon handling and discharging their weapons.\n\n\nAs you all know, Gun Dealers have been unable to import rifles or rifle ammo for some time due to restrictions or some regulations. Some fresh import rifle ammo is available in the market but at very high price, forcing people to look for cheaper alternative.\n\nSo because of this there is all kinds of fake ammo or (dara made or modified) ammo and rifles being sold in the market as original. \n\nThis is not to offend or discourage anyone from buying old locally modified or local made rifles, but just to advice everyone to be more careful and be 100% sure of your weapon and ammo being fit before using it. \n\nBelow are some Photos from the net of rifle Accident.\n\n\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]10678[/ATTACH]\n\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]10679[/ATTACH]\n\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]10680[/ATTACH]\n\n\nThis accident happened because the guy discharged the rifle with laser bore sight still inside the barrel.\nAny obstruction in a gun or rifle barrel can cause the gun to explode. The gases pushing the projectile will expand at their normal rate. If they can''t escape through their normal route, the barrel will explode for sure.\nMost Common rifle accident, discharging faulty round in a rifle will lead to projectile being stuck in the barrel (this is common with Dara made ammo), many people will reload the rifle and discharge another round without realizing the obstruction in the barrel. This will destroy the rifle and injure the shooter for sure.\n\nI would request more input on the issue from Expert rifle shooters.', ''),

If so, who in DSA did you contact and what was their feedback?\n\nb) Have you shared this experience of yours with the person who sold it to you, the one who rated it very highly on some other local forum? What were his feedbacks?\n\nc) It is highly unethical to mislead innocent gun enthusiasts by falsely rating a product very high, whereas in reality it is CRAP. How many others got duped because of that misleading review?[/COLOR]\n\n\nAns (a) I contacted Mr Murad who is the manager there several times. Guy is really courteous but insisted that I handover the gun to them for repair in Peshawer that too free of cost. He did not agree to courier to me the required parts nor to hand them over to my friend in Peshawer. According to him their local dealers in Karachi can''t help me with repair. Gun was in Karachi and it was not possible for me each time to take it to Peshawer for repair. I got the gun repaired from DSA Peshawer once for replacement of Mag tube which was done free of cost. Rest of the problems were rectified by local gunsmith.\n\nAns (b) I bought the through that guy without him getting any financial gains from the deal. I bought it for a total of 23k with box so price was quite reasonable. He still thinks that this product is of good quality and I may have misused it or this particular piece was a lemon.\n\nAns (c) I don''t believe he misled anyone. He genuinely believes it is an outstanding product. His judgement may be questioned but not his intention.\n\nI would request members to just forget about the history of the gun and just read the review.
