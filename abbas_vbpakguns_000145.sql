Both are very reliable, have a quick action (faster than your fingers), durable (will out last you). The only difference among these two is the brand name with Browning rated higher than Winchester.\n\nfitting is a very important factor while purchasing any weapon, better try holding both and get the one that fits you better. I think these are supplied with shims that can help improve the fitting of the gun.\n\nIn my opinion among these two, Winchwester SX3 is a better and wiser choice in terms of value for money.

(391399, ' Browning Maxus is worth buying with a difference of 25K in my opinion over Win SX3. But better than Browning Maxus, is Urika2 Classic (OptPlus) by Beretta which is available in same price as Maxus I guess. \r\n\r\nAlmost same weight of all 3 guns (7 lbs), but difference in terms of functioning - one major being : VERSATILITY to fire all loads from 24 grams to 42 grams and up. This is only possible with Beretta Urika2 above, while Maxus has 28 grams load and up range and Win SX3 has 31-32 grams and up. This is a critical difference in my opinion. Here skeet and trap loads are 24-25 gms, and field loads are 31-36 gms in general. So one has to see gas mechanism accomodates all of this range we use normally here in Pakistan with Shaheen cartrg.\r\n\r\nBackboring is used by all three and elongated chokes too. Main thing would be stock fit and what is the available range to vary the pull, or drop, or cast in all these semi autos. For example in some semis, like A400 Beretta KO, one cannot change the length of pull despite being the top of the line semi auto at moment.\r\n\r\nRegarding Stock Fit, for example, my ideal shotgun measurement is:\r\n\r\n14-14.25" length of pull\r\n2.4" drop at heel\r\n1.5" drop at comb\r\n1/4" cast off (or 1/8" if 1/4" n.a)\r\n\r\nUnless such PERSONAL dimensions of stock fit are correctly met, shooting with a shotgun is jeopardized and shooter thinks it is the gun''s or choke''s or cartrg''s fault, whereas gun fit is the culprit most of times, as the EYE acts as the rear sight in a shotgun due to instinctive shooting required in shotgunning. So the essential point in Qs here would be: Does your chosen shotgun accomodate you with YOUR required stock fit thru shims and spacers ?', ''),

(391423, ' [COLOR=#000000][FONT=Verdana][LEFT][FONT=Arial][SIZE=4][B]Top Eleven Bad Habits of Shooters[/B][/SIZE][/FONT][/FONT][/COLOR][/LEFT][LIST=1]\n[*]Not Looking at the Sights. This quite frequently is listed as "looking at the target." A shooter may be focusing his eye on neither the sights nor the target, but since he does not see the target in clear focus he assumes he is looking at the sights. You must concentrate on sight alignment.\n[*]Holding Too Long. Any adverse conditions that interrupt a shooter''s ability to "hold" will cause him to delay his squeeze, waiting for conditions to better. The disturbing factor about this is that you will do it unconsciously; therefore, you must continuously ask yourself, am I being too particular?\n[*]Improper Grip or Position. Suffice to say that you cannot fire a decent score with any gun at any range if you continually change your grip or position.\n[*]Jerk or Heel. The application of pressure either with the trigger finger alone or in case of the heel, pushing with the heel of the hand at the same time. Apply pressure to the trigger straight to the rear and wait for the shot to break.\n[*]Anticipation. Anticipation can cause muscular reflexes of an instant nature that so closely coincide with recoil that extreme difficulty is experienced in making an accurate call. Anticipation is also the sire to flinching.\n[*]Loss of Concentration. If the shooter fails in his determination to apply positive pressure on the trigger while concentrating on the front sight his prior determination needs renewal and he should rest and start over.\n[*]Anxiety. You work and work on a shot, meanwhile building up in your mind doubt about the shot being good. Finally you shoot just to get rid of that particular round so you may work on the others.\n[*]Vacillation (Plain Laziness). This is a mental fault more than a physical one, which results in your accepting minor imperfections in your performance which you could correct if you worked a little harder. The end result being you hope you get a good shot. Just like you hope you will get a gratis tax refund, and you will get one just about as frequently as you get the other.\n[*]Lack of Follow Through. Follow through is the subconscious attempt to keep everything just as it was at the time the shot broke. In other words you are continuing to fire the shot even after it is gone. Follow through is not to be confused with recovery. Merely recovering and holding on the target after the shot is no indication that you are following through.\n[*]Lack of Rhythm. Hesitancy on the first shot or any subsequent shot in timed or rapid fire. Develop a good rhythm and then have the fortitude to employ it every case. Frequently many shooters will have fine rhythm until the last shot of a string and then hesitate, doctoring up that last shot.\n[*]Match Pressure. If there are 200 competitors in a match, rest assured that there are 200 shooters suffering from match pressure. So what makes you think you are so different? If you are exerting all your mental energy toward executing the correct fundamentals rather than the arithmetic evaluation, your shooting match pressure will be what you feel when people congratulate you on a fine performance.\n[/LIST]', '');

(391555, ' [QUOTE=12GAUGE;228982]bro, any quality shotgun can handle slugs provided that it is provided with open chokes such as a cylinder or a improved cylinder choke. similarly, a Baikal O/U too can handle slugs. however I will not never recommend firing slugs using an O/U. reasons:\n\n1. Barrels of an O/U or SxS converge at a known distance thus the point of impact of a slug becomes a guestimation at best. making it extremely difficult to fire slugs with any reasonable accuracy.\n\n2. the front sight is of a bead type. a setup intended for rapid aiming. as it promotes speed but at the cost of accuracy. specially the rifle like accuracy required for firing a single projectile such as a shotgun slug.\n\n3. the two barrels in an O/U or a SxS are held together by a side rib joined together by a solder (mostly cold). the recoil and vibrations caused by a slug can easily work the rib loose.\n\nwith the reasons above, an O/U can handle slugs but it is not recommended.[/QUOTE]\n\nLogically explained.

(391566, ' Salam All,\nFirstly, if you fire those subsonic rounds, it means that you are firing lead rounds (unjacketed).  I don''t believe you have fired that many through it otherwise you would revise your statement.  Subsonic WILL clog up your firing Pin.  Read the article on the reliable feeding for P22, the way I did it, it fires EVERY Ammo EVERY time.\nSecondly, I agree with most when they say, that the p22 is not for HD.  In others case(s), agreed.  I, however, do carry and have been carrying either the Beretta 87 or the P22 for SD.  Reason, I now have experienced MY guns enough to realize whether or not they will fail and with which ammo.  \nSecondly, my position is this: if the FBI makes its agents qualify four times (shooting) a year to allow field work - and its been shown statistically that in a fire fight even they end up missing 40+% of the times... where does that leave us?  Hands shaking, nervous, sweating palms... etc etc I want a gun I can just hold without it slipping and pull the trigger repeatedly without jerky recoil and NOT taking my aim out of sight after the first round.  All I gotta worry about is the slightly nervous shaky hands, I have taken out most of the other variables for my gun.  This allows me to fire rapidly at vital areas only to bring the bad guy down...  i.e. Face or chest\nThen again this IS ONLY my way of thinking and has been now for over 20 years.', ''),

The wildcat version dates back to around 1920, when it was introduced by A. O. Nieder, and Remington has stuck to his original configuration of simply necking-down the 30-06 case. The Remington Model 700 series bolt-action rifles were the first to be offered in the newly-adopted caliber. At the present time, Remington, Interarms, Ruger, Savage, winchester, Weatherby, Sako and almost every other manufacturer of bolt-action rifles offer at least one version in 25-06. In addition, the Ruger single shot is available in this caliber. Since its commercial introduction, the 25-06 Remington has become a very popular number.\r\n\r\nThe 25-06 was probably the finest of the 25-caliber wildcats, and its emergence as a standardized factory item has been welcomed by many. As a varmint cartridge it is best with the 87-grain bullet, and for big game one should stick to the 117- or 120-grain bullets. With the former, 4831 and H-870 give top velocity within permissible pressures, and with heavier bullets, 4831 and N205 work best. This cartridge definitely develops top velocity only with slower burning powders. Some consider the 25-06 good for anything from varmint through deer only; others insist it will handle anything in North America. Like most other multipurpose cartridges, satisfactory results depend on using the right bullet for the game and conditions and placing the shot right!', ''),

(391857, ' 257 Weatherby Magnum\r\n\r\nThis cartridge was developed by Roy Weatherby about 1944, a year before he actually went into the commercial gun business. Like most of the other Weatherby cartridges, it is based on the necked-down and blown-out 300 H&H case. Commercial ammunition under the Weatherby name has been available since 1948. This has been based on Norma components since about 1951. There are a number of wildcat versions of the 300 H&H Magnum necked-down to 25-caliber, but the Weatherby cartridge has largely displaced these because of the availability of factory ammunition and rifles.\r\n\r\nThe 257 WM is one of the first modern, ultra-velocity, small-bore, rifle cartridges to be produced on a commercial basis that developed and retained a large degree of popularity. It is quite accurate and well-suited for long-range varmint shooting on one hand, and delivers sufficient velocity and energy to take on almost any North American big game on the other hand. A superb deer, antelope, sheep, goat or black bear cartridge, it has also been used successfully on elk, moose, brown bear, lion, buffalo and zebra. Many authorities insist that it is much too light for heavy or dangerous game, but high-velocity advocates insist with equal favour that with proper bullets, it is adequate for any thing except the largest and most dangerous game in close cover. In any event, it is not intended as a woods rifle, for the light, high-velocity bullets are too easily deflected. It is in its element for long-range plains or mountain hunting. For long-range varmint shooting it can only be described as ''spectacular".', ''),

And if it happens in a very narrow place like a barrel, made of chrome plated steel , in presence of high temperature and intensively pressurized gasses trapped between nest of  mud , grooves and lands of barrels, so i can not rule out any chemical reaction causing damage to the shining of barrel/ bore. beside , the larva of the insects were also nothing but protein , of course before being burnt to ashes. my gun was saved as it was not fired and yes , after we have started to cap the muzzles of our weapons, no further case of such nature is reported to any gun with a covered / capped muzzle', ''),

To shotgun aficionados, however, only the best matter—and “best” takes on a particular meaning in the world of shotguns.\n  A “best gun” is a double-barreled shotgun made with all the care and precision of a work of art. The cream of the crop is the London best—a shotgun made by premier gun makers of London such as Boss & Co., Holland & Holland or J. Purdey & Sons.\n  In 2008, Christie’s held their Exceptional and Fine Sporting Guns and Rifles sale in London. The highlight of the event was a pair of gold-inlaid 12-bore shotguns by J. Purdey & Sons. Gunsmith Ken Hunt was inspired by the Royal Armouries in the Tower  of London. These shotguns are particularly notable for the profusion of gold used in their making and are displayed in an exquisite oak and leather case.\nValued at $320,000 to $400,000, it’s safe to say these fantastic firearms are the most expensive shotguns in the world. \n  [ATTACH=CONFIG]6351[/ATTACH]', ''),

Of course, none of them get to carry the most expensive rifle in the world.\n\n The gun is a product of Viggo Olsson, the Swedish gunsmith who founded VO Vapen in 1977. Called the H.H.

The rifle was modeled after the mosque&#8217;s impressive chandelier and features gold inlays and thirty-six diamonds of various colors. The exclusive rifle is valued at $825,000. Olssen has also produced 100 Royal Collection United Arab Emirates Edition rifles priced at a somewhat more modest $525,000.\nOf course, there are some rifles whose historical importance renders them priceless.

(391895, ' [B]Most Expensive Handgun[/B]\n\nThe Luger, more correctly known as the Parabellum-Pistole, is a semi-automatic pistol design patented by Georg Luger in 1898 and manufactured by DWM (Deutsche Waffen- und Munitionsfabriken Aktien-Gesellschaft) in 1900. Originally designed for 7.65x22mm Parabellum cartridges, US Army trials in 1906 demanded a semi-automatic pistol with a larger caliber. DWM&#8217;s submission, a Luger adapted to .45 ACP rounds, has since become the most expensive handgun in the world.\nThe .45 ACP (Automatic Colt Pistol) cartridge, one of the most successful cartridges ever, was designed only a year earlier by American firearms designer John Browning. It has been used in a wide variety of firearms since, owing part of its success to the fact that it isn&#8217;t prone to over penetration and is, therefore, less likely to injure anyone standing behind the original target. Additionally, due to its inherent subsonic nature when firedfrom handguns or short-barreled submachine guns, it is one of the most powerful pistol calibers able to be suppressed.\nOf the two .45 ACP Lugers submitted to the US Army, only one, marked serial number 2, is known to have survived. Serial number 1 is assumed to have been discarded, possibly damaged after the initial trial. For unknown reasons, DWM withdrew from the trials after the first round of tests. At least three more of the .45 ACP Lugers were made, one a carbine bearing serial number 21.\nMost recently, the world&#8217;s most expensive handguns have been valued in excess of $1 million.\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]6356[/ATTACH]', ''),

(391935, 'mysterious scar in the bore of the rifle i belong to the area which comprises of the arid zone also. the last summer"s  torrential rains played havoc with our area. it was a complete devastation . the calamity hit the humans and wild alike . i saw wild bores crossing just near the human dwellings and relief camps silently. but neither of them paid any heed to each other . i was even told by some people who remained  stranded at tree tops for several days that they saw snakes lurking nearby , but it seems that they forgot to sting. each species was thinking to save its life.\n after the rain stopped and severity of situation mitigated a bit, millions of insects appeared from no where  which  were never known to us . it was just as the aftershocks after the quake has jolted the earth and every body knows that after shocks are deadlier than the earthquake itself.\n during those days one mysterious problem  started to bother the gun owners of my area . they suddenly come to know about the presence of an ugly scar inside the barrels of their weapons, specially rifles. i saw a few of the rifles myself. the scar was really really ugly looking. the barrels were ruined. not worth keeping by any serious gun enthusiast any more  . there were many speculations . some were attributing it it to the excessive humidity , some one was holding his son responsible for less care of the  gun  and other was holding faulty material in gun making as a culprit and was blaming the dealer to supply him a darra made rifle but i was not satisfied as the guns were different but the problem was same . i thought a lot but the mystery would not solve. \n Though I was away from my area  and busy with my job but I was constantly in touch with my people and when ever I find  a room, I rushed to my village and on  each and every trip I asked about the matter but there was no remedy even the scattered cases were reported. People were frustrated on loosing their weapons in this way.\nFew days back I got  some  days space to live at my native village . I took my German made rifle and  field  stripped it with a view to clean it. I use to clean my weapons even they do not need it as it is my favorite time pass and I enjoy it thoroughly . as usual , I took the barrel and tried to peep through it just to see the condition of the barrel and chrome but couldn’t see through completely  . it was partially  choked . I was shocked to see the barrel of my gun chocked in this way. I tried to open it by using WD 40  but it didn’t work, some thing was badly stuck inside the  barrel. I tried  a thin and  soft plastic rod to remove the obstruction. Slowly the rod penetrated the obstruction and than there it came down barrel . it was a tiny  nest of some  small hornet like insect made from mud containing  its tiny  larva hardly visible   .. the culprit which ruin  many  fine guns in our area  was trapped . the owners fired the guns without knowing that there is insects nest made of mud containing the larva  in the barrel. that insect was not known in this area before thus no body could ever think any insect nesting in the bore of a rifle . I told the news to every person I know in my area and advised then to cap  the barrels of their guns  with appropriate covers and caps. If some body don’t have any thing suitable , the filter of a new cigarette would work .\nIt is always good to follow the gun safety rules and one of them is to ascertain and see that the barrel/ bore of ur gun is free from each and every obstruction , before u fire ur weapon', ''),

I have always found myself struggling in getting a consistent mount with a nose heavy shotgun. That is one of the reason why I absolutely love a "Neutral" shotgun.\r\n\r\nhowever if I have to pick between a nose heavy and a tail heavy shotgun, I would always prefer a nose heavy shotgun. aids in a smooth swing and you can always use some shot lead mixed with ordinary carpenter''s putty (inside the hollow buttstock) to bring the center of gravity in the smack middle of the shotgun. I prefer right under the forend hinge assembly.\r\n\r\nas far as the poor pattern performance of A400 with Shaheen Cartridges is concerned, I am guessing that it could be the inadequate gas seal inside the over bored barrel of A400. just a guess, I could be wrong.\r\n\r\nusually, as the barrel ID increases beyond a certain degree/point, the wads are unable to provide adequate gas seal which can result in uneven (blown out) patterns.\r\n\r\nRegards.', ''),

(391976, ' Yes, you are right 12Ga bro in your own way. But, by "Fwd Wt Bias" I meant a "slight FWB" ... like e.g. in Baikal semi''s FWB is very high and is some hinderance to a fluid gun mount.\r\n\r\nA semi auto with a "Neutral Wt Bias" Vs "Slight Forward Wt Bias" ... the latter will almost surely be a better performer in field hunting. In waterfowl hunting, the need would be much more, rather essential. Therefore, I would advice A400 lovers to choose 28" barrel NON KICKOFF version: two reasons .... (1) ability to change length of pull and (2) Slight FWB due to removal of KO and addition of 2" barrel length (when compared to 26" brl). Besides 28" is a multiusage barrel - skeet/trap/ducks/upland. The KO system at stock''s rear with hydraulic springs & all, adds considerable weight on rear side even with a 28" barrel.\r\n\r\nOn a different tangent, one thing abt "A400 Xplor Light" ..... users of this weapon which though is very light (around 6.5 lbs ave) probably do not know that there is one major thing that they are forgoing i.e. KO3 system which protects the gun from wear and tear and excesive peening and battering of the receiver and mechanism.

[/B]\nAccording to reports, five poachers, among them Ramzan Shoro and Pervez allegedly paid Rs5,000 bribe to game watcher of the area, Suleman Khoso, to look the other way when they hunted down the antelope about three weeks ago in Naryasar village, a game sanctuary near Nagarparkar.\nThe news about the rare animal`s hunt came out when Pervez posted snaps of about 200 animals and birds, including the antelope recently hunted near Naryasar village on his profile on the Facebook, and thereby left no recourse to the wildlife officials but to take some sort of action. Dawn\nDistrict Game Warden Shoukat Ali Hingorjo on Friday imposed a fine of Rs50,000 on the five poachers. He told that during an inquiry into the poaching incident and a visit to the site, a local influential man Hamir Shoro, admitted to involvement of his son Ramzan and others in hunting the endangered animal in violation of game laws.\nAn FIR was registered against Ramzan Shoro, Samero Kolhi, Jafar Shoro, Pervez, Ratno Kolhi and two unidentified men and Rs50,000 fine was imposed on them, he said.\nHe said that another antelope was also reportedly hunted near Dhingano village, Nagarparkar taluka, about three weeks ago and the matter was being investigated.\nGame Watcher Suleman Khoso and his colleagues posted in Nagarparkar taluka had been accepting bribes to allow hunters and poachers to hunt down the rare animal, he said.\nHe said that Suleman had been transferred to the wildlife department`s head office in Karachi in the past over public complaints but he succeeded in getting himself reposted to Nagarparkar by using his connections, he alleged.\nHe said that an inquiry was being conducted against the game watcher.\nPoaching and hunting of rare and endangered species of antelope, deer, houbara, peacock, partridge, sand goose and hare in Karoonjhar hills game sanctuary continues unabated under the very nose of wildlife officials but they usually turn a blind eye to it for obvious reasons.\n[url]http://www.dawn.com/2011/11/27/hunter-invites-action-by-posting-pictures-of-animals-on-internet.html[/url]', ''),

If you feel that the  bird shot is yours be polite and give the benefit of the doubt to your  fellow hunter\n[*]If the fellow hunter is a chronic “claimer” then avoid standing next  or near that person, make a note of not going on the same shoot as the  “claimer”\n[*]Avoid being trigger happy, take measured and calculated shots and give the game a fair chance\n[*]When  on a duck shoot, do not shoot before the other guns are in  their respective places, do not shoot at high and out of range birds and  do not shoot at circling ducks which are about to land in a decoy  spread\n[*]Always keep extra water for the helpers, pickers and beaters\n[*]Be considerate and friendly with helpers, pickers and beaters, a generous tip is a must, but do check with the host first\n[*]Sharing the cost of the ‘tip’ is the right thing to do, always offer  to contribute towards the tip or any other cost which can be shared  amongst the hunting party\n[*]If you enjoy an occasional drink, do not ‘ever’ drink during the  shoot, please wait till the shoot is over and even then take the host’s  permission to do so\n[*]When invited on a shoot, never “ever” approach the host directly for a shoot, this is “bad manners”\n[*]Your hosts would at times like to socialize with you after the hunt is finished, be polite and resist the urge to rush back home\n[/LIST]\n \n The most important principle of shooting etiquette is to be safe;  everyone involved must have regard for others and their safety at all  times.', ''),
(392065, ' Here are some basic safety tips for those who are new to the sport:\n  \n \n[LIST]\n[*]Never point a gun, loaded or not, at anyone else!\n[*]Whether walking in line, or standing at your peg, keep your barrels high in the air or pointed directly at the ground\n[*]Guns should only ever be loaded immediately prior to expecting a  shot; on driven days this is not before the signal for the drive to  start has been given\n[*]On shoots you may sometimes see people standing with the gun lying  in the crook of their arm or with the barrels horizontal across their  waist; this is totally unacceptable and stupidly dangerous\n[*]Keep your gun in its slip or broken and unloaded between drives\n[*]Guns must also be unloaded before crossing over any obstacle or before ever being handed to another person\n[*]Always check that your barrels are clear before loading the gun, and  never keep mixed calibre cartridges in your pockets. Putting a twenty  bore cartridge into a twelve bore and then placing another twelve bore  cartridge over the top of it is one of the most common shooting  accidents, and several people are lucky to only lose fingers every year;  for the less fortunate, the results can be fatal\n[*]When actually shooting driven birds, never swing the barrels through  the line of guns; always be aware of everybody else&#8217;s position. A shot  in a direction that could potentially endanger anybody else must never  be taken. A good rule is to make sure there is "sky" behind the bird  before firing\n[*]Most of these safety procedures are common sense but they must  always be strictly adhered to.

(392089, ' [QUOTE=Moeen;230015]Salam All,\nFirstly, if you fire those subsonic rounds, it means that you are firing lead rounds (unjacketed).  I don''t believe you have fired that many through it otherwise you would revise your statement.  Subsonic WILL clog up your firing Pin.  Read the article on the reliable feeding for P22, the way I did it, it fires EVERY Ammo EVERY time.\nSecondly, I agree with most when they say, that the p22 is not for HD.  In others case(s), agreed.  I, however, do carry and have been carrying either the Beretta 87 or the P22 for SD.  Reason, I now have experienced MY guns enough to realize whether or not they will fail and with which ammo.  \nSecondly, my position is this: if the FBI makes its agents qualify four times (shooting) a year to allow field work - and its been shown statistically that in a fire fight even they end up missing 40+% of the times... where does that leave us?  Hands shaking, nervous, sweating palms... etc etc I want a gun I can just hold without it slipping and pull the trigger repeatedly without jerky recoil and NOT taking my aim out of sight after the first round.  All I gotta worry about is the slightly nervous shaky hands, I have taken out most of the other variables for my gun.  This allows me to fire rapidly at vital areas only to bring the bad guy down...  i.e. Face or chest\nThen again this IS ONLY my way of thinking and has been now for over 20 years.[/QUOTE]\n\n\nFully agreed, i am quite inclined towards the factor that SD is totally a stance of defending yourself; not getting into a warzone, so that makes a reliable 22 a great companion..', ''),

(392093, ' Honestly picking one of these is not easy, as every one among these has something that makes it best for the specific scenario.\n\nBut If i have to pick one among these that would be O/U, Why?\n\nIt gives you a combination of chokes rather than a single choice as in semi-auto, which helps in getting a second shot at the bird which have reached out of your lower barrel choke range (especially when the shooter is like me i.e not among the quicker). SxS are usually light weight but comes in fixed chokes, i dont like this feature. I agree semi-auto are good for duck-shooting where u need multiple successive shot especially when the guns/shooters are limited. Apart from all these how can i forget the very easy maintenance of O/U n SxS. \n\nSingle trigger or double trigger doesn''t make any significant difference in hunting, but single trigger is convenient in Trap/Skeet Shooting. \n\nregards', '');

Contrary to popular belief, this wasn''t to prevent cracks, it was to  give the locking block a "wear surface" to operate on.They found that high round count guns would wear the aluminum frame in  the locking block operating surface and the guns would give locking  problems.\n\nTo allow military guns to shoot much higher amounts, later P1 guns also had a "''fat slide" to prevent slide cracks.\n  \nThis means no POF 2Z and Chinese 311 ammo in this gun.', ''),

(392303, ' Anaglyphical,\n\nMay I offer a suggestion. Look for someone  near you who is a "gun nut". If he is member of this group, he will be more than happy to go out with you and inspect the gun with you and for you. He will be able in a position to physically point to you what he is looking for. Here, word description alone would not suffice and would not make you a savvy used gun buyer. \n\nInitially, when I started buying used guns in the mid 1950''s, I got burned a few times. Through those mistakes I learned my lessons. I hope you will avoid my mistakes and learn from a pro who can teach you first-hand how to inspect the condition of a gun. \n\nUnless the used gun is military surplus, it is likely to have little "mileage" - shot very little. Cosmetics is something else - unless you are going into collecting guns. For practical use, a scratch on the wood stock should not be of concern. Neglect from improper storage and/or improper maintenance/cleaning techniques can ruin a good rifle. Usually, used guns are very good buys. Unless you are the kind (I am not) who likes to open a new gun box, I go for used guns. If I am in the market for one, a "good-buy" usually does not escape me.\n\nWhat kind/caliber gun are you looking for? Do you have a budget in mind. The gun pro who can assist you will need to know these points. Good luck to you on your hunt for a used gun.', ''),

Govts) so it is always viable to go to "YOUR DEALER" built a relationship and get it done a honorable cost.\n\nHonorable cost is, what both (You & your dealer) agrees including Govt. Fee (If Any), get out of city Lic also work but, WHY if you can have it at your door-step, I agree that KHI dealers do charge a bit-high, BUT do make them aware that if we move to HYD or any other city for our required task "THEN" what are they left with to do business ?\n\nLike in another thread I calculate a nominal cost as;\n\nGovt Fee (if Any) + Service Fee (Agent''s Service Fee to perform job + Dealers Charges to make things done at the their responsibility.)\n\nSo if the Govt. Fee is Rs 2,000 + then Service can be some where around 75% to 100% (Or in some cases up to 150%) but never above that,\n\nBrothers try to get your dealers to a nominal cost based upon the nature of work and Govt fee involved, incase of No Govt fee; then a cost somewhere 2,000 to 3,000 (like Section 144 Exception Permission)............\n\nDo try it, Hope this will work, as if we all try to set cost like this, there will sure be a "Calculated Way" in getting a true costing.\n\nRegards', ''),

Soon,they came back in claiming to have killed a bird which fell far-away in the Nallah. I snitched the rifle from them and ran outside with a pellet loaded. On a fruit tree and at a range of about 6 meters I saw a bird,took my first shot in a hurry as my brother was running after me, and much to his dislike, down went the bird after flying till my neighbor''s house. I received compliments from my Grandfather( my hunting teacher), and he promised me a reward, now I have forgotten what it was. Hunting always caught my attention and I used to love game meat (still do) which my elders used to give me. \nThen I progressed to a newer Chinese airgun, on to a .177 Diana 21, and finally a RWS 350 magnum.. In between I started shotgun hunting with my grandpa and uncle. Old hunting memories still fascinate me and I have made a small archive of as much as I could capture on camera.\n My first dove came after much desperation, utter hardship and a lot of time. One day one just came and sat on the "Dharaik" 10 yards away from me. I had my airgun in my hands (as usual on weekends), shot, down it came. I kept it in the freezer a few days just to have a glare of it. Finally went into my stomach. After that, MashAllah have shot hundreds of them and taken part in many hunts.', ''),

You press the trigger, but the round fails to ignite..... now in a semi auto, you have to take your one of your hands(in most cases your trigger hand) and pull back to load a new round, but with the pump action, your front hand is already ON the action of the bolt, all you have to do is pull back, push back and we''re ready.\r\nCase 2, you fire a round but round fails to eject, with the shell caught in your action, you again have to take one of your hands off the normal position and use force to clear the shell. With a pump action, you can exert more force just because of the posture you''re in.\r\nCase 3, you shoot, the case eject but the gun fails to feed the round. Once again the outcome should be predictable :)\r\n\r\nThe second thing that you pointed out of pump action guns jamming, but like you said they were local guns, the materials and engineering principles of production in these are mostly flawed(even more specifically, the ones that jam).

No issues whatsoever.\r\n\r\nAll this said, I am not saying that semi autos will ALWAYS jam, just that the probability of one jamming is higher(due to all the moving parts involved) than that of a pump action. Even a pump action can malfunction, just the probability is lower.

(392554, ' [QUOTE=Kamranwali;230982]Salam Trajan Bro,\nOk, consider this, you have a shotgun shouldered in a situation. You press the trigger, but the round fails to ignite..... now in a semi auto, you have to take your one of your hands(in most cases your trigger hand) and pull back to load a new round, but with the pump action, your front hand is already ON the action of the bolt, all you have to do is pull back, push back and we''re ready.\nCase 2, you fire a round but round fails to eject, with the shell caught in your action, you again have to take one of your hands off the normal position and use force to clear the shell. With a pump action, you can exert more force just because of the posture you''re in.\nCase 3, you shoot, the case eject but the gun fails to feed the round. Once again the outcome should be predictable :)\n\nThe second thing that you pointed out of pump action guns jamming, but like you said they were local guns, the materials and engineering principles of production in these are mostly flawed(even more specifically, the ones that jam). That''s why a GOOD pump action is recommended. I personally have used the DSA Shooter, a Remington 870 and a Winchester 1300. No issues whatsoever.\n\nAll this said, I am not saying that semi autos will ALWAYS jam, just that the probability of one jamming is higher(due to all the moving parts involved) than that of a pump action. Even a pump action can malfunction, just the probability is lower. Therefore I think the role of a semi auto is more in a hunt or on a range, where a failure can be tolerated, but in a SD situation, well I''ll just leave it your imagination. :)\n\n\nRegards.[/QUOTE]\n\nSounds like someone needs to practice malfunction clearances a bit more. Also that''s why you never rely on just one weapon in a HD and even in SD situation.', ''),

But parking is a problem.\n\nProcess was very very simple (no need to have reference ), which surprised me (I have old book form  license, if you have computerised license, process would be very  slightly change, but keep your original CNIC with you to get entry pass).\n\n1. Write an application to Section Officer Arms that:\n\nDate:\n\nThe Section Officer Arms\nHome Department\nGovt. of Sindh.\n\nSub: Conversion of Sindh License to All Pakistan.\n\nRespected Sir,\n\nI own All Sindh License # XXXXXX  for NPB issued by ___ dated ______.  Due to traveling needs and prevailing law and order situation you are  requested to allow me to convert the same into All Pakistan. You are  therefore requested to approve my application to convert my license to  "All Pakistan." My particulars are as under:\n\nName: \nLicense Number:\nIssue Date:\nIssued By:\n\n\nHuzaifa\n\n2. Go directly in the room of Mr. Peer Bux Chanjro and get your application approved by his one signature.\n\n3. Go to Computerised Arms Section room and show them your application, they  will give you formal printed letter addressed to "Manager National Bank of  Pakistan" for issuance of Challan for All Pakistan Conversion.\nTake this printout again to Mr Peer Bux he will sign on it, then get stamped it from the room just opposite to him.\n\n4. Get copied this approval letter (3 copies for safe side), License  Copy, CNIC Copy (2 numbers), and most important get National Bank  challan from the person sitting below the tree outside the Sind  Secretariat (Named Shah Ji, a beared person) who will charge Rs 10 for a  photocopy challan. NBP does not have challan form you have to buy from  outside.\n\n5. Go to National Bank Sind Secretariat branch (not FBR branch) which will open by 11 ''O Clock, along  with original letter of Mr Peer Bux and CNIC copy, Fill the challan form for Rs 2500 and pay Rs 2500 + 30. \n\n6. Get copied this paid challan (3 copies).\n\n7. Go to the room opposite Mr Peer Bux they will stamp your license and  will write some record on this stamped  area, then get signature of Mr Peer  Bux Chahjro at this stamped area on your own. \nAgain get photocopy of this page.\n\n8. Get Complete license copy (if not already done) including recently  signed/stamped page, CNIC copy, paid challan copy and go again in the same room  (opposite to Mr Peer Bux) and give them these photocopies. \nThey will record your license entry in a register and allot you a number in stamped area.\n\nNOW YOU ARE DONE:)', ''),

Chinese airguns, as I know, are not durable and the claimed fps is highly exaggerated. The springs wear off after a few hundred shots. Even if I was going to get a Chinese airgun, I''d get a Stoegar or Ruger. However as I have not experienced the gun you are talking about, I can''t comment, personally I''d never par 35k or 28k on a Chinese airgun, that too which I have never heard of. The choice is yours.\r\n The appearance of the regular 350magnum can be seen in my other thread:- Raised cheek-piece, Rubber recoil pad, checkering, and cheap iron sights.\r\n What I love about the classic variant is the long-sleek finely-grained stock, which makes the gun more balanced than the other one mentioned, though weight difference is just 200 grams or so (classic is just 200 grams lighter). Secondly it has no recoil pad. Thirdly, I like the fiber optic sights. Recoil difference is just due to fine tuning of this gun, I think it has a 20% milder recoil than the other one I had. The raised cheek piece on the other 350mag made shooting pleasure less. The stock used to hit my jaws. Probably this was due to the barrel slightly tilting upwards, should be fine. Overall, I like the classic 350 much more and it''s prettier.\r\n To utilize the power, a scope is a must.', ''),

On a fruit tree and at a range of about 6 meters I saw a bird,took my first shot in a hurry as my brother was running after me, and much to his dislike, down went the bird after flying till my neighbor''s house. I received compliments from my Grandfather( my hunting teacher), and he promised me a reward, now I have forgotten what it was. Hunting always caught my attention and I used to love game meat (still do) which my elders used to give me. \nThen I progressed to a newer Chinese airgun, on to a .177 Diana 21, and finally a RWS 350 magnum.. In between I started shotgun hunting with my grandpa and uncle. Old hunting memories still fascinate me and I have made a small archive of as much as I could capture on camera.\nMy first dove came after much desperation, utter hardship and a lot of time. One day one just came and sat on the "Dharaik" 10 yards away from me. I had my airgun in my hands (as usual on weekends), shot, down it came. I kept it in the freezer a few days just to have a glare of it. Finally went into my stomach. After that, MashAllah have shot hundreds of them and taken part in many hunts.[/QUOTE]\n\nNice Share Brother.', ''),

Add in other benefits, such as the new Speed Lock Forearm with express locking mechanism and Turnkey Magazine Plug, and the Browning Maxus becomes the finest, most reliable semiautomatic shotgun ever made.\n[url]http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ao3snIvShs[/url]\n\nEdit: Here''s another one\n[url]http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJmwYBImLqc&feature=player_embedded[/url]', ''),

Well, my purpose was to know of your experience, not to challenge your ratings, as such. So, very kind of you to explain your methods and experiments. We need more of such, preferably with photographic support, whenever in the field, as that say''s lot more than the verbal resume.\n\nWe''ve experimented with a few, inclusive of Magtech Brazil, Armscor, Prvi Partizan, and I shall post a link to the thread by the bottom of this post, as per your kind request.\n\nAs regards my own wording quoted by your good self above, well, let me say, those words -[I] if understood correctly from my post in separate thread[/I] - were meant for the Prvi Partizan one, about which I stated that it [I]was compromising on the expansion[/I], in favour of reliability, as well as [I]adaptability[/I] to specific feeding ramps of some handguns. The Armscor ones expand much better, if only your gun accepts these. I just did not like the cosmetic appearance of these, wrt the non-uniform tip cavity from round to round.\n\nWe''ve not tested the S&B round so far, yet I assume it should expand reasonably well. I intend to do a review of this one at earliest convenience, since it''s an expensive round, the mushrooming capability of which should be determined for the good of our community. It stands at Rs. 120 per round as of now, hence the double of all other rounds. I truly hope it delivers commensurately well.\n\nAs regards your notions on the Barnaul, well, I''d like to see the substantiated proofs of it being good or better than the rest, coz I''ve my doubts on it''s mushrooming capability at the heavy grainage of 145. A Jhp round requires a high muzzle velocity for best expansion, which I doubt the 145 grained would have.\n\nWe''ve found the Armscor one as the best with respect to expansion vs the Prvi Partizan. And I don''t quite think water gallons would give the desired mushrooming effect at impact. You''d need somewhat more solid an object to impact it on.\n\nThe Prvi and S&B, however, due to the sharper nosed profile would suit the more troublesome of handguns, with respect to positive feeding/extraction. \n\nI am of the view that in selecting a Jhp ammo, it''s expansion capability should be the foremost thing for consideration, and one must then experiment with a few that your handgun works best with, wrt to feeding reliability, lest you''re carrying one that does feed reliably, but yields no more results than an fmj!\n\nBelow our own review, conducted last year:\n\n[URL]http://www.pakguns.com/showthread.php?5205-9mm-vs-.45ACP-Which-caliber-do-you-prefer-and-Why&p=171741&viewfull=1#post171741[/URL]\n\nSome links on the Prvi Partizan, Sjhp''s:\n[URL]http://www.pakguns.com/showthread.php?6416-prvi-partizan-not-expanding-at-all-s[/URL]\n\n\nRegards.', ''),

(396547, '270 Winchester Designed by Winchester for their Model 54 bolt-action rifle and first marketed in 1925, the 270 caused quite a stir in shooting circles. It has remained somewhat controversial ever since. At that time, it offered better long-range potential than any big game cartridge generally available on the American market. It has now been adopted by practically every manufacturer of standard bolt-action high-powered sporting rifles in the world. The Remington slide actions and Remington and Browning semi-autos are also available in 270-caliber. The cartridge is based on the 30-06 case necked-down. It was a long time favorite of well-known gun writer the late Jack O''Connor, who probably contributed more popularizing the 270 than any other individual.\r\n\r\nAlong with the 30-06, this is one of the most accurate and effective all-round American big game cartridges. Its reputation and popularity have increased at a steady rate since its introduction. Although not intended as a varmint cartridge, the 270 will serve very well in that capacity when loaded with 100 grains. It is generally conceded to be a better long-range varmint cartridge than its parent, the 30-06. The original 130-grain bullet at over 3100 fps muzzle velocity is considered adequate by many experienced for any North American big game. When first introduced, some deer hunters complained that this bullet had such an explosive effect it ruined too much meat. To satisfy the "need" for a deer load, Winchester brought out a 150-grain bullet at the reduced velocity of 2675 fps. However, it was short-lived because the people who demanded it wouldn''t buy it. The present 150-grain bullet at 2900 fps is intended more for maximum penetration on such heavier animals as elk, moose or the big bears. Some disagree, but current evidence forces the conclusion that the 270 is adequate for any North American big game and many African plains animals as well. Assuming the hunter uses the proper bullet weight and type for the job at hand, the 270 will deliver reliable performance. In any comparison of the 270 with the 30-06, much depends on intended use and hunting conditions. For some reason, probably less recoil, many individuals shoot better with the 270 than the 30-06. The 270 is flatter shooting than the 30-06, and thus makes a better varmint/big game rifle where this is a consideration. The 30-06, with its 180, 200 and 220 grain bullets, is conceded a better woods, brush or heavy game caliber. In accuracy and general killing power, there isn''t a great deal to argue about. Anyone trying to make a big case for one against the other is beating a pretty dead horse.', ''),

If you have the kit please post some pics and also post some range result which was been shot after and before tuning the airgun . This will show the reult of the airgun .\n\nAlso what''s the procedure to get these kits ? Are they available easily in Pakistan. If yes i would like to know its price and from where to buy .\n\n Thanks[/QUOTE]\n\nDear Naveed,\n\nHere are some pics.\n\nHMO piston is an "O" ring type piston.  It is developed by "CCA" a company making products for airguners. This company has close relation with "Vortek".  Hence the product of CCA which is HMO piston is now being sold through Vortek as well.\n\n[U][B]Following is a review of HMO piston.[/B][/U]\n\n[I]"I have a 20 year old model 52 that I bought used (just to put the piston in  LOL!). When I got it, it was shooting 14.3 gr cp''s at 712 with an ES of 16, SD  of 4 for 10 shots...this translates to 16.1 fpe. This was stock piston, the  exact way I received the gun. I thought that was slow and that maybe the spring  was getting tired. Before HMO piston arrived I bought a JM monolith spring  to put in the gun. So I had that on hand. \n\nI received HMO piston  the other day and went ahead and tried the monolith spring on the factory guide.  This spring looks like a beast compared to the spring that came in the gun.  (BTW, I''m not 100% sure that the spring that came in the gun is an OEM spring,  but I THINK it is.) Anyways with the monolith spring the gun shot JSB heavies  which I weighed to be 18.2-18.3 gr. at 664 fps with an ES of 9 and SD of 3 for  10 shots- 17.8fpe. CP''s 14.3 gr, shot 748 with and ES of 10 and SD of 3 again  for 10 shots- 17.8 fpe. I did use the thinnest spacer provided...any more and  the spring would bind and the gun didn''t cock. Well, I took the monolith out  last night and put the original spring back in. (The monolith had taken a big  set and was quite a bit shorter than the original. It was unset when I bought  it.) So now with the original spring back in the gun and NO spacers used: JSB  heavies 710 avg, ES-3 SD-.81 for only 5 shots because it was beginning to rain  here. CP''s 801 AVG, ES-15, SD-4 for 10 shots. Both translate to 20.4 fpe!!! MUCH  BETTER than the stock piston!!! OVER 5 fpe gain with just the new piston  change!! \n\nBest of all the shot cycle is very nice...just a quick recoil  pulse...very, very smooth. In fact the shot cycle seemed to be identical to the  shot cycle of the monolith spring but with much more power- 17.8 fpe vs. 20.4  fpe. \nI would like to try a new OEM spring and may try to buy one in the  future. I do have another JM spring and guide coming from a wtb ad I placed on  the classifieds. The seller doesn''t know which JM kit it is, but it''s an old one  and doesn''t have a tophat just the rear spring guide. So, more testing to come.  \nregards."\n\n[/I]I think the above experience will help the readers to judge the benefits of HMO piston over Diana piston.\n\n[B][U]Vortek says[/U][/B]\n[U][B]Now I come to Vortek Kit[/B][/U]DYI tuning kits allow the air gun owner an inexpensive and simple, module tune kit to install. A self-contained drop-in system to correctly reduce piston and spring noise. In addition, most air guns quietly perform with increased velocity!\n\n The PG2 tuning kits come [B]complete with 3 guides[/B], ...mechanically tuned in the boundaries of the PG2 technology  that controls noise by homogenizing harmonics with-in and throughout the dampened dual-guide materials!\n\n Included in each kit: power spring, lubrication and instructions on how to install. No tight guides and tar! Full Power! \n[U][B]\nDiscussion[/B][/U]\nThere are two Kit makers in USA which are renowned.\n\n1. JM Maccari\n2. Vortek\n\nThe 3rd one is from UK\n3. V-Mach\n\nthese are world famous tuners and developers of unique tuning kits for different airguns.\n\nIn recent days, Vortek kits and HMO pistons have been proved to be the best.  \n\n[U][B]Price[/B][/U]\n\nHMO Piston      130$\nVortek PG2 Kit   79$\n\nThese prices are without shipment charges which are normally 11$.\n\nI know it is difficult to spend extra 130$ on an airgun but if some one has got funds, its worth using.  If an airgunner is really a gun lover, he will love this piston as it increases power without increasing recoil.\n\nThe rest of airgunners who cannot spend that much and have  Diana 34, 48, 52, 54, 56th, 460 or 350 can move to Vortek PG2 kit by spending 79$.  This is I think a one time investment after which if some one feels that power level has decreased due to years of usage of gun, the replacement spring price is just 17$. This spring will fit in the tuning kit.\n\nVortek kit is unique because it uses 3 guides.  While Diana uses only one guide.  3 Guides reduces the recoil and the gun becomes very accurate without compromising on power.\n\nEven if some one using Diana 54 puts this kit in, the firing behavior improves a lot.\n\nThis is a world wide practice.  These people are specialist in making these parts and in US a lot of people buy a new gun and replace its spring with the PG2 tuning kits and throw the original spring away.  That much is the difference between original Diana springs and Vortek product.\n\nI am using PG2 kit in my Diana 54.  \n\nI also want to give this knowledge to all other Pakistani airguners so that they could also get the best use of there airguns.\n\nSpecially the users of 350, 460 and 34 need to put Vortek kit in their guns.  If some one like the other way, JM maccari kits can also be their choice but those kits are difficult to install and technology wise Vortek is superior.  But JM Maccari kits also give very good results.\n\nI am here to help the airgunners in technical aspects.\n\nI think now we should discuss such things and improve our guns.\n\nWelcome to all', ''),

(393070, ' I carry both chambered and with the chamber empty, depending on the situation. I only chamber a weapon when expecting eminent danger. \n\n However, the only times I do carry a chambered handgun, I do so only with a gun with a decocker. So I carry my PT99 or Stoeger Cougar with a round in the chamber, the hammer down with the decocker lever [U]and[/U] the safety on. In my humble opinion, it is not worth the risk to carry a chambered weapon in any other manner. By decocking the weapon the trigger pull becomes much longer and reduces the chances of accidentally pulling the trigger, especially in a high stress situation. With the weapon chambered and the hammer decocked, it is a fairly easy to get the gun out of the holster and ready to fire with one hand in this manner. All one needs to do is turn the safety off and you are ready to fire in double action. As a personal preference I prefer the safety on the PT 99 as it is much easier for me to access. \n\nI would never carry my Norinco 636 or my Baikal Viking in this manner as both guns come without a decocker. It is possible to manually lower the hammer in both by pulling the trigger while holding the hammer back with your thumb and [U]carefully[/U] lowering the hammer, however that in its own is a very risky procedure. Therefore, in conclusion the only way I carry a chambered hangun is when the handgun has a decocker lever.', ''),

(393082, 'AKDAL MKA 1919 semi-auto ShotGun Let me introduce my new AKDAL MKA 1919 semi automatic shotgun which I bought from Badruddin, Rwp at Rs. 57K in October 2011. Reviews about this gun were not available in Pakgun, though one of the members has purchased it with Akkar but didn''t post any review. \n\nWhen I started searching this one then most of the dealers (rather all the dealers in Saddar and Chota Bazar) didn''t know anything about this gun. Only Badruddin knew it and even sold some pieces and he was very negative about this gun. As per his views, this gun does not load the cartridge (specially Pakistani), but as he didn''t have the gun so I just had to wait. Finally, he got one frm somewhere for me, it was 2011 production and he said that it didn''t have any such issues which were there in 2010 version. \n\nHe gave me the gun on 57K (Islamabad dealers were demanding 75K) and when I wanted to buy imported cartridges then he suggested to go for Shaheen and said these won''t be a problem.\n\nGun came with 2 Mags (3" and 2 3/4") of 5 which, i think, makes it 5+1. There were three chokes, full/modified/cylinder bore, don''t exactly know when and why to use them ... \n\nI have fired some 45+ Shaheen 4 No. and except one FTL (Load), 19th, everything seemed perfect. I categorize one feeding failure as the imperfection of the shaheen cartridge. As per my experience, Recoil is less than 2 Barrel and Pump Action with Stocks. Two times it didn''t lock-back the bolt (or whatever you guys call it, i don''t know these techinical terms) ... \n\nIt does not seem much heavy and it is the piece one should have. I cannot say that it is any threat to Saiga but, no doubt, it is something one wishes to have and fire. \n\nI will be trying to have a detailed review of its shooting as you guys are accustomed of here in pakgun. My shooting area is some 15-20 minutes drive frm my place, a village having mountains and I target bushes which, unortunately, are the worst thing to shoot at, no clue where the fire hit.\n\nEnd of too much of bak bak ... here are few pictures from my mobile ...

The gradient of Rainbow 35 (of velocity reduction) is the steepest I have seen, 1000 shots, and it''s useless... unless you get a new spring and get it installed from the gun-smith in Saddar Pindi. He has the springs available, including labor cost was like 400 rupees.\n Gamo airguns have much more velocity in the beginning, around 715 fps for Shadow 1000 in .22, and I think after 5000-7000 shots, the need for a new spring would arise, but still the guns performance would be much better at that stage than the Rainbow''s would be.', ''),

Especially, when you know that you''re about to do some money transaction/carry cash/carry valuables - [I]or[/I]- entering the [I]devil''s domain[/I].\n\nVigilance of surroundings is an absolute must, so if you feel this is not necessary in the environment that you''re about to embark upon, there''s no need to carry a handgun at all - chambered or not.\n\nA gun in that situation would not have helped you at all - if being in the comfort zone.

In your case, I''d have thrown the wallet at their feet, and drawn the gun only if I felt a personal treat. Petty cash doesn''t even warrant a warning shot, I agree.\n\nI must say, we''re very prone to get into the comfort zone easily - and that''s basically what an ideal life should allow us too.

Within an hour or so we bagged 10 grey partridges. The birds were in very good numbers. I missed five or six birds in the beginning otherwise our bag would have been even better. By noon we bagged 25. We had lunch and rested for a while as the area was very hard. We started our shoot again by 3pm and were able to bag 55 birds in total,10 lost even that we had two dogs.

(393257, ' @AK47\nSir, I completely agree with your assessment. As I had written earlier, I personally carry chambered but with the safety on; I do so because I can easily reach & manipulate the safety lever with my thumb without having to break my grip or use my reaction hand (the advantage of having rather large hands :) ). Infact, I''ve gotten into the practice where I switch the safety off as I''m drawing from the holster.\n\nI''ve been told by some people on a few occasions that carrying chambered is "unsafe". Quite frankly, if a chambered firearm is unsafe in your possession, then you''re definitely [B]NOT[/B] competent enough to carry in the first place and [B]SHOULD LEAVE THE GUN AT HOME UNDER LOCK & KEY![/B] I personally believe that a majority of altercations can be resolved and/or diffused peacefully, without having to rely on punitive force. But, on the rare occasion when I may be forced to defend my life or the lives of my loved ones, then I will have absolutely no qualms about resorting to violence. In such a situation, my primary objective will be to neutralize the threat as quickly, efficiently and effectively as possible. And that means drawing my firearm and getting the shot off at the threat in as little a time frame as possible. The only way I can do that is if I minimize the time it takes between my weapon hand landing on my holstered firearm to getting the shot off at the target. Having to rack the slide, especially under dynamic stress where my life hangs in the balance, simply adds a whole series of wasted motions and wasted time.\n\nA firearm, IMHO, is carried primarily for personal safety & protection, irrespective of any imminent threats or not. If your firearm is [B]NOT[/B] in a "shoot-ready" condition as soon as it leaves the holster, then it''s nothing more than a glorified paper-weight. Period.', ''),
(393255, ' First of all, I presume carrying any pistol without a round in the chamber, implies the assumption that [I]if you need the gun to defend yourself, you will have the time and ability to chamber a round[/I]. Humbly, this is not a safe assumption in my opinion and can prove fatal as well, seriously.\n\nI know that quite a lot of you - [I]as evident from the red graph above[/I] - feel uncomfortable carrying your handgun in chambered mode. Yet, an unchambered gun - IMHO - puts you at a severe[I] disadvantage[/I][B] if you were to ever need it[/B],[B] [COLOR=#ff0000]which in my opinion, is the whole point of carrying it in the first place[/COLOR][/B]!\n\n If the need isn''t there, the whole point of carrying a handgun - chambered or not - is kind of literally[I] offset[/I]. I wouldn''t carry my handgun just for the habit or fun of it, or just because I''ve been sanctioned a license for it and can do so. In that case, it better be kept oiled n'' greased back in the closet.\n\n I observed quite a few replies in the preceding posts that "[B][COLOR=#0000cd][I]It doesn''t take too long to chamber your handgun when you need it[/I][/COLOR][/B]". Well, probably. But, It''s not just the few seconds, it''s the fact that under stress, studies have proven that nervous hands [I]can[/I] tend to do half racking (failure to properly chamber) as one of the concerns.\n\n  Furthermore, It takes a lot of experience and training to rack the slide and get a round off in a[I] stressful situation[/I] without having either an accidental discharge or failure.[B] [COLOR=#ff0000]Remember, you''re not watching yourself in front of the mirror and doing draw practice, you''re standing before a guy who''s there to harm you, one way or another[/COLOR].[/B] I personally wouldn''t take the risk, and rather prefer to have my stuff in a "ready-to-go" mode. In a vehicle, it''s of even greater importance, to have it "stand-by", ready to go.\n\n  The usefulness of [B]one hand free [/B]also can be very important as well and the racking of the handgun does imply - even if just for a fractional moment of time - [B]that you''re using both hands[/B]. Now, what if the would-be attacker is on top of you before you know it and at bad breath distance? Do you really think you can draw and rack or draw and disengage a thumb safety as well, if employed?? \n[B]\nAlso, how would we fend off an assailant with one hand[/B], would you ask him: "[B][COLOR=#0000cd]Hey, wait a second, let me just rack up this thing first[/COLOR][/B]"? Remember, the adrenaline is running high and you''re again not standing in front of your mirror, but in front a live, nasty, probably psychologically bewildered [COLOR=#ff0000][B]potential threat[/B][/COLOR]!\n \nAny number of things could easily prevent you from having both hands free to chamber a round, even if for the need of having a hand to keep the attacker off you, so that you can draw the darn thing out of the holster with the other.\n[B][COLOR=#0000cd]\n I personally know of two incidents of friends who were snatched away of their guns during this racking up time-delay.[/COLOR] [/B]One was an [B][COLOR=#ff0000][SIZE=5]ex. Army Major[/SIZE][/COLOR][/B], being stripped off his Beretta 92, and returned only after hectic jirga requests.\n\nAnother incident (2 weeks ago) was of 3 guys being stripped off of 2 handguns, one pump action, after one of them had been [I]neutralized[/I] and other 2 had to give up their drawn weapons. Can you imagine what could have happened in these two incidents, had the other party been adequately [I]junooned[/I] up??!! Hence, practical business is quite different from home-brewed theories, about having "enough of time", etc. Not to say, that you necessarily draw a chambered handgun to kill, but to say, that even a timely warning shot can deter quite a lot.\n\n I am therefore, humbly, of the opinion, that If you''re not going to chamber it at all, you''re really just carrying excessive paper weight.\n\n I do not - as stated before - have any experience with "Safe Action" Glock type of handguns. Yet, with a total trigger travel of 12.5mm only (Caracal''s being 8mm only), I certainly would be more cautious with chambered carry of those and ensure that I got just the right type of holster, preferably Kydex type that cannot interfere with the trigger, like cloth getting in the way.\n\n[COLOR=#ff0000][B]As far as DA/SA handguns are concerned, I''m of the opinion that the 10-12 lbs double action itself is safety enough.\n[/B][/COLOR]\n  Let me know, if anything of above appears as unfounded by some reasonable logic. I carry it chambered friends, with or without reasons of enmity.\n\n Thanks again for gracing this thread with your valuable inputs. Awaiting more opinions.\n\n\n Regards.', ''),

(393272, ' Hi Pak Gunners,\n\nI am not quite sure about the procedures outside of Pakistan, so I will take the word of Chaudhry as good advise, but when you reach Pakistan with the airgun, things are not simple anymore. \n\nRecently one of my friends bought a DIANA 350 Magnum .177 Cal from UAE, and so far he could not find a way to bring it to Pakistan. As per the information which he has received from some one in Pakistan Customs is that you need to be a member of a registered sports club / body in Pakistan or in the country from where you are carrying the airgun. This sports body / club needs to issue a letter in favour of the person carrying the airgun that he is authorized to import the airgun for sporting purposes.\n\nWhat happens now with my friend will be known in a couple of weeks, as he has no such membership and currently he is in UAE and will travel back to Pakistan in a couple of weeks. I will update on this forum whether or not he manages to bring the airgun to Pakistan without any problem. \n\nAnother of my friends, based in Germany who happens to be an "Airgun Doctor", and is a professional match player recently brought an FX Royal with him to Pakistan, and he was talking about the long procedure he had to go through in Germany to get permission to export the airgun out of Germany temporarily, as he intended to take the airgun back with him on his return from Pakistan. I noticed that there was an A4 sized sheet on his airgun case, with his club membership details and exact flight itinerary. Since he did all the paper work in Germany, he had no problem with Pakistan Customs. Based on this, we can deduce that there might not be any problem if you are a member of a sports club outside of Pakistan.\n\nFor those looking for importing an airgun into Pakistan from Canada, please note that in Canada, all airguns having muzzle velocities over 500fps are licensed, and the procedure is too complex to export a licensed gun outside of Canada.\n\nAs for the airgun pellets, I got around 4kg of different pellets from Canada recently, which were in the luggage and no one even bothered to check these at Islamabad airport, perhaps due to the over crowding at the airport due to Hajj Flights or some other reason.', ''),

For me, personally, it makes no sense to carry unchambered (as I''ve already mentioned in a previous post), irrespective of what the law & order situation is. As long as I am not violating any laws and local rules (like weapons not being allowed in a bank), I will continue to carry a chambered firearm. The whole objective of carrying a firearm to protect yourself from any harm or danger, actual or perceived. And if faced by such danger, my gun should be ready to go "hot" as soon as it comes out of the holster.

An LEA is rarely attacked upfront. You don''t move up in front of a cop and shoot him down just like that. Instead, the LEA usually is the "chasing" sort of a guy, rather than the "chased". This allows him timely, [I]anticipatory[/I] response.  \n\nMay I just say, of what I''ve come to know, even in the USA, only fewer of shooting instructors advise un-chambered carry. At least, quite many of them advise chambered. This course, to those who have been trained proficiently well in handling of fire-arms and their courses are usually extensive as well. IMHO, a passing out from such should be mandatory even here in Pakistan, before issuance of licenses. \n\n[B]@Denovo87.[/B]........Thanks Denovo bro for joining in here, you for sure have been missed. I respect your stance fully, inasmuch as I respect Dr. Zakir Sb''s for un-chambered carry. I agree with both of you, if the "danger zones" could be avoided as much as possible, leave alone chambered carry, the carrying itself is needless.\n\nI do not however agree with the higher risk of accidental discharge when carrying chambered, especially not from the hands of such experts, coz I still believe, the trigger of a gun will never pull itself. Hence, the gun is safe to carry, only the carrier himself is a danger.\n\nI must say, I do not advise the "sometimes chambering" stance at all. The habit has to be [I]singular[/I] and [I]uniform[/I], either carry chambered, or don''t carry chambered. The "sometimes" habit bears the risk that you may forget the status of your gun, either loading or unloading of same. Hence it may be un-chambered when you need it at the most, or remain chambered when you don''t need it all! Moreover, it will require more frequent chambering/unloading and hence higher risk of unintended discharge, irrespective of presence the decocker.\n\nRegards.', ''),

(393412, ' [QUOTE=]... But they know that these boars will run over them eventually during some night.... So they appreciate long as you are using a valid hunting license...\n[/QUOTE]\nI beg to differ.\nI have seen hundreds of herds of wild boars in Islamabad... They start roaming in the Nallahs sometimes just as Maghribh prayers are being offered, or till the sun settles down. The time when I have seen them frequent roads and streets more often is like 10:00- onwards.\nIt was a moonless mid-night, we were coming from somewhere and passed by this main road of a sector adjacent to a green belt. There we saw 6 boars consuming trash from a drum at the side of the road. We stopped our car with our headlights beamed at them, but they were too busy adding some pounds to their weight :) , our car was hardly 3 feet away from them. 2 of those were white, and extra heavy-weights.\nI have also seen some people who routinely walk on trails made in these green belts, especially foreigners, they have clubs and torches, and are very comfortable walking in the wilderness, in the darkness of the (jungle).\n Boars in my village, as soon as they spot a vehicle run away and are generally lighter than the ones in the capital territory. Probably they have no threat of getting shot by people, have a lot of grasses/herbs/bushes to nibble on (and a lot of trash :D). They also know the peaceful nature of people residing in that area unlike those in villages, who chase boars along with their dogs and trap them.\n(This is just my observation)\np.s it''s their (the policemen''s) duty to stay awake all night and safeguard the neighborhood. If the boars ever do run over them, it''s their fault, had they been awake, they could have used the tools they have. (PB''s as well as NPB''s :) )', ''),

I see white collard people daily indulged in road rage and by seeing their vicious behavior I always thank God that none of the two opted to carry a chambered gun ;) so everything ends in [I][B]slinging the mobiles[/B][/I] to call backup instead of [I][B]slinging loaded Rami''s[/B][/I]  that would end one in police station n other in morgue ;)[/QUOTE]\n\n1+ Denovo bro,\n\ni agree with Faisji bro regarding having enough practice where your gun becomes an extension of you, but sir i wish we all could have the opportunity and the means of practicing to that level which in our dear Homeland is non existent.', ''),

(393516, 'Citadel M1911 Imported to US by Legacy Sports International So, earlier this year I competed in the Texas Limited Championships, and won the Single Stack Division.  The prizes for this division win were a belt-buckle; gold and silver with saphires (small gems and electroplated I am certain, but it looks nice), and a Citadel M1911, imported to the US by Legacy Sports, International.  I understand this gun to be of Phillipine manufacture along the lines of Rock Island Armory.\r\n\r\n[url]www.legacysports.com[/url]\r\n\r\nThe factory stock pistol came with a extended beaver tail, raised grip safety, ambi-dexterous thumb safety, Novak style sights, and wooden grips.  The trigger was breaking rather clean at about 5 lbs, with a little creep.  For a free gun I wasn''t complaining.\r\n\r\nI had won a certificate for a fourth place finish in Single Stack at the Area 4 Championships from XS sights.  I placed my order for the XS standard dots with tritium inserts.  When they arrived, on they went.\r\n\r\n[url]www.xssights.com[/url]\r\n\r\nI had some VZgrips, Operators II, recently removed from my Kimber, so they went on.  Those looked really good.\r\n\r\n[url]http://vzgrips.com/gun-grips/1911-pistol-grips-1/operators-ii-2[/url]\r\n\r\nFinally I added a magwell from Wilson Combat, ordered from Midway USA.  I took a Dremel and file to that magwell to make it "just right."  It took removing a little material from the underneath side of the grips to match the "hooks" on the magwell, but that was as simple as tracing the outline and working it out with the Dremel tool.\r\n\r\nI noted that I wasn''t getting a positive engagement of the grip safety, I placed a small strip of aggressive skateboard tape over the bump on the grip safety which semi-permanently holds the grip safety down.  It''s also made the gun feel a little more secure in the hand.\r\n\r\nDuring some early test firing I found encountered a few rounds which nose-dived into the feed ramp.  I took the firearm to my gun smith and told him to do what he needed to ensure the rounds feed reliably.  He built up the mag catch a bit to raise the magazine higher in the gun and polished the feedramp.  Since then the only faliure to feeds have been with a specific magazine and I don''t attribute the error to the gun but rather an issue with that particular magazine.\r\n\r\nThe gun shoots great.  I have no complaints.  At 7 yards/21'' It will print a single hole if the shooter is up to the task.  I''ve shot 2" groups at 15 yards, resting my arms on my gun bag.  The trigger is not that of my Kimber Super Match II or my wife''s Kimber Custom II... but you won''t pay the same price either.  It''s been to the range a number of times for practice sessions and fired in one IDPA competition.  Until the sights were adjusted, it was shooting left, but now it fires right at point of aim.\r\n\r\nThe XS sights take some getting used to, but for quick sight acquisition they are just the trick.  The tritrium night sights make them a smart bed-stand or carry choice.  They line up like the letter, "i" with the front sight being a glowing dot, and the rear sight being a glowing straight line.\r\n\r\nFor a 1911 that can be had for about $500 US this was a surprisingly well crafted gun.  It had a little play with downward pressure on the barrel hood.  The factory allignment of the sights on the slide to the barrel was off and required some adjustment.  The trigger was the most notable part of the gun- very nice for a low end 1911.  My smith who mostly works as a 1911 trigger smith said it could use a little polishing but nothing of the trigger screamed for immediate work or replacement.\r\n\r\nIf you are looking for a entry level 1911 with very good for the money trigger and features, consider this 1911 from Citadel.', ''),

You should plan for it to sudden, loud, bloody, violent, messy, and frightening as hell.  You''ll want to be able to draw and shoot in as little time as possible with as little bother as necessary.  The more you have to do under the stress of you or your loved one''s dieing the next second the more you can muck up.  I think a Glock with chamber loaded or 1911 with big thumb safety well practiced is ideal.\r\n\r\nI think that if you fear the loaded gun you are likely admitting you need more practice. The practice buildings confidence and instills a certain sense of security.  That fear of the loaded gun is like dreams about drawing your gun to shoot a bad guy and the trigger feels like it''s a 2000 lb pull, the gun is not loaded, or the shots don''t stop the bad guy.  This is your puppy brain telling your conscious mind it wants more range time.  "Protect me, daddy" is what it is screaming.\r\n\r\nLaws differ from location to location, State by State here in the US.  But most of the time the law requires a "immediate" need.  If you really had time to draw and rack, was it immediate?  Maybe it wasn''t.  I think the idea that we carry because we only "might" need to use the handgun is deceiving.  We should carry as if we "know" we are going to need to use and thank God everynight when didn''t that day and every morning when we didn''t the night before.  Not having that mind set is leaving you open to the frozen mind that comes with not believing it can happen.  You should make the mental check a number of times a day- it can happen.  As you leave your house remind yourself that a bad guy might be encountered on the way to the car, not just in the car on the way to work.  Remind yourself at least once at work that anytime the door opens it could require a violent response to a violent attack.  As you leave work make the same life-saving reminder.  When the unexpected visitor darkens your entryway at home in the evening, prepare your mind for the worst and enjoy anything less.  \r\n\r\nBe polite to every stranger, but have a plan to kill them.  I know that sounds mean.  I know that sounds paranoid.  But in reality it makes me offer a polite greeting to all I met, they don''t know I''m considering shooting them, at least for a moment.\r\n\r\nSure, the heavy fighting might ought to be left to the hired guns, but ultimately you have the responsibility to save yourself and your loved ones.  If the hired guns fail, you don''t get to blame them, you have to blame yourself.  I am the last and final layer of protection, and reality, the only real layer of protection for me and mine.  The police arrive to photograph the blood stains.  I can''t afford highered guns.  But I can afford to practice at least once a week with live ammo and dry practice is free all the time.  What''s your life and those of your family worth to you?  Twenty draws and reload practices a week? Really, you can''t afford that?  Some dry fire trigger time while watching the news? A box of ammo once or twice a month even?  It costs you nothing to mentally steel yourself that badness can happen and have a mental picture of yourself handling it.', ''),

In 40k you can get a 350 magnum which is a hundred times better than Diana 35 IMO. Accuracy of Rainbow 35 is nowhere near Diana 35 without scope, mainly due to un-adjustable iron sights.

Got the gun in .......... probably October, 2011. In Karachi you can get the quotes from 60k to 85k (for black colored gun), and if you don''t know inside out, you have to pay the price. This is the way Karachi armour market works. The largest dealer "Haris" (at DHA-2 Extension) advised me a price of Rs. 85K while innocently asserting that AKDAL MKA 1919 is available only with one mag. Perhaps they might be dealing in magz separately as well :p. You can understand what I mean. :) Anyway.\n\nPls note that black colored MKA 1919 is cheaper by almost Rs. 10k than the AKDAL MKA 1919 CAMO that is available in a camouflaged painting/color . However, there is no technical difference at all except for color''s variation......and to my choice black looks awesome.\n\nJust to point out, the prices of all guns at Karachi are always higher than the prices of Lahore and Islamabad by around Rs 5k to Rs. 10k. Therefore, buying at Rs. 59K, looks a good deal. :)\n\n@Armughan, jiggar you very well know why the gun has missed a detailed testing so far despite having been bought around 2-3 months back. :) I have a provincial license which, reportedly, is not so eagerly welcomed by Navy''s shooting club therefore, I have not tried that option.

It turned out to be my old [B]Stevens .22 LR[/B] rifle ! Hadn''t seen it in decades ! Seeing this rifle took me back many years, it was the first gun I remember shooting. I think I was 3 years old and had not even started school yet, every morning I got the treat to shoot 10 rounds of Winchester (the yellow box) in my front lawn. Those were the good old days and there were empty fields (which is now main DHA road) beyond my house in Cantt, Lahore. I looked at the Rifle closely and found it in a bad state. It had not been maintained or even touched for 20 years, was just lying around in stuff without a cover. Also when it fell, the sight broke. \n\nI thought for old time sake and nostalgia reasons this rifle deserves to be restored. You don''t see Stevens stuff around anymore as I  think 80 years ago or so it was merged into Savage Arms. This model was also  sold with Springfield and Savage stampings. A interesting fact which some  new friends might not know is that Stevens was the inventor of the .22  LR round. \n\nAnyway since I''m not the fiddling around type nor  interested in much beyond shooting firearms I thought I should hand over  the Stevens to our resident "Hands on Expert" [B]12G [/B]and present it as a  challenge.

I have not shot it but it seems to function fine. The Challenge details below:\n\n[B]The Budget : Rs. 25,000[/B]\n\nCondition 1).

Not spending a Ruppee more than 25k. No cheating :nono:\nCondition 4). Time to build approx 45 days (Must be Finished by 1st of Feb 2012) \n\nOther than the 4 things above you have complete control over everything else.

I mean distance, guns/caliber allowed, shots per participant/round, target size, scoring etc?[/QUOTE]\n\nOnly our beloved Denovo could add humour to the subject.\nWell\nRange 15 meters\nTgts 4 inch diameter  6 clay discs (used for Kheer Thuthi )\nThere are two sets of 6 clays each suspended at shoulder height by steel wire.\nWeapon Auto pistols of Caliber, 7.62x 25, or 9mm X 19\nTwo names are drawn out of a hat and the two shooters whose names pop out get to the firing stands, Starting position is  two hands grip allowed  with gun at 45 degrees on the command are you ready.\nAt the command Fire both shooters commence firing and the shooter who shoots all six first is the winner, the number of rounds do not count.\nThis is a tough discipline as there is a lot of Time Pressure. This event brings out the importance of  balancing Accuracy with Speed. As most of us gun nuts are suckers for buzz words or catch phrases, so" Take Your Time in a Hurry" is the catch phrase as some one put it for speed shooting events.\nThis is a man against man match ( Two fine Ladies blew the pride of many macho chauvinist shooters though )\n ( Iram Rehman and Aisha Sajid ). Luck placed Aisha Sajid against one of the finest shooters early in the match and she bowed out gracefully having shot very well beaten by one target only.\nI guess I have been able to explain the essentials of the match. There is sudden death for the loser and the winner takes on the winner of the other duo.\nIt so happened that my own student ended up against me, beating all competition, since we were sharing the same gun, (my pride the Sig X6 ) I chose to let her shoot my X6 and Mr Naeem was kind enough to to loan me his X5, I checked the zero and found to my horror that it was zeroed at sub six where as in Rapid events I shoot point of  impact or centre. \nSo I started the match with two clean misses on first target and then dropped my sight to sub six and blew the first four targets in barely 2.5 seconds then a a miss on the 5th and then two targets in about 1.5 or 2 seconds. \nMy student Iram Rehman  a very talented and   tenacious shooter/gun fighter could only shoot 3 out of her 4 targets while I got all six of mine. We had given an advantage of 2 targets to these young ladies much to the chagrin of some of our male chauvinists.', ''),

(394051, 'Kimber .22 LR Conversion Kit On a whim last year I purchased a used Kimber .22LR conversion kit from a local gun store.  I paid about $275 US.  \r\n\r\nThese converstion kits are a complete upper which is placed onto your existing 1911''s frame and comes with one magazine.  The strongest selling point of these kits in my opinion are that they afford you trigger time on your favorite 1911- you shoot the same trigger, but with less recoil and for a whole lot less money.\r\n\r\nI quickly discovered why the kit was being resold used- many malfunctions.  But, unlike the previous owner I was unafraid to diagnose and fix the problem.  There was a lot of friction of the slide moving over the barrel hood during recoil.  So much so that it did not cycle fully and often did not pick up the next cartridge from the magazine.  I noted that by using a different slide stop the friction was reduced.  The "pin" portion of the slide stop was slightly smaller than that which came with the kit.  That did not completed reduce the malfucntions so out came the sand-paper.  After some time the slide was moving smoothly across the hood and the malfunctions ceased.\r\n\r\nThe kit is pretty much a standard 1911 configuration.  It has a slide which is milled from alluminum to make it lighter.  A barrell which is .45 caliber in circumference with a .22 caliber diameter hole.  A barrel bushing, recoild spring and guide rod complete the configuration.  The ejector on your 1911 .45 will not work on the .22.  Affixed to the barrel in an arm which extends rearward with a small extention on the end towards the center of the gun.  As the slide works rearward extracting in realtively normal fashion eventually the case strikes that small extention which acts as the ejector.\r\n\r\nI have fired probably 10,000 rnds through the conversion kit since it''s purchase.  When it becomes very dirty or dry the malfunctions start.  It is also very finicky to ammo and limp-wristing.  My kit perfers Federal ammo but not Winchester, and like most 1911s- the wetter the better.\r\n\r\nRecently I fired it for accuracy at 15 yards.  These shots were fired at 15 yards, standing, two-handed but otherwise unsupported at the “little blue man” on a B27 Law Enforcement target.  The target with 15 shots measures about 1.75” by 2.25”.  The second group of 11 shots measures 1.5” by 2.5”.  I hit the "little blue dude" with 13 out of 15 and 10 out of 11 respectively.\r\n\r\nThe Kimber .22LR conversion kit was mounted on a Citadel M1911 frame.  The ammo was Federal Target Grade .22LR, 36 grn.  It was 65 degrees and relatively still, and partially cloudy.\r\n\r\nIF available, I recommend the .22 conversion kits.  They provide a lot more shooting for the same ammo cost.  You benefit from shooting the same trigger.  Also, .22 competions are fun.  Children and adults both can learn to shoot on a low recoil, low report, low blast firearm allowing them to focus on fundamentals when full powder firearms may distract the shooter with the louder booms, more violent recoil and larger flash of gunpowder.', ''),

If threatened with a gun pointed at you there are but two choices.  1) Total Compliance: hope for the best, beg for mercy.  Leave the outcome largely to him.  Your actions will either tend to motivate the person with the gun to not shoot you if he is already inclined not to shoot you, or, shoot you if he is already inclined to shoot you.  2) Total War!  You move, you draw, and you fight!  You influence the outcome to the greatest degree you can.  Your actions will either tend to motivate the person with the gun to not shoot you if he is already inclined not to shoot you, or, shoot you if he is already inclined to shoot you.  You can not know and therefore cannot say that the fight option will make the person shoot you who was not going to shoot you.\r\n\r\nIf something indicates compliance would end the situation, I might opt for compliance.  If I had any indication he was headed toward violence then I would bring everything in my arsenal to change that end.\r\n\r\nWhat is for certain is that the act of chambering the round will delay your ability to influence the person pointing the gun at you.  Very few people can chamber that round in less than one second, most will add about 2 seconds to the situation... do we really wish to give the man pointing the gun at us two more seconds to shoot us?  I prefer not to.\r\n\r\n[quote]secondly it would be  individual confidence in carrying a chambered gun .[/quote]\r\nWith much respect I completely agree.  It should always remain an individual''s decision and persons on both sides of this discuss have no business declaring only one carry method should be exercised.  We can only offer our observations and opinions and let them decided.\r\n\r\n[quote]thirdly decision to carry a chambered weapon will also depend upon the circumstances , going to  a known danger zone where chances for encounter are more or traveling late at night   then chambered gun is preferable. as i am not dealing with these situations so i prefer to carry unchambered weapon.[/QUOTE]\r\n\r\nWith much respect, I agree again.

(394088, ' @StevenCline\nPersonally, I think the reason the majority of people carry unchambered here in Pakistan is a combination of a lack of confidence in carrying a "hot" weapon and the misplaced belief that you''ll be afforded time to rack the slide smack in the middle of a gunfight.\n\nThe fact that LEA''s here carry unchambered as standard practice might also propagate this mindset. But, as far as LEA''s are concerned, one must keep in mind that they are seldom engaged in a firefight alone, while most of us ordinary folk end up going toe to toe with the bad guy all on our own. LEA''s can call upon immediate backup, us ordinary folk can''t. For example, I know for a fact that if someone barges into my house and, God forbid, a firefight ensues, I''ll have no armed backup for atleast 10 minutes. And I seriously doubt anyone needs to be told that 10 minutes in a gunfight is like bloody eternity!\n\nI think a lack of proper and/or professional handgun training facilities here in Pakistan is a major reason why people might be unconsciously afraid to carry chambered. A majority of folk here train on their own time with whatever resources they have available. That, plus the natural human mindset that the worse case scenario will never happen to you. I personally have experienced such a "worse case scenario", and the first thing that went through my mind was, [B]"How the hell can this be happening to ME!?"[/B] I was very lucky to have made it out of that situation unscathed, but it was certainly a very bitter lesson in real life.\n\nReal life can be sudden, sharp, and utterly unexpected with a heavy doze of absolute terror. How can you be sure you''ll have enough time to unholster your weapon, let alone rack the slide? What if you''ve been shot in your reaction arm, how can you be sure you''ll even manage to rack the slide with just one hand? How many of us actually practice firing supine or prone? How many of us practice firing accurately with simulated injuries? How many of us know how we''ll shoot when our veins are pumping more adrenaline than blood and our heart rate is hammering away at 180-200? Where in the cosmic rulebook does it say that the threat will openly present itself, give you ample amount of time to rack the slide of your weapon, get into the ideal firing stance with the perfect grip, and then start the engagement? Chivalry, ladies & gentlemen, exists only in fantasy and has no place on the battlefield. If someone is bent on causing me or mine harm, then I will do whatever is necessary to stop & eliminate the threat as quickly and effectively as possible. Plain & simple.\n\nI carry chambered because I have absolute faith in my firearm and complete confidence in my abilities. I carry chambered not because I have any existing threats or because someone''s out to get me, but simply because life can be choke full of nasty surprises.\n\nAnd I bloody [B]HATE[/B] surprises.', ''),

There is sudden death for the loser and the winner takes on the winner of the other duo.\nIt so happened that my own student ended up against me, beating all competition, since we were sharing the same gun, (my pride the Sig X6 ) I chose to let her shoot my X6 and Mr Naeem was kind enough to to loan me his X5, I checked the zero and found to my horror that it was zeroed at sub six where as in Rapid events I shoot point of  impact or centre. \nSo I started the match with two clean misses on first target and then dropped my sight to sub six and blew the first four targets in barely 2.5 seconds then a a miss on the 5th and then two targets in about 1.5 or 2 seconds. \nMy student Iram Rehman  a very talented and   tenacious shooter/gun fighter could only shoot 3 out of her 4 targets while I got all six of mine. We had given an advantage of 2 targets to these young ladies much to the chagrin of some of our male chauvinists.[/QUOTE]\n\n\n\nSir, it has been an honour to have had the chance to shoot with the  best. The 2 target advantage for newbies like me, a gesture of true  sportsman spirit from LRC, encouraged and enabled me to reach the  finals. Despite the odds against you, the way you overcame those odds is a lesson for all of us and this is what  sets a champion apart from the rest. I was unnerved by the fact that I  was in the final and that it was to be against you was the final straw !  The Time Pressure of this competition and the decisive elimination in  every round, makes the Toothi extremely challenging for a new shooter  but your instructions, which have been noted in bold, highlighted and  underlined,  etched in my mind, kept me going. A sincere thanks to everyone for their  support and encouragement.\n\nYou are truly an inspiration, Sir, and I feel privileged to be your student.\n\n\nP.S. Any idea when beginner''s luck runs out ?!', ''),

(394093, ' Nice input Ahnab bro, loved it, absolutely in line with everything Steve and I myself have been saying.\n\nI agree, the law enforcement agents have a different approach and probably can afford to have.\n\nAs I stated in one of my earlier posts, most of the members having voted for the empty chamber solution are decent men of family and may either not have any need to engage danger zones, or try wisely to avert such.\n\nThis is where I would say, you never know if you''re in the danger zone, coz such situations can arise anytime, anywhere,[I] beyond any expectation[/I], where I''d seriously regret not to have been loaded "stand by" to take control of the situation.\n \nNow, this doesn''t mean that by being fully "stand by", I necessarily could turn the outcome of any such event into my favor, no not at all, but at least the "odds" that I still may be able to do so, will be significantly greater than when carrying unchambered, no doubts.\n\nHence, in order to enable better[I] odds[/I] into your favor, the cost is more time spent with your gun as to "dis-alienate" the[I] hot status[/I] and attain confidence in carrying your steel with this active. This cannot be attained by the occasional racking of the gun, lubing it, and putting it back into the closet. On the other hand, a couple of days spent with carrying a loaded gun will gradually tell you that this is no issue at all, and your proficiency of handling the gun in status "red" and without any fear will grow with each passing day.\n \nSteve, one of the reasons for the standing of the percentages above is simply because I''m sure the replies handed in were not from daily carriers, but also from collectors in general, with this hobby, and occasional carry requirements only.\n\nI wonder how the graphs above would have looked like over there in the sacred lands of guns?\n\n\n\nRegards.', ''),

I am truly impressed by this company. infact, in near future, I will visit their manufacturing facility cause I just gotta know how they are making shotgun that dont even feel like a Pak made product.

The winner of the next pair shoots again; and the winner again shoots against the winner of the next pair. Out of 30 shooters we get 15 winners, then 8 then 4 and then 2 and then 1st and 2nd.   \nThe winner has to win at least  4 shoot outs  in one on one ; before winning. It is a  very tough match. \nAfter the first  shoot out the competitors get tougher and tougher as at the LRC there are a number of very fine and experienced shooters. \nSometimes it is pure bad luck when two fine shooters are pitched against each other at the very start and one gets eliminated on word go. How ever to reach 1st and 2nd positions is real real tough as after 4 to 5 shoot outs ones reaches the final.\nThere is no limit on number of rounds to be fired, I fired 7 rds in one, 7 in another and 9 in one ( in the final with a borrowed gun)  and 6 in one to win. The larger number of rds one fires the greater time one takes due to recoil , recovery and reshoot. Some one said TAKE your TIME in a HURRY\nIt is better to try and shoot deliberately without hurrying but the pressure forces one to hurry , make mistakes miss and take much more time with repeat shots.', ''),

Having a good airgun, be it a magnum springer or a PCP, I would never buy any more airgun as I consider that a waste of money. It won''t do me any extra favor. If I was so much interested in spending my money just on weapons, then I''d get a rifle probably a .243 or .270, suitable for the game we have in Pak. I like shotguns more, so a Semi-auto and if I have extra cash, a DBBL, in case there''s a ban on partridges again. All the weapons would do me what I want. SO why would I get more than 3-4 anyway? I need a gun more for it''s capabilities and lesser for a high-end name or high price tag, or some ''extra engravings''. And yes, this is my opinion.', ''),

I bought a new gun eleven year ago. I have not fired it once. It a 50[SUP]th[/SUP] anniversary edition - collector item. \n \nThen again, more than likely, you bought the rifles for shooting. You soon found out that center fire rifle cartridges are not cheap - they cost a bunch of money. Each time you pull the trigger, you burn many rupees. Each firing session becomes a metal exercise in figuring out what your wallet will allow you to expend and how many trigger-pulls” you will allow yourself.\n              \nOn the other hand you may be the lucky one - in an elite class of 22LR shooters in the world who do lot of shooting with little money. No wonder the 22LR is the Number One caliber. More 22LR cartridges are sold than all other calibers combined.\n \nYear 2011 is about to come to an end. Why not make a resolution for 2012 - you will promise yourself to buy a 22LR rifle. Make this commitment. I assure you - shooting fun will come your way.', ''),

(394762, 'Collared Dove Collared Dove \n\n Eurasian Collared dove is a species of dove native to Asia and Europe, and also recently introduced in North America.\n It is a medium sized dove, distinctly smaller than the Wood Pigeon, similar in length to a Rock Pigeon but slimmer and longer-tailed, and slightly larger than the related Turtle Dove, 30&#8211;33 cm long from tip of beak to tip of tail, with a wingspan of 47&#8211;55 cm, and a weight of 125&#8211;240 g. It is grey-buff to pinkish-grey overall, a little darker above than below, with a blue-grey underwing patch. The tail feathers are grey-buff above, and dark grey tipped white below; the outer tail feathers also tipped whitish above. It has a black half-collar edged with white on its nape from which it gets its name.\n The Collared Dove is not wary and often feeds very close to human habitation, including visiting bird tables; the largest populations are typically found around farms where spilt grain is frequent around grain stores or where livestock are fed. It is a gregarious species and sizable winter flocks will form where there are food supplies such as grain (its main food) as well as seeds, shoots and insects. Flocks most commonly number between ten and fifty, but flocks of up to ten thousand have been recorded.\n Most of you would be familiar with the unique Coo-coo-Coo of the dove. The Collared Dove is much larger in size than the Mourning Dove in America (The most hunted game bird in the US annually), and the local Palm Dove"totru"\n It makes a perfect table bird, and the meat has a distinct taste. There are many delicious possibilities ranging from Barbequed doves, to Khuggi Pulao, dove roast, etc.\n \n.Where to see them:\n\nJust about anywhere, but often around towns and villages. They''re common visitors to gardens and parks. After they have fed, they can be seen swarming electricity cables in the countryside as well as urban areas. If you''re out shooting these with a rimfire or air rifle, the best time to get these would be 10-12 AM and 3-5 PM, just when they have filled their tummies and feel like absorbing some sunlight.\n\nIf you want to hunt them in an open area, scatter a lot of grain in the field, they''ll fall for it no matter what. Few birds shot in the beginning would do perfectly as decoys. \n\n.What they eat:\n\nSeeds and grain.\n\n\nThis thread has been started to gather information about collared doves,  your own personal experience of them of shooting them, pics of the hunt, and a lot of recipes!\n\nHere are a few pics...

They entertain the export order for even one knife. They are working with Bux Elahi Lahore for their display and local sales. They are working on the quality for price range from Rs.2500 - 15,000.

(627989, 'Arms lic is itself a permit to carry a weapon Thanks for your sharing your experience [QUOTE=common man;464737]On Friday 31 November 2014 i went to Chief Commissioner Office G11 Islamabad. Had a detailed discussion with the officer dealing the arms license and carry permits. I asked for the procedure of obtaining carry permit. He asked do u have any life threat. I said no. He asked do you have any FIR registered of an attack on your life. I said no. He said then there is a no permit for you. I asked that i need to carry my NPB weapon for security reasons and current law and order situation. He said that you do not need any permit for carrying NPB in concealed manner whether on person or in car. Permit are only issued for Display of weapon. All pakistan permits are issued from MOI and provincial are issued by respective DC office.\n\n\nI inquired about carrying NPB while 144 is imposed. He said if the 144 notification states that Carrying is banned then you cannot carry, otherwise you can carry in concealed manner. In 144 general notification, permits for displayed carrying are suspended. In short he said carrying of NPB weapon is allowed in concealed manner only. For display/brandishing of weapon, permits are issued. And currently none are being issued from MOI and DC office.\n\n\nI asked for the policy document if any. He said MOI has it.Now I am planning to visit MOI for the most wanted policy document so that we all can know the policy for the firearms handling lawfully.\n\n\nSecondly I was travelling in Islamabad two days back, near Serena, with 2 of my friends in my mehran when i was stopped at checkpost. The police constable asked us to step out. Which i did. He did a body search, before he could feel the weapon on me , i told him that i have a weapon. He asked me to show. I took it out, said that i will unload it , unloaded it and handed over to him. just the gun. He had a deep look to it. Asked me to show the license. which i did. he matched the number. He asked about the number of rounds i am carrying. i said 15, he asked for the magazine, which i handed over to him. He felt the weight of the magazine. and handed over the gun and magazine to me and started examining the license. Meanwhile i loaded the gun in front of him and holstered it. He returned the license to me. I smiled and said thank you to him sat back in car and left. Rangers were also present on that checkpost.\n\n\nthought of sharing this incident with you all.[/QUOTE]\n\nI had sent letter to MOI for the same and i got the response that "Licence is itself a permit to carry a weapon. However display is not allowed "\ncopy is attached for other members to see too.

Gauge is determined from the weight of a solid sphere of lead that will fit the bore of the firearm, and is expressed as the multiplicative inverse of the sphere''s weight as a fraction of a pound (e.g., a 1&#8260;12th pound ball fits a 12-gauge bore). Thus there are twelve 12-gauge balls per pound (etc.). The term is related to the measurement of cannon, which were also measured by the weight of their iron round shot; an 8 pounder would fire an 8 lb (3.6 kg) spherical cast iron ball and had a bore diameter of about 91 mm (3.6 in).'' copied from wikipedia. \ngauge and bore is one and the same thing. its actually we Pakistani wrongly speak ''tees-bore'' in reality internationally its thirty caliber or .30th inch. such is the case is for SMG, internationally smg refers to mp5 or any sub compact rapidfire gun where as in Pakistan it refers to Chinese AK47. also one more example, German Shepherd dog(GSD) and Alsation are one and the same thing but in Pakistan we refer alsation to local breed bhagyari or an east german line GSD as alsation or any dog that resembles jackal or wolf. :)', ''),

(395129, ' Unfortunately, explanations of caliber and bore can differ, depending upon your particular purpose (even within the context of firearms).\n\nCaliber, as a standard of measure, is given in tenths of an inch, though for technical purposes, thousandths of an inch are also given. Some will state that this later case is not correct.\n\nExample:\nan M1 Garand fires a bullet having a diameter of .308"\nan AK-47 fires a bullet having a diameter of .311"\nThey are both referred to as being .30 caliber rifles.\n\nThe bore of the gun is the inside of the barrel (like a "hole," it''s not actually anything concrete, but where stuff is missing) it can also refer to the inside walls of the barrel ("there is rust in the bore")\n\nMost barrels have rifling, which is also described as "Lands and grooves" the lands are the areas sticking up, and the groves are the areas pressed (or cut) away.\nIf you imagine a cross-section of a gun barrel now, you would see something like a circle with a "gear tooth" edge. (remember that the metal is on the outside of this shape, not inside it) You could draw one circle touching the tops of the lands, following the inside shape (cutting off the teeth), and one circle touching the bottoms of the grooves (making the circle as big as the teeth).\nThe diameter of the smaller circle (measured from the tops of the lands) is the Bore Diameter. It is the largest round thing you could pass through the barrel, without having to miss-shape it to make it fit.\nThe diameter of the larger circle (taken from the bottoms of the groves) is the Groove Diameter. This represents pretty much the largest thing you can pass through the barrel, and whatever you push through it, will be cut, or pressed into by the lands of the barrel sticking up, in its way. Bullets, for the most part, are this diameter.\nCaliber USUALLY refers to this larger size, and thus, too the diameter of the bullets used in the barrel too.\n\nTo give an example (I think these numbers are correct, but I have not verified them):\nIf you have a .30-06, the bullet 308/1000 of an inch (.308") passes through the barrel, which has a BORE of .300" and a grove diameter of .308".\nIf you have a .50 BMG, the bullet .510" passes through a barrel with a bore of .500", and a groove diameter of .510"\n\nUnless you are involved in some technical aspect respecting firearms, most people will use the bullet''s diameter "Caliber" to describe both the barrel and the bullet, because one number for everything is much easier for everyone involved.\n\n\nAs for bullets and weird sizes, I''ll add to that: Why do they use numbers that don''t reflect anything accurately?\nYou will find, in many cases, that weapons firing bullets of seemingly similar calibers, even if from different cartridges, are, in fact, the same [COLOR=#366388]caliber bullet[/COLOR]. Markets usually don''t reinvent the wheel. The .30-06, .308, .300 Win Mag, and .30-30 (I believe) all use the same .308" standard. similarly, 6mm and .243 cartridges are using the same caliber, and most center-fire (not rim-fire) .22s are using the .224" bullet. These include the .22-250, .220 Swift, .223 Remington (aka 5.56mm x45/NATO) and more.\nI''ve always found it interesting to note that, while it makes sense to round .308" to a nice, round "thirty," that the actual metric equivalent to that is 7.82mm, and that the no-less-complex 7.62 is simply a nice, round "thirty" in inches.\nDespite what I state here, if you''re dealing with foreign cartridges, you will often find them using similar but different actual diameters. (the British .303 is something like .312" and the AK-47 is .311" I believe)\nAlso worth mentioning is that the .38 is a .357" and the .44 is a .429". Sometimes they''re not that close.\nThe best advice I can give you with stated calibers and cartridge names is: memorize them, and realize they can lead you astray.\n\nI hope this gives you more understanding than confusion.', ''),

The chest size of a dove is not more than this...\n\nAnother common problem we all make is that we sight in our guns on horizontal targets, and while aiming at the birds on wires, we do not cater in the drop which will be more due to the elevation. It has happened to me many times that I keep missing the same bird again & again, and pellets are so stupidly dispersed that the bird doesn''t even realize that its being shot at.\n\nAnd do note that if you are able to hit bulls eye with a match pellet, Pro mags will still be missing, as each pellet type has its own physics involved, and trajectories are never the same. So you have to make sure that your gun is at perfect "zero" for the pellet which you will be using during the hunting.\n\nSince you are using 350 Mag, if you can get good results with match pellets on paper, knocking birds off will get fun as there is too much power in the pellet fired by a 350 mag. If I can get a dove fall like a mango at 20 yards with match pellet fired from my Mod. 35, I hope that you should be able to get a match pellet through the dove at this distance.\n\nHope this was informative..', ''),

(395224, 'Problem and Solution (I guess) AOA everybody,\n This Friday I went dove hunting, and unfortunately was scoreless. The next day I tried culling some crows/kites but was missing simply every shot. This missing had been going on since a month or so, when my stock of other imported pellets ran out.... and I was just relying on Gamo Pro Mags bought from Pindi. These pellets are totally rubbish, no doubt. I have done a brief review on them too, too lazy to post the link here, but you can scroll down my threads if interested in reading it. Not a big fan of punching paper, finally today I decided to punch some... oh yeah, I did some target shooting yesterday too, but the pellets were dispersed all over the A4 sheet of paper. \n Don''t know of the airgun is zeroed or not, probably slight error remains, but I''ll get that done once I get hold on some good imported pellets. I shot many pellets without clicking the ''slight adjustment screws or whatever they are called'' just to see the grouping at 10 yards. I am not using a scope, but am going to get one soon.\n I was shocked after shooting about 50 pellets or so and seeing that even 2 consistent shots weren''t grouping together. One would go too above the center, the next too right, one would be near the center, and so on (I mean I was getting +6 inch groups at 10 yards)... At this point I was thinking about the deep trouble I was stuck in. Then opened my inventory to see if any other pellets were left, just had those stupid H&N Rabbit Magnum II pellets (24.69 grains) which are too heavy and in-accurate. Borrowed a few Crosman Copperhead Wadcutters from my brother, and started punching some paper again... This time I was quite relieved with the results achieved. Though I was not shooting very carefully, just checking the grouping, shot 8 pellets and they grouped quite well (of course there was some human error). After this I tested my H&N rabbit mags, the grouping was again similar to the rubbish named ''Gamo pro magnums'', all disperesed over the target and about half a feet under the center of the intended target. I have also written a brief writeup on these pellets a couple of months ago, describing them and their lack of accuracy.\nWell here are the pics;\nDiana RWS 350 MAGNUM (Classic/Feuerkraft)\n[IMG]http://i1203.photobucket.com/albums/bb399/B77W/TargetSHooting001.jpg[/IMG]\nThe setup\n[IMG]http://i1203.photobucket.com/albums/bb399/B77W/TargetSHooting003.jpg[/IMG]\nNone other than the rubbish, Gamo P.Ms\n[IMG]http://i1203.photobucket.com/albums/bb399/B77W/TargetSHooting002.jpg[/IMG]\nThe groups on the left are with a the 350, on the right with my Rainbow 35, both not exactly zeroed, just to see the groupings, majority of the ones going out of the circles being the Rainbow 35 shots.\n[IMG]http://i1203.photobucket.com/albums/bb399/B77W/TargetSHooting004.jpg[/IMG]\n350''s scattered shots\n[IMG]http://i1203.photobucket.com/albums/bb399/B77W/TargetSHooting005.jpg[/IMG]\nAnother target\n[IMG]http://i1203.photobucket.com/albums/bb399/B77W/TargetSHooting006.jpg[/IMG]\nThe other side of it\n[IMG]http://i1203.photobucket.com/albums/bb399/B77W/TargetSHooting007.jpg[/IMG]\nHere we''ve got the irregular grouping of Rabbit Magnum pellets.. I aimed for the en-circled target, but we can see where the holes were punched (encircled as well).\n[IMG]http://i1203.photobucket.com/albums/bb399/B77W/TargetSHooting008.jpg[/IMG]\nAnd we''ve also got a 8 shot group of the Crosman wadcutters, much compact group, My hands were shaking while shooting [because I was shooting casually] a bit but still got a reasonable group.\nCould''ve been much better. I''ll zero my gun with these tomorrow InshAllah.\n[IMG]http://i1203.photobucket.com/albums/bb399/B77W/TargetSHooting009.jpg[/IMG]\nThe holes created by the wadcutters were neater than the others, and the ricochet \nI need to know the exact problem.... What I have guessed is that the pellets I use (Gamo Pro Mags) are the cause. There is no choice in the market except Irani, Gamo Match and Pro magnums, the Irani ones and Gamo P.Ms being illegible for powerful airguns, they only choice left is Gamo Match. Will try those in a couple of days. The only solution to this problem is getting different top-end pellets and checking them for accuracy in each of your air-rifles, and stock up the best (in terms of accuracy)... Don''t know whether this is feasible because you won''t often go abroad for these and relatives won''t be arriving every month.\n Will Crosman Premier hollow points and domed pellets give me more accuracy, because I''m about to order them from USA. And where are imported pellets available in Pk, other than Gamos.\n\nYour input would be greatly appreciated.\n\nRegards.', ''),

Where is the sportsmanship in scattering many shotgun shell pellets when there is just one rabbit in front of you? Real sportsmanship calls for one bullet for one target. If the rabbit does not sit still, I say so much the better. In this case it will take a true marksman to nail the game. Mind you, a shotgun has its place. Next time why not leave the shotgun at home and take a 22LR instead? If you don’t have a 22LR, it is a very good time to consider buying one. The investment will outlast you and many generations to come in your family. Don’t forget, 22LR is cheaper to shoot than any center fire ammunition. Shotgun kicks like a mule. The 22LR does not - essentially no recoil. \n \nThe true champion in the shooting and hunting sport is the world-renowned 22LR. Other calibers have come and gone.

(395362, ' Read on another forum, seems like that excessive dry firing even with snap caps can be harmful for the gun\n\n------------------------------------------------------------\nAh yes, dry firing ... another one of my favorite subjects. Let''s start with the mechanics of the gun. With exception of the bore and the chambers in the cylinder, your revolver doesn''t know the difference between dry fire and live fire. The internal parts all get exercised the same except you are much more likely to damage a gun from dry firing. \n\nDry firing to break a gun in is not wise. Yes, a few parts will smooth up but mostly what you are doing is wearing all the parts prematurely. Here''s an analogy that is a bit over dramatic using 60 grit sand paper and assuming the surfaces of the sandpaper represent the mating surfaces of internal parts. Start by placing the sandpaper with the rough sides facing each other. This would represent a mating surface in your gun where both parts are rough. Rub the two pieces of sandpaper together and soon you will see both pieces have worn the roughness off each other. Both pieces will be notably smoother but way thinner, indicating considerable wear. Now place the rough surface of one sheet of sandpaper against the smooth back on another sheet and rub them together. This would simulate a rough part rubbing on a smooth part inside your gun. As you continue to rub them together, the smooth surface now becomes rough and the rough surface stays about the same. For internal parts, that means the smoother mating surface becomes rougher and wears, but not as fast as if both surfaces were rough. Last, place the sheets of sandpaper back-to-back with the smooth surfaces facing each other. You can rub a long time with minimal wear and in fact you will polish the surfaces. This simulates two smooth parts rubbing together. When you dry fire or live fire, the parts behave much the same as the sandpaper. If you start off by smoothing the parts mating surfaces, wear is minimized and the gun will last much longer. If you dry fire to break a gun in, don''t expect it to last near as long.\n\nThe reason why dry firing causes more damage is twofold. First, people tend to be a bit more aggressive when pulling the trigger in DA or cocking the hammer in SA when they dry fire. This makes the cylinder rotate very fast and come to an abrupt halt when the cylinder latch contacts the cylinder''s lock notches. This peens the lock notches and the frame''s "window" for the cylinder latch. It doesn''t take long and the cylinder lock-up becomes loose. Additionally, the hand pushes a ratchet to rotate the cylinder. These two surfaces wear which retards cylinder timing (carry-up) and the faster you operate the gun, the faster they will wear.\n\nThe second issue with dry firing is purely in the numbers. You are more likely to dry fire a thousand times than to live fire a thousand rounds so the revolver is subjected to more repetitions. Usually internal wear has more to do with how you dry than the number of times you dry fire. If you pull the trigger or hammer more slowly, you will minimize peening the cylinder and frame. Lubrication does not prevent peening.\n\nNow for "Snap-Caps". These have to be about the most worthless things ever made and even worse, they give the owner a false sense of security. Snap-Caps do absolutely nothing for the gun''s internal parts. Yes, they do cushion the firing pin but they don''t even do a good job of that. Ruger''s firing pins are made of a copper and steel alloy that are nearly immune to breaking so it is very rare to see one break. Snap-Caps are worth using in the older single and double barrel shotguns where firing pins are more subject to breaking. In modern guns, they do absolutely nothing except to occupy space in the chamber instead of a live round.\n\nRuger''s manuals say it''s OK to dry fire but what they really mean is you won''t break parts (especially the firing pin) by dry firing. They do not address excessive or improper dry firing that causes wear or damage. Normal dry firing for training or doing a function test on your revolver is not a problem but sitting in front of the TV and clicking away countless times is. When I had my gunsmith shop, it was pretty common for customers to bring in guns with excessive wear. When I asked them how much the gun had been fired, I often got an answer like "I''ve only fired a couple boxes through it". My next question was about dry firing where I usually got some dumb look instead of an answer.', ''),

So, only one FTFeed in total of 55 shots with absolutely no FTE and FTFire. It makes it 98.18% reliable on Sunday. \n \nI had already fired 46 Shaheen No. 4 with this gun which also had only one FTFeed. No FTE and no FTFire then too. So, in total, I fired 101 shots with no FTE, FTFire and only two FTFeed which makes it 98.02% reliable. \n \nI guess that only two FTFeeds in 101 shots are bcuz of some problem in the cartridge and not any problem in the gun itself, otherwise it would have stuck much more often. \n \nAs can be read above, many types of ammo was used so gun’s virtually perfectly cycling the ammo gives the hint of the strength of the gun for all types of ammo.\n \nI don’t how do you guys measure reliability but it was simple mathematics from my side. I apologize if I didn’t do it correctly or missed out the whole hell of a main point.\n \n[b]Accuracy[/b]\n \nAnd time of “another” disclaimer …\n \n[b]Disclaimer No. 3[/b] … [i]This target shooting was my first time ever with any type of the gun. Earlier, I had just fired the guns with no aim, whatsoever, just firing straight on the mountain bushes and not knowing where it actually hit. So any haphazard formations of hits on the targets are entirely my fault. Gun should not be blamed … [/i] :D\n \nMy target sheets were simple made. Took some print-outs on A4 page of targets available on net (linked somewhere in pakguns) and then pasted them on simple charts bought from a Bookshop. When I first aimed at the middle of the target then I felt that my left arm was swaying like I was “moving” my arms on Salman Ahmad’s Jazba song in Imran Khan’s Jalsa and I doubted that if I was ever be able to hit the chart, what to talk about target. But, however, somehow managed to save my honor and below are the results. \n \nFirst went 5 S&B Slugs from 25+ meters. My first ever shot on target was some 4-5 inches up and right to the centre of the target which made me feel better that I am not THAT bad though it tore off some part of the chart. Second shot went more up and right and completely tore off the part of chart. So, I placed the chart upside down and fired next three shots which are clearly visible in the picture below. I was not only pleased to hit the target and near around it but was also pleased that the gun is accurate. Here goes the picture:\n\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]6887[/ATTACH]\n \nNext came 5 Shaheen SG/LG from 20+ meters. Result speaks of itself, first full chart picture and then close up of spread.\n\n\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]6888[/ATTACH][ATTACH=CONFIG]6889[/ATTACH]\n \nThen again came 5 Shaheen SG/LG from 20+ meters and again results were good, to my standards. Here is full chart picture and close-up of spread.\n\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]6890[/ATTACH][ATTACH=CONFIG]6891[/ATTACH]\n \n \n5 S&B Slugs again. All remained below the “belt” but nonetheless accuracy of gun got established, I guess. Here is full chart picture and close-up of spread.\n\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]6892[/ATTACH][ATTACH=CONFIG]6893[/ATTACH]\n \nTime for 5 Olympia buckshots.  Rapid fire from 35+ meters. I was having difficulty in re-aiming after each shot in rapid fire, first bcuz there was no “target point” in the chart to aim at and second I was not getting adjusted so fast after recoil to aim again. Anyhow, Spread took the whole of the chart, everywhere, literally. \n \n[ATTACH=CONFIG]6894[/ATTACH]\n \n[b]Comparison with Saiga 12[/b]\n \nNow this is the difficult part. I don’t want to sound “blasphemous” comparing it with saiga but in Pakistan these are the only two mag fed shotguns, so I have no choice but to compare them. \n \nSaiga has ALL SUPERIORITY over MKA1919 being from the AK47 family and who does not love AK47. \n \nSaiga comes with 8 fed mag and extandable to not only 12 but also drum of 20 is available but for MKA1919 I have not seen any extendable mag in Pakistan, though saw a 10 fed mag in a youtube video, and love to have two of such.\n \nMKA1919 is almost half of the price of Saiga in Pakistan, so I guess, keeping in view the budget constraint of most of us, taste of saiga can be availed thru buying MKA1919.\n \n[b]Conclusion[/b]\n \nAs per my little understanding of the subject, this gun is quite reliable and accurate and this is the stuff shotgun lovers should have for HD purpose.\n\n[b]Disclaimer No. 4[/b] ... [i]All opinions are mine and "my" AKDAL MKA 1919 is not responsible for any wong conclusion on my part...[/i] :D', ''),

For the friends coming from punjab by road or if some body comes by air and lands at sukkur , it would be feasible to cross the khairpur larkana bridge on river indus and than take the route of dadu/ karachi and after crossing waggan & nasirabad towns they would be on the way to mehar and from there the link road laeding to faridabad would take them to the gartal.\n    the guests had arrived one day before the scheduled programme and were made comfortable in the tent city used by arab royals for their hunt in this area. they alredy had their hunting  trip completed few days back. there was a light musical programme during night also.\n the shooting started in early hours when the visibility got clear . the targets were set up at the distance of 400 meters. it was previously decided to allow 3 shots to each contestant but as the number of contestants was only 26 thus it was decided to allow each shooter a string of 5 shots \n\n      after the   firing session , the score was calculated and following compititors secured the positions as under;\n\n      1. Mr Zarar shah  ( belonging to larkana)\n      2. Mr Shakeel Ahmed ( son of  pir of bharchundi )\n      3. Mr Omar Yusufzai\n\nthe competition turned very intersting at the moment when the score  between  Mr shakeel Ahmed and Mr Omar Yusufzai had a tie after completion of the first string of 5 shots , both the contestants were given extra 3 shots to make a decision for No 2 and No 3 positions , interestingly enough, the sore was equal this time too , compelling the organisers to allocate  a further single shot to both of the shooters to decide the issue and this last shot decided as to who is gonna be runner up and next to him', ''),

With the In-Line Inertia Driven System, the burned propellant residue and gases are shot out of the barrel, for a cleaner action.\r\n\r\n[url=http://postimage.org/image/3kb7betav/][img]http://s15.postimage.org/3kb7betav/inline_inertia_detail.jpg[/img][/url]\r\n\r\n\r\n[size=150][u][b]QuadraFit Plus System[/b][/u][/size]\r\n\r\nThe QuadraFit Buttstock Module customizing system allows easy adjustment of drop, cast, comb height and length-of-pull in a matter of minutes, with no tools required. The polymer QuadraFit Buttstock Module with ComforTech Plus connects directly to the receiver by a simple turn-and-lock, steel-to-steel attachment. \r\n\r\n\r\nhttp://i970.photobucket.com/albums/ae189/azamkakar/Picture042.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[size=150][u][b]Packing:[/b][/u][/size]\r\n\r\nVinci comes in a beautiful blue oblong custom plastic carry case of good quality. The gun is broken down into the 3 major components already. The first component is the stock, the 2nd is the barrel bolt combination already together, and the 3rd is the trigger assembly/forearm/magazine. Inside the case following items are included with the gun; \r\n\r\n- 5 Optima chokes ( F, IM, M, IC, C )\r\n- Shims\r\n- Benelli oil \r\n- Choke key\r\n- Sling swivel studs\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[size=150][u][b]Finish, Looks & Quality:[/b][/u][/size]\r\n\r\nThe gun looks beautiful in its ergonomic shape and rubberized finish. As far as quality is concerned I guess that it must have been made with the best quality raw materials available\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i970.photobucket.com/albums/ae189/azamkakar/Picture012.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[size=150][u][b]Grip & Stock[/b][/u][/size]\r\n\r\nBenelli''s V-Grip has a non-slip surface that is molded into the synthetic material of the forearm and pistol-grip offers a more secure hold of the weapon.\r\nThe stock can be simply removed (or swapped), which is easily adapted to fit by means of shims which alter cast and drop\r\n\r\nThe stock incorporates Benelli’s ComforTech Plus recoil reduction system.\r\n\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i970.photobucket.com/albums/ae189/azamkakar/Picture023.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[size=150][u][b]Action & Barrel:[/b][/u][/size]\r\n\r\nThe Vinci Free-floating barrel system operates on the same principle applied on high-performance bolt-action rifles thus ensuring outstanding ballistic accuracy. \r\n\r\nThe lug less design of the free-floating barrel leans on the Receive Module through a flat base   which allows for natural vibration of the barrel and virtually non-existent muzzle climb.\r\n\r\nThe chrome lined, steel proofed barrel is topped off with vented 5mm rib and red high visibility extended bead and flows into the integral bolt-housing. The bolt  is incredibly smooth in function and feel.\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i970.photobucket.com/albums/ae189/azamkakar/Picture018.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[size=150][u][b]Trigger:[/b][/u][/size]\r\n\r\nstraighter trigger pull that is more like a rifle than a traditional shotgun.\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i970.photobucket.com/albums/ae189/azamkakar/Picture019.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[size=150][u][b]Balance and Recoil:[/b][/u][/size]\r\n\r\nI found the recoil to be very soft, even lighter than Beretta A 400 Xplor. The gun is very balanced with natural swing as the weight is at the center of the gun where it is supposed to be i.e between the shooter’s hands.\r\n\r\nBenelli claims that with “Benelli’s ComforTech Plus recoil reduction system, offering a drop at comb and heel of 13/8” and 2” with a standard length of pull set at 14¼”, the gel chevron inserts, sculpted recoil pad and gel comb expand and contract dissipating the recoil in a sideways direction and away from the shooter’s shoulder hence making the felt recoil considerably less than many gas-valve driven shotguns”.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[size=150][/size][u][b]Sights:[/b][/u]\r\n\r\nRed front fiber optic bead (receiver tapped and drilled for mounting)\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i970.photobucket.com/albums/ae189/azamkakar/Picture029.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[size=150][u][b]Magazine:[/b][/u][/size]\r\n\r\nThe magazine tube holds three shells. It has a release button that allows you to remove shells from the mag without cycling the bolt.\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i970.photobucket.com/albums/ae189/azamkakar/Picture032.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[size=150][u][b]Safety Mechanism:[/b][/u][/size]\r\n\r\nThe safety is recessed into the trigger housing in front of the trigger and is a tight push to move from safe to fire.\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i970.photobucket.com/albums/ae189/azamkakar/Picture016.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[size=150][u][b]Reliability:[/b][/u][/size]\r\n\r\nExtremely reliable gun. Took it out NIB and fired and fired a couple of hundred rounds with almost no FTF & FTE.\r\n\r\n\r\n[size=150][u][b]Maintenance:[/b][/u][/size]\r\n\r\nThe internals of the gun have been made very simple and cleaning of the gun definitely make life easier\r\n\r\nWith this gun, hunters and shooters can go for longer periods in between cleaning sessions as is it not gas operated which leaves very little residue in the operating system.\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i970.photobucket.com/albums/ae189/azamkakar/Picture004.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i970.photobucket.com/albums/ae189/azamkakar/DSCF2875.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\n\r\nPrice:\r\n\r\nThe gun is currently selling just over 300k.', ''),

Isn''t there another concept such as : ''Proper aiming with patience'', which ultimately takes a difficult quarry such as a "salt range partridge" which is known as one of the most difficult flying (upland) targets here???\r\n\r\nBelieve me, only patiently aimed TWO shots are maximum  that a darting SALT RANGE partridge gives a gunner; the rest of the shots, even with a repeater are at 50+ yards range which is way beyond damage. Other thing is that a bad shooter will cripple all birds he shoots at, even with a double gun. So repeater or no repeater, does not affect that. Needless to say, main hazards are POACHING (netting, bhagwa, torching) and I''m afraid not the Pouching which you are refering to here.\r\n\r\nThis semi auto OR repeater issue has been blown out of proportion by some LESS-KNOWLEDGABLE persons sitting at the helm of affairs. Thank God a lawyer filed a writ in High Court last yr and got a verdict in favor of repeaters usage which is probably why this year we see no such silly ban in Punjab.

I just want to know your IMPLEMENTATION PLAN for the sake of my know-how .... Will you strip check each person in a vehicle while travelling to or from and a hunting destination? Due to the vastness of the terrain, and many other factors, this is not practical. Thus this little violation of crossing 6 birds per gun by 1 or 2 odd birds happens in field, but in general, majority of the parties are not even achieving the legal bird limits, due to netting & related poaching & other factors of course, despite paying Rs2000 per person enhanced annual shooting licence fee to the department. The important point to look here is : Is the dept also giving those people enough in return. Minimum they can do is eliminate netting and this menace of bhagwa, torching and hunting all over with falcons/pointers. Local checks should be invested in and enforced.

(395657, 'Project CZ 75 TS (Tactical Sports) Salam All,\nA little over a year ago (Nov. 2010), I purchased a CZ75TS (Tactical Sports), at that time I had also placed an order with a dealer for the Sig Sauer X6 PPC Edition.  Upon picking up the CZ 75 TS, I realized that this gun has a lot of potential if one can invest a little more time and money.  I had also ordered custom trigger, adjustable rear sight, magwell housing, base pads for it.  I had them installed and the gun really looked good aesthetically and worked even better making the trigger even more crisp.  Upon shooting it at the range I along with two other colleagues realized that there was no longer a need for the Sig Sauer X6 and we hoped that the dealer wouldn''t get them in as we were committed to buy should the X6s have arrived.\nThen I jumped the gun by selling it off to a dear brother of mine, who was all too happy to take my customized CZ 75 TS home.  I jumped the gun by waiting for the CZ 75 CzechMate, which arrived after three months or so, I remember rushing off to the dealer to pick it up.  At the dealer I was really dismayed when I saw that the CzechMate was only available with two magazines rather than the four in quantity stated; furthermore, there were no extra two in quantity barrels with the CzechMate.  Talk about a disappointing day for me.  To add insult to injury the dealer wouldn''t lower the price (380000/rs).  Later on I found out that he did sell it off to another friend of mine for 330000/rs.\nAbout a little over a month ago I received a call from my dear brother Malik Fayaz of Hira Arms, Nila Gumbad, Lahore.  He asked me to come down and make a visit to him as he had something to show me.  I went and low-and-behold he puts a fully loaded (ALL Options Included) CZ 75 CzechMate in front of me.  He states "Do you want this?  I remember you wanted one."  I stated yes by taking out my check book and proceeded to write him his check.  On the way out Malik Fayaz tells me he needs me to drop by his house as there is something else he has there for me which he promised me over a year and a half ago!  We get to his home and WOW again... he gifts me a Walther PPK in .22lr.  He tells me "Moeen Jee, I never forgot I owed you this gun, now give me your license so I can enter this weapon as well and you can be on your way, otherwise you are welcome to stay here at my house."  I quickly took out my license and got the pistol entered and then hauled ass home to Isb..  Thank you again Fayaz bhai. \nAfter reaching home, tired as much as I was I still couldn''t go to sleep till I held the CzechMate for a while.  The next day upon waking up and with the heart beat back down to normal, I took the CzechMate out again and started to go through its things.  I saw that the rear sight is still the fixed model (disappointing), the trigger is still plastic (very disappointing), and lastly the compensator unit doesn''t have a front sight blade (very very disappointing).  So what was the main difference between the CzechMate and the TS I had customized?  A holographic sight?  Extra barrels which I probably will never need?  Whatever!  I still have a CzechMate... the little voice in my head was trying to convince me.  Then something happened which made the little voice in my head SHUTUP.\nI went to the range with my old customized CZ75TS and with my new CZ75 CzechMate.  I found out that both were giving me the same recoil.  The open sighted TS was also very quick in dropping the plates as was the CzechMate BUT the CzechMate was giving me problems with the dot as - further the distance the more harder to control the red dot over the target becomes.  That red dot C-More was doing the disco bogalloo all over the place.  Aside from that I couldn''t notice anything different.  I got home and took both guns apart trying to figure out what makes the CzechMate better or different than the TS.  I found out that the TS frame is longer and that toward the muzzle, the TS has a nice one inch Steel lip to give it more front weight/balance; the CzechMate has this entire area cut along with the slide so one can either install a compensator (with out a front sight) or  a bushing with a front sight.  It all equals out to the same muzzle end weight; but I will put my bet down on a muzzle heavy gun verses compensated guns as they are ammo sensitive.  Now someone please try to make me understand this logic: I paid a pretty penny on a gun which looks great and I want to shoot it with the variable options given; however, those option(s) don''t add up!  For example, I want to shoot open sights but with compensator - I can''t.  I can go on but won''t.  [B]DISAPPOINTING.[/B]\nSo I got rid of the CzechMate quickly, as it still is a desirable piece.  I then proceeded to locate another TS.  It turns out the person I had sold my TS to had his original one still in box unfired/untouched.  I purchased that from him and off I went.  MY MISSION: to make a TS which will COST WELL UNDER 300000/rs AND WILL MELT ANY CZECHMATE PUT DOWN BESIDE IT IN LOOKS AND IN USE - ANYDAY AND ANY PLACE.  This TS will include my option(s) to use the open sights AND also allow me to indulge in the pleasure of the optic sights whenever wanted.  [B]GAME ON![/B]\n \nI ordered the following:[LIST=1]\n[*]Rear Adjustable sights.\n[*]CzechMate style hammer.\n[*]Grips.\n[*]Magwell.\n[*]Basepads.\n[*]A custom Trigger from CZ CUSTOM.\n[*]A rear slide racker/optics mount from CZ CUSTOM.\n[*]Burris Fast Fire II optics.\n[*]SS recoil rod and plug.\n[*]Two in quantity, recoil springs.\n[/LIST]I then proceeded to sand blast the frame as I have always hated that crappy silver finish (a real B***h to remove), then I had the frame blued in the matt black finish.  Rather than putting everyone to sleep - I will let the pictures do the talking for me.  Followed by a video at a later date.  Enjoy, as I am very happy and content now.  And currently looking for a CzechMate to turn green or even better...

They told me that one of my card has arrived and other one is in QC process and in a week or two 2nd card will also come.\n\nNow by reading all this stuff in the thread I am confused for taking it.

But other friends swear by 6# and 4 cuts (IMP CYL choke) combination ... I am sure 6# has advantage of dead-drop kill as its a bigger load & larger diameter pellet, though I like to take advantage of more pellets in 8#. Mod/8# combo has one limitation i.e. if you fire at very close range, the partridge bursts in air (all meat gone) so one has to let the bird go about at least 15-20 yards before firing. It happened with me in last hunt by accident, when a partridge flushed from 5 yards near my feet and shot was impulsively taken at abt 10 yards.\r\n\r\nMy experience with 7# reg Shaheen is also not good. I think 8# and 6# due to more sales volumes are made in better quality than the 7# as they are high volume running items, otherwise if you use Eley (UK) 7# it has very good results. I think it is the quality of cartrg and not 7# issue.\r\n\r\nPls do keep me posted about how you train pointers off season to be fit & pointing (within range) during partrg season.

(395765, 'CARACAL F Review and 1100 Round Endurance &amp; Torture Test ! Salams,\n\nRecently I was given a Caracal F and Caracal C by the guys at Caracal Pakistan and they asked me to test and review them. I told them plain and simple that the review will be unbiased and I would need a 1000 or so rounds to test it with. They obliged and yesterday I tested the Caracal to my satisfaction.\n\nA few words on Caracal before I go on:\n\nThe Caracal is a new combat handgun from the U.A.E. It was designed by Wilhelm Bubits who first worked at Glock and then moved to Steyr to design the Steyr Mannlicher M & S family of pistols. Caracal''s are made to compete directly with the likes of Glock, Steyr and XDM line of pistols. There are three versions, the F, C & SC which respectively compete with the Glock 17, 19 & 26. It is perhaps also pertinent to mention that Caracal owns the German Shotgun and Rifle manufacturer Merkel which produces the Caracal handguns under licence in Germany as well. \n\nOn to the review: \n\nThe Caracal came in a decent quality plastic box, included in it was the gun, two magazines and a users manual. The manual is in English and well written. The F itself is about the same size as the Glock 17 however it has a 4.1 inch barrel compared to the 17''s 4.5 inch barrel. The gun comes with a safe action (DAO) trigger which functions great and breaks smoothly, the trigger pull is about 5 lbs. The gun comes with two different kind of sights, conventional straight 8 ones (in which you align the two dots to form a figure 8 to be on target) and a quick sight which roughly starts from above the barrel chamber area and extends to the muzzle end. Mine came with a Straight 8 sight which while easy to align were nothing spectacular. The sights also seem to be part of the slide itself which is not a positive. On the back of the gun is a loaded chamber indicator which tells you when the gun is loaded.\n \nThe finishing of the slide and the polymer frame is quite good and defiantly in the exclusive Glock/Styer neighborhood. It weighs about 125g more than the Glock 17 at 750g which is quite welcome as the gun feels very solid to hold. Holding the gun for the first time felt amazing, infact I think it is the most point able gun I have ever held. It gives you Steyr like depth of grip with Glock like solid feel without the Glock grip angle (which does not suit everyone). The checkering on the Polymer grip is very comfortable to hold and even after shooting it quite a lot it still felt good. It does have a ambidextrous mag release but the slide release is only on the left hand side (for right handed shooters). There is a picatinny rail on the front for mounting accessories and a Glock like serial number plate on the bottom of the frame but strangely no serial number printed on it. Overall the polymer frame is top notch/high quality. The disassembly lugs situated right above the trigger finger are made of hardened steel and make disassembly surprisingly even easier and quicker than the Glock (I didn''t realize it could get easier). \n\nPictures below:\n\n\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]6919[/ATTACH]\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]6920[/ATTACH]\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]6921[/ATTACH]\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]6922[/ATTACH]\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]6923[/ATTACH]\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]6924[/ATTACH]\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]6925[/ATTACH]\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]6926[/ATTACH]\nShooting review to follow shortly:', ''),

The gun draws it genetics basically from the M9A1.[/COLOR]\n\nIt probably may be the best "hybrid" solution you could get between a Glock 17/19 and Steyr M9, yet has probably an even lower placed bore axis in comparison - [I]and reportedly - a better, much crisper trigger than the Glock and Steyr models.\n\n I had the chance to check all 3 models, the Caracal F, C and C-QS and picked up the below one finding it the most appealing as well as serving of my purpose of SD carry.\n \nThe rear sight on this specific model is placed [B]just past the ejection port[/B], aligning with a fibre optics front sight. The gun came with 3 magazines of 15 rounds capacity.\n\nMore on the[I] Technics later, let''s enjoy some fresh gun porn first, it''s the absolutely best "feel in hands" I''ve ever had from of holding a compact in my hands:\n\n[COLOR=#b22222][SIZE=5][B]The Box:\n[/B][/SIZE][/COLOR][/I][/I][/I]\n\n[IMG]http://i1136.photobucket.com/albums/n497/wahstar1/PG%20upload/Picture014Small-1.jpg[/IMG][I][I][I][COLOR=#b22222][SIZE=5]\n[B] The Contents:\n[/B]\n[/SIZE][/COLOR][/I][/I][/I][IMG]http://i1136.photobucket.com/albums/n497/wahstar1/PG%20upload/Box1Medium.jpg[/IMG][I][I][I][COLOR=#b22222][SIZE=5]\n\n[/SIZE][/COLOR][/I][/I][/I][IMG]http://i1136.photobucket.com/albums/n497/wahstar1/PG%20upload/Box2Medium.jpg[/IMG][I][I][I][COLOR=#b22222][SIZE=5]\n\n\n[B]The Beauty:\n[/B]\n[/SIZE][/COLOR][/I][/I][/I][IMG]http://i1136.photobucket.com/albums/n497/wahstar1/My%20Guns/Picture015Medium.jpg[/IMG][I][I][I][COLOR=#b22222][SIZE=5]\n\n[/SIZE][/COLOR][/I][/I][/I][IMG]http://i1136.photobucket.com/albums/n497/wahstar1/My%20Guns/Picture016Medium.jpg[/IMG]\n\n\n[SIZE=5][COLOR=#b22222][B]The Frame:\n[/B][/COLOR][/SIZE]\n[IMG]http://i1136.photobucket.com/albums/n497/wahstar1/PG%20upload/CaracalFrame1Medium.jpg[/IMG][IMG]http://i1136.photobucket.com/albums/n497/wahstar1/PG%20upload/FrameMedium.jpg[/IMG][IMG]http://i1136.photobucket.com/albums/n497/wahstar1/PG%20upload/Picture001Small.jpg[/IMG]\n\n\n[COLOR=#b22222][SIZE=5][B]The Slide:\n[/B][/SIZE][/COLOR]\n[IMG]http://i1136.photobucket.com/albums/n497/wahstar1/PG%20upload/30-06002SmallMedium-2.jpg[/IMG]\n\n[IMG]http://i1136.photobucket.com/albums/n497/wahstar1/PG%20upload/CaracalSlide1.jpg[/IMG]\n[IMG]http://i1136.photobucket.com/albums/n497/wahstar1/PG%20upload/Picture004Medium-2.jpg[/IMG]\n\n\n[COLOR=#b22222][SIZE=5]The Barrel:\n[/SIZE][/COLOR]\n[IMG]http://i1136.photobucket.com/albums/n497/wahstar1/PG%20upload/30-06005Medium.jpg[/IMG]\n[COLOR=#b22222][SIZE=5]\n[/SIZE][/COLOR][IMG]http://i1136.photobucket.com/albums/n497/wahstar1/PG%20upload/CaracalBarrel2.jpg[/IMG]\n\n\n[COLOR=#0000cd][B]Check below post for more specifications, impressions.\n[/B][/COLOR]\n[COLOR=#8b4513][B] [I]For Range Report See post#16 below [/I][/B][/COLOR]\n[B]\nRegards.[/B]\n[COLOR=#b22222][SIZE=5]\n\n\n[/SIZE][/COLOR]', ''),

This with the retention of the 15 shots capacity as that of Glock 19. Hence it''s [I]compacter[/I] than the G-19, whilst being more solid with added 100 grams to the weight.\n[/SIZE][/COLOR][COLOR=#b22222][B][SIZE=5]\n[/SIZE][/B][/COLOR][COLOR=#000000][SIZE=5][SIZE=4]The F model is exactly between the sizes of the Glock 17 and 19, being about 6mm shorter in length than the G-17, and 4mm longer than the G-19. Thickness is 2 mm thinner than both. Height is 7mm more than the G-19 and 3 mm shorter than the G-17. This with an increased capacity by 1 round, hence 18+1 vs 17+1 of the G-17!\n\nBarrel lengths, 4.04" of the F model, and app. 3.75" of the C model, respectively, are roughly 10 mm shorter than their Glock counter part''s, G-17 and G-19.\n \nIt really appears like if they managed to pack in quite some improvements there, with reduced dimensions.\n[/SIZE][/SIZE][SIZE=4]\nThe trigger pre-travel of 8mm''s in both models is said to be about 4-5mm [I]shorter [/I]than Glocks, offering a better break and being much crisper, also. Reset is naturally longer, when pre-travel is shorter, it''s a "Safe Action" DAO handgun and naturally the trigger has to go all the way back for the consecutive shot. \n\nI have not fired the handgun as of yet, but hope to be back with more in a couple of days, with respect to the field experience. Chief''s review however was very reassuring of my buy, though I had no idea that he was set for the torture test of the Caracal F, as in his review.

The gun is the very brainchild of Wilhelm Bubit, whose Steyr M9A1 is still conceived by many as being an edge over the Glock 17/19 [/COLOR][/SIZE][COLOR=#000000]series[/COLOR][SIZE=4][COLOR=#000000] in many aspects.\n\nThe gun has a "feel of luxury" to it that you may find only in the Glock/Steyr/XDM series of handguns.\n\nHence, to expect that this gun would fall in the category of Taurus or Turkish handguns in the market would be totally out of place to expect or wish for. At the closest - [I]and despite of being a totally different platform handgun[/I] - it may eventually land up in the closer vicinity of CZ handguns -[I] price-wise - [/I]as per our market trends over here in Pakistan[I].\n[/I]\nSee you soon[I].\n\n[/I][/COLOR][COLOR=#000000]Regards.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[/COLOR][/SIZE]', ''),

Second: Still got that Matrix thing going huh?\nHere is what I thought of the pistol:\n1.  Very nice ergonomics, really enjoyed the feel and handling.\n2.  Very reliable gun.  Designed by the same guy who designed the Steyr M9.\n3.  Gun passed the NATO standards.\nThings I didn''t like:\n1.  The slides underside is bare showing all kinds of flat sheet springs, should one come out during cleaning, will cause problems not to mention its more liable to jam when it gets dirty.  As started to happen in Abbas bhai''s case. \n2.  The rear sight is all metal fixed to the backplate, that means can''t buy or change rear sights on whim.  Also can''t install an adjustable sight to it.\n3.  Had a similar problem when I had attached the stock, and its NOT the recoil part as the more firm you hold the gun the more likely its to recoil fully rather than in the hand which takes up most of the recoil with movement.\nThing(s) in question:\n1.  For 100k does it come complete in a big case with the foregrip and the rear stock and the lock??\n2.  What about parts?  I know Dubai is near but this stuff is hard to purchase, plus I understand they are not keeping up with the production.  I know that for Glocks just about everypart is available here.', ''),

Looking forward to your review.\n\n@Mitho & Mig The trigger reset is not a problem just a personal preference. We are used to shooting Double Action/Single Action triggers, the Caracal has a Double Action Only (DAO) trigger. I.e the trigger does not get lighter after the first shot, it stays the same on every shot.\n\n@Aquarius Lolz, I completely agree and the very same thought went through my mind when I was shooting it afterwards ;) \n\n@Moeen On point 1: I agree, thought the same thing that it should be covered but upon closer inspection not easy to get those little springs out. There was quite a lot of mud on the slide underbelly after the mud/water test but it still kept shooting. Personally like you I''d like one to be there just in case.\n\nOn point 2: Agreed again. The sights should really be removable. \n\nIn 100k there is just the box, gun, two mags and a manual. Accessories are optional. Dunno how much they cost.

This gun should [B]not [/B]retail for more than Rs. 80,000. It is pointless to launch a gun when good press is being generated about it only to waste it all by sticking to a price at which no one is willing to purchase it. The distributor is of the mindset that it is a competitor to the Glock and Steyr so should command premium prices like them and the consumers are of the opinion that it is a new gun from a new manufacturer whose country has no export restrictions to Pakistan so it should be sold at normal prices. If CZ did not have a presence in the market perhaps CARACAL could have managed to convince people it was worth 100 k + but with the $ 1000 + CZ''s selling for Rs. 100,000 to Rs. 125,000 surely trying to sell a $ 500 pistol for Rs. 125,000 is foolish.\n \nDuty structure, manufacturer prices is really no excuse. We see $ 400 Taurus''s (from Brazil which has no export restrictions to Pakistan) being sold for Rs. 50,000 and $ 275 CF-98''s (from China) being sold for Rs. 30,000 or $ 400 Canik''s selling for Rs. 45,000. Why then can''t a gun which is being sold for $ 500 in the U.S be sold in Pakistan for Rs. 80,000 ?\n\nCARACAL tried the Glock pricing formula in the US and failed miserbly, only a handful of hard core gun nuts picked it up as a curio and the consumers when asked to choose between a Glock or a Caracal didn''t think twice and picked up the Glock. Pakistan has the potential to be one of the largest markets in the world for Caracal, not because of our purchasing power but because we genuinely need a sensibly priced replacement for Glock and equallily reasonably priced ammo to put through it. \n\nIn most Western countries people will never accept CARACAL over Glock even if the next generation of the gun is better than it. We here in Pakistan have no such hang up''s or bias and don''t look down at a gun from U.A.E or Turkey to be any less than a gun produced in the U.S. We are willing to accept it whole heatedly but [B]the price should be right[/B].', ''),

Thanks for the kind words, and thanks a bunch for reassuring my Caracal C choice positively with that torture test, I feel like a proud owner now, let''s see what happens in the field, yet I''m confident that I got a winner in my hands.\n\nI personally have requested the gentlemen importing it to do include the 3.rd magazine with the package - irrespective of customs regulations, added cost, etc, and a year''s warranty on the handgun would really boost the impact as well. Let''s see, I believe some sort of regularization should be due, either added extra''s, or regulated price.\n\nPersonally, I am glad to own a Caracal C model and I wish to express my thanks to the gentlemen importing it, for all the friendly interaction during the process of procurement, not to say, even managing it according to my choice serial number, lol!\n\nI truly wish the Caracal authorities the best of future here in Pakistan.\n\n\nRegards.', ''),

Sights: kindly add a few words on the sight setup. cause I feel that this reduced sighting radius might help in instinctive/point shooting however they are severely limited as far as accuracy is concerned and \r\nwill pose a serious problem in zeroing if the point of impact in off in the vertical plane.\r\n\r\nRegards.', ''),

I believe the vid should prove this assertion of mine, you simply cannot think about the trigger''s [I]revert to normal stage[/I] with this rate of fire.\n\nOverall, let me sum the shooting experience up, the Caracal C is no doubts one pleasure to shoot out and with the lowest recoil factor to it that I personally ever have felt from a 9mm para.\n \nI have never really been a good judge on the recoil factor and always thought it to be a natural "behavior of guns", probably because I have rarely felt a great difference with this respect from one 9mm handgun to another, when comparing two of same category handguns, be it full sized or compacts. The Carcal C stood out with this respect due to it''s "soft" recoil, almost air-soft.\n\nI have used a Glock and find that the grip of the Caracal is by far more [I]user friendly[/I] than Glock''s "brickish", [I]aggressively contoured[/I] type of grip, especially for the small to mid sized hands, and it adds to the overall shooting pleasure, [I]control[/I].\n\nLet me know if I missed out anything, will be back with my final remarks on the Caracal in my subsequent post.\n\n\n[/SIZE][/COLOR][COLOR=#000000][SIZE=4]\n\n[/SIZE][/COLOR][COLOR=#000000][SIZE=4][/SIZE][/COLOR][SIZE=7][SIZE=4][B][SIZE=4][/SIZE][/B][/SIZE][/SIZE][SIZE=4][COLOR=#000000]I have been asked by quite a few friends about the price paid and whether if I deemed it an appropriate pick to fullfill my requirement for a poly framed duty gun, by choosing a whole new, untested brand.\n[/COLOR][/SIZE][B][SIZE=4][COLOR=#000000]\n[/COLOR][/SIZE][/B][SIZE=4][COLOR=#000000]Let me clarify my stance with respect to the Caracal being a "new entrant'', and you''re certainly free to disagree and comment your views.\n[/COLOR][/SIZE][B][SIZE=4][COLOR=#000000]\n[/COLOR][/SIZE][/B][SIZE=4][COLOR=#000000]The perfection in handguns comes with times and several generations of the same base model,the manner by which Glock has developed from it''s initial version to the present gen 4, the Steyr M9A1 from version 1.0 and on-wards.\n \nCaracal could thus both be seen as a new entrant as well as an "old" [I]continuation[/I], since it''s basically just another link to the [I]evolution[/I] of Safe Action handguns, the kinds of Glocks, Steyr''s, XDM''s, etc. Moreover it has been designed by the very man who''s brainchild the Steyr M9A1 still is a preferred duty gun for many across the world, some deeming it a notch above the Glock as well, in a few aspects.\n[/COLOR][/SIZE][B][SIZE=4][COLOR=#000000]\n[/COLOR][/SIZE][/B][SIZE=4][COLOR=#000000]I would therefore rather call it an[I] old gun[/I], [I]further perfected[/I], and manufactured from a different place of origin, than the traditional Austrian. \n[/COLOR][/SIZE][B][SIZE=4][COLOR=#000000]\n[/COLOR][/SIZE][/B][SIZE=4][COLOR=#000000]The improvements, as if compared to the Glock/Steyr, lie basically [/COLOR][/SIZE][COLOR=#000000]in[/COLOR][SIZE=4][COLOR=#000000] below main things:\n[/COLOR][/SIZE][B][SIZE=4][COLOR=#000000]\n[/COLOR][/SIZE][COLOR=#0000cd][SIZE=4]\n1) Parts reduction to 28 from +30.\n\n2) Lower bore axis\n\n3) Better, crisper trigger\n\n4) Reduced dimensions, retention of mag capacities, even increased in F model to 18+1 vs Glock17''s 17+1.\n[/SIZE][I][SIZE=4]\n[/SIZE][/I][SIZE=4]5) Better ergonomics.\n\n6) Model variations ( F, C, F and C-QS.)\n[/SIZE][/COLOR][SIZE=4][COLOR=#000000]\n[/COLOR][/SIZE][/B][SIZE=4][COLOR=#000000]\nAs I have stated earlier, The Steyr is the most identical to the Caracal, and vice versa, and you can definitely see and feel the Bubit heritage in the Caracal. Let me add a couple of pics, the 1.st one showing the Steyr vs Caracal bore axis, where clearly the Caracal''s can be seen as [I]lower placed[/I]:\n \n[B]Caracal to the right:[/B]\n\n[/COLOR][/SIZE][IMG]http://i1136.photobucket.com/albums/n497/wahstar1/Caracal/M_C_Compare_front.jpg[/IMG]\n\n[B]\n[SIZE=5]On dimensions:[/SIZE] (Steyr to the left in first pic, Glock to the left in 2.nd pic)[/B]\n\n\n[IMG]http://i1136.photobucket.com/albums/n497/wahstar1/Caracal/IMG_4987Small.jpg[/IMG][IMG]http://i1136.photobucket.com/albums/n497/wahstar1/Caracal/IMG_5013Small.jpg[/IMG]\n\n\n[SIZE=4][COLOR=#000000][B]\n[SIZE=5]Vs the G-19:[/SIZE]\n[/B]\n\n[/COLOR][/SIZE][IMG]http://i1136.photobucket.com/albums/n497/wahstar1/Caracal/Glock19vsCaracal1.jpg[/IMG][SIZE=4][COLOR=#000000]\n[/COLOR][/SIZE][IMG]http://i1136.photobucket.com/albums/n497/wahstar1/Caracal/Glock19vsCaracal2.jpg[/IMG][COLOR=#000000]\n\n\n[SIZE=5]So as you can see, it''s basically more of an [I]evolutionary link [/I]to the already existing "chain" of Safe Action polymer handguns, and not "new entrant" as a whole as such.[/SIZE]\n\n[/COLOR][COLOR=#B22222][B][SIZE=6]Price:[/SIZE]\n[/B][/COLOR][SIZE=5][COLOR=#000000]\nI''ve been asked this question right from the moment it landed with me and I truly appreciate that the closest of friends did have the patience to wait it out. Let me be clear, price is quite a [B][I]relative[/I][/B][/COLOR][B][I] matter[/I][/B][/SIZE][SIZE=4][I], [/I][SIZE=5]which[/SIZE][/SIZE][SIZE=5][COLOR=#000000] you have to gauge in comparison to your already existing options in handguns of [I]similar platforms[/I].\n \nHence comparing it to the price of CZ''s is kind of[I] irrelevant[/I], since these are two totally different things. Caracal is best compared to the Glock/ Steyr series of handguns, which are priced at some 350K''s and 240K''s, [/COLOR][/SIZE][SIZE=6][SIZE=5][I][COLOR=#000000]respectively[/COLOR][/I][/SIZE][/SIZE][SIZE=5][COLOR=#000000], with minor variations from city to city.[/COLOR][/SIZE]\n\n[SIZE=5][COLOR=#000000]I''d say - especially in the light of Abbas bro''s 1100 rounds torture test of the F model - that this handgun, in terms of quality has already established itself. Some of our close friends have even fired thousands of rounds from this handgun and were satisfied, even when there were still doubts on [/COLOR][/SIZE][COLOR=#000000][B][SIZE=5]whether[/SIZE] [/B][/COLOR][SIZE=5][COLOR=#000000][SIZE=5]the handgun would be introduced here commercially or not.[/SIZE]\n\n[SIZE=5]With thanks to Arms & Accessories, the Caracal distributors in Pakistan, I was handed over the C -QS model, with 3 mags as a promotional package, a year''s warranty and a box [/SIZE][/COLOR][B][COLOR=#b22222]@ 100K''s ($1100)straight[/COLOR][/B][/SIZE][COLOR=#000000][SIZE=5][B]. [/B][/SIZE]\n\n[/COLOR][SIZE=5][SIZE=4][SIZE=5]Now you may consider it high or low, whatsoever, yet kindly do bear in mind, that the warranty attached does have it''s cost and significance. The distributors offer a year''s limited warranty with the boxes as 1.st time concept with handgun''s in Pakistan and I feel this does justify a slightly increased deal than what most would have expected.[/SIZE]\n[/SIZE]\nLet me say, before the critiques - [I]if any[/I] - start pouring in,[/SIZE][COLOR=#b22222][SIZE=5]" [SIZE=6]it''s certainly no [B]sin[/B] [I]not[/I] to take it [/SIZE]"[/SIZE][/COLOR][SIZE=5], if you don''t like it or feel there are better 100K options of it''s kind to take instead, but at the same time it would probably be a "blessing" to your collection and at a reduced/favorable\n cost if you do.\n \nI''d still say, I''d prefer to have 3 Caracal''s over the price paid for 1 Glock in Pakistan, and 2 Caracal''s over 1 steyr at it''s respective price tag, everything in life is "relative".\n\nI''ll post a comparison review soon, that will clarify that it''s a much better, more potent CCW package than a CZ-Rami 2075D and more "carry friendly" than a P07 Duty, if we still should compare it to DA/SA handguns of same price range.\n\n[B][COLOR=#b22222]I''d recommend the QS model only to those who have a [I]genuine SD requirement[/I]. The F and traditional C models are better suited for traditional shooting, sports, owing to better sighting variations.[/COLOR]\n[/B]\nFinally, my thanks to Arms & Accessories, Karachi, and the Caracal distributors for some very fine customer dealing, and I truly hope they''ll be dealing with our forums to the best of our satisfaction. I talked to one of these gentlemen yesterday and was told that prices would be tried the best to be kept at a [I]constant level[/I], no "artificial shortage" abrupt hikes.\n\n\n[SIZE=5]Regards.[/SIZE]\n\n\n\n\n[/SIZE]\n[COLOR=#000000][SIZE=4]\n[/SIZE][/COLOR]\n\n \n[COLOR=#000000]\n\n\n\n\n[/COLOR][SIZE=5][COLOR=#000000]\n[/COLOR][/SIZE]', ''),

There are heavy fines on over bagging & hunting before & after the season, but no one cares, primarily due to corruption. The only difference we could make is that we as responsible hunters, start obeying the regulations. If we don''t obey the rules as mentioned in our licenses, how can we raise fingers on others, may they be torchers or netters or whoever they are.\r\n\r\nTo be honest, we all should take a moment to think about our pasts and see how many times have we exceeded our bag limits. Hunting is a very serious sport, and we cannot simply refuse to accept the responsibility of "this little violation of crossing 6 birds per gun by 1 or 2 odd birds". This is exactly the same lame excuse as a person with net would innocently say "I am so poor that I don''t even have a gun, so I use the net to catch birds and feed my children"\r\n\r\nI have been in the field with falcons once, and I have witnessed the mass murder. This is wrong and I have decided never to hunt with falcons again in my life, even if wildlife department forecefuly issues me a license for this kind of hunting. As for the pointers, if you are carrying a valid gun dog license, there is no harm in hunting with it as long as bag limit is obeyed. Personally I don''t like to hunt with dogs much, only because I love spending time walking in the fields, and there is no excuse for me to stay there if I have 5-6 birds during the first couple of hours. \r\n\r\nWe have a good fellow member at Pakguns, whose signature says something like "a good hunter is a good conservator too.."

It is a very accurate gun, though it does need a custom trigger; I love its weight, balance and almost no felt recoil.\nThe C'' More sight needs getting used to and one does not have to centre it in the target the moment it is any where in the aiming area release a shot, if you wait for the dot to centre and stay there; it is not about to happen.

Most of them are 1 or 2 minute clips and usually one video just has one test not all of them.\n\nAnother thing that I noticed watching the Youtube video''s is that people do a lot of outtakes (i.e the video''s are cut and paste and not continually recording). As in someone would claim that they shot 5,000 rounds though a handgun but the clip will only be a minute long. \n\nAnyway I tried to find torture tests for the Beretta 92, the Glock and the HK to see how they compare with the Caracal and I have to say so far the CARACAL outshines them all !\n\nHere are best two Berreta / Glock video''s I could find:\n\n[video=youtube_share;Srg4nwVv6go]http://youtu.be/Srg4nwVv6go[/video]\n\n[video=youtube_share;e6bNQ4Orp6U]http://youtu.be/e6bNQ4Orp6U[/video]\n\n[video=youtube_share;uORhTcKe8Ms]http://youtu.be/uORhTcKe8Ms[/video]\n\n@Bbiillaall It''s surprisingly fine.

The Piranha-C is a little hard to get, so go for the Shark-C instead. It''s specs are identical to the CZ-75 Compact, only frame differs.

(396343, ' @12G, PakiPower, BadarJanjua, Skeeter60 & Sohail Thank you. \n\n[U]Continuing the Review:[/U]\n\nThe gun itself has good/excellent machining and the build quality is very much on par with Glock''s. The frame in my opinion is even better, more rugged and perhaps stronger than Glocks and it certainly feels better to hold. One of Glock''s unique selling points was it''s simplicity as the entire gun just had 34 parts, Caracal have taken it a step further and reduced the number of parts to an amazing 28 ! Lesser parts means lesser things to go wrong and more reliability. \n\nI appreciate the lengths Caracal went to make their guns more reliable and then to prove a point they were sent for the most stringent testing available worldwide. Here is a excrept I came across on Wikipedia:\n\n[I]Before being put into production the Caracal pistol was evaluated through independent tests. These tests were carried out by the Federal German Armed Forces Technical Center for Weapons and Ammunition (WTD 91) in Meppen, Germany which included metallurgic and composite analysis, functional fitness-for-purpose and quality evaluation, endurance firing, environmental exposure, safety and accuracy tests. A certificate was issued by the Bundeswehr Technical Center for Weapons and Ammunition (WTD 91) in May 2006 after the pistol successfully complied with the NATO D14 standard, the German Federal Police Standard and the German Federal Armed Forces Technical Purchasing requirements. These tests are the most stringent test protocols ever devised for a service firearm.\n[/I]\nThat is seriously impressive as just the Nato test includes the following:\n\n[I]The pistol must also complete an environmental conditions test: \nThis means cold, heat, dust/sand and mud.\nThe pistol must fire after being frozen for 24 hours at &#8211;35C (-36F).\nThe pistol must fire after being heated for 24 hours at 70C (126F)\nThe pistol must fire after being submerged in mud, sand and combinations including being stripped of oil then completing the sand and mud tests again.[/I]\n\nPlaying around with and using the gun for a while I did like a few things about it. \n\n1). The trigger while double action only is pretty decent and a large improvement over other DAO triggers that I''ve shot.\n2). The slightly heavier frame absorbs the felt recoil better compared to a Glock.\n3). The checkering of the frame is almost perfect for me. In shooting 1100+ rounds I did not have any chaffed skin, grip impressions on my hand and cuts.\n4). The slightly lower barrel placement/low profile slide make double taps extremely accurate. The gun naturally comes back to the correct position. If you watch Part III at time 2:08 you can see what I mean. \n5). I like the loaded chamber indicator placed on the back of the slide instead of near the extractor or on top of the gun. This makes it much more practical. \n6). I very much like the full slide rails on the frame (shown in picture 7 on page 1) compared to the Glock.\n7). The Straight 8 sights are easy to align. \n8). Of the 22 mags that I had all fit well, there were no magazine issues (quality control, ejection, malfunctions etc.)\n9). It''s better looking than the Glock.\n10). 18 magazine capacity compared to Glock 17''s 17.\n11). The easiest take down I have ever used.\n12). The optional mag loader is one of the best I''ve come across.\n\nThere is some stuff however that I would love to see improved / modified in the Generation 2 Caracal:\n\n1). Removable sights. Trijicon/Tritium/Adjustable/Novak as options.\n2). The slide realize should be extended a bit. Perhaps make the whole area on the left side of the frame where it says "Caracal F" a slide release.\n3). The loaded chamber indicator should be colored not plain black.\n4). The disassembly lugs should be made or atleast coated in polymer.\n5). The extractor needs redesigning. I''ll attach a sample CZ extractor design compared to the Caracal. Although the Caracal one might be more robust/efficient it is at times erratic.\n6). The belly of the slide / firing pin area should be covered / enclosed and ideally the firing pin should be easily removable like the CZ Shadow.\n7). The trigger assembly needs to be made more resilient to sand and specially mud. It needs to be protected.\n8). Quality of stamping on the Slide could be improved.\n9). The magazine springs are too rigid, almost impossible to load the 18th round by hand. \n10). Glock like 33 round extended magazines would be great. \n\n[B][U]Final Verdict:[/U][/B]\n \n[B]I would like to rate this gun a "MUST HAVE". It is simply an improved Glock for 1/3 the price.

Please elaborate.[/COLOR][/B][/QUOTE]\n\n[B]@Abbas...[/B]....Thanks for your kind words Chief, appreciated.\n \nAs for the QS, you can''t imagine how many times I didn''t try to exposure with my digi cam, the direct line between the two sights, as when taking the aim, yet failed every time, since even the Makro settings on my cam wouldn''t allow such close distance exposure! I will try again sometimes this night, as I just returned from the village and am bound to leave again early morning, also to shoot out this babe tomorrow afternoon, Inshallah, for the completion of this review. More impressions shall be added also.\n\nBasically, the QS system, as explained by Caracal and the people around the world who have used it, is a new sights set-up, which kind of turns the little wonder to a "point & shoot" instrument, hence quicker SD response. In a way, you''re just aiming with the fibre optics front sight! The rear sight by the ejection port and front sight are pretty close to each other.\n\nThe sighting radius does decrease, no doubts, but - [I]reportedly[/I]- transfers no ill effects to the POI up to the range of some 20 yards or so. This should be more than enough for a SD carry/duty gun. Beyond this, there may be a discrepancy of an inch or so to the Y-axis of the POA.\n\nIt''s a totally different feeling of taking the aim, yet I''ll be in a better position to comment on this, after having fired it off.\n\n[B]@Wolf Hunter, ARJ, Nazim Sahib, Zaheer, BL, TH, Canik, Soldier 786, Ahnab, Pakipower.....Thanks guys.\n\n@TH..[/B].............Thanks TH bro, you''re welcome to question me, course, yet let me clarify, I still stand by my debate on the steel vs polymer question. Nevertheless, I had always stated and mentioned my collection wishlist would include at least 1 Safe Action handgun, be it Steyr M9A1, Glock, XDM series, whatever. The Caracal just landed here very timely for me, when I was all ready to pick the Steyr M9, even had arranged one for the pick.\n\nFinally, no, the Caracal C or F models - [I]regardless of closeness in price to the Duty [/I]- will[B] not[/B] be compared to the PO7 Duty, coz of totally different platforms. The Caracal is bound to be compared to the Steyr, Glock, XDM series of handguns.\n\nYet still, I''ll post some comparison reviews on dimensions later in this thread, and you''ll be surprised to see, carrying a Caracal is quite a different feeling than carrying the PO7 Duty. The CZ will remain the choice for DA/SA trigger preference.\n\n\nRegards.', ''),

Therefore, it is popular with shooters wanting a vermin and deer rifle with the option to upgrade to larger calibers as there are 23 choices of caliber.\r\n\r\nThe 202 Polar comes with a tough synthetic stock and polymer coating named Ilaflon, which is applied to all the metal parts, ideally suiting a real stalking rifle with maximum weather resistance and is highly resistant to scratches.\r\n\r\nThe strength of the action is partly because the switch barrel locks directly into the chamber end of the barrel. Barrels can be easily changed, so it is possible to use a variety of calibers on one chassis (unfortunately, we in Pakistan do not have this option).. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[color=#FF0000][size=150][u][b]BARREL, BOLT AND ACTION [/b][/u][/size][/color]\r\n\r\nThe barrel is retained by three cross-bolts that transverse the front of the receiver and clamp it securely in place around the chamber end with the aid of a locating peg. It is not as fast a barrel change as Blaser rifles, but it is very secure. \r\n\r\nThe barrel length is 23.6 inches with Krupp steel hammer forged construction and is silver Ilaflon coated for ultimate rust protection.\r\n\r\nThe bolt has a solid body with a supported head that locks directly into the barrel. There is a single claw extractor that efficiently expels fired cases from the rifle. \r\n\r\nA great feature is the short bolt lift angle of 60% that not only makes for a fast and relatively short bolt throw, but avoids the bolt knob coming anywhere near the eyepiece of the scope. The bolt handle has a distinctive butter knife profile and is known for its smooth movement. \r\nThe Sauer’s switch barrel system differs from others in that the barrel is retained in a yoke at the front of the action where three cross-bolts securely clamp the barrel in place with a precise fit. \r\n\r\nUnloading is done by releasing the safety to open the bolt. The magazine pops out after pushing a small plunger.\r\n\r\nBoth barrel and action are covered with the Ilaflon coating, which forms an effective barrier against rust.\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i970.photobucket.com/albums/ae189/azamkakar/Picture020.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i970.photobucket.com/albums/ae189/azamkakar/Picture025.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i970.photobucket.com/albums/ae189/azamkakar/Picture049.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i970.photobucket.com/albums/ae189/azamkakar/Picture042-1.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i970.photobucket.com/albums/ae189/azamkakar/Picture036.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[color=#FF0000][size=150][u][b]TRIGGER, SAFETY AND MAGAZINE [/b][/u][/size][/color]\r\n\r\nThe safety catch requires minimal movement from the hand to operate it. It has a single set trigger mechanism.The rifle''s single set trigger can be used in two ways. The first by simply lifting your trigger finger upwards against a plunger to release the safety and squeezing the trigger, just like any rifle. The second is to release the safety as before but then push forward the trigger into its set position. When once set, the lightest of pull fires the rifle\r\n\r\nThe base of the action houses the magazine, which is detachable and has a 3 round capacity. To release the magazine, press a small button at the front of the magazine well and the box is ejected.\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i970.photobucket.com/albums/ae189/azamkakar/Picture032-1.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i970.photobucket.com/albums/ae189/azamkakar/Picture030.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[color=#FF0000][size=150][u][b]TWO-PIECE STOCK [/b][/u][/size][/color]\r\n\r\nThe Sauer has a two-piece stock, which is secured to the action via long, threaded bolts accessed through the butt and fore-end. The rifle can be stripped down to a very short overall length for safe and convenient storage.\r\nIt has a tough polymer-stock with the Snow camo pattern which merges perfectly with the steel surface.\r\n\r\nThe butt has a well designed Monte Carlo style cheek piece, allowing good scope-to-eye alignment.. The soft touch-feature, an anti-slip coating, works very well in wet and hot conditions. This rifle offers the possibility to take off the butt stock to shorten the whole rifle and that also without taking out the barrel.\r\n\r\nThe pistol grip is designed to accommodate even the largest hand and allows for a natural hold. The fore-end is floated from the barrel and is slim.\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i970.photobucket.com/albums/ae189/azamkakar/Picture044-1.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i970.photobucket.com/albums/ae189/azamkakar/Picture026.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[color=#FF0000][size=150][u][b]Scope[/b][/u][/size][/color]\r\n\r\nI have got a Leupold VX-2 3-9 x40mm scope  for my rifle. Scope-mounting relies on separate bases and scope rings. Scope bases and rings are black in color and have been taken out for the review as they were not matching with the rifle color. Have ordered silver bases and rings.\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i970.photobucket.com/albums/ae189/azamkakar/Picture062-1.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[color=#FF0000][size=150][u][b]ACCURACY [/b][/u][/size][/color]\r\n\r\nI did not conduct any accuracy test. I just fired a couple of shots at random targets and they were all taken out. Recoil is pretty well manageable. There should be no doubt in this rifle being accurate. However, people who have conducted accuracy tests say that it is a highly accurate rifle and gives ½ inch groups at 100 yards.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[color=#FF0000][size=150][u][b]Reliability[/b][/u][/size][/color]\r\n\r\nNo feeding and ejection problems. This is a very reliable rifle from Sauer and can be used for decades without any problems.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[color=#FF0000][size=150][u][b]Price and Value for Money[/b][/u][/size][/color] \r\n\r\nIn Pakistan, it is rarely available in NIB or used condition. Considering the high price of 1 million over here, I would say that there is no comparison between value and money.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[color=#FF0000][/color][size=150][u][b]Maintenance[/b][/u][/size] \r\n\r\nSauer 202 is not a very difficult rifle to maintain except the availability of parts. The rifle can be taken apart easily for cleaning. Parts are available from online gun parts stores but are not very cheap and they do not ship to Pakistan.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[color=#FF0000][size=150][u][b]CONCLUSION [/b][/u][/size][/color]\r\n\r\nThe Sauer 202 Polar is a true hunting rifle which is built with quality engineering. It is designed for serious use in all weather conditions and can withstand any abuse and neglect. Only negative I can think of is that it does not have open sights..', ''),

(396538, '264 Winchester Magnum This cartridge was officially announced by Winchester in 1958, but production rifles didn''t show up until well into 1959. The 264 Magnum is one of a series of cartridges based on the original Winchester 458 belted case, necked-down. It is interesting for several reasons, one of being that it is the first American 6.5mm cartridge since the long-defunct 256 newton was announced back in 1913. It was originally available only in the Winchester bolt-action Model 70 "Westerner" with a 26-inch stainless steel barrel. At present, Winchester offers the standard weight Model 70XTR Magnum with a 24-inch barrel, which means some reduction on the original ballistics. For a time, the Remington 700 Series was offered in 264-caliber.\r\n\r\nThe 264 Winchester is a very fine, ultra-velocity cartridge with excellent long-range possibilities and ballistics somewhat superior to the time-tried 270 Winchester. Its development may well have been suggested by the 257 Weatherby Magnum, for the two are quite similar. The 264 should be able to equal anything the 257 WM can do, but with the added advantage of the heavier 140-grain bullet for the larger species of big game. The 100-grain bullet is intended for animals in the deer and antelope class, the 140-grain for elk and above. The rifling twist used by Winchester is not quick enough to stabilize spitzer bullets of more than 140-grains. However round-nosed bullets up to 160-grains have provided satisfactory practical accuracy in many rifles. The handloader has a wide choice of bullets ranging from 87 to 160 grains. All things considered, the 264 Magnum should be adequate for any North American big game, but it is plains and mountain cartridge, not intended for heavy brush or woods hunting. The ballistics listed in the current Winchester catalog show muzzle velocity reduced 380 fps for the 100-grain bullet and 170 fps for the 140-grain. This is probably due as much to reduced loading as it is to the shorter barrel.', ''),

(396559, ' First of all thanks AK bro for yet another informative review. The Caracal must be something really special as it is the only handgun which fulfilled your wish list for 1 polymer framed gun. I really was impressed with the fact that the manufacturers have put their heart and soul in their creation which one can see from the packaging and the overall gun quality. The following is an account of my interaction with Caracal....\n\nWent to my gun store a couple of days earlier. The guy had both the models of Caracal as well as a Glock. We stripped off the Caracal and the following are my overall impressions:\n\n1. The finishing of the internals was very good but did not look solid at all like we find in CZ pistols or even Taurus PT99 for that matter\n\n2. The internals were a replica of a glock''s internal\n\n3. Used a weighing scale to weigh the Caracal (full sized) and a glock (full sized) and the glock was lighter\n\n4. Caracal''s slide (upper portion) appeared to me as too thick and came across as a toy pistol as far as looks are concerned\n\n5. Overall finishing of the exterior was good but not eye catching (was dull)\n\n6. Trigger pull (dry fire) was crisp\n\n7. Grips were somewhat comfortable but nothing very impressive\n\n8. The curves of the recoil spring were flat as opposed to being cylindercal shaped\n\n9. Not really comfortable with striker fired pistols as it tkes an effort to double check whether a round is chambered or not. That tiny rod on the slide indicating the same in striker fired pistols is nearly invisible in low lit situations\n\n[B]Overall Impression:[/B]\n\n100k plus is a very very high price tag. Even if it was on the lower / mid price range I would prefer to pick off something else from the shelf as 1. I ain''t a plastic fan and 2. The overall design of glocks and their replicas do not impress me. Needless to say that the positive market repo of Caracal''s designer would make it a handun worth to try out. The yellow coloured optical fibre front sight was an added feature nice to have in the compact version', ''),

Dedicate an exclsuive portion of shelf/cupboard/drawer for ammunition.\r\nb. Wooden material is ok but still prefernce goes to metal as wood can catch fire easily.\r\nc.

Cocking effort for 80,90,95 respectively is 34,40,46 lbs.. this will send you sweating after a couple of shots. IMO even the 80 has a not-so-easy cocking effort before breaking-in.\n. 80 and 90 are less loud than the 95. \nSo 80 is a good option.\n\nThe cons of Weihrauch springers are:\n. Heavy\n. Slightly lesser powered than RWS ones (but very very accurate and very manageable recoil unlike RWS, so thumbs up to Weihrauch)\n. I hate the auto safety on it. RWS airguns safety can be turned off if you''re doing target practice and taking successive shots, and the safety on RWS can be reapplied if you have already turned it off and the bird/animal flys off or whatever the circumstances be. Both of these are not possible on Weihrauch airguns.\nPlus I find the safety on RWS''s more comfortably located.\n.Weihrauchs are more costly.\n\nHowever, given I have the funds and Weihrauchs are available where I am, I would opt for them, anyday.', ''),

(396684, ' Excellent stuff Mr. Abbas. Two thumbs up on conducting that test. Now we know from a reliable source how much torture this machine can withstand.\n\nI have always been hooked up on the idea of  an improvement on the Glock design with a lesser price tag and Caracal has done it well. However, like you said, the price should be right. It is an extremely important dimension to our (the gun-enthusiasts/owners) life-style and purchasing habits that you point out. Nevertheless I think the comparisons should broaden a little and at least models which already present themselves in our local market as Glock competitors should be compared against this design too. One comparison I am particularly interested in is Caracal viz-a-viz the newly (relatively) Taurus 24/7 Gen. 2. The said gun is in the range of 70-75K and compares excellently to a Glock.\n\nThe two things I like the most in the Caracal are its unique trigger reset system and the low-bore-axis. The thing I hate the most is the sights. Anyhooo, lessee where it stands in days to come and perhaps I''ll find a way to afford it.\n\nCongrats on the pure delight of firing the gun extensively and thank you for sharing it with us.\n\nRegards,\nCD.\n\nPS.

(396662, '280 Remington (7mm Express Remington) The 280 Remington was introduced by that company in 1957. Initially it was chambered in the Remington Model 740 autoloader, later in the 760 slide action and the 721 and 725 bolt actions. The 700 series bolt-action rifles by Remington originally included the 280 chambering. From 1979 to 1980, Remington cataloged the 280 as the "7mm Express Remington," but too much confusion resulted and they went back to the original 280 moniker. Most European manufacturers have added to their bolt-action rifle line. The 280 Remington, actually a 7mm with a bullet diameter of .284-inch, is based on the 30-06 case necked-down, and is very similar to the 7mm-06 which has been around for a good many years. In 1979, Remington introduced a new 150-grain loading.\r\n\r\nThis is a 30-06 class cartridge of slightly more power than the 270 Winchester, at any rate, it can be loaded to greater power if fired from a bolt action rifle. If used in the autoloader or the slide action, pressures must be kept below 50,000 psi. Factory ammunition is loaded to about 47,000 psi. It would be stretching a point to say that the 280 is better than the 270 Winchester, although it is probably a little more versatile due to the variety of factory bullets available. The 280 is certainly adequate for any North American big game and would also lend itself for use on varmints and the lesser varieties. It is another case of a good wildcat cartridge finally emerging in a commercial version. It has picked up a modest following among 7mm fans since its introduction. The new 150-grain bullet at 2970 fps brings out some of the latent potential of the 7mm/280, which is truly an excellent long-range big game cartridge.', ''),

(396710, ' SHOT GUNNER,\n\nI don''t know of any single-barrel rifle manufacturer  that stamps on the rifle barrel "22LR/22WMR"  or similar markings indicating that 22LR and 22 magnum cartridges can be fired in that rifle. The cartridge and chamber dimensions of the two calibers are different. One may be able to insert a 22LR cartridge into a 22 magnum rifle.  Firing such a combination is asking for trouble on two counts. First - the rim of the 22LR cartridge may blow up. Second - with long chamber (22 mag) and a short cartridge (22LR) the chamber will be ruined over time.  \n\nSound safety advise for myself and others- never, ever fire a cartridge in a rifle that is not designed for that cartridge.', ''),

The only imported pellets we have here are Gamo Pro Mags and their quality has really gone down the drain, they make like 10 inch groups at 10 yards.\nNever tried these pellets but ordered these, will soon get to use them and thus I will be able to comment on their accuracy.\nHowever I ordered these after reading a lot of reviews, and finally I made the conclusion that Crosman Premiers and JSB pellets are the best pellets for airguns.\nBut What on earth is this??? \n[url]http://www.pyramydair.com/s/p/Crosman_Premier_22_Cal_14_3_Grains_Domed_625ct/116[/url]   -----> 625 pellets for $24.99\n[url]http://www.pyramydair.com/s/p/Crosman_Premier_22_Cal_14_3_Grains_Domed_500ct/769[/url]   -----> Same type, 500 pellets for $8.99\nThe ones you are talking about (625 pellets and cardboard box) are too overpriced, whats the reason. You can get the same 500 pellets in a tin for like 1/3 the rate.\n\nConclusion: They are very accurate, and make .5 inch groups @60 yards+ with a Benjamin Discovery (I read this in a review).

Tried the red box at the range together with some freely supplied POF 1Z. Loved the POF as compared to the red box. Sadly POF was unavailable so bought S and B 124 grains FMJ. Like I said I carry both FMJs and JHPs for SD and HD. As you are aware that JHPs are incapable of penetrating through wooden doors or metal objects or a sofa seat to be precise so that is where my S and B FMJ comes into action. For one on one action I use Armscor 124 grains JHP. I will keep on using Chinese red box at the range coz I can afford to burn 42 rupees per round as compared to the 60 rupees per round for the S and B.\r\n\r\nRed box here in Karachi is around 42 rupees per round, Armscor JHP is around 80 per round and S and B FMJ 124 grains for 58 rupees per round. I think these are decent enough, no need to go above that.[/QUOTE]\r\n\r\nSalaam Bhai,\r\nAre POF rounds common in the market yet?

(396850, ' AOA AK bro, first of all congrats on your new acquisition.\n\nA very detailed and in depth review indeed, thank you for putting the effort and time in it so guys like myself can learn and gain first hand knowledge about this handgun from a first hand experience.\n\nI myself was greatly surprised when you told me that you got a Caracal. Honestly speaking I did not think of Caracal as much than a knock of or a wanna be clone of Steyr, or rather an unholy birth stemming from the union of Glock and Steyr LOL. \n\nBut after having a conversation with you, you were kind enough to elaborate different aspects of this handgun in detail, and I was convinced enough to do a little bit more research by myself. And after having the conversation with you and after some research I started to look at the handgun in different light and starting to hold a certain respect about it that is reserved for some select few handguns.\n\nWell many things highlighted by you are impressive, such as the rifling etc, plus the slimmer design and especially the quick sight concept is thought provoking when it comes to actually buying a polymer striker fired handgun. Also an extra mag in the package is impressive, because lots of us are usually in search of an extra mag for our handguns. But what is really impressive is that it comes with a limited warrantee with it, I only want to know that when this gun will be mass marketed, how are they going to deliver on that, I mean will we have to send it all the way back to the manufacturer or are they going to give us some facility or any qualified and certified guys for repairing this gun here in Pakistan.\n\nAnother aspect I found impressive is the trigger in it, by the looks in the video and Moeen bhai''s statement backing it up, I am darn impressed with its performance, also it may be just me, but I noticed that the recoil and the muzzle flip were almost absent during the rapid fire, if it is so, then I believe that the added weight of the handgun compared to Glock etc also helps in this aspect and is very very impressive. Now I believe that there is a torture test has already been carried out by Abbas sb, and both of your reviews hold this gun in very impressive class.\n\nAs for the price aspect, I believe that its a relative term, and we all have to be realistic in this aspect as well, we must keep in mind how much we are paying for handguns here, a small example the Mark 23''s were sold as high as 700k, although we have to compare apples to apples and oranges to oranges, but that was just an example so that we should be realistic when thinking about the price of this handgun, which in case of the two reviewers is as good as Glock and Steyr, and maybe surpass them in some aspects, because after all this handgun was conceived and manufactured after Glock and Steyr, so in a way its and evolution to those handguns, just my opinion though.\n\nAnyways, all in all a great review. Thank you once again for taking out the time and putting in the effort so the rest of us can gain first hand knowledge from your experience.', ''),

The prices downed further would probably assist in bringing the exorbitant $3500-$4000 prices of the Glock or $2500 of the Steyr M9 down also, and that credit would go to Caracal as well. \n\nI''d request respected mods to kindly open a new thread and transfer all preceding posts to that, where probably the importers could get a chance to interact and reply to all queries.\n\nLet''s limit this thread to the technical aspects of the handgun only.\n\n\nRegards.', ''),
(397260, ' @All\nThanks guys, hope it helped everyone! :)\n\n@12GAUGE\nI actually started this thread so that we can optimize the usual "tap, rack & bang" process. If you read the sections on "Stovepipe" and "Out of Battery", you''ll see that there''s no need to "tap, rack & bang"; it''s just wasteful to go through those motions when something more simpler works. For example, in case of a "Stovepipe", why should I tap the magazine and rack the slide to clear the malfunction? The magazine is seated just fine (otherwise I''d have a "Failure to Feed"), and by racking the slide I''m also removing a good round from of the chamber. I am simply wasting precious seconds by the "tap & rack" when a simple swipe across the slide to dislodge the stuck casing will suffice. The ultimate objective is to [B]LOOK[/B] at the gun in order to see what the malfunction is, and then to take the appropriate action. Going through the rote routine of "tap, rack & bang" every single time, instead of properly diagnosing what the problem is, IMHO a thorough waste of time. Time is [B]THE[/B] most important commodity in a gunfight, and if you can manage to shave off even a few seconds while clearing your malfunctions, then the faster you can get back into the fight.', ''),

(397008, '7mm-08 Remington Remington introduced this medium capacity rifle round to the marketplace in 1980. It is based on the unmodified 308 Winchester case necked-down to 7mm and loaded with a 140-grain bullet at 2860 fps. Remington advertised this cartridge as the "......first modern 7mm round designed for use in short-action rifles." This is rather interesting claim in view of the fact that the 284 Winchester designed for the same purpose, arrived on the scene in 1963. Furhter more the 7mm-08 is a direct copy of the 7mm/308 wildcat that dates back to at least 1958, probably earlier. This is not meant to denigrate what is a very fine cartridge, but rather to demionstrate that there really isn''t much new under the sun despite advertising claims.\r\nOriginal rifles chambered for the 7mm-08 were the Remington Model 788 and 700BDL Varmint Special bolt-actions. Current Remignton catalogs list 700 series and Model Seven bolt actions as available in this chambering. Other makers are begining to chamber it; among the early starters were Savage and Alpha. Silhouette shooters of all types also use the 7mm-08 Remington.\r\nRemington has certainly hung their hat on 7mm caliber and with considerable success. They now offer five chamberings: 7mm-08, 7x57mm Mauser, 7mm Express (280 Remington), 7mm Remington Magnum and 7mm BR for the XP-100 silhouette pistol. However, the 7mm BR originated as something of a semi-wildcat based on the 308x1.5-inch necked-down. Remington has contributed more than any other company to the belated recognition ot the ballistic advantages of the 7mm caliber by U.S. shooters.\r\n\r\nThe 7mm-08 140-grain load surpasses the 308 Winchester 150-grain load downrange, according to Remington tests from a 24-inch barrel. Based on Remington ballistic data, this appears to be true, particularly at around 500 yards. At that range, the 7mm bullet has an edge of 238 fps and 750 fpe over the 308 bullet. This would make at least some difference in potential killing power and also help in better bullet placement at unknown distances. This is not sufficient difference to cause owners of 308-caliber rifles to rush down and trade them off for 7mm-08s, but it does illustrate the ballistic advantages of the smaller caliber.\r\nThe 7mm-08 is a great favorite with many metallic silhouette shooters, and many glowing reports have been heard regarding its accuracy on the range, particularly with handloads. It is also building a good reputation as a long-range deer and antelope cartridge. When handloaded with heavier bullets than the factry 140-grain, it would alo be suitable for heavier game such as elk. Unfortunately, the two factory bullet weights do not make for a very flexible big game cartridge unless one is willing to handload. On the other hand. by handloading, this cartridge can be adapted to anything from varmint shooting through elk and becomes quite versatile.\r\nThe case capacity of the 7mm-08 is slightly less than the 7x57mm Mauser and performance with the heavier bullets of around 175-grains is about 100 to 150 fps less, which is not anything to get real excited about. The fact of the matter is that the 7mm-08 is adequate for most North American hunting, but is handicapped by only two commercial bullet loadings. Possibly Remington did not visualize the 7mm-08 as a hunting cartridge, but as primarily a target and silhouette round, so they stayed with the lighter-weight 120- and 140-grain bullets.', ''),

(397014, '7-30 Waters The 7-30 Waters was introduced by Winchester in 1984 for the Model 94XTR Angle Eject rifle nad carbine. The cartridge was actually the work of Ken Waters, a well-known and popular gun writer and ballistic expert. He began planning the cartridge in 1976, as a high-vlocity, flat-trajectory round for the short, handy, lever-action carbines. These are many problems to be overcome by those who would improve on the performance of the 30-30-class cartridges and lever-action rifles. Severe restrictions are imoosed by the tubular magazine, the lenght of the action and the permissible working pressure. However, by 1982 Ken had, by working within these constraints, developed a cartridge that would push the 139-grain 7mm bullet at close to 2600 fps. At this point, U.S. Repeating Arms Co., who now manufacturers Winchester brand rifles, became interested in the project and decided by 1983 to go ahead and produce Model 94 lever-action rifles for this cartridge. \r\nfederal Cartridge Co. then worked on the final version of the cartridge, making various dimensional changes and opting for the 120-grain bullet weight because they could achieve higher velocity at less pressure than with the 139-grain bullet. The current commercial loading uses a 120-grain Nosler H-jacket bullet which develops a velocity at the muzzle of 2700 fps when fired from a 24-inch barrel.\r\n\r\nThe 7-30 Waters does offer improved performance for those who like the lever-action carbine or rifle and should make a good deer/ black bear- class caliber. However, the majority of 30-30 lever-action fans prefer the short carbine since most are woods and heavy brush hunters, and the 7-30, with its light 120-grain bullet is unlikely to best the 30-30, 32 Special, 38-55, etc. in brush or woods. Also, it is not going to be the answer for the long-range plains or mountain hunter. When fired from a 20-inch barrel, its performance will be considerably reduced, so anyone interested in this caliber will be better served if they buy the rifle rather than the carbine. The light recoil of this cartridge makes it an excellent choice for a woman, boy or anyone who is recoil shy. The 7-30 would probably be at its best in broken-type country with shots varying from patches of brush and trees to open areas and shot ranging from, say, 75 to 175 yards ofr more.', ''),

(397054, '7mm Mauser (7x57mm) Developed as a military cartridge by Mauser and introduced in 1892, the 7mm Mauser was adopted by the Spanish government and chambered in a limited quantity of Model 92 Mauser bolt-action rifles, which were a modification of the Belgian pattern 89. In 1893, Spain adopted a new model Mauser in this same caliber. This rifle has been called the Spanish Mauser ever since, although it was also adopted by Mexico and a number of South American countries. Remington chambered their rolling block and Lee rifles for the 7mm about 1897, and later the Model 30. The Winchester Model 54 and 70 also chambered it. Currently, the Ruger Model 77 and Winchester Featherweight bolt action, plus the Ruger Number One single shot offer the 7mm as standard among American-made rifles. However, most British-and European-made bolt-action rifles and combination guns chamber the 7mm Mauser, as do many custom-made rifles each year.\r\n\r\nAlthough originally a military cartridge, the 7x57mm Mauser has proven itself as one of the best all-around sporting rounds ever developed. It is particularly useful in lightweight rifles because it delivers good killing power with  moderate recoil. It has been used successfully on every species of big game on earth, including elephant. However, it is no elephant cartridge in the true sense of the term and its success is due largely to the hunting conditions and ability of the hunters who have used it. Ballistically, it is only less powerful than 270 Winchester or the 280 Remington. It is adequate for most American big game, but is perhaps on the light side for Kodiak bear or moose unless used by an experienced hunter. The 7mm Mauser was discontinued in American-made rifles about 1940 due to lack of popularity. Since the end of WWII, it has become increasingly common due to the influx of surplus 7mm military rifles for several years after the war. The wide selection 7mm bullets now available for handloading has also contributed to an increase in popularity.', ''),

(397058, 'PISTOL MALFUNCTIONS - Immediate &amp; Remedial Actions Salam & greetings all!\n\nPistol malfunctions is something which we all experience atleast once on the range, irrespective of the type of firearm or ammo we''re running. The usual and tried & true method of "tap, rack & bang" is a sure fire process to clear almost all known stoppages, yet I''ve learned that, at times, this generic method is a simple waste of time. Now, I understand that on the range we have all the time in the world to fix malfunctions, but if you find yourself (God forbid) in a shootout with your life hanging in the balance, time is a commodity we almost never have.\n\nI know that there are a lot of seniors and experienced shooters here for whom remedying these malfunctions is something they could do in their sleep. I''m writing this for relative newbies like myself, as a way of showing more efficient and effective methods of clearing jams in as little time as possible.\n\nNow, first off, a semi-automatic handgun can experience [B]ONLY FOUR TYPES OF MALFUNCTIONS[/B] (provided there''s nothing physically wrong with your firearm or you''re not experiencing any ammo related problems). These malfunctions are: [B]Failure to Feed, Out of Battery, Stovepipe and Double Feed.[/B] A pistol, no matter it''s make, model or year of production, [B]CAN NOT[/B] suffer any malfunctions other than the above mentioned under ordinary circumstances.\n\nOrdinarily, we''re taught that the first three of the aforementioned malfunctions can be cleared using the "tap, rack & bang" method (also known as an [B]"immediate action"[/B]), while the Double Feed requires the longer, [B]"remedial action"[/B]. I think having a generic method of clearing jams, while being easier to remember, is a waste of precious time. A firearm, like any other machine, constantly communicates with the operator, and as such we''re supposed to respond accordingly. So instead of going through the usual "tap, rack & bang" every time, we should look at the malfunction, listen to what the gun is saying, and then reply with the appropriate immediate action.\n\nFirst step in optimizing the kind of immediate action we will take is to remember that there are two places through which the gun will tell you what the problem is: The rear of the slide, and the ejection port (or the chamber). As soon as you experience a malfunction, you simply tilt the nose of the gun up by 10 degrees; this will give you a clear line-of-sight to both possible areas of problem.\n\nBelow is the normal firing stance.\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]7150[/ATTACH]\n\nAs soon as you experience a malfunction, tilt the gun up by 10 degrees.\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]7151[/ATTACH]\n\nBy doing so, you will immediately see the rear of the slide and the chamber.\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]7152[/ATTACH]\n\nNow, you can begin  to problem solve and trouble shoot. Lets take a look at the four malfunctions and the most efficient methods of solving them. Remember, the following methods are meant to save you time, make your fixes more efficient and remove any waste movements you might go through (especially, as I had mentioned earlier, in a shootout).\n\n[B]1. Failure to Feed[/B][B]:[/B] This malfunction requires an immediate action. You will know you''re experiencing a misfire when you pull the trigger, the hammer/striker slams the firing pin and yet nothing happens. This failure usually happens if, either you''re carrying "dud" ammo or the magazine hasn''t seated properly. Since it is impossible to know which of the two is the cause, we tap the magazine to seat it properly incase it wasn''t, and then rack the slide to remove the "dud" round incase it was culprit. Here''s a breakdown:-\n\nStep 1) Tap the magazine to seat it properly.\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]7153[/ATTACH]\n\nStep 2) Rack the slide to remove a misfiring round.\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]7154[/ATTACH]\n\n\n[B]2. Out of Battery:[/B] This malfunction requires an immediate action. In this particular instance, the slide doesn''t follow through properly after the recoil, either because of dirt or mud stuck in the rails, or the fresh round not being chambered properly. You will notice this malfunction when, as you tilt the gun up, the rear of the slide will be "hanging" out of place. Because of this, the gun won''t fire. Here''s what should be done:-\n\nStep 1) You tilt the gun up and see that the slide is out of battery.\n [ATTACH=CONFIG]7155[/ATTACH]\n\nStep 2) To fix, simply slap the rear of the slide to get it back into battery.\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]7156[/ATTACH]\n\n\n[B]3. Stovepipe:[/B] This malfunction requires an immediate action, and is perhaps the easiest to diagnose; if you have a hunk of brass sticking straight up out of your ejection port, you''re experiencing a stove pipe. This malfunction is usually caused by a failure to extract the spent casing of the round you just fired. Here''s the method to clear it:-\n\nStep 1) Tilt the gun up, and you''ll see the spent casing sticking out of the ejection port.\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]7157[/ATTACH]\n\nStep 2) Simply sweep aggressively across the spent casing to dislodge it. This will get rid of the stovepipe and the slide will rack home.\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]7158[/ATTACH]\n\nStep 3) Get your gun back on target and shoot away.\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]7159[/ATTACH]\n\n\n[B]Continued in my next post...[/B]', ''),

Was just curious to know how accurate a bullet fired from this adopter can be, as it looks it will be flying off on its own as soon as it leaves the adopter, so a group of 5 fired from logical distances where both barrels line cross (about 35 yards) can establish how consistently accurate is it & I am sure an SxS will be better than O/U to try as you at least can use front bead to determine both tubes meeting point ;) cant say if semi or pump be used as dont know how long this adopter is.\nDoes adopter has rifling in it by the way?[/QUOTE]\n\n\nNope no Rifling smooth bore.', ''),

I am truly at the point where one starts thinking, if one really is worth this praise. Lolz on the Guns & Ammo mag!\n\nSir, as far as testing it from the 15 and 25 mtrs range, it''s my genuine impression that this should be done with the traditional sights models, hence Caracal F and C, since they offer more sighting variation.\n\nI am sure, however, that a shooter of your calibre could even take out the best from the QS model as well, but it was far beyond me, the reason why I attempted at traditional SD range and suggested in my review post, that QS models should be sought only by those like me who have a genuine SD requirement.\n\nLet''s see if the other variations of the "bird" could land in more hands for some more insight here.\n\nThe review has met overwhelming response and I kind of can''t even cope giving replies to all, timely.

However I don''t think it''ll ever be in the 70 K range as it is a much better gun than Taurus etc. \n\n@Ak47 A little birdy told me you were in talks for some days and getting one yesterday. ;) Congratulations you got yourself a winner ! Looking forward to your review.\n\n@Mitho & Mig The trigger reset is not a problem just a personal preference. We are used to shooting Double Action/Single Action triggers, the Caracal has a Double Action Only (DAO) trigger. I.e the trigger does not get lighter after the first shot, it stays the same on every shot.\n\n@Aquarius Lolz, I completely agree and the very same thought went through my mind when I was shooting it afterwards ;) \n\n@Moeen On point 1: I agree, thought the same thing that it should be covered but upon closer inspection not easy to get those little springs out. There was quite a lot of mud on the slide underbelly after the mud/water test but it still kept shooting. Personally like you I''d like one to be there just in case.\n\nOn point 2: Agreed again. The sights should really be removable. \n\nIn 100k there is just the box, gun, two mags and a manual. Accessories are optional. Dunno how much they cost. As far as parts, I raised that question with the distributor and he assured me parts will not be a problem and the guns will come with warranties.

(397083, '7x61mm Sharpe &amp; Hart Super The 7x61mm was developed in the United States by Phillip B. Sharpe and Richard F. Hart. Its design was originally based on a rimless, experimental French 7mm semi-auto military cartridge. It was copyrighted and made available on a commercial basis in the Schultz & Larsen rifle in 1953. Ammunition was loaded and inported by Norma, and the final version was a belted case. Loaded ammunition offering a 154-grain bullet, as opposed to the original 160-grain.\r\n\r\nThe 7x61mm Sharpe & Hart (now listed as the S&H Super) is very similar to the 275 H&H Magnum, a belted case chambered and loaded in England. It is in the short 7mm magnum class and its performance is the same as a number of other cartridges, mostly wildcat, based on the blown out and shortened 300 H&H Magnum brass case. However, the Sharpe & Hart case has a slightly larger rim and base diameter but its popularity in the U.S. was quite limited by competition from the 7mm Weatherby Magnum, the 7mm Remington Magnum and various wildcat developments. The 7mm S&H is, nonetheless, a very fine fine cartridge for any North American game and most African plains game. Although Norma no longer loads ammunition, brass cases for handloading will probably be available for a number of years. The fact that Norma once again loading ammunition will be good news for those who have rifles of this caliber.', ''),

(397085, '7mm Weatherby Magnum The 7mm Weatherby Magnum was developed in 1944 as one of a series of cartridges based on the necked-down and altered 300 H&H case. There are several similar wildcat versions, but Weatherby''s design is the most popular due to the availability of commercial ammunition.\r\n\r\nThe 7mm (or 284-caliber) has long been popular in the U.S. in various wildcat cartridges, yet the original 7mm Mauser never created any great enthusiasm, the result, possibly, of the poor (and underloaded) factory ammunition selection. The 7mm Weatherby Magnum, offered as a maximum performance cartridge to satisfy the demand to the 284 enthusiasts, is probably the best known widely used 7mm Magnums. This is due to the availability of factory-loaded ammunition with a good selection of bullet weights, and in part to the very fine Weatherby rifles. The 7mm has a slight edge over the 270 Weatherby on tough or dangerous game because it uses somewhat heavier bullets and churn up greater energy. However, if long-range varmint shooting is on the agenda, the 270 is better choice. The 7mm WM is adequate for any North American big game and all thin-skinned African game. The 7mm WM has, to a large extent, lost popularity to the 7mm Remington Magnum because the Remington version is available in many rifles less expensive than the Weatherby Mark V.', ''),

(397126, '7mm Remington Magnum A factory-designed, belted 7mm magnum introduced by Remington during 1962, the 7mm Remington Magnum was brought out at the same time as the improved, bolt-action 700-series rifles, which replaced the earlier Models 721, 722 and 725. Most other manufacturers have since added it to their lines. It took an American manufacturer nearly 40 years to realize that the 275 Holland & Holland (made long ago by Western Cartridge Co.) is a first-rate, medium-game, long-range caliber. The long line of 7mm wildcats and the 7x61S&H are much like the old 275 H&H, which came out in 192-1913.\r\nRemington chose to ignore the classic 7mm bullet, a 160-grain spitzer, in its 7mm Magnum loads. For some inexplicable reason, too, Remington handicapped the 150-grain by using  a rather round-nosed bullet.\r\n\r\nThe 7mm Remington Magnum is fine, long-range, gir game cartridge that could also be adapted to varmint hunting. There ia a good selection of 7mm bullets available and the handloader could make it do for just about anything. It has ample power for any North American big game and probably most thin-skinned African varieties. However, it would be an open-country, plains or mountain cartridge rather than a woods or brush number. Many will compare it with the 7mm WM or the 7x61mm Sharpe & Hart. Bitter arguments will ensue as to which is the best or most powerful. This will be akin to the ancient Greek pastime of discussing how many spirits can dance on the head of a pin. In other words, any difference in these cartridges will be strictly a matter of opinion or imagination. They all have about the same case capacity and none will do any thing the others can''t duplicate. In fact, the 7mm Remington is hardly a new or brilliant design because it is largely a commercial version of several of the wildcat short-belted 7mm magnums (Auckley, Luft, Mashburn, etc.). Its principal advantage lies in the fact that it is a standard factory product that is widely distributed and available in well-made, moderately-priced rifles. Come to think of it, that''s quite a bit to a lot of people. However, don''t trade off your present 7mm magnum with the idea that the Remington round is going to provide some mysterious extra margin of power or knockdown.', ''),

(397131, '284 Winchester The 284 was introduced by Winchester in 1963 for their Model 88 lever-action and Model 100 semi-auto rifles, both of which have been discontinued, This is the first American commercial cartridge to have a rebated or undercut rim of smaller diameter than the body of the case, though British and European designers used this type of case years ago. For a short time, the Savage Model 99 lever action was available in 284. Some small outfits like Ultra-light often chamber the 284, and so does Browning.\r\n\r\nThe 284 Winchester has the rim diameter of the 30-06 group, but the body diameter, nearly, of the belted magnums. This provides increased case capacity in a relatively short case. The cartridge is designed for medium-length actions and will increase the performance of these short, light rifles. Ballistics are practically identical to the 280 Remington and there would be no difference in killing power, range or capability between the two. (Except in some gun writer''s imagination!) The 284 Winchester should be a good long-range cartridge for any North American big game under ideal conditions. It could also be adapted for varmint shooting. Some 270 or 7mm fans have always wanted a cartridge of this type for lever-action rifles and the 284 should have filled the bill. Unfortunately, not enough people bought Model 88 or 99 rifles.', ''),

The impact of the pellet is much more with .22 while .177 has better penetration.  .177 pellet goes straight at longer distances but carries less power.  .22 calliber is a general purpose calliber which is also suitable for hunting while .177 caliber is mostly use for target practice.

(398234, ' [QUOTE=armoured;236614]Dear Pakgunners,\n\nApart from the fact that I spotted that Pakguns shooting vest at the TOSS show, got to see some really nice local made knives & cutting blades, I was disappointed at the TOSS show as far as the "so called hunting & sporting guns" were concerned.\n\nWho arranged this Toss show? "The Pakistan Hunting & Sporting Arms Development Company"...\nWhat was the show called by PHSADC? "The Premier Shooting & Hunting Sports Show"\n\nMy question to PHSADC is: Is an assault rifle really a hunting & sporting gun? Was there even a single 0.22 cal bolt action rifle displayed by any of the participants (to the best of my knowledge, there was none, as I spend 2 hours finding one). They should have been clear in the first place about what will be allowed to be displayed & what not.\n\nWhat our local industry needs to do is to focus on small/big caliber hunting / target shooting bolt action rifles alongwith improving quality of the 12Gague shotguns, and this is the prime weakness in our local arms industry. \n\nI was surprised to find some 12guage SxS Sidelock shotgun, being displayed by the most reputable armory in Pakistan, with price tag of 400k+ (export only model), and when I asked the reason for such a nice price tag, I was given the example of "Holland & Holland" that see how expensive they are....Well, this cannot justify this price tag. The only thing that can justify such prices is the quality and the art of workmanship put in by the gunsmith, and to my disappointment, when I asked the exhibitor to disassemble the shotgun, so that I could examine the barrel independently, after struggling with it for around 5 minutes, he excused that the gun is brand new and seems like it needs some oiling... this was the mechanical quality which I saw, and about the quality of the bore, better not discuss it at all. I wonder if there is a proof house in our country?\n\nI have been using shotguns since last 15 years, and I have never put any oil in my shotgun except for the kerosene oil which I use for cleaning purposes. Yet the assembling & dissembling is as smooth as anything... And here, I am referring to a 50 years old, cheapest gun of its time "by Gecado, Germany" which I inherited from my grand father... This doesn''t even have any engraving in it....\n\nBy this post, I do not intend to finger point at any company in Pakistan, but want to give some serious points to ponder for PHSADC. We want to buy Pakistani hunting guns, we want to rely on their brand names for quality and performance, but how can we? Any new gun enthusiast hunter today will go out, get a license (its another story how to get it...), and >80% of the time will opt for an imported gun...\n\nThis is the age of global competition. I am in an engineering sales job and truly understand the consequences of a lesser graded product being hit by the competitors when out in the market...[/QUOTE]\n\nThe next time you see that idiot gunsmith tell him that an H&H is a classic which enjoys perks like the finest quality raw materials gathered from around the world, a royal patronage certificate[no royal shooting party is complete without something from H&H and purdey] white english labourers and gunsmiths who have been paid proper wages slaving over their pieces and about 2 centuries worth of experience....the armouries here look like auto chop shops....they use regular metal shaping tools instead of purpose built ones and the word temper guage and ore quality means nothing to them.....their guns dont deserve anything above 55 k and thats high too.\n\n@chauhadry sahib\nPOF is indeed an exception but they too should not charge anything above 150 to 170 k for the more restricted sections of their armouries...', ''),

(397271, ' [COLOR=#8b4513]This one the post he wrote and then edited [/COLOR]:\n\nI would like to share a post by someone.\n\nI quote.\n\n*International price perspective*\n\nAny rational prospective buyer will always consider the international price at which the same product is being offered in one of the bigger markets (example US). If the buyer sees that a handgun is being offered in a US$ 350 - 400 range in the US market whereas other prominent brands, such as CZ, are being offered in the range of US$ 800 - 1,200 then the buyer would EXPECT more or less the same price differential. What is happening is that here in Pakistan, we have CZ''s top of the line products being offered in the range of Rs. 90,000 to Rs. 130,000 whereas Caracal''s two models, F and C are being offered at Rs. 100,000 to Rs. 125,000.\n\nA knowledgeable buyer will also be aware of the fact that the documentation and import duties involved, while importing firearms to Pakistan, from US/EU countries are 2 to 2.5 times higher as compared to importing firearms from South America, UAE, China and Turkey. Even the processing time is much shorter.\n\nBased on these (as well as other factors, already discussed in earlier posts), *it is my firm view that the Gun-Enthusiasts'' Community of Pakistan will expect the price to further come down.*\n\n\n*Local market options*\n\nWe are comparing Caracal with Glock and Steyr. We MUST understand that Glock and Steyr are already positioned at an artificial and exaggerated price in Pakistan. A Glock sells for around US$ 400 in the US market (remember, CZ sells for at least twice that amount over there) and Caracal is trying to position itself at a price lower than US$ 400 over there. So, therfore, it is not logical to compare the price at which Caracal is trying to sell their products here in Pakistan with the ridiculous price at which Glock is being sold here (Rs. 300,000+ or USD 3,750+). \n\nWe should also note that price-wise, a Glock and Caracal comparison is not an apples to apples comparison from the perspective that (because of reasons mentioned above) brands originating from US/EU should be compared with other brands originating from the same region. We should not compare prices of brands originating from US/EU with brands originating from countries like Turkey, UAE, China and Brazil. \n\nPakistani gun-enthusiasts have several other options (even better options) in the price range of Rs. 100,000 to Rs. 150,000. Caracal will have a very hard time trying to position itself as a serious contender in this price range. If they are really interested in penetrating the market and it is turnover that they are interested in, then an introductory price of Rs. 50,000 to 60,000 should be considered. Even CZ adopted the same approach, when they entered our market at Rs. 80,000 and then slowly increased their price to Rs. 100,000''ish. And we all can see how well they have positioned their products now.\n\n\n*CONCLUSION:\n\n_REALISTIC PRICE RANGE: RS. 55,000 - RS. 75,000_\n\n\nHaving said all that, we will still have A FEW enthusiasts who will always be willing to procure a gun at the first given opportunity without giving much consideration to the price. There will still be few for whom price is secondary. However, from a business perspective, Caracal should not be targeting those few but rather, the overall gun-enthusiasts'' community at large. Moreover, let me assure everyone that those FEW are becoming FEWER by the day because of contributions of a couple of our local gun forums, both of which are trying their best and doing a commendable job in educating the gun-enthusiasts community and helping them make better buy decisions.*', ''),

I''d rather train hard & train right in order to save time in a gunfight, than learn a generic process and loose time in a gunfight. I go through malfunction & dry firing drills using snap caps everyday for atleast an hour before going to bed, so I try to make sure that I can identify & clear all malfunctions instinctively and without wasting any time. If I can save even a tenth of a second clearing a jam in the middle of a gunfight, that fraction of a second will allow me to get back into the fight faster and may very well save my life. In all honesty, I actually found having four different methods simpler to follow and learn because they''re very logical, and therefore very instinctive. As I had written earlier, in case of a "Stovepipe", for me it''s logical (and more instinctive) to simply sweep the stuck casing rather than wasting time "tapping & racking".

(397378, ' @ denovo bro\n\nRightly put big brother... +1. Not only am i impressed by your genuine concern and vowing enthusiasm, i am also inspired by your admirable desire of regulating the profits for the gun-dealers so the Pakistani gun community can benefit. Thumbs up to that.\n\nI would, on the other hand, can pay upto 80 grand flat for it if i can find it in adjustable sights. But the asking price of 100k is definitely an insult to my intelligence. \n\n@ 12gauge bro\n\n\n+1. Now I did suggest in a post of mine on the other thread (by Mr. Abbas... the torture test thread) that the comparison should be broadened for Caracal is not the only (and certainly not numero uno) manufacturer of polymer guns in the world... and we do have the tauruses available locally which are excellent polymer guns for their value and are often compared to the Glocks (of course I''m not excluding Turkish guns from the list, but Taurus is the more compared make against Glock generally). I don''t think it is proper to pin Caracal specifically against Glock/HK... that only aids in creating a hype which would ultimately benefit the dealer/s.\n\nOn reliability: No test is like the test of time. The piece does look good. But only time would tell how well it can be relied upon. Both Glock and HK have proved their worth and tactical usefulness over a lengthy period of time.\n\nAnother point is the propriety Plasox treatment that Caracal undergoes:\n\n"[COLOR=#000000][FONT=sans-serif]The metal parts receive a proprietary "Plasox" [/FONT][/COLOR][URL="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitriding#Plasma_nitriding"]plasma-based nitriding[/URL][COLOR=#000000][FONT=sans-serif] with an enclosed postoxidizin surface treatment producing an oxidation protective coating resistant to aggressive environmental conditions.[/FONT][/COLOR][SUP][URL="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caracal_pistol#cite_note-13"][14][/URL][/SUP][SUP][URL="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caracal_pistol#cite_note-14"][15][/URL][/SUP][COLOR=#000000][FONT=sans-serif] The manufacturer claims that this proprietary protective coating method is relatively environmental friendly, is very durable and protects well against rust.[/FONT][/COLOR][SUP]"\n[/SUP]\n(Copied from Wikipedia)\n\nWe can look at Caracal''s Plasox treatment viz-a-viz the Melonite of Glock/XDm or the Tennifer treatment of HK/Taurus. Ultimately i guess it is Ferritic Nitrocarburizing vs. the Heat Treatment (Nitriding). Perhaps you can shed some more light on this as science is your field. It would definitely make for an interesting and informative read. :)\n\nRegards brothers,\nCD.', ''),

A very good example of this calculation is the price of Viking in the US and Canada market which is almost equalent with the MRSP of Glock. Point to note that probably even not legally imported in Pakistan, Viking is available at Rs. 50K.\nAs far as duties and levies of Pistol imports in Pakistan, you have already granted an allowance for Caracal while taking it at 50%. Actually aggregate % of duties and levies comes to 40% of the invoice value for NPB''s and 50% for PB''s.\nIn case importers of Caracal considers reasonable profits, I am in the list of Want to Buy.', ''),

Kindly can anyone confirm the availability and price S&W revolver in Karachi. The revolver i am particularly interested in is S&W Model 340PD. If the said model is not available is there anyway to import it. \n\nThanks and regards,\n\nAZ', ''),

I remember once paying Rs. 140k for a Taurus pt92 back in 2003 and then the flood of imported Tauri started in the market and prices came down significantly.\n\n@ CD: i concur with you completely. No test is better than the test of time and Caracal simply has no way of charging a premium unless it can prove itself in  this test. Only way to do that is to look @ long term business by giving it in the hands of as many buyers (@ the price range of Brazil/ Turkish weapons). \nHaving a new/untested brand in the market manufactured in a country not particularly known for its finesse in weapons manufacturing and following premium pricing strategy is not very prudent.\n\nTaurus PT-92 is actually made on Beretta 92 tooling yet is not priced near a Beretta 92.\nStoeger Cougar 8000 is actually a Beretta Cougar 8000  manufactured to Beretta standards on Beretta Machinery (Stoeger being a wholly owned subsidiary of Beretta) and yet it is not priced anywhere near the original Beretta Cougar 8000 price levels due to the lower costs in Turkey.', ''),

To my understanding FOB Ex-factory price of Caracal F is not more than US$350 which translates into  Rs. 31500 ( I am not taking under invoicing in account which definitely be there).\n\nNow all the duties on import per current rates (accumulated) are 50% for a semi auto pistol taking its landed cost to Rs. 47250, adding 10% more on account of overheads be its net cost for importer that is [B]Rs. 51975 ( and be Rs. 44550 if invoice value is USD300).[/B]\n\nNow my question to all dealers/importers bitten gun enthusiast community is; HOW MUCH PROFIT A DEALER n IMPORTER SHOULD BE HAVING ON ?\n\nMy personal resolution is not to buy Caracal above Rs.65000, I will never buy it (even its proved 3 times better than Glock) unless its sold on its natural price point. I am better of with any Turkish handgun than UAE''s if had to pay premium on; although paying premium on the guns originated from countries we are on their embargo list pinches a lot but for Caracal its totally not acceptable. \n\nOnce again I no way am bashing Caracal, I love this gun & be having one as soon its available at the price it should be, my concern is UNDUE PROFIT TO DEALERS which to my surprise all the above posts are over looking & even being helpful to be made from innocent gun enthusiast community.\n\nOk more later....[/QUOTE]\n\n+1 denovo sir...price must be reduced and dealers should refrain from making extraordinary profits....i think if the dealers start selling this handgun at the price equivalent to taurus/turkish handguns, there sales would increase two or threefold.hence they ''ll be able to make the same (or more) amounts of profits than wat they are making now.', ''),

[COLOR=#b22222]seeing it going to importers pocket along with unreasonably  huge margin is what we have problem with.[/COLOR][/B][COLOR=#b22222]\n[/COLOR]\nWe can teach  dealers very well bro; its not 2008, its been 3 years now we all got  ourselves educated, our voice is being heard and market trend moves with  us now; remember what happened with CZ prices? do you think these  prices would go that high without us helping national Traders to promote  CZ?  \nAnother example of power of gun enthusiast platform is Caracal  USA, just trying go on their website you will be surprised to see it  closed then try finding Caracal page on facebook you will not be able to  find it anymore. \nWhy Caracal vanished from biggest civilian  firearms market like USA? just because they have very strong platforms  (like we have now in the shape of Pakguns) to warn users before they  fall for something offered at unnatural price. \nSo brother AK we must  give heads up to our community and Caracal UAE as well before  importers/dealers start looting our community and sending the name of Caracal down the drain same way CaracalUSA did.\n\nFinal words: [B][COLOR=#b22222]I voted for 55000[/COLOR],[COLOR=#b22222] which to my calculation is reasonable price to start with[/COLOR],  gives dealers a reasonable profit, gives Caracal UAE a chance to capture good market &  provide users a chance to have a good gun well within their budget. So everyone  goes home happy happy [/B];)[/QUOTE]\n\nDenovo bro, I do not know if the handguns would go to other dealers or not, but it was a presumption, coz it is not possible for any importer to distribute throughout the country from 1 fixed venue.\n\nThis is the reason, why I requested the Caracal management in my preceding post which you sadly forgot to quote with a positive credit, that they set up their own retailer  network, at least in the main cities around.\n\nOtherwise, it is quite natural, that distribution is circulated to other retailers, since it is not purely our forum community that takes in the weapons and the handguns have to reach other customer bases as well, which may not be possible if importer operates from 1 fixed station. Hence, unless the importers set up their own network - and I truly hope they do - certainly handguns will be floating around with other dealers as well and with added cost, most probably.\n\nAs regards the warranty issue, I think when we purchase any cell phone from any distributor network, the warranty covers all Pakistan, and any defected item eventually lands back by the original distributor. ( Just an example, now don''t blow it up). I hope the Caracal management will check and reply to this thread, I am just posting my own perception on this matter and to the best of my logic.\n\nFinally, no argument on the prices, but humbly it''s a package worth much more than the Taurus packages around, which even have crossed your polled limit recently, and rejecting a handgun of this quality just because we can''t have at the price of a Taurus is probably demanding a bit in excess to reasonable terms, especially when your own calculations of import prices/cost come to [B]51K''s[/B], I wonder if your good self with all invested stakes would have been willing to take a profit of 4000 per handgun, which even a pakora maker may be able to earn in not too long time, lolz! \n\n1500 pieces reached the USA and the people over there are craving for more, there were just some issues in the relationships between the exporter and importer, or something like that, have checked but can''t exactly remember what.\n\nThanks for the interaction, I personally wouldn''t mind polling double the amounts offered, can anyone raise a finger to my will???!!!

(397652, 'Webley and Scott 912 Sporter Over Under 12 Guage Read a report on Pakguns regarding a Webley and Scott repeater shotgun and found that my worthy members were not really impressed.\r\nHowever I decided to take a plunge and bought a Webley and Scott 912 Sporter O/U in 12 guage from Baksh Elahi and Co. Here I would like to share some of my impresssions about the gun.\r\nThe CEO at Baksh Elahi told me that they are not sure about the origin of this gun as it is either Turkey or Portugal (I confirmed subsequently that they are being manufactured in Turkey under licence, however I am still not sure about Portugal). I also confirmed that the guns are then shipped to England UK for final proofing by the Company. The gun came in hard plastic casing slightly larger than Beretta but with Average finish. The box included the gun , a set of five chokes, wrench and the manual . \r\nSpecs:\r\nGuage- 12 \r\nweight- Approx 3.6 kgs\r\nTrigger- Single Selective in Gold ( trigger pull 3.7 lbs for upper and 3.5 lbs for lower barrel as claimed by manufacturer)\r\nEjectors- Yes\r\nRibs- Ventilated at top and middle\r\nChokes- Cyl, IC, M, IM and Full.\r\nMy first impression was that from outside the gun appeared elegant but little large. It had a top mounted safety lever which functions both as safety and barrel selector. Here the manufacturer could have done a better job for the sake of the optics. The gun employs a conventional Box lock action built on mono block principle. The Box lock action is with minimal no of parts with considerable simplification in cocking and ejecting. The muzzle is threaded to accept extended choke tubes which when installed protrude 25mm ahead of muzzle end. each choke is marked for steel or no steel. The forearm and the buttstock are nicely finished in Turkish Walnut with a little darker shade . The front sight is an illuminated bead which is good for easy acquiring. The recoil is considerably good and recovery for the second shot is perfect.\r\nI have been taking this gun out at the Skeet Range for last three weeks (once a week) and my impression is:\r\nAs far as the looks are concerned it is better than average however it does offer all the features which are currently popular in sporting guns. The balance is good and being a little heavier gives a good follow through. The trigger pull is satisfactory compared to beretta and the ejection is smooth and good (threw empty shells slightly over a meter). The performance of the gun made me comfortable since I have been achieving an average result of 22-23 out of 25 at the range. The gun handles well for the value of money costs slightly over 600 Pounds sterling in UK and i paid approx Rs 120000/- some images', ''),

Just like guns we choose our birds, all types of hawks are short range and falcons for long ranges. I will sure post a detailed info regarding each raptor''s quarry.\n\n Price starts from 5ks and can reach up to 400-500ks depending on bird’s kind, age, size, gender, plumage and for what it is made.\n\n To be true a hunting bird is not good for those who are new to this sport because there are several things in its daily routine to check, like its weight, diet, fitness exercise and weather conditions etc. And if a trained bird is mishandled no matter how good it is manned, it can get wild within few seconds and wont be able to train again.\n\nBut a well manned bird is suggested for newcomers which can be trained by him :). \n\n[QUOTE=Naveed_pk;236380]Nice Hawk''s collection Falco Bro :) As you are expert in this , Please tell us more what you feed them and what are the precautions while handling them.\n\n Regards[/QUOTE]\n\nThanks for your compliments Naveed Brother :) , I will sure write about their diet and some tips regarding their handling in my upcoming posts.\n\n\n[QUOTE=adeel123;236393]Just out of curiosity... how much does one Shaheen costs.?[/QUOTE]\n\nI am so sorry that i wont be able to quote the exact prices online but any member can e-mail me for this purpose.

AND they are not assembling only, this foreign third world labor is doing just that labor (making, grinding, bluing, casting, etc).\n[*]Then lets talk a little about Evolution, in case of Glock, since its design inception, it went through four different model designs before finalizing on Gen One, and then so on; however, the overall mechanism(s) has remained the same.  In case of Steyr, there is some stuff borrowed over from what Glock never used in design AND ALSO obsolete in the eyes of the International Trade Copyrights and Patents.  The rest was pretty much restyled to beat the lawsuits.  One must remember that once a designer sells his patents to a company; he looses ALL rights to at a later time copy or rework that design unless authorized by the owner of the patents.  Either that or the person can wait for 15+ years.  So a gun designer is approached and then is given money for his design and given money to make it even better prior to production.  This has been done with Steyr M9.  Sooo I am curious as to what kind of camel-hump-meat was given to this Caracal designer for dinner to so call "evolutionize" over the Glock or Steyr with a Caracal.\n[*]Fact is, given this market of international patents and copyrights - the designers had to choose what mechanisms could be had with form changes 20+% and what needs to work the same but using other variables.  So they got rid of the internal rods, pins and replaced them with leaf springs (In my opinion a very bad idea especially when exposed to the elements or the user who cannot do a proper field strip or to just the carbon buildup from usage).  Some of the things they decided to bypass common sense, like the rear sight, come on, even .30 bore has a removable sight.... and it costs less.  On the their plus side Caracal concentrated on the Glocks movie look.  A front pistol grip and a rear stock... yeah right!  Ok ok done but should have been done with elegance... not the airsoft look.  Then we get to the side panels, on Abbas bhai''s Caracal review I can see one of the side panels is protruding out meaning about to fall out.  And the side panel thing is crap if its only offering colors.  This idea came out with the HK P30 and they give you extra for various grip and size options.  In case of Caracal: Oh no Not Yellow (for days I feel like a chicken), not blue (for days I am blue), and red and black... what ever!\n[*]I was there when in 1985, a Florida Police Dept put the Glock through the tests with SWAT.  There was only one gun given.  It was dropped from third story tower (where SWAT practiced window intrusions) LOADED.  It was picked up and fired immediately (NOT CLEANED).  Then it was thrown in beach sand (Loaded) taken out - shaken and then shot (fired only five rounds then jammed).  But the worst thing they did to check strength was hammering in a 9x21 round in the barrel/slide and then firing it!  After replacing a magazine rel. button and ejecting the blown case from the chamber, they kept firing for another 500 rounds.  Oh and did I mention their water test?  Take a bucket fill with water and then clay fine mud - dump the gun inside and then roll it around - take it out - shake off the mud and fire (fired a little of half a clip). \nI have many many points I can start to think of as I sit here in front of my pc but will not waste time.  Rather if I remember something I will only add to this post.  I am of the humble opinion that this Caracal is NOT worth more than 70k with all the goodies (goodies = butt, four mags, foregrip, and panels).  Caracal needs to sort itself out by being more objective as to their design rather than trying to make a picturesque object.  They need to get a better (more educated) labor force.  For me there is nothing special about this pistol.  Caracal is charging the same money for their product as Glock but are NOT able to make the same quality via labor where as Glock and Steyr is.  [I][SIZE=4]As for AK47 bhai, he is in love with this pistol so to him even if he paid over 110k/rs he is content - I say more power to you brother and to hell with what everyone else thinks.[/SIZE][/I]\n[*]Lastly, I say this, I am willing to test against two Caracals the F and the C models some of my pistols WITH minimum of 2 Mods present.  I will conduct the test as I see fit EQUALLY meaning no complaining about broken sights or color marring or dents or dings on plastic.  So when can we do the test?  Anyone?\n[/LIST]', ''),

Keeping it simple, If I have spare Rs. 350K and spending this amount on purchasing a gun is no problem for me then I might as well go for the glock or sig, no matter the price is true reflective of the market or not or whatever, I had the money, I got the gun, damn every other thing. My such "insane" purchasing does not mean that price of glock or sig are rightly priced but it just depicts the "lust" I have for the gun and it also does not mean that prices of glock and sig should not be rectified. And even after such a fanatic purchase, if I love caracal and have "hell of a money" then I will purchase the caracal too, even though if I know that its gonna be "dragged" down after some months.\n\nHaving done such a "lavishly" shopping, I would still fight for lowering the prices, not for me, but for other consumers who are holding their decisions to buy on "right" price.

(397758, '.177 vs .22 &amp; The Winner For Hunting is .22cal The differences between .177 & .22 - and which jobs they do best.\n\n\n\nBy B.B Pelletier\n\nThere are two other smallbore pellet calibers, but in terms of sales and recognition, .177 and .22 are the major ones. For three-quarters of a century, .22 was the sales leader in America, while .177 lead in Europe nearly all that time. In the 1970s, when many British and European models started being imported to this country in large numbers, the preference for .177 came along with them and now the U.S. is in line with the rest of the airgun world. But newcomers often ask, "What are the significant differences between these two calibers, and why should I care?"\n\n\n. In any airgun, .22 is always more powerful.\n\nThis is true irrespective of the type of powerplant, length of barrel or anything else. Twenty-two delivers about 20% more punch in any given airgun. The technical specifications for the Air Arms Pro Sport illustrate that.\n\nThe same difference holds true for all other models of air rifles and pistols. When the velocity is given, the .22 is always slower, but we should not fail to appreciate that it shoots a pellet weighing twice as much. That''s where the extra power comes from.\n\n. .177 is the caliber for 10-meter target guns - period!\n\nOnly .177 is the caliber accepted by all international 10-meter shooting organizations. That means all target guns are made in that caliber and no other. The extra care given to the construction of target guns ensures that .177 target airguns are the most accurate. There are no .22-caliber equivalents.\n\n. .22 caliber dominates the hunting scene\n\nWhile is is possible to hunt with a .177, .22 caliber is by far the favorite. Sometimes, a .177 pellet will pass through the game animal without doing enough severe damage to stop the animal. Hunters who have had their quarry run away after a solid hit often switch to .22 immediately thereafter.\n\nEven a .22 pellet is no guarantee of a humane kill. The pellet still has to hit a vital spot, and even then there may be some running or thrashing after the hit - but hunters notice a decided advantage when they use .22 caliber.\n\n. .177 pellets are cheaper\nThere is a big advantage to the smaller caliber here. Not only are there more pellets to choose from in .177, they also come more to a box and cost a significant amount less. Look at Crosman Premiers in .177 compared to Premiers in .22 for a comparison. If you look at the pellet count per box, you''ll see that you get exactly twice as many .177s as .22s for the same price. That''s a dramatic example, for sure, because the usual price difference is more like 30%, or so. If you plan on doing a lot of target shooting and general plinking, .177 is your best bet.\n\n\n\nI hope this short discussion helps some people make the choice between calibers. In the end, of course, either caliber can satisfy most shooting needs.\n\n^ Link: [url]http://www.pyramydair.com/blog/2005/04/differences-between-177-22-and-which.html[/url]\n\n\nBeing a hunter and not punching much paper, I have, and always will prefer .22 over the .177 in small-bore airguns. The points are stated above.\n\nSome may argue that the .25cal delivers more energy for a cleaner kill of small sized game like rabbits, squirrel, etc, than the .22, but then the trajectory intervenes.. .22 has a relatively flat trajectory especially in the more powerful air rifles, and this is almost the same as the .177s trajectory. The .25 is a much heavier pellet and thus the pellet starts dropping after say half the distance as of a .22 or .177. We can conclude that it has a RAINBOW-LIKE trajectory and thus many will prefer the .22 over the .25 in this aspect.\n\n\nEdit: And folks, newer .177 airguns, specially Magnum Springers produce velocities over 1200fps. At this speed, the pellet will swirl on the way (as it crosses the sound barrier and thus moves around), resulting in poor accuracy.', ''),

(397893, ' interesting discussion but away from the facts:\r\nLet us stick to one simple point "any gun shouldn''t be priced above the cheapest priced guns in our market". This should be determined by looking into the prices of guns which land here without any extra bribes or passing through any kind of restrictions. Almost all shotguns, .22rifles and handguns made in Turkey, China, Brazil, Russia fall in this category. To my knowledge importes get 30% discounts on minimum recomended retail prices. So, a shotgun being retailed in US at 1700$ would cost an importer roughly 1100$ + Taxes + shipping. All Turkish handguns land here with a cost of 24K-32K everything inclusive.\r\nIf we do all the working we can easily find that our fairly priced guns are priced as (landed cost + 50% profit). As it seems that we would love to buy Caracal if it is priced as Turkish guns are. \r\nNow i would use brother Denovo''s calculated base landed cost Rs 56K and add an accepted market trend profit in it. Worked out fair price shouldn''t be more than 85K. \r\nI have voted for this price(85K) and would buy 1 if it is sold at this price.', ''),

It is based on Sig Platform i.e., a reliable one, accepted fact.\n\nBut one thing needs to be emphasized the metallargy of gun is NOT SAME I dont think it is even 50% of Original Sig. After all you are comparing a product "Made in China" to "Original Sig".\n\nEven then if Aquarius our senior & respected PG member and others are positive about it then my suggestion is AFTER Protective Measures ( even seriously use a helmet ) and give it a Torture Test of a 1000 Rounds/day for 7 days a week. Atleast fire more than 5000 rounds in a limited period of time and the pistol should be picked up randomly.\n\nIf it gets through the "Real Test" and not mere assumptions and also approved by Forum Seniors after the Torture Test then it is good to go. Otherwise atleast I am Paranoid about Kaboom and nothing else I also want a High Capacity 7.62X25 mm.\n\nRegards', ''),

Now we all know that Marks n Spencer would never compromise on quality. hence it can be said that Pakistan is making good quality products for them. so IMHO the place of origin doesnt matter if the thing produced is good. plus i never said that the gun is the 8th wonder of the world. but yes i can confidently say that its a good gun n with the passage of time, it wud become better. \n\nCheers![/QUOTE]\n\nBefore I comment on your latest reply I would like to go back to the previous comment made by you [B][I]well its simple economics. products produced at home are cheaper than those which are imported (in most of the cases). those having G3s and MP5s made in Pakistan by Wah industries (im talking about direct purchase from the factory) know very well how cheap they are as compared to the same guns produced by Germany[/I][/B].\n\nYou are confusing 2 complete different business models. Examples quoted by you are of licensing and manufacturing rights where intellectual property is transferred under a license agreement and a certain subsidy is paid to the parent company. HK MP5 and HK G3 are manufactured by POF industries under a license agreement where the technology and the minimum standards of raw materials used is determined by HK thus indirectly HK controls the quality of arms. The only thing different here is the cost of production visavis stringent labour laws in Germany''s case making it expensive to manufacture a gun in Germany therefore the cost of manufacturing a G3 or MP5 in Pakistan in cheaper. In Caracal''s case the technology, basic design, intellectual property is all UAE and is typically a new invention of Caracal arms.\n\nNow coming to your Marks and Spencer example..... Please do not confuse textile technology to arms.... Marks and Spencer only manufactures its shirts in PAKISTAN due to cheaper cost of production but the quality of raw materials, the fashion / design of stitching is handed over to our local factories by Marks and Spencer thus once again the basic idea behind clothes i.e the fashion and trendiness is determined by Marks and Spencer.\n\nYou buy Nike / Addidas / Reebok / Puma ? When you buy you only see the BAND / LOGO and not the fact that it is made in China or Indonesia because no matter where a Nike shoe is manufactured, the tick speaks for itself. In Caracal''s case even if the gun originated from UAE and was Made in China wouldn''t have mattered because the market standing / reputation / goodwill of Caracal itself is pre-mature....', '');

Examples quoted by you are of licensing and manufacturing rights where intellectual property is transferred under a license agreement and a certain subsidy is paid to the parent company. HK MP5 and HK G3 are manufactured by POF industries under a license agreement where the technology and the minimum standards of raw materials used is determined by HK thus indirectly HK controls the quality of arms. The only thing different here is the cost of production visavis stringent labour laws in Germany''s case making it expensive to manufacture a gun in Germany therefore the cost of manufacturing a G3 or MP5 in Pakistan in cheaper. In Caracal''s case the technology, basic design, intellectual property is all UAE and is typically a new invention of Caracal arms.\r\n\r\nNow coming to your Marks and Spencer example..... Please do not confuse textile technology to arms.... Marks and Spencer only manufactures its shirts in PAKISTAN due to cheaper cost of production but the quality of raw materials, the fashion / design of stitching is handed over to our local factories by Marks and Spencer thus once again the basic idea behind clothes i.e the fashion and trendiness is determined by Marks and Spencer.\r\n\r\nYou buy Nike / Addidas / Reebok / Puma ? When you buy you only see the BAND / LOGO and not the fact that it is made in China or Indonesia because no matter where a Nike shoe is manufactured, the tick speaks for itself.

(398129, ' Salams to all PG Bros! Had been away for the last three/ four days. Got back today and just saw this wonderful thread. IMHO Caracal is a nice addition to our market and it can easily penetrate and snatch its market share, only if it is very reasonably priced. Now what that reasonable price would be... in my humble opinion, anywhere between 50k to 65k.  If it hits the 70-80k bracket, for a potential buyer like me who is simply looking for a[B] [U]reliable handgun for SD purpose[/U][/B], CZ75B is the way to go. When I mean reliable, a recently made striker fired Caracal from UAE gets nowhere near a hammer fired 75B from &#268;eská zbrojovka, which enjoys decades of glorious heritage and experience. \r\nMoreover, just comparing it to Glock, SIG, Baretta, HK etc will never make it a competitor of these brands in Pakistan, even if we assume that its better than all these. These brands keep selling for +300k... but it would be much difficult for Caracal to find many buyers at the 100-110k range.', ''),

I did take afew pics of the Clone when I was in Pakistan and you''d be pleased to know just found them on my USB Memory Stick, However I do not have any pics of the Original one yet bcos I live in the UK and I got my cousin to buy that for me a few months ago while I was here so I have not seen it myself either, apart from seeing it on the Skype, lol. I did not get a chance to test fire the clone either due to a very busy schedule when I was in Pak, which was only for a short time. So the Clone still remains a virgin. BUT, I will be popping its cherry when I go Pakistan next time Inshallah, Along with a few other foreign babes (Handguns and Rifles) that have been purchased for me in my absence including the new Original CF by Norinco. And I will tell u what I''ll do for you guys... I will do a quick comparison bw the Clone and the Original. Even though the results is pretty obvious that the Original one is gonna be on top but we’ll see what the clone has to offer for it’s Price. I Bought it from a well-known dealer in Peshawar who were probably the first ones to set up their own CF98 (Clone) plant and gave me assurance that it shouldn’t let me down but I am yet to find that out myself when I take it for a ride on my next visit Inshallah. When my cousin went to get the Original CF for me a few months ago I told him to ask the dealer about the possibility of Part-Exchanging the Clone towards the price of the new Original one and he did. He rang me back and said that the dealer’s best Offer if I wish to part exchange my CF98 Clone towards the price of the new one is 10K, which means he’ll knock off 10K off the new price and I will end up getting the Original CF for 30K instead of 40K. It was the same dealer I had bought the Clone from and He knew the price we had paid him for the Clone  was higher than hiss offer and also knew the Clone was still brand new un-used in original packing, Not fired and almost same condition as it was when we bought it from him. But that’s a dealer for you. However after giving it a thorough thought I refused to Part-ex the clone towards the new Original one and decided to keep the Clone for rough use. I’ve kept the Clone because I''m just gonna rag it out. Abusing it is not gonna bother me at all due to the fact its a Clone and also due to its Price. Another reason for keeping it is off course the use of local Ammo which is something I’ll not be using with my Original one. As this is not my main hand gun so I intend to get lots and lots of local ammo and bhang the life out of it, it’s a cheaper way of having fun I guess. have already bought a box of 50 “Sher” brand 9mm rounds for Rs.800.

(398205, 'Why I was disappointed at the TOSS Show?? Dear Pakgunners,\r\n\r\nApart from the fact that I spotted that Pakguns shooting vest at the TOSS show, got to see some really nice local made knives & cutting blades, I was disappointed at the TOSS show as far as the "so called hunting & sporting guns" were concerned.\r\n\r\nWho arranged this Toss show?                     "The Pakistan Hunting & Sporting Arms Development Company"...\r\nWhat was the show called by PHSADC?        "The Premier Shooting & Hunting Sports Show"\r\n\r\nMy question to PHSADC is: Is an assault rifle really a hunting & sporting gun? Was there even a single 0.22 cal bolt action rifle displayed by any of the participants (to the best of my knowledge, there was none, as I spend 2 hours finding one). They should have been clear in the first place about what will be allowed to be displayed & what not.\r\n\r\nWhat our local industry needs to do is to focus on small/big caliber hunting / target shooting bolt action rifles alongwith improving quality of the 12Gague shotguns, and this is the prime weakness in our local arms industry. \r\n\r\nI was surprised to find some 12guage SxS Sidelock shotgun, being displayed by the most reputable armory in Pakistan, with price tag of 400k+ (export only model), and when I asked the reason for such a nice price tag, I was given the example of "Holland & Holland" that see how expensive they are....Well, this cannot justify this price tag. The only thing that can justify such prices is the quality and the art of workmanship put in by the gunsmith, and to my disappointment, when I asked the exhibitor to disassemble the shotgun, so that I could examine the barrel independently,  after struggling with it for around 5 minutes, he excused that the gun is brand new and seems like it needs some oiling... this was the mechanical quality which I saw, and about the quality of the bore, better not discuss it at all. I wonder if there is a proof house in our country?\r\n\r\nI have been using shotguns since last 15 years, and I have never put any oil in my shotgun except for the kerosene oil which I use for cleaning purposes. Yet the assembling & dissembling is as smooth as anything... And here, I am referring to a 50 years old, cheapest gun of its time "by Gecado, Germany" which I inherited from my grand father... This doesn''t even have any engraving in it....\r\n\r\nBy this post, I do not intend to finger point at any company in Pakistan, but want to give some serious points to ponder for PHSADC. We want to buy Pakistani hunting guns, we want to rely on their brand names for quality and performance, but how can we? Any new gun enthusiast hunter today will go out, get a license (its another story how to get it...), and >80% of the time will opt for an imported gun...\r\n\r\nThis is the age of global competition.

(398262, ' [QUOTE=Omkhan;236579]Good luck with that :)[/QUOTE]\n\n Thank Omkhan. Let me share you my personal experience. At sharah e faisal, entering to Tipu Sultan sultan road, from dunkin donuts, i was talking on my cell phone, with half of the window down, my sixth sense alarmed that a bike (with two persons) has started following me, since i was talking on phone so didn''t bother, when i tried to take left turn (towards KMCHS), they hit on right front fender, when car was dead slow, I stopped the car (that was my mistake), and asked them whether everything was alright, (while i was still in the car), the guy sitting on the back of bike suddenly grabbed my shirt and asked for the mobile / valet, the other person had the 636 (with hammer up). I said okay okay wait wait, day raha hoon, day raha hoon and i started looking for my mobile which i placed on dashboard near cig. lighter of car. While i was picking my phone, looking at their face, both of them had an eye contact with each other, that was the time i pulled out my gun. The guy sitting on back shouted, bhaag iss kay paas TT hai. They ran away, i rushed from there keeping gun in my hand afterwards i put that front seat, reached home, then i observed that there was a bullet in a chamber with hammer pulled up. I tried to remember when did i slide the rack, but wasnt able to remember, it must be done when i just pulled out my gun, though i dont remember.\n\nThe crux is, when you can use the gun, you will definitely slide the rack in the event of danger, naturally, like when we drive the car, we dont even remember when we change the gear from 1 to 2, 2 to 3 and onwards.\n\nMy dad (R.I.P) used to say, never pull out your weapon, unless you and your family are in a safe position. Just a display of gun will force the other to fire at you.', ''),

(398275, ' [QUOTE=armoured;236614]Dear Pakgunners,\r\n\r\nApart from the fact that I spotted that Pakguns shooting vest at the TOSS show, got to see some really nice local made knives & cutting blades, I was disappointed at the TOSS show as far as the "so called hunting & sporting guns" were concerned.\r\n\r\nWho arranged this Toss show?                     "The Pakistan Hunting & Sporting Arms Development Company"...\r\nWhat was the show called by PHSADC?        "The Premier Shooting & Hunting Sports Show"\r\n\r\nMy question to PHSADC is: Is an assault rifle really a hunting & sporting gun? Was there even a single 0.22 cal bolt action rifle displayed by any of the participants (to the best of my knowledge, there was none, as I spend 2 hours finding one). They should have been clear in the first place about what will be allowed to be displayed & what not.\r\n\r\nWhat our local industry needs to do is to focus on small/big caliber hunting / target shooting bolt action rifles alongwith improving quality of the 12Gague shotguns, and this is the prime weakness in our local arms industry. \r\n\r\nI was surprised to find some 12guage SxS Sidelock shotgun, being displayed by the most reputable armory in Pakistan, with price tag of 400k+ (export only model), and when I asked the reason for such a nice price tag, I was given the example of "Holland & Holland" that see how expensive they are....Well, this cannot justify this price tag. The only thing that can justify such prices is the quality and the art of workmanship put in by the gunsmith, and to my disappointment, when I asked the exhibitor to disassemble the shotgun, so that I could examine the barrel independently,  after struggling with it for around 5 minutes, he excused that the gun is brand new and seems like it needs some oiling... this was the mechanical quality which I saw, and about the quality of the bore, better not discuss it at all. I wonder if there is a proof house in our country?\r\n\r\nI have been using shotguns since last 15 years, and I have never put any oil in my shotgun except for the kerosene oil which I use for cleaning purposes. Yet the assembling & dissembling is as smooth as anything... And here, I am referring to a 50 years old, cheapest gun of its time "by Gecado, Germany" which I inherited from my grand father... This doesn''t even have any engraving in it....\r\n\r\nBy this post, I do not intend to finger point at any company in Pakistan, but want to give some serious points to ponder for PHSADC. We want to buy Pakistani hunting guns, we want to rely on their brand names for quality and performance, but how can we? Any new gun enthusiast hunter today will go out, get a license (its another story how to get it...), and >80% of the time will opt for an imported gun...\r\n\r\nThis is the age of global competition. I am in an engineering sales job and truly understand the consequences of a lesser graded product being hit by the competitors when out in the market...[/QUOTE]\r\n\r\n\r\nI like and respect about how honest you were about how you felt.I had been to the Toss show twice and had a good time.I agree that there was very little of "Hunting and sports" weapons with the exception of some very over priced guns.\r\nBut however this show gave some much needed exposure to our local gun industry.\r\nOurhandgun industry got alot of exposure that it needed for quite some time.Thats all all i can say the toss show was about,Giving exposure to the local gun manufacturers.I agree they didnt do a good job at showing there sporting weapons.', ''),

One of of the main reasons I wanted to get this Pump action shotgun is the fact its made in Turkey by the Akkar Company so the quality is kinda reliable second reason is it has a folding buttstock which helps in terms of "concealed carry" issue and also could be easily carried in the car even though the barrel size is same as the fixed butt (18.5 Inches I think). I''m not sure of its exact price but goodthing about Akkar pumps is they are not too expensive comparing to other foreign made shotguns I.e US and European ones. Budgette is not an issue but because this is [U]NOT[/U] going to be my main weapon and will be only kept as an Extra so therefore, I would prefer to keep the price as low as possible. preferabily around 40K or under. Do you have something else to suggest? [B][COLOR=#000080]Please help.\n\n\n[/COLOR][/B][/QUOTE]\nI think Escort P/A is much better. Its available in just 26 k', ''),

If the time span is greater between two shots your follow through or second shot will be tiny miny delayed.....\n\nThirdly, people who believe that 9mm or even .45cap will knock someone off their feet and they will go soaring away are still playing ring a ring a roses in lala land.\n\nNow lets talk ballistics: Long or short barrelled handguns will just impact on the distance in the sense that bullets fired out of long barrelled hand guns are more likely to travel long distances. Expansion to an extent will be impacted by the distance range between the shooter and the target. For example a JHP is fired to hit a target at 25m will not be as deadly as to when a taget is shot at 10m.\n\nThe weight of the bullet is of no major significance at shorter distances but at further distances heavier bullets will fall short. It is a battle between velocity vs. penetration. The flesh expansion between a 124gr and 115gr bullet is not a major difference as compared to a JHP. YOu''re being attacked by a pack of dogs then here velocity is the key.\n\n147 gr bullets and P and +P ammo is a sensitive topic as there are limited guns which are capable of firing these. The health of the firearm at the end of the day should also be kept into consideration. If the health of the gun is not an issue then lead tipped bullets are the way to go.', ''),

(398502, ' [B]Last chance for ministry to reply in arms licences case [/B]\nThe News Lahore\n\nThe Lahore High Court on Friday provided last opportunity to the interior ministry for filing its reply in connection with a petition challenging the ministry&#8217;s directions to licence holders to surrender their licences to Nadra for computerisation. \n\nJustice Farrukh Irfan Khan issued the order as a law officer sought more time to secure a reply from the ministry. The judge was hearing different petitions filed by arms license holders who challenged the Ministry of Interior directions ordering the license holders to surrender their licences to Nadra by Dec 31st. \n\nThe court on the previous hearing had barred the ministry from implementing the deadline. On behalf of the petitioners, Barrister Syed Ali Zafar submitted that the process for issuance of arms licences, ownership of firearms, their sale, purchase and exchange as well as the issuance of ammunition was regulated and prescribed by Pakistan Arms Ordinance, 1965 and Arms Rule 1924. He said the only method of amending these rules was through a gazette notification. \n\nHe argued that, instead of amending the rules after due consultation with all stakeholders, the government had instantly issued the impugned directions. Although the government had issued a notification delegating powers to make rules to Nadra, he said, adding that it was not a notification of the rules, terming it illegal because there was no power to sub-delegate. He said there was no harm in computerisation of the licences, and the entire process should be contained in duly notified rules which provided for all aspects, relating to possession, transport, sale and transfer of firearms. The court will resume the hearing on January 12.', ''),

The goal was for citizens to obtain computerized arm licences in August this year.\nThus far NADRA has received around 1,586 applications from 16 districts of Balochistan, Interior Minister Rehman Malik said in his written reply to the National Assembly.\nMaximum applications for revalidation process came from Punjab and Sindh.  Malik had assigned the task of revalidating all the licences by Dec 31. This is also a deadline for citizens to register their licences.\n“According to rough estimates around 3 million Pakistanis have arm licences.” said a retired Secretary of the Interior Ministry, who asked not to be named.  But officials dealing with arms licences claim that they don’t know the total number issued since Pakistan’s inception.\nThe government informed the Supreme Court that the Sindh government from 2001 to 2011 has handed out around 0.5 million arms licences to citizens.\nPakistan Muslim League-Nawaz  MNA Malik Shakeel Awan sought details of arm licences which are being verified by NADRA.\nThe government has spent Rs53 million on renovations of NADRA’s headquarters during the last five years, Rehman Malik told the National Assembly.\nAround Rs2 million were spent on renovation of the NADRA  chairman’s office in Islamabad, while an amount of Rs1.62 million was spent in 2011, he added.\nExpenditures of some Rs51 million were for repair and maintenance of NADRA headquarters from 2006 to 2011, while Rs14.2 million was spent during the current fiscal year.\nIn reply to a lawmaker’s question, Malik said NADRA issued 89.145 million Computerised National Identity Cards till December 14, 2011.\n“Around 94.89 per cent registration has been completed in the country. Orphan children will also be registered under the new policy,”he added.', ''),

(398562, ' Life of caracal,\nIn my opinion I think the long term the future of caracal will be nothing but a good pistol displayed in a shelf. Not to undermine caracal and its capabilities but the country in which its made in UAE. The following points needs to be considered,\n1-UAE has no proven history of making ARM or AMMUNATION of any kind. Like Europeans, TURKEY, CHINA, US etc. We have DARRA producing weapons since british raj they are still struggling(they will succeed if they focus on quality). \n2-Local arms manufacturing and Labor is not available, all expertise have to come from outside (from sweeper to Manager). Bringing labor from overseas will make the price of product higher and less competitive. \n3-No local technical University/schools that can produce local talent for technical engineering etc. No planning for future for technicians.\n So maybe in the future they will size the operation since it will not be feasible for further operation. This handgun has not produced the desired result in the US or European market due to its high price. Turkish shotguns have a big success since they are selling it half the price of American/European arms. This handgun can be success if they drop the price to about $250-300 in US, but can they still be profitable at this price?????? Maybe in the longrun.

(398706, ' Salam All,\r\nContrary to popular belief, the 1911 or .45 calibre, is NOT A CANON. :D The .45 might push a lttle more, but its nothing that can''t be handled. Whatever weapon you have, you have to PRACTICE, and there''s no way around that part. \r\n\r\nThe option in CZ would be the CZ97, which IMHO, is a better weapon to have than a 1911 in Pakistan. The reason for this is that a 1911 needs more love( and a few parts now and then :) ). The only reason for choosing a 1911 would be if it fits your hands better than a CZ97 due to your hand shape and size. But thats just my opinion, other''s may differ.\r\n\r\nPrice, I have no idea and you should ask in the want to buy, or market price thread.\r\n\r\nI couldn''t help myself so I replied :) as we are PRETTY off topic.', ''),

(398725, ' [QUOTE=Abbas;223922]I agree with and appreciate the suggestions both by Mehdi and KamranWali. Excellent points.\n\nI personally owned a couple of Pakistan made firearms and had a few built on order as well but low quality control is a big issue. You never know if your firearm is going to last 50 years or have it explode in your hand on the first day. \n\nI completely agree with Skeeter60 assessment that we need a proof house but the problem is that in Pakistan that is just another stamp for cottage gun makers to add to the firearm to make it look genuine. \n\n@Marker It is one of my dreams to have Pakistani manufacturer developing quality weapons here in Pakistan. Unfortunately the red tape, government interference and corruption is not worth it. Everyone can be making guns left right and center and no one will be asked a question, only the largest and properly setup, tax paying factory will get frequent visits from all kinds of ground level bureaucrats/officials like law enforcement, taxation, health and safety etc etc whose sole concern in life is just to make life miserable for the person doing business in a legal way.\n\nOn the same topic, I was seriously considering setting up a large, mechanized ammunition factory in Pakistan targeting the domestic market solving our problems of quality decently priced ammunition in all commercial calibers. But as I started to work on my project I found out that I had to go through about 20 + Government bodies and the ''costs'' for making them all work were just not economically viable. It would be cheaper to import ammo from China, Europe or Russia than to setup a unit for domestic production.[/QUOTE]\nVery good talk Abbas bhai....indeed corruption is the first and foremost enemy,defeat that and you have everything the way it should be including quality control in comercial firearms.....sorry to hear your troubles man....hope you are able to get the project online before long.....its good patriotic industrialists like you who are being hurt every day by the system....I really wish you luck and success and plus could ya throw in an assembly line for those .380s mk II rounds lols.....', ''),

I also saw an original Chinese Baretta at a gunshop in Peshawar the asking price 27K just over a year ago. Again a Chinese Import. So In my opinion despite it''s high and reliable quality, the price should still be alot lower as its a home production. Lower prices will also result in higher sales which means they will break even alot sooner than they will at the current price. The profit margin may be low but POF or "WIL" will make their money in terms of selling in a higher quantity, public demand may increase, as it''ll become affordable for average working class Pakistani citizens so for once they will get value for money, relaibaility and will no longer have to be restricted to buying the poor quality un-relaible Desi weapons from Darra or other private factories due to the limited budget.

As for pricing, once cannot compare the price of this weapon with foreign weapons (esp Chinese) as there is a thing call ''economy of scale'' which basically means that that if a factory is producing 10,000 units of a pistol and another is producing only 1,000 units of the same , the price of the units from the smaller factory would be higher. \nI think 33k is VERY reasonable. It seems like the toolings were obtained under license of some sort by POF.\nAs for the barrel. This is not a Darra made weapon. The barrel would meet and exceed army and international standards. We must remember that the same factory produces barrels for our machine guns, assault rifles and even for heavy weapons.  A very welcome addition to POF inventory and a great step forward towards complete self-reliance. I''d buy it just to support my country .', ''),

It seems like the toolings were obtained under license of some sort by POF.\r\nAs for the barrel. This is not a Darra made weapon. The barrel would meet and exceed army and international standards.

The problem is that I aimed at the center of the plate and shoot 5 slugs. The 3/5 went above the plate about 60 cm and the other hit the target but not the center, and the last that I aimed very low at the target the slug was accurate. I shoot 00 buckshot the same day at the target with succes with 32/36 inside the big plate but not center. And also I shoot birdshots number 5 at the same distance with great accuracy at the target and little wooden targets and birds with no problems. The slugs were shoot through a full choke and the weapon is 12/89 with 76 mm smothboar barrel.please help[/QUOTE]\r\n\r\nThe problems I see in your approach:\r\n\r\n1. do not shoot slugs out of a full choke: only use Cylinder choke or Improved Cylinder choke. some slugs can be fired through full choke but after firing they are so deformed that they do not offer any reasonable accuracy. therefore it is always recommended to use either Cylinder or Improved Cylinder choke.\r\n\r\n2. reduce the distance: the distance of 40 meters is very difficult for a "front bead only" shotgun. if you want to increase the distance, you must install slug sights. you need front sight along with rear sights for proper aiming at any distance larger than 25 meters with a shotgun.\r\n\r\n3. change the brand of slugs: different brand of slugs give different level of accuracy out of each shotgun.\r\n\r\nHope it helps.\r\n\r\nRegards.', ''),

(399198, 'Zigana T (Law Enforcement) vs CZ Sp-01 Shadow Dear All, I have been using my Taurus Pt-92 for target shooting in range (LRC). I have been using it for over one and half months now. Unfortunately I am not impressed by Taurus Pt-92 even though I had usually found very good reviews regarding this handgun and thus purchased it as my first handgun. Things I don''t like and am Unsatisfied regarding my Taurus Pt-92 are as follows:\n\n1) A little harder trigger pull in single action. I always find it difficult to manage. I don''t find it smooth as it should be. (I have fired around 350 rounds from my handgun yet).\n\n2) Poor grip. The beaver tail pinches the back of my hand after few rounds, and because my hand gets sweaty after a while, the grip becomes difficult to hold.\n\n3) I am not impressed by the poor finish quality of Taurus Pt-92.\n\nAfter handling and finring a few other guns at the range, I have selected two options for my next handgun purchase (in replacement of my Taurus Pt-92). Those two options are as follows:\n\nA - Zigana T (Law Enforcement)\n\nB - CZ Sp-01 Shadow\n\nBoth are priced around the same in Lahore market. I need suggestions from all of our senior members regarding both of above mentioned options.

If he wants one for hunting as well as target shooting, I''d suggest this airgun (Rainbow 35), but with a scope as it only comes with fixed sights, but gets very accurate with a scope.\nThe only other gun in the 10k range would be a Chinese B3-2 Underliver for 4500rs, but it''s a "Finger slicer" and crappy airgun so mark this out. \nIf he is not interested in shooting birds, may I suggest a Gamo Delta airgun, available in Lahore for 10-12k, but should be around 15k in Karachi.. Underpowered for hunting, but just fine for beginners,pretty accurate for a starter. If you get this, then you might not be interested in a scope because it has crisp fiber optic sights. \nSo it boils down to;\n. Either a Rainbow with a scope and mounts for around 10k. (Hunting+Plinking)\n. A Gamo Delta for 15k.

Then I would give you a suggestion bro which you will not regret hopefully in field. Try Full Cylinder and Imp Cyl combination with your chosen load #6. Otherwise Imp Cyl and Mod, if Cyl choke is not supplied with the gun. Cyl/Imp Cyl is the best combination with this load for partridge as almost all friends using this have had gr8 results with partrg. But my choice has always been Mod choke with #8 regular Shaheen load. I have also heard that this regular Shaheen #8 load which they claim is 31g or 32g is not even that much... it is abt 28 grams in actual. Is it true or a rumour?', '');

I hope for the best, since it''s indeed a very fine handgun and should ideally have the max magnitudes of end users as target group.[/FONT][/COLOR][COLOR=#323D4F][FONT=Lucida Grande]\n\nWith this, let me venture on to the pro''s and con''s of the Caracal C-Q.S, as they stand according to my own 1.st hand impressions:\n\n[SIZE=6][B][COLOR=#40FFFF]Pro''s:[/COLOR][/B] [/SIZE]\n\n[COLOR=#0080FF]1) Short trigger pre-travel, VERY crisp break, fast successive shots.\n\n2) Very low, almost non-existent muzzle flip, which itself would be positively accuracy-related. \n\n3) Dimensions very compact, whilst capacity high, as if compared to CZ-Rami 2075D, and dimensions compact whilst capacity almost at par with the CZ-PO7 Duty. [/COLOR][/FONT][/COLOR][B][COLOR=#ff0000][FONT=Lucida Grande]In fact, the slide  of the Carcacal C is well about 20mm''s shorter than the PO7 Duty''s, whilst still retaining the barrel length, almost [/FONT][/COLOR][/B][COLOR=#323D4F][FONT=Lucida Grande][COLOR=#0080FF][B]!\n[/B] \n[/COLOR][/FONT][/COLOR][COLOR=#ff0000][FONT=Lucida Grande][B]Capacity of 15 shots at par with G-19, profile 2mm slimmer, height 5mm shorter![/B]\n[/FONT][/COLOR][COLOR=#323D4F][FONT=Lucida Grande][COLOR=#0080FF]\n4) Light weight, as if compared to CZ-PO7 Duty, difference being some 100-150 grams, and a fair bit heavier than Glock-19, hence better recoil absorption than the Glock. Weight at par with CZ-Rami.\n\n5) Very easy field strip.[/COLOR]\n\n[COLOR=#0080FF]6) Excellent grips.\n\n7) Well placed loaded chamber indicator, though wish it could have been colored.\n[/COLOR]\n[SIZE=6][COLOR=#00FFFF]Cons:[/COLOR][/SIZE]\n\n[COLOR=#BF0000]1) Slide release lever small, actually just kind of a button, a bit hard to adjust to. Could have been longer, ideally.\n\n2) Q.S system is kind of "fixed sight", and offers no variation to the sighting efforts. The front sight kind of [I]disappears[/I] if angle of hold upped. This is a limitation to the range shooter, and only suitable for pure SD use, where it indeed is a fast set-up. [/COLOR]\n\n[B]Not wishing to sound any biased at all, but the con''s dept. just wouldn''t stretch any farther, at least not until this time of my use.\n\nWill update further if anything found.\n[/B]\n\n[COLOR=#0080FF]I''d seriously advise not to take the Q.S model if you intend range shooting over longer distances. It may be o.k for up to 15 mtrs perhaps, but not any beyond, if group size is the objective. The experienced shooter may be able to make up for the reduced sighting radius, to some extent, beyond SD range even, but as stated earlier, this is a fast sighting set-up for the SD use and quick target acquisition, hence best for SD distances.[/COLOR]\n\n\n[/FONT][/COLOR][COLOR=#ff0000][FONT=Lucida Grande][B]Sports/range shooters should rather opt for the Caracal F, or Caracal C traditional model[/B].\n[/FONT][/COLOR][COLOR=#323D4F][FONT=Lucida Grande]\n\nFound this interesting picture, on how skate-board tape could help in customizing polymer grips even, lol!

I reside in Peshawar though got a Urdu speak background. \n\n So far no luck regarding the Stoeger 3500, I was told that it is available with Punjab Arms in Lahore for 72k though they had very limited stock so they soon ran out of it, later was told by two Peshawar arms dealers that they can arrange it for me though after 10 days of wait both said that it isnt available and initially both gave the price of 55k (not a bad price).\n\n I will never ever say that Benelli, Browning etc. are the best guns, for me every gun is the best companion when it functions smoothly at the required time and situation. Yeh the Benelli`s inertia operated system is tempting option though I also know that recoil reducer is useless since I (most of us) would be using the standard Shaheen`s cartridges.Also I really dont want to go for the usual choices like Baikal, Hatsan etc. Also I got Stoeger Cougar 9mm pistol that I am happy with, so its also one of the reasons for going for the same brand. \n\n To be honest with you I am more a Double Barrel and Over n Under guy when it comes on shotguns, semi auto seems more like an excuse for not coming back empty handed from the hunt, have seen guys firing NON STOP to kill one bird, I avoided such guns for years though just want to get one for the heck of it and see such type is for me or not.

(399420, ' [B]All PG fellows[/B], seen this on Dawn site. Mods can shift to proper thread if needed.\r\n\r\n"ISLAMABAD: The interior ministry has endorsed a proposal seeking issuance of licences for prohibited and non prohibited bore arms on the recommendations of the members of parliament and provincial assemblies.\r\n\r\n[B]Under the proposal, 10 licences for prohibited bore arms and 20 for non-prohibited bore arms could be issued every month on the recommendations of each member of the Senate and National Assembly.\r\n\r\nSimilarly, five prohibited and 10 non-prohibited bore arms licences could be issued on the recommendations of each member of provincial assemblies.[/B]\r\n\r\n[I][B]This was said by Interior Minister Senator Rehman Malik at a briefing given to the National Assembly`s Standing Committee on Interior here on Monday. It means over 7,700 new licences could be issued for prohibited bore arms and over 15,800 for nonprohibited bore arms on the recommendations of around 1,100 lawmakers.[/B][/I]\r\n\r\nThe decision elicited a strong reaction from the committee members with Bushra Gohar of the Awami National Party saying that powerful arms mafia was using lawmakers to promote its interests and another member warning against issuing licences to the people with criminal record.\r\n\r\nMr Malik, however, downplayed the fear licensed weapons would be used in criminal activities, saying only un-licensed weapons were used in crimes. He said a number of lawmakers `genuinely` needed security.\r\n\r\n`Whether weapons are used as a status symbol or to feel protected, the fact is that they are in demand,` he said, adding that under the Constitution it was the responsibility of the state to provide security to citizens but it was not possible to make each area, street and house secure.\r\n\r\nThe minister said that after the 18th amendment work relating to issuance of arms licences had been devolved to provinces. The interior ministry has not issued any arms licence after June 30, 2011.\r\n\r\nHe said a revised arms licence policy hadbeen formulated which would be soon submitted to the prime minister for approval.\r\n\r\n[B]Mr Malik said Nadra had been assigned the task for revalidation and issuance of computerised arms licences, adding that by Jan 4, 2012 it had received 109,800 licences for revalidation. Another 2,400 cases for revalidation were pending owing to deficiency of required documents, he said.[/B]\r\n\r\nHe directed Nadra to introduce measures aimed at facilitating people.\r\n\r\nBanned groups` leaders \r\n\r\nOn the issue of unchecked movement of leaders of proscribed outfits raised by Minister of State for Human ResourceDevelopment Sheikh Waqas Akram, the interior minister said provincial governments would be asked to keep a check on activities of such elements.\r\n\r\nSheikh Waqas said the leader of a banned outfit came from Karachi to Punjab and hurled threats on him.\r\n\r\nHe said the leader of another proscribed organisation was seen freely moving in Islamabad`s red zone with masked armed men in two double-cabin vehicles escorting him.\r\n\r\nMr Malik said a scam of transferring illicit weapons to Karachi through oil tankers had been unearthed, adding that a large cache of arms had been seized and some arrests made."', ''),

I reside in Peshawar though got a Urdu speak background. \n\n So far no luck regarding the Stoeger 3500, I was told that it is available with Punjab Arms in Lahore for 72k though they had very limited stock so they soon ran out of it, later was told by two Peshawar arms dealers that they can arrange it for me though after 10 days of wait both said that it isnt available and initially both gave the price of 55k (not a bad price).\n\n I will never ever say that Benelli, Browning etc. are the best guns, for me every gun is the best companion when it functions smoothly at the required time and situation. Yeh the Benelli`s inertia operated system is tempting option though I also know that recoil reducer is useless since I (most of us) would be using the standard Shaheen`s cartridges.Also I really dont want to go for the usual choices like Baikal, Hatsan etc. Also I got Stoeger Cougar 9mm pistol that I am happy with, so its also one of the reasons for going for the same brand. \n\n To be honest with you I am more a Double Barrel and Over n Under guy when it comes on shotguns, semi auto seems more like an excuse for not coming back empty handed from the hunt, have seen guys firing NON STOP to kill one bird, I avoided such guns for years though just want to get one for the heck of it and see such type is for me or not.

It is suggested that find a falconer (who hunts with falcons) or austringer (who hunts with hawks) in your area so that he can guide you properly and if possible acquire a manned bird and before that you have to arrange the equipments according to the bird.\n\nFollowing are the equipments you should always have:[LIST=1]\n[*]Glove  [URL]http://www.themodernapprentice.com/glove.htm[/URL]\n[*]Hood   [URL]http://www.themodernapprentice.com/hoods.htm[/URL]\n[*]Swivel  [URL]http://www.themodernapprentice.com/swivel.htm[/URL]\n[*]Jesses  [URL]http://www.themodernapprentice.com/jesses.htm[/URL]\n[*]Leash   [URL]http://www.themodernapprentice.com/leash.htm[/URL]\n[*]Perch (according to your bird type and area).

How would i know that I am a new gunner or experienced enough to handle a .45 monster. If it is related to the number of bullets fired, weapon handling and safety then i do have some experience. But what will be the criteria you define?\n2. Solid Katta? why would you use this term for 1911?\n3. What is price range of CZ product line in similar category. I though is more or less the same like Taurus..\n\nAlso I would be grateful if you can give me an idea of price of 1911. And hope you will clear my confusions.[/QUOTE]\n\nLets take Taurus 1911 as an example:\n\n1) .45 cap is a difficult weapon to handle in terms of recoil and you need to have perfect gripping and recoil control to be accurate. Plus the ammo capacity in a 1911 is around 8 rounds as compared to a 15 round in a 9mm thus you have fewer chances to ht and miss a target with a .45\n\n2) I sometimes like to use the desi slang for a handgun, Katta, lolzz\n\n3) CZ Shadow 9mm is around 30k expensive than a Taurus 1911, just because CZ is a class of its own. Taurus 1911 is around 100k in Karachi. I do not know the price range of .45 cap CZ line of products though\n\n4) It is an expensive callibre to practice with as an average .45 cap round is around 95 rupees as compared to 42 rupees for chinese 9mm.\n\n5) .45 is a more potent round with higher stopping power than a 9mm', ''),

(399733, 'Remington SPR 310 ejectors not ejecting! Hello,\nI''ve fired the first 50 rounds through my new Remington SPR 310 and have a question about the ejectors.   After firing the two shells and opening the barrel for reload, the ejectors didn''t throw the spent shells from the barrel. \n\nI believe I have the set screws positioned to enable the ejectors.   That is, the slots in the screws are turned vertical (running parallel with the barrels).  I''m following the graphic in the photos.  Note that I have tried the other setting just to see if that worked.   They appear to work about the same, regardless of the setting.\n\nThe manual is a little confusing about this because it is contradictory regarding the setting of the screws for the ejectors.   It says to turn the screw slot vertical but running perpendicular to the barrels! :dizzy:  However, the photos show the screw slot running parallel to the barrel and is more consistent with the vertical explanation.\n\n So, finally onto my question, are the ejectors something that improves over time with more break-in, or is there something I can fix to get better performance from the shell ejectors?\n\nThanks for the help.   Otherwise, I love my Remington/Baikal!', ''),

As it can be loaded in a second and fired in inadvertently by a  bystander.\n\nRULES  FOR DISPLAYING GUNS IN A ROOM/ RANGE\n\n1.Never bring in LOADED GUNS\n\n2.Always unload magazines as well\n\n3. Always REMOVE MAGAZINE , LOCK SLIDE BACK IN OPEN POSITION by RAISING SLIDE LOCK  and only then PASS the GUN.\n     ALWAYS EXPECT THE GUN TO BE PASSED TO YOU IN THIS CONDITION.\n\n4. Always RETURN the gun in the same position.\n\n5. Revolvers should be passed with the cylinder empty and opened out to the side.\n\n6. A RIFLE should be passed with THE BOLT OPEN and Magazine CLEAR.\n\n7. An Auto SHOTGUN should be passed with the Slide LOCKED BACK with empty Magazine \n      Clear /empty.\n8. A double should be passed with the action open \n\nKindly follow these rules and insist others follow these. Passing a gun in other ways is not only bad manners but a dangerous practice which can result in LOSS of LIFE which CAN BE YOUR OWN.\n\nI am prompted to write these lines as a very narrow situation was avoided recently,\na very experienced and knowledgeable friend excitedly brought  4 or 5  boxed handguns in his drawing room,\nas he opened one of  the boxes and offered me to see the pistol, 2 magazines were visible in the box and I assumed the pistol was  without a magazine, I picked up the gun and as per my instinct racked the slide, and loaded the chamber with a round as the pistol had a third loaded magazine inserted in it.\nAll this happened while we were all  excitedly discussing guns and paying little attention as we all thought boxed pistols brought in for display were not loaded. \nThank  Almighty Allah I again racked the slide and a live round popped out, I promptly removed magazine and unloaded the gun.\nWe were five  people in the room with an eight year old child. Although a shot was not fired but I was so guilty conscious for assuming there could  not be a third magazine, and not first removing magazine before racking the slide, and mixed feelings of annoyance for the friend offering loaded boxed guns without a single word of warning even.\n A  COMPLETE RECIPE FOR SUICIDE.\n \nI lost my appetite, was shocked and my Blood pressure remained dangerously high for the next two days with feelings of guilt, shame and annoyance. \nNo shot was fired but with my more than 55 years  experience with guns and having seen accidents I am aware how close we came to one.\n I am  still not out of shock and guilt as I visualize the chubby smiling  son of the  host running around the room excitedly.', ''),

(399807, ' Excellent thread, Sir. Firearm safety is something we all must follow fanatically, not just on the range but at home as well. One must not only only know the safety rules verbatim, but should also adhere to them down to the letter.\n\nThe gun safety rules are meant to save your life and of those around you. These rules aren''t just applicable at the range, but are meant to follow you wherever you go, irrespective whether you''re carrying a firearm or are in the vicinity of one. It''s very easy, unfortunately, for us to occasionally forget/overlook these rules in our excitement or (on some occasions) complacency.\n\nBeing relatively new to firearms, I myself have been guilty of complacency on a few early instances. I just thank God that nobody was hurt during those moments of personal idiocy! But now I strive to be better prepared and be more responsible, and constantly remind myself that there''s absolutely no excuse in the world for a lax attitude towards firearms.\n\nSir, I can completely & understandably empathize with what you''re feeling, and am very happy & relieved to hear that nobody got hurt.

This experience has changed my perception fully and rightly by respected Skeeter Sahib, that a loaded handgun is any handgun with a loaded magazine in it, irrespective of chambered/un-chambered status.\n\nWe actually were outdone by 2 specific things:\n\n[B]1) Skeeter Sahib''s perception/[COLOR=#ff0000][I]expectation[/I][/COLOR] of a [COLOR=#ff0000][I]traditional [/I][/COLOR]box, consisting of a handgun and [I][COLOR=#ff0000]2[/COLOR] mags[/I]. \n[/B]\n[B]2) My [COLOR=#ff0000][I]pre-occupation[/I][/COLOR] as host dealing with 2 more respectable gents, a servant, and also the chap running around. [/B](He couldn''t resists meeting a uniformed officer, though I had kept him away from the room from the start)\n\nHence before I even got a chance to say anything on the mag, Skeeter Sahib - with the traditional gunner''s play eagerness/ fervor - was already racking the slide!\n\nI heard the slide being racked and instantly alerted Skeeter Sahib, so did one of the respected gents I think, and Skeeter Sahib racked the slide again to get the round and magazine out, yet the same gun in the hands of any trigger-happy person could turn out the atmosphere quite differently.\n\nI am sure had Skeeter Sahib and I been alone, engaged with ourselves only, there would have been both time and occasion to ask and tell, yet, it''s important to note, that a mishap always has it''s own prelude.\n\n[COLOR=#0000cd]Let me say, nothing happened, but this is for [/COLOR][COLOR=#ff0000]strict practical adherence[/COLOR][COLOR=#0000cd] and [I]informational purposes[/I] mainly[/COLOR]:\n\n[COLOR=#ff0000][I]1) Be careful when presenting your weapons to anyone, racking the slide is a fractional part of a full second. Always present as mentioned by Skeeter Sir in above post.[/I][/COLOR]\n\nAs irony would have it, the sitting above was between 2 of those persons, Skeeter Sahib specifically, and myself, whom most of you would regard as the senior members here. Hence, if Skeeter Sahib forgot to check out/observe an inserted 3rd magazine, watching 2 empty in the box, and I lost the opportunity to alert on it due to circumstantial conditions, rest assured, this can happen literally, [I]anywhere[/I]! Be careful!\n\n[COLOR=#ff0000][B]We believe practical experience is the best to impart teaching.[/B][/COLOR]\n\nFinally let me thank Skeeter Sahib for an occasion to see him at personal levels and for honoring me greatly with his visit here, indeed I''m indebted to his kindness.\n\nI am attaching a picture of the highly trivial meet, wish there could have been more time, you simply can''t have enough of Skeeter Sahib''s knowledgeable company.

What so ever the glove should be according to bird :) LOL, like if luckily you got Goldie you can’t handle it on motor cycle gloves you should need triple layer leather glove which also covers your elbow.\n\nBelow you can read type of gloves and their usage:\n\nSingle layer glove: Shikra (male& female), Sparrow hawk (male& female), Red-headed Merlin (male& female), Shaheen & Peregrine males only.\nDouble layer glove:  Shaheen (female), Peregrine (female), Saker (male& female), Goshawk (male& female).   \nTriple layer glove:  Any kind of eagles.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n2) You don’t need a verity of hoods but you can purchase 2-3 hoods in different styles but same size for your bird for the best fit, because sometimes we have to alter the openings for its beak and cere. (You can also ask SUFI for a falconer in KHI, he can guide you).\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n3) It also depends on bird: there are only 3 sizes available in market.\n\nSmall size: Shikra (male& female), Sparrow hawk (male& female) & Red-headed Merlin (male& female).\nMedium size:  Shaheen (male& female), Peregrine (male& female), Saker (male& female) & Goshawk (male& female).   \nLarge size:  Any kind of eagles.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n4) Traditional leather jesses are best if made properly and works well in emergency cases when you don’t have nylon one’s because you can’t get all sizes. And you can get Arab jesses and leash set with swivel from the same manufacturer. But sizes are available for only Shaheen (male& female), Peregrine (male& female), Saker (male& female) & Goshawk (male& female).\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n5) As I have told you earlier you can get an Arab nylon leash with jesses and swivel but no doubt you can also choose or make of your choice (light in weight and strong) depending on bird’s strength. :)\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n6, 7) Perches are very important for the prevention of their talons and you can’t keep a raptor in a cage :shocked:. Yes you can keep them in bedroom hooded or unhooded if they are properly manned but they need sunlight on daily basis in winter especially, so you should also give them a weathering area (lawn). But in summer birds shed their feathers and grow new ones (Moult) and during moulting season you can’t keep them in bedroom & you need a good aviary or a separate room which has good ventilation and sunlight.  For 1 bird like Saker, Shaheen or Goshawk, Size of mew should be 10’ Length X 8’ Depth X 8’ Height is best. \n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nIt’s your choice if you like falcons than go for a male lugger and if hawk than you should start from a shikra. And rite time to practice is September or October because in these months the weather is good.\n\nI tried my best but still your questions are welcome.\n\nRegards,', ''),

(399906, ' Nice sharing , thanks[QUOTE=Rizshu;84235][B]Leather Treatment for a Pistol Holster[/B]\n\nLeather holsters should hold the firearm in a firm position, but not too firm for a difficult removal of the pistol. The leather must be kept properly maintained for optimum performance of the holster. Neat foot oils or mink oils should be avoided as these products can make the leather holster too supple. The soft leather may have a difficult time holding onto the pistol. \n\n\n[B]Leather Break In[/B]\n\nRemove all ammunition from the firearm before fitting the pistol into the holster for the first time. Breaking in the holster may be necessary if the pistol fits too tight within the leather. While holding the holster in your left hand, insert two fingers of the right hand into the opening. Beginning two inches down from the top rim, push outward with the right-hand fingers to stretch out the leather. Continue this process until you have worked all around the perimeter of the leather holster and as far down into the holster as possible. Insert the unloaded pistol into the holster and check the fit. Repeat the process as many times as necessary for a correct fit of the pistol to the leather. \n\n\n[B]Cleaning[/B]\n\nOccasionally the leather holster will need cleaning. In times where the holster is in contact with body perspiration, cleaning may have to occur on a monthly basis. Remove the firearm from the holster and any straps or belts attached to the holster. Use a hard bar glycerin soap and a soft cloth. Work the soap into a soft lather onto the cloth with warm water. Rub the soapy cloth against the leather. Work the lather into any deep crevices and stitching. Perspiration can over time affect and weaken the stitching. There are special leather soap lotions available that can be worked directly into the leather. Allow the leather to air dry. Do not apply any type of artificial heat to the leather. Replace the firearm as soon as the holster is fully dry. \n\n[B]Things Not to Do[/B]\n\nKeep the holster out of any submerged liquids. When this condition occurs remove the firearm immediately and dry the leather with a clean cloth. Allow the holster to dry naturally. Do not place the holster in direct sunlight such as the dashboard of a vehicle. The sun can crack and prematurely dry out the leather. The use of Neat foot oils or mink oils will soften the leather to a point of loosening the grip onto the firearm. These types of oil applications are discouraged.[/QUOTE]', ''),

(399919, ' [QUOTE=Falco;238265]Your questions are welcome bro.\n\nYes, that is why I referred that website. :) But still we have different ways here.\n\n1)  Any kind of leather glove can work, if the color is permanent and doesn&#8217;t leave its color on the meat. What so ever the glove should be according to bird :) LOL, like if luckily you got Goldie you can&#8217;t handle it on motor cycle gloves you should need triple layer leather glove which also covers your elbow.\n\nBelow you can read type of gloves and their usage:\n\nSingle layer glove: Shikra (male& female), Sparrow hawk (male& female), Red-headed Merlin (male& female), Shaheen & Peregrine males only.\nDouble layer glove:  Shaheen (female), Peregrine (female), Saker (male& female), Goshawk (male& female).   \nTriple layer glove:  Any kind of eagles.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n2) You don&#8217;t need a verity of hoods but you can purchase 2-3 hoods in different styles but same size for your bird for the best fit, because sometimes we have to alter the openings for its beak and cere. (You can also ask SUFI for a falconer in KHI, he can guide you).\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n3) It also depends on bird: there are only 3 sizes available in market.\n\nSmall size: Shikra (male& female), Sparrow hawk (male& female) & Red-headed Merlin (male& female).\nMedium size:  Shaheen (male& female), Peregrine (male& female), Saker (male& female) & Goshawk (male& female).   \nLarge size:  Any kind of eagles.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n4) Traditional leather jesses are best if made properly and works well in emergency cases when you don&#8217;t have nylon one&#8217;s because you can&#8217;t get all sizes. And you can get Arab jesses and leash set with swivel from the same manufacturer. But sizes are available for only Shaheen (male& female), Peregrine (male& female), Saker (male& female) & Goshawk (male& female).\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n5) As I have told you earlier you can get an Arab nylon leash with jesses and swivel but no doubt you can also choose or make of your choice (light in weight and strong) depending on bird&#8217;s strength. :)\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n6, 7) Perches are very important for the prevention of their talons and you can&#8217;t keep a raptor in a cage :shocked:. Yes you can keep them in bedroom hooded or unhooded if they are properly manned but they need sunlight on daily basis in winter especially, so you should also give them a weathering area (lawn). But in summer birds shed their feathers and grow new ones (Moult) and during moulting season you can&#8217;t keep them in bedroom & you need a good aviary or a separate room which has good ventilation and sunlight.  For 1 bird like Saker, Shaheen or Goshawk, Size of mew should be 10&#8217; Length X 8&#8217; Depth X 8&#8217; Height is best. \n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nIt&#8217;s your choice if you like falcons than go for a male lugger and if hawk than you should start from a shikra. And rite time to practice is September or October because in these months the weather is good.\n\nI tried my best but still your questions are welcome.\n\nRegards,[/QUOTE]\n\n\nThanks sir for such an out-class reply!! :)\n\nahahha!!

(400046, ' I respect all the nice opinions and recommendations about Taurus Pt-92, but personally I am not satisfied with it. When I had to buy my first gun, I also did a lot of research here on PG and on google as well. I am a research freak :-) I chose Taurus Pt-92 as my first handgun based on reviews, will full confidence that it will be my life time partner, but unfornately the reality was a bit different. \n\nI have mentioned the points which I don''t like about Taurus Pt-92 another thread, which mainly are poor grip, hard and unsmooth trigger in single action (compared to many other guns), and lower finish quality which I guess is a personal preference only. (by the way, I have had 3 FTE with my Taurus Pt-92 yet. I have fired around 350 + rounds till now).\n\nNow in my view, the best way to choose your first handgun is to physically hold and possibly fire a few rounds with them, and see with whom you are most comfortable with. Comfort lies in grip, acquision of point of aim, recoil management, etc. This is best way to choose your first handgun. (You can rule out those guns which have got a bad repute e.g. Taurus 809, but it is very important to physically hold and possibly fire the models you like and are generally considered reliable).\n\nIn range, I shot with CZ Sp-01 TS, CZ Sp-01 Shadow, Glock 19, Zigana T (Law Enforcement), Sig P 226 Tactical Ops. I have liked CZ Sp-01 Shadow and Zigana T the most probably and I will choose CZ Sp-01 Shadow as my next handgun. It will suit my needs ofcourse. \n\nI therefore suggest you to atleast hold the guns which you plan to buy and check how much you are comfortable with them. I have not fired CZ Duty, but I have held it and it feels very good in hands. In my opinion it will be much better option than Taurus Pt-92.', ''),

There''s no match with respect to accuracy of these two, Stoeger being sub 4" barrel and rotating barrel system.

(400261, 'Shooting Sports FUN in Kuwait Many of you may know that I have moved to Kuwait with the family and have not been very active on the forum lately (as I use to be :P ). Since I moved to Kuwait the Shooting itch was there but I was in the process of settling in. After the initial settling in I went to Kuwait Shooting Range for couple of times for the fun shoot. Couple of weeks ago I was at the shooting range and a Range Officer was observing my shots, when I finished my round he approached me and told me that could be a potential member of their Practical Shooting Team.\r\n\r\nThe guy approached me was the President of FAST (Filipino Action Shooting Team) Mr. Manny Cornelio and he introduced the FAST to me and I gladly accepted the offer to joined the team. I became the member next day and started my First Practical Shooting on 20th December 2011. FAST organizes the Practical Shooting Event every Tuesday, this provides a great opportunity to the members to have hands on practical shooting by creating different scenarios.\r\n\r\nDue to the busy schedule I went there the 2nd time on last Tuesday 10th January 2012 and had great fun in the practical shooting. As this was my 2nd time to compete in the Practical shooting, my main aim was to focus on the precision rather than to be quick in finishing the round. In the draws for the line up this Tuesday my name came the first to start the event. I will leave rest of the details of the event to the article of the Arab Times online edition, the link is attached below. The Arab Times covers the event and publish the details every Thursday. Check out the link and you can find out how I performed in the event (my performance mentioned in the last paragraph of the first column). Remember this was my second time in practical shooting). :)\r\n\r\n[url]http://www.arabtimesonline.com/Portals/0/PDF_Files/pdf12/jan/12/50.pdf[/url]\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\n\r\nGlockcohlic (Malik Javed)', ''),

While CZ 999 had best trigger in single action among the three...My recommendation was Baikal 446 Viking, however is inclined towards CZ999 as its more beautiful and considered very accurate.

I am still very much inclined towards 3500model though it isnt available and I am really hoping that I will getsome good reliable lead about this. 2000 model considered to be agood product and 3500 came with all the modifications while removing(as much as possible) the flaws that they were discovered in 2000.Thats why I am so keen about getting that baby. \n\n\nBy the way I will like to add my ownpersonal quote here in reply of your quote of “Huntingis a Royal Sport” - for me “Hunting is the passionate way ofexpression for those who believes on fighting back with honor andintegrity” (I know it sounds too dramatic hahahahaha)\n\n\nYes its true thatnow the prices of weapons and ammo are shooting up and up, a littlewhile back I tried working on an idea of starting my own smallmanufacturing unit for 12 bore cartridges (only and only 12 bore)though the government people were too kind to scare me off  big timeabout the legalities and big bribes required for all the paper workso never bothered again though I do believe that we can easily cutdown the cost of cartridges into half (at least) if we are having agood market competition that we dont. Shaheen is more a mediocrebrand, Ely is with a SLIGHT touch of class and after that its all themoney game.\n\n\nYou know what Ithink I will try one more time to find the 3500, if I got lucky thenawesome and if not then I will wait, I am not settling down forBaikal or 2000. I know I can get any other gun in particular pricerange though it will be more a compromise then a choice.\n\n\nTomorrow one moretime :)\n\n\nThanks.', ''),

Justice Farrukh Irfan Khan also directed the government to tell the court whether they were willing to consult the stakeholders and adjourned the hearing till January 27.\n\nEarlier, Barrister Ali Zafar argued on behalf of petitioners and said the arms licences were issued in the form of a booklet which contained pages covering all the aspects. However, the notification for computerization of these licences had been challenged on the ground that the federal government must consult the stakeholders and then make rules providing for all the aspects, which should thereafter be notified in the Official Gazette. He said the petitioners were not against the computerization but the process of computerization should be clearly prescribed.\n\nThe counsel further argued the rules had to be made by the federation but they illegally authorized Nadra to formulate the rules, which was not an entity envisaged under the Arms Rule 1924.\n\nArms licences holders filed these petitions challenging the advertisement and notification issued by the federal government in which all arms and ammunition licences were to be cancelled and new computerized licences issued by Nadra.', ''),

The CZ 75 is a wondernine and one of the best handguns ever made. The problem that needs to be understood is that instead other quality items bringing down the prices of Glocks or Berettas, the prices of these items are taking the prices of other items higher. An example is that the CZ Rami was originally 85 k but they are priced around 110 k now. This is only because of the positive reviews that CZ got when they reached here.\r\n\r\nThis is a dilemma.

I have tried turning the screw 90 degrees to horizontal.   But I will do so again and give it some time.

The documentary Cars 1 and 2 proves this )\n\n,we kept a small part of our water breathing apparatus( not the physical part, the hardwired nature to breathe water( do fishes drink water ???)). Every once in a while it declares " OMG I''m suffocating " and spasms like its 1986.

(401026, ' @ american lockpicker\n\nfollowing is the english version i found:\n\nIn 1973 the war between Arabs and Israel was about to start. Meanwhile an American Senator visited Israel on a special mission. He was chief of the Senate Arms Committee. A meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Golda Meir was arranged immediately. \n\nGolda Meir welcomed him into her home, like any common housewife welcoming a family guest. She took him to the kitchen. While seating him at the kitchen dining table, she went over to prepare tea for the guest. \n\nAs the water was kept for boiling, she came over and sat on a chair near the dining table. She opened the discussion regarding planes, missiles, and guns. In the course of negotiations, she got the aroma of the brew. \n\nShe prepared two cups of tea, and offered one cup to the Senator, and another to an American guard who was standing at the gate. On returning, she came back, continued talking with the Senator. After a discussion they settled the arms deal. In the meantime, she stood up, collected all the cups, and turned to senator and said "I agree to this deal. You can send your secretary to my secretary for written deal". \n\nIt may be remembered that Israel at that time was facing a serious economic crisis, but the huge arms deal was settled by Meir with the greatest of ease in the history of Israel. It was quite astonishing that earlier, the Israeli cabinet had rejected the same deal, because they thought it would be so costly, that the whole nation would have to make do with a single meal a day, for years to come. \n\nMeir knew about their stand, and said, "Your doubt are well founded, but if we win this war, and defeat the Arabs, history will remember us as the victors, and in history, once a community is know as the victor, it forgets how many eggs they ate and how many times they had food. Whether there was jam, honey, butter on the table, and how many holes they had in their shoes. Or whether the sheaths of their swords were new or old! A conqueror is a conqueror." \n\nBased on Meir''s solid logic, the Israeli cabinet approved the deal. Later it was proved that the decision taken by Meir was right, and the whole world witnessed the Jews knocking on the doors of the Arabs with this artillery. A war took place, and the Arabs faced a shameful defeat at the hands of an old lady. \n\nAfter a gap of one decade after the war, a reporter of the Washington Post interviewed Meir, asking "Was the logic you had in your mind for the arms was spur of the moment decision or you had had an advance strategy?" \n\nMeir''s reply was very surprising. \n\nShe answered, "I got this logic from the prophet (of the Muslims) Mohammed (peace be upon him). When I was a student, my favorite topic was comparative study of religions. Those days I studied the life of Mohammed (PBUH). One author stated that when Prophet Mohammed (PBUH) died, there was not enough money to buy oil for a lamp, his wife (Ayesha Siddiqua[Raziallah-u-ta''ala unha]) mortgaged his battle shield to buy oil, yet there were nine swords hung on the wall of his house. \n\nWhen I read this account, it occurred to me- how many people in the world would have known about the worst economic condition of Islamic state? But everyone recognizes them as conquerors of half the world. So I decided that I would buy arms at any cost; even if we would have to starve or to live in camps instead of buildings, but we would prove ourselves as the victor". \n\nMeir revealed this secret, but requested the interviewer to keep it "off the record", and refrain from publishing it, because if she referred to Prophet Mohammed(P.B.U.H), the Jews would have revolted against her and the Muslim position would have strengthened. \n\nOver the time, world situation changed. Golda Meir died. By this time the interviewer had given up the profession of journalism. Meanwhile another correspondent was busy interviewing 20 famous American journalists. In connection with this, he met the journalist who had interviewed Meir as a representative of the Washington Post. \n\nIn this interview, he recounted the story of Meir that drew on the life of Prophet Mohammed (PBUH). \n\nHe said he was not ashamed to tell the story. Further, he said, "After this incident I studied the history of Islam, and was astonished to know about the savoir-faire of Arabs. Because I learnt that Tariq bin Ziyad conquered Spain through Gibraltar, while more than half his army did not have complete suit of clothes. They subsisted for 72 hours at time on water and dried bread. \n\nIt was then that the interviewer agreed with Meir''s view that history counts victory; it does not count the eggs, jams and butter on the table."', ''),

I was at an arms shop the guy brought it to sell the gun but the dealer refused to pay right away and told the guy to keep it in amanat, however i approached the guy outside the shop and asked him his demand. The guy demanded 20K, i checked the gun and liked it pretty much i thought of offering him so low that he won''t sell it to me hence i offered him 12K and to my surprise he right away agreed and i bought it. the gun''s front sight needed a replacement so i replaced it with an irani sight. but still i am suffering to achieve any  accuracy with the gun. so any help or assistance with the sights would be great and besides is there and benchmark of power testing on through which i can be sure if it is powerful or not.\r\n\r\nBest Regards', ''),

I showed it to my wife, we discussed and decided to visit this beautiful phenomena of Mother Nature, ice covering everything like a blanket, moreover I wished that I would meet Mehdi and for that very reason I haven’t yet replied to his thread (Pics of Muree) I was drafting a detail talk with him so that I could meet him upon my trip to Muree some time soon.  Denovo bro  as you said your as well as mine wish will remain un-granted and I pray that  “He certainly found  better friend than you,  better company than ours and more beautiful ambiance than any where found in this world” (Ameen).  \r\n@ Asad Raja I would only say that you are lucky man that you have had a wonderful father and had a chance to spend time with him. In my case I hadn’t granted enough time. I only have flashing memories of him, being posted out station he had a chance to meet us only on weekends and he passed away when I was in Grade 5. One more thing I would like to share with you is : when my mother got severe CVA attack and she was in comma (later she survived), I thought what possible in this very world could take away that great sense of sorrow, sense of losing some one near and dear to you and the sense of being left alone. Believe you me that I found it for the time being whenever I offered Prayer, since then never feel left alone.  All the best wishes for you and sincere prayers for the dear departed.

(401123, ' [QUOTE=Slayerjatt;239421]@ american lockpicker\n\nfollowing is the english version i found:\n\nIn 1973 the war between Arabs and Israel was about to start. Meanwhile an American Senator visited Israel on a special mission. He was chief of the Senate Arms Committee. A meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Golda Meir was arranged immediately. \n\nGolda Meir welcomed him into her home, like any common housewife welcoming a family guest. She took him to the kitchen. While seating him at the kitchen dining table, she went over to prepare tea for the guest. \n\nAs the water was kept for boiling, she came over and sat on a chair near the dining table. She opened the discussion regarding planes, missiles, and guns. In the course of negotiations, she got the aroma of the brew. \n\nShe prepared two cups of tea, and offered one cup to the Senator, and another to an American guard who was standing at the gate. On returning, she came back, continued talking with the Senator. After a discussion they settled the arms deal. In the meantime, she stood up, collected all the cups, and turned to senator and said "I agree to this deal. You can send your secretary to my secretary for written deal". \n\nIt may be remembered that Israel at that time was facing a serious economic crisis, but the huge arms deal was settled by Meir with the greatest of ease in the history of Israel. It was quite astonishing that earlier, the Israeli cabinet had rejected the same deal, because they thought it would be so costly, that the whole nation would have to make do with a single meal a day, for years to come. \n\nMeir knew about their stand, and said, "Your doubt are well founded, but if we win this war, and defeat the Arabs, history will remember us as the victors, and in history, once a community is know as the victor, it forgets how many eggs they ate and how many times they had food. Whether there was jam, honey, butter on the table, and how many holes they had in their shoes. Or whether the sheaths of their swords were new or old! A conqueror is a conqueror." \n\nBased on Meir''s solid logic, the Israeli cabinet approved the deal. Later it was proved that the decision taken by Meir was right, and the whole world witnessed the Jews knocking on the doors of the Arabs with this artillery. A war took place, and the Arabs faced a shameful defeat at the hands of an old lady. \n\nAfter a gap of one decade after the war, a reporter of the Washington Post interviewed Meir, asking "Was the logic you had in your mind for the arms was spur of the moment decision or you had had an advance strategy?" \n\nMeir''s reply was very surprising. \n\nShe answered, "I got this logic from the prophet (of the Muslims) Mohammed (peace be upon him). When I was a student, my favorite topic was comparative study of religions. Those days I studied the life of Mohammed (PBUH). One author stated that when Prophet Mohammed (PBUH) died, there was not enough money to buy oil for a lamp, his wife (Ayesha Siddiqua[Raziallah-u-ta''ala unha]) mortgaged his battle shield to buy oil, yet there were nine swords hung on the wall of his house. \n\nWhen I read this account, it occurred to me- how many people in the world would have known about the worst economic condition of Islamic state? But everyone recognizes them as conquerors of half the world. So I decided that I would buy arms at any cost; even if we would have to starve or to live in camps instead of buildings, but we would prove ourselves as the victor". \n\nMeir revealed this secret, but requested the interviewer to keep it "off the record", and refrain from publishing it, because if she referred to Prophet Mohammed(P.B.U.H), the Jews would have revolted against her and the Muslim position would have strengthened. \n\nOver the time, world situation changed. Golda Meir died. By this time the interviewer had given up the profession of journalism. Meanwhile another correspondent was busy interviewing 20 famous American journalists. In connection with this, he met the journalist who had interviewed Meir as a representative of the Washington Post. \n\nIn this interview, he recounted the story of Meir that drew on the life of Prophet Mohammed (PBUH). \n\nHe said he was not ashamed to tell the story. Further, he said, "After this incident I studied the history of Islam, and was astonished to know about the savoir-faire of Arabs. Because I learnt that Tariq bin Ziyad conquered Spain through Gibraltar, while more than half his army did not have complete suit of clothes. They subsisted for 72 hours at time on water and dried bread. \n\nIt was then that the interviewer agreed with Meir''s view that history counts victory; it does not count the eggs, jams and butter on the table."[/QUOTE]\n\nwow!! and thanks for translating gin English :)', ''),

I.e, I ain''t got a single No.4 shell in my house of 12G ammo, every pack is some sort of BG medicine buck shots, and was kind of [I]reprimanded[/I] by the better half on this lately, as to what the heck my weapons were good for, if I couldn''t take her out for some fun hunting, lol!\n\nSame goes for the pick of 124 grainers, since I deem 115 grainers are best suited for range/target shooting, the 124''s a bit better for the SD use.\n\nNext pick will be 115. Was feeling good at this consignment, only till I dumped the boxes into my special air-tight metallic can, which somehow wanted 1150 more, way to go, lolz!\n\n\nRegards.', ''),

The difference between 115 and 124 is hardly 0.5 gram, one being 7.5, other being 8.o grams.\n\nThe 115 grained gives a higher muzzle velocity than the 124 grained and hence for serious target shooting may be stabilizing it''s cruise comparatively a bit better than the 124 grained, thus comparatively with bit better accuracy also, but not what would be significantly better than the 124 grained with respect to self defense purposes, where a slightly heavier round may be preferred for the better [I]impact poundage[/I].\n\nI am not much into ballistics, else than the general facts above, perhaps an expert here would be better able to conclude.

I showed it to my wife, we discussed and decided to visit this beautiful phenomena of Mother Nature, ice covering everything like a blanket, moreover I wished that I would meet Mehdi and for that very reason I haven’t yet replied to his thread (Pics of Muree) I was drafting a detail talk with him so that I could meet him upon my trip to Muree some time soon.  Denovo bro  as you said your as well as mine wish will remain un-granted and I pray that  “He certainly found  better friend than you,  better company than ours and more beautiful ambiance than any where found in this world” (Ameen).  \n@ Asad Raja I would only say that you are lucky man that you have had a wonderful father and had a chance to spend time with him. In my case I hadn’t granted enough time. I only have flashing memories of him, being posted out station he had a chance to meet us only on weekends and he passed away when I was in Grade 5. One more thing I would like to share with you is : when my mother got severe CVA attack and she was in comma (later she survived), I thought what possible in this very world could take away that great sense of sorrow, sense of losing some one near and dear to you and the sense of being left alone.

Their population bomb explodes rapidly, and they are thousands in number. Many years/decades back, they used to come and shit on the balcony all the time, and dirtied all clothed left there for drying. Many dead ones would be fallen down, and they''d eat /steal any edible or small thing placed there. Don''t know of the situation now.\r\nThe reason for their overpopulation is that they are fed ''Baajra'' grains in city centers by residents of the area and authorities.. Their excretion is contains harmful substances, and when they poop in bodies of water, they pose a threat to human health. There is also a major population of ticks on the birds. \r\n\r\nIs there a similar problem in your area?\r\n\r\nPlease share your experiences, and (if) how you solved the problem.', ''),

I have got a few questions, and I request all members to guide me.\n\n1) I want to buy it in black Fiber Stock, as I don''t like the wood shape. I have found it with two dealers, one has 26" barrel and is offering five chokes (I Don''t know how this is possible because as per all reviews I have seen, Baikal MP153 comes with three chokes), and the second option is 28" barrel with three chokes. Please guide me which one I should choose and with pros and cons.\n\n2) I have read problems in 2011 model here on PG. Should it be safe to buy 2011 year model, or should I stick to 2010 or before models. (Its almost impossible to find models before 2010 in NIB condition).\n\n3) Can anyone guide me of some range or other place where I can practice with my shotgun...I am member of LRC but they don''t allow shotguns.\n\n4) And finally can Baikal MP153 be used as Home Defence weapon?? I know its meant for hunting but what if it is used for HD as well? \n\n5) Please suggest me some other handguns which I should be looking at.
