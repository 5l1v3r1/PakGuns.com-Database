Get copied this approval letter (3 copies for safe side), License   Copy, CNIC Copy (2 numbers), and most important get National Bank   challan from the person sitting below the tree outside the Sind   Secretariat (Named Shah Ji, a beared person) who will charge Rs 10 for a   photocopy challan.

Get Complete license copy (if not already done) including recently   signed/stamped page, CNIC copy, paid challan copy and go again in the  same room  (opposite to Mr Peer Bux) and give them these photocopies. \nThey will record your license entry in a register and allot you a number in stamped area.\n\nNOW YOU ARE DONE:)', 1, 0, '113.203.187.250', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

It depends on individual''s body dimensions. Pick up the gun while closing eyes, shoulder it as if aiming at some moving object, align the gun, then open eyes. Repeat this several times to see a common pattern. The gun''s rib and bead will tell you whether the dimensions are suited for you or not. If slight rib is showing, then it is good for rising flushing game such as some gamebirds and trap. I like to have a very slight rib showing for all shooting in general - game and clays. Other thing is whether the bead is centered after opening eyes. If it is not, then cast is needed to be altered. All AL391''s are factory supplied with some cast off (for right handed shooters). The spacer marking DX will show cast off, while spacer''s marking SX corresponds to cast on. Regarding length of pull, try 14", 14.25" and 14.5" ... 3 lengths of pull. The middle one suits most shooters. That of crs as you know can be changed by using stock pads of varying thicknesses. Gel Tek pad for example gives a longer LOP (length of pull) and the other accessory (plastic butt plate) gives a shorter LOP.\r\n\r\nTry to determine your favorite and optimum LOP/DAH/DAC/Cast measurements (e.g. my fav gun dimensions are 14.25"/2.4"/1.5"/0.25"), and use or alter them for almost all your shotguns as close to your optimum as possible (without harming the firearm).

Preferably, bring at least two guns. Bring all of your friends who have guns. \n&#8226;Anything worth shooting is worth shooting twice. Ammo is cheap. Life is expensive. \n&#8226;Only hits count. A close miss is still a miss. \n&#8226;If your shooting stance is good, you''re probably not moving fast enough nor using cover correctly. \n&#8226;Move away from your attacker. Distance is your friend.\n&#8226;In ten years nobody will remember the details of caliber, stance, or tactics. \n&#8226;They will only remember who lived. \n&#8226;If you are not shooting, you should be communic- ating, reloading, and running. \n&#8226;Accuracy is relative: most combat shooting standards will be more dependent on "pucker factor" than the inherent accuracy of the gun. \n&#8226;Use a gun that works EVERY TIME. \n&#8226;Someday someone may kill you with your own gun, but they should have to beat you to death with it because it is empty. \n&#8226;Always cheat = always win. The only unfair fight is the one you lose. \n&#8226;Have a plan. \n&#8226;Have a back-up plan, because the first one won''t work. \n&#8226;Use cover and concealment as much as possible. \n&#8226;Flank your adversary when possible. Protect yours. \n&#8226;Don''t drop your guard. \n&#8226;Always tactically reload and threat scan 360 degrees. \n&#8226;Watch their hands. Hands kill. (In God we trust. Everyone else, keep your hands where I can see them). \n&#8226;Decide to be AGGRESSIVE enough, QUICKLY enough. \n&#8226;The faster you finish the fight, the less shot up you will get. \n&#8226;Be polite. Be professional.

[/B]\n\nCan''t say of Peshawar still, Ameer bro, lets see.\n \nMy personal piece was requested from Karachi and brought to Pindi under license, hence " [I]almost to my doorsteps[/I]" as I wrote in my initial review, deeming that I literally  would have had to take a 40kms drive only, and not one of 1500 kms! Couldn''t be closer to my "doorsteps", kind of.\n\nSince I wanted to have a feel of the "F" model, before picking the C-QS from Pindi, I had to visit Lahore, coz the importers told me that they sadly did not have the F model in Pindi.\n\nThis was a self-inflicted "by-pass", since after checking out the F in Lahore, I still favored the C over it, which I could easily have taken locally over here. My stay got prolonged in Lahore for another day and a night and the Pindi gentleman finally moved to Lahore to hand me over the gun there and do the necessary paper formalities also.\n\nThis mess restricted me seeing close friends, who by the way, were busy firing off 1100 pops with another one, lolz!

In 1893, Spain adopted a new model Mauser in this same caliber. This rifle has been called the Spanish Mauser ever since, although it was also adopted by Mexico and a number of South American countries. Remington chambered their rolling block and Lee rifles for the 7mm about 1897, and later the Model 30. The Winchester Model 54 and 70 also chambered it. Currently, the Ruger Model 77 and Winchester Featherweight bolt action, plus the Ruger Number One single shot offer the 7mm as standard among American-made rifles. However, most British-and European-made bolt-action rifles and combination guns chamber the 7mm Mauser, as do many custom-made rifles each year.\r\n\r\n    Although originally a military cartridge, the 7x57mm Mauser has proven itself as one of the best all-around sporting rounds ever developed. It is particularly useful in lightweight rifles because it delivers good killing power with moderate recoil. It has been used successfully on every species of big game on earth, including elephant. However, it is no elephant cartridge in the true sense of the term and its success is due largely to the hunting conditions and ability of the hunters who have used it. Ballistically, it is only less powerful than 270 Winchester or the 280 Remington. It is adequate for most American big game, but is perhaps on the light side for Kodiak bear or moose unless used by an experienced hunter. The 7mm Mauser was discontinued in American-made rifles about 1940 due to lack of popularity. Since the end of WWII, it has become increasingly common due to the influx of surplus 7mm military rifles for several years after the war. The wide selection 7mm bullets now available for handloading has also contributed to an increase in popularity.', 1, 0, '113.203.187.49', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),
(243340, 7000, 224223, 'masood357', 4098, '', 1327944015, '270 Winchester\r\n\r\n    Designed by Winchester for their Model 54 bolt-action rifle and first marketed in 1925, the 270 caused quite a stir in shooting circles. It has remained somewhat controversial ever since. At that time, it offered better long-range potential than any big game cartridge generally available on the American market. It has now been adopted by practically every manufacturer of standard bolt-action high-powered sporting rifles in the world. The Remington slide actions and Remington and Browning semi-autos are also available in 270-caliber. The cartridge is based on the 30-06 case necked-down. It was a long time favorite of well-known gun writer the late Jack O''Connor, who probably contributed more popularizing the 270 than any other individual.\r\n\r\n    Along with the 30-06, this is one of the most accurate and effective all-round American big game cartridges. Its reputation and popularity have increased at a steady rate since its introduction. Although not intended as a varmint cartridge, the 270 will serve very well in that capacity when loaded with 100 grains. It is generally conceded to be a better long-range varmint cartridge than its parent, the 30-06. The original 130-grain bullet at over 3100 fps muzzle velocity is considered adequate by many experienced for any North American big game. When first introduced, some deer hunters complained that this bullet had such an explosive effect it ruined too much meat. To satisfy the "need" for a deer load, Winchester brought out a 150-grain bullet at the reduced velocity of 2675 fps. However, it was short-lived because the people who demanded it wouldn''t buy it. The present 150-grain bullet at 2900 fps is intended more for maximum penetration on such heavier animals as elk, moose or the big bears. Some disagree, but current evidence forces the conclusion that the 270 is adequate for any North American big game and many African plains animals as well. Assuming the hunter uses the proper bullet weight and type for the job at hand, the 270 will deliver reliable performance. In any comparison of the 270 with the 30-06, much depends on intended use and hunting conditions. For some reason, probably less recoil, many individuals shoot better with the 270 than the 30-06. The 270 is flatter shooting than the 30-06, and thus makes a better varmint/big game rifle where this is a consideration. The 30-06, with its 180, 200 and 220 grain bullets, is conceded a better woods, brush or heavy game caliber. In accuracy and general killing power, there isn''t a great deal to argue about.

Most other manufacturers have since added it to their lines. It took an American manufacturer nearly 40 years to realize that the 275 Holland & Holland (made long ago by Western Cartridge Co.) is a first-rate, medium-game, long-range caliber. The long line of 7mm wildcats and the 7x61S&H are much like the old 275 H&H, which came out in 192-1913.\r\n    Remington chose to ignore the classic 7mm bullet, a 160-grain spitzer, in its 7mm Magnum loads. For some inexplicable reason, too, Remington handicapped the 150-grain by using a rather round-nosed bullet.\r\n\r\n    The 7mm Remington Magnum is fine, long-range, gir game cartridge that could also be adapted to varmint hunting. There ia a good selection of 7mm bullets available and the handloader could make it do for just about anything. It has ample power for any North American big game and probably most thin-skinned African varieties. However, it would be an open-country, plains or mountain cartridge rather than a woods or brush number. Many will compare it with the 7mm WM or the 7x61mm Sharpe & Hart. Bitter arguments will ensue as to which is the best or most powerful. This will be akin to the ancient Greek pastime of discussing how many spirits can dance on the head of a pin. In other words, any difference in these cartridges will be strictly a matter of opinion or imagination. They all have about the same case capacity and none will do any thing the others can''t duplicate. In fact, the 7mm Remington is hardly a new or brilliant design because it is largely a commercial version of several of the wildcat short-belted 7mm magnums (Auckley, Luft, Mashburn, etc.).

(243349, 8142, 0, 'Survivalist', 2250, 'The 5.7x28mm &quot;Cop Killer&quot; Cartridge Myth', 1327945015, '[url]http://www.chuckhawks.com/5-7x28_cop_killer.htm[/url]\r\nBy Barr H. Soltis with Chuck Hawks\r\n\r\nI receive a significant number of "Officer Safety" alerts generated by a wide variety of local, state and federal law enforcement agencies. One alert that regularly rears its ugly head focuses on the alleged "cop killer" 5.7x28mm round fired by the Five-seveN pistol manufactured by Fabrique Nationale de Herstal (FNH) of Belgium. Given my innate curiosity, I decided to research this super duper cop-killing round and try to put it into perspective.\r\n\r\nThis is a .224 caliber rimless, bottlenecked, boxer primed, centerfire cartridge designed for use in semi-automatic arms. (Primarily pistols and sub-machineguns.) The cartridge overall length is 1.594 inches and it can be loaded to a maximum pressure of 50,040 psi.\r\n\r\nPublished reports indicate that as factory loaded the 5.7x28mm drives a 32 grain bullet, load #SS190-AP (armor piercing), at a muzzle velocity (MV) of 2350 fps with 390 ft. lbs. of muzzle energy (ME). The 28 grain spitzer bullet, load #SS195LF-JHP, has a muzzle velocity of 2350 fps and muzzle energy of 290 ft. lbs. The 40 grain Hornady V-Max bullet, load #SS197SR, claims a muzzle velocity of 1950 fps with 340 ft. lbs. of muzzle energy. Readers old enough to remember the obsolete .22 Remington Jet small game and varmint cartridge of 1960--40 grain bullet at about 2000 fps from a S&W Model 53 revolver--will be startled to hear that the slightly less powerful 5.7x28mm is a "cop-killer" round.\r\n\r\nIt is important to remember that the 5.7x28mm velocity and energy figures were derived from a 10.35 inch (sub-machinegun length) test barrel and that the Five-seveN pistol barrel actually measures 4.82 inches in length. Realistically, we can anticipate a substantial velocity loss of about 20% when the 5.7x28mm cartridge is fired from a pistol. This would mean an actual MV of approximately 1560 fps and ME of 216 ft. lbs. for the 5.7x28mm 40 grain bullet when fired from a handgun. Because it starts a heavier bullet at lower velocity, which maximizes energy and minimizes velocity loss, this should be the most effective load for a 5.7x28mm pistol.\r\n\r\nA comparison of the performance of the .22 Winchester Magnum Rimfire (WMR), introduced in 1959, and the 5.7x28mm is interesting. The .22 WMR shares the same bullet diameter (.224") as the 5.7x28mm cartridge and their muzzle and energy figures are actually rather similar.\r\n\r\nWinchester''s Supreme .22 WMR loaded with a 34 grain jacketed hollow point bullet has a muzzle velocity of 2120 fps and muzzle energy of 339 ft. lbs. from a (presumably 24") rifle barrel and a muzzle velocity of 1690 fps with 216 ft. lbs. of muzzle energy from a 6.5" pistol barrel. (That is just a hair over the 20% velocity loss that we postulated for the 5.7x28mm.)\r\n\r\nWinchester''s Super-X .22 WMR 40 grain jacketed hollow point (JHP) and full metal jacket (FMJ) bullets--Winchester offers both--have a MV of 1910 fps with ME of 324 ft. lbs. from a rifle barrel. Fired from a 6.5" pistol barrel the same loads register 1480 fps MV and 195 ft. lbs. ME. Note that rifle ballistics of this load are nearly identical to the 40 grain 5.7x28mm factory load as fired from a sub-machinegun length barrel and from a pistol barrel the 5.7x28mm is only a puny 21 ft. lbs. of kinetic energy ahead of the .22 WMR. I have never heard that semi-automatic .22 WMR squirrel and jackrabbit rifles were considered a particular threat to police, nor have I ever heard the .22 WMR described as a "cop killer" handgun round. Actually, the .22 WMR is considered a "mouse gun" caliber by most handgun authorities.\r\n\r\nAnother interesting comparison is with the 9x19mm (9mm Luger) cartridge. The 9x19 is the official NATO pistol and sub-machinegun cartridge and is widely used by police as well as by at least some real life criminals. Using Winchester published ballistics for comparison, we find that the popular Super-X 115 grain Silvertip JHP load has a MV of 1225 fps and ME of 383 ft. lbs. from a 4" pistol barrel. The U.S. military load for the 9x19mm drives a 124 grain bullet at a MV of 1299 fps and ME of 465 ft. lbs. from the Beretta M9 service pistol.\r\n\r\nThese numbers indicate that the common 9x19mm is a considerably more powerful cartridge than the 5.7x28mm when fired from pistol length barrels. This will surprise no one familiar with firearms or who has a passing familiarity with external ballistics. In reality, because the 9x19 fires a heavier bullet with far greater cross-sectional area, it will create a much larger wound cavity and prove far deadlier than this simple comparison of "paper" ballistics would indicate.\r\n\r\nThe 5.7x28mm caused quite a stir a few years back with the assertion that its AP load could penetrate at least some Kevlar helmets and body armor. (So, of course, will most other AP rifle and handgun rounds.) This may or may not be true, but the fact is that sales of armor piercing ammo are restricted to law enforcement and the military. This alone makes the 5.7x28mm cop killing round nothing more than an urban legend, leaving the practical use of the 5.7x28mm for target shooting, plinking and short range varmint hunting, much like the .22 WMR.\r\n\r\nFrankly, I know of few individuals who would be willing to spend more than $900.00 for the FN Five-seveN pistol and then shell out more than $20 for a 50 round box of ammunition. (.22 WMR ammo commonly sells for $7-$8 for a 50 round box.) I imagine that the Five-seveN probably also fails to spark much interest with criminals, as these pistols are rare and thus almost impossible to acquire except from legitimate, FFL dealers. Typically, the criminal element usually relies on the availability of larger (9x19mm, for instance), more effective calibers that can be easily acquired in the stolen gun market.\r\n\r\nThis leaves us with the obvious conclusion that the 5.7x28mm cartridge has little advantage over the .22 WMR in terms of killing power and serious disadvantages in terms of the price and availability of both firearms and ammunition. Without doubt, being shot with either can have deadly results, but there are much greater threats and more important things with which to be concerned. The top "man stopping" handgun cartridge remains the .357 Magnum, and it has been around since 1934.', 1, 1, '119.154.71.67', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

Initially it was chambered in the Remington Model 740 autoloader, later in the 760 slide action and the 721 and 725 bolt actions. The 700 series bolt-action rifles by Remington originally included the 280 chambering. From 1979 to 1980, Remington cataloged the 280 as the "7mm Express Remington," but too much confusion resulted and they went back to the original 280 moniker. Most European manufacturers have added to their bolt-action rifle line. The 280 Remington, actually a 7mm with a bullet diameter of .284-inch, is based on the 30-06 case necked-down, and is very similar to the 7mm-06 which has been around for a good many years. In 1979, Remington introduced a new 150-grain loading.\r\n\r\n    This is a 30-06 class cartridge of slightly more power than the 270 Winchester, at any rate, it can be loaded to greater power if fired from a bolt action rifle. If used in the autoloader or the slide action, pressures must be kept below 50,000 psi. Factory ammunition is loaded to about 47,000 psi. It would be stretching a point to say that the 280 is better than the 270 Winchester, although it is probably a little more versatile due to the variety of factory bullets available. The 280 is certainly adequate for any North American big game and would also lend itself for use on varmints and the lesser varieties. It is another case of a good wildcat cartridge finally emerging in a commercial version. It has picked up a modest following among 7mm fans since its introduction. The new 150-grain bullet at 2970 fps brings out some of the latent potential of the 7mm/280, which is truly an excellent long-range big game cartridge. \r\n\r\n7mm-08 Remington\r\n\r\n    Remington introduced this medium capacity rifle round to the marketplace in 1980. It is based on the unmodified 308 Winchester case necked-down to 7mm and loaded with a 140-grain bullet at 2860 fps. Remington advertised this cartridge as the "......first modern 7mm round designed for use in short-action rifles." This is rather interesting claim in view of the fact that the 284 Winchester designed for the same purpose, arrived on the scene in 1963. Furhter more the 7mm-08 is a direct copy of the 7mm/308 wildcat that dates back to at least 1958, probably earlier. This is not meant to denigrate what is a very fine cartridge, but rather to demionstrate that there really isn''t much new under the sun despite advertising claims.\r\n    Original rifles chambered for the 7mm-08 were the Remington Model 788 and 700BDL Varmint Special bolt-actions. Current Remignton catalogs list 700 series and Model Seven bolt actions as available in this chambering. Other makers are begining to chamber it; among the early starters were Savage and Alpha. Silhouette shooters of all types also use the 7mm-08 Remington.\r\n    Remington has certainly hung their hat on 7mm caliber and with considerable success. They now offer five chamberings: 7mm-08, 7x57mm Mauser, 7mm Express (280 Remington), 7mm Remington Magnum and 7mm BR for the XP-100 silhouette pistol. However, the 7mm BR originated as something of a semi-wildcat based on the 308x1.5-inch necked-down. Remington has contributed more than any other company to the belated recognition ot the ballistic advantages of the 7mm caliber by U.S. shooters.\r\n\r\n    The 7mm-08 140-grain load surpasses the 308 Winchester 150-grain load downrange, according to Remington tests from a 24-inch barrel. Based on Remington ballistic data, this appears to be true, particularly at around 500 yards. At that range, the 7mm bullet has an edge of 238 fps and 750 fpe over the 308 bullet. This would make at least some difference in potential killing power and also help in better bullet placement at unknown distances. This is not sufficient difference to cause owners of 308-caliber rifles to rush down and trade them off for 7mm-08s, but it does illustrate the ballistic advantages of the smaller caliber.\r\n    The 7mm-08 is a great favorite with many metallic silhouette shooters, and many glowing reports have been heard regarding its accuracy on the range, particularly with handloads. It is also building a good reputation as a long-range deer and antelope cartridge. When handloaded with heavier bullets than the factry 140-grain, it would alo be suitable for heavier game such as elk. Unfortunately, the two factory bullet weights do not make for a very flexible big game cartridge unless one is willing to handload. On the other hand. by handloading, this cartridge can be adapted to anything from varmint shooting through elk and becomes quite versatile.\r\n    The case capacity of the 7mm-08 is slightly less than the 7x57mm Mauser and performance with the heavier bullets of around 175-grains is about 100 to 150 fps less, which is not anything to get real excited about. The fact of the matter is that the 7mm-08 is adequate for most North American hunting, but is handicapped by only two commercial bullet loadings. Possibly Remington did not visualize the 7mm-08 as a hunting cartridge, but as primarily a target and silhouette round, so they stayed with the lighter-weight 120- and 140-grain bullets. \r\n\r\n7x61mm Sharpe & Hart Super\r\n\r\n    The 7x61mm was developed in the United States by Phillip B. Sharpe and Richard F. Hart. Its design was originally based on a rimless, experimental French 7mm semi-auto military cartridge. It was copyrighted and made available on a commercial basis in the Schultz & Larsen rifle in 1953. Ammunition was loaded and inported by Norma, and the final version was a belted case. Loaded ammunition offering a 154-grain bullet, as opposed to the original 160-grain.\r\n\r\n    The 7x61mm Sharpe & Hart (now listed as the S&H Super) is very similar to the 275 H&H Magnum, a belted case chambered and loaded in England. It is in the short 7mm magnum class and its performance is the same as a number of other cartridges, mostly wildcat, based on the blown out and shortened 300 H&H Magnum brass case. However, the Sharpe & Hart case has a slightly larger rim and base diameter but its popularity in the U.S. was quite limited by competition from the 7mm Weatherby Magnum, the 7mm Remington Magnum and various wildcat developments. The 7mm S&H is, nonetheless, a very fine fine cartridge for any North American game and most African plains game. Although Norma no longer loads ammunition, brass cases for handloading will probably be available for a number of years. The fact that Norma once again loading ammunition will be good news for those who have rifles of this caliber. \r\n\r\n7mm Weatherby Magnum\r\n\r\n    The 7mm Weatherby Magnum was developed in 1944 as one of a series of cartridges based on the necked-down and altered 300 H&H case. There are several similar wildcat versions, but Weatherby''s design is the most popular due to the availability of commercial ammunition.\r\n\r\n    The 7mm (or 284-caliber) has long been popular in the U.S. in various wildcat cartridges, yet the original 7mm Mauser never created any great enthusiasm, the result, possibly, of the poor (and underloaded) factory ammunition selection. The 7mm Weatherby Magnum, offered as a maximum performance cartridge to satisfy the demand to the 284 enthusiasts, is probably the best known widely used 7mm Magnums. This is due to the availability of factory-loaded ammunition with a good selection of bullet weights, and in part to the very fine Weatherby rifles. The 7mm has a slight edge over the 270 Weatherby on tough or dangerous game because it uses somewhat heavier bullets and churn up greater energy. However, if long-range varmint shooting is on the agenda, the 270 is better choice. The 7mm WM is adequate for any North American big game and all thin-skinned African game. The 7mm WM has, to a large extent, lost popularity to the 7mm Remington Magnum because the Remington version is available in many rifles less expensive than the Weatherby Mark V. \r\n\r\n284 Winchester\r\n\r\n    The 284 was introduced by Winchester in 1963 for their Model 88 lever-action and Model 100 semi-auto rifles, both of which have been discontinued, This is the first American commercial cartridge to have a rebated or undercut rim of smaller diameter than the body of the case, though British and European designers used this type of case years ago. For a short time, the Savage Model 99 lever action was available in 284. Some small outfits like Ultra-light often chamber the 284, and so does Browning.\r\n\r\n    The 284 Winchester has the rim diameter of the 30-06 group, but the body diameter, nearly, of the belted magnums. This provides increased case capacity in a relatively short case. The cartridge is designed for medium-length actions and will increase the performance of these short, light rifles. Ballistics are practically identical to the 280 Remington and there would be no difference in killing power, range or capability between the two. (Except in some gun writer''s imagination!) The 284 Winchester should be a good long-range cartridge for any North American big game under ideal conditions. It could also be adapted for varmint shooting. Some 270 or 7mm fans have always wanted a cartridge of this type for lever-action rifles and the 284 should have filled the bill. Unfortunately, not enough people bought Model 88 or 99 rifles. \r\n\r\n280 Remington (7mm Express Remington)\r\n\r\n    The 280 Remington was introduced by that company in 1957. Initially it was chambered in the Remington Model 740 autoloader, later in the 760 slide action and the 721 and 725 bolt actions. The 700 series bolt-action rifles by Remington originally included the 280 chambering.

Some (v slight) rib showing during aim is always good....\r\nBut for trap shooting, many shooters use an even lesser DAH/DAC (i.e. raised comb) like for example 50 DX (1.96 inches DAH) to compensate for fast rising/angling target from 15 yds away from shooter. \r\n\r\nThus these semi-autos have different Heel and Comb options.

A molot Vipr is an absolute dream and miles ahead of Saiga-12. its made by the molot factory and commands great respect in the quality of their firearms. some say, Baikal is more civilian market oriented whereas molot is more hardcore combat oriented. saiga 12 is built on AK47 platform whereas molot is built on light-machinegun version of RPK platform. that means, thicker and heavier receiver and barrels.\r\n\r\nThe main differences between the AK and RPK being that the RPK has a longer and thicker barrel, a wider front trunnion with a larger barrel opening to accommodate the thicker barrel, and a thicker receiver with a pocket at the front for the wider front trunnion.\r\n\r\nDuring Soviet times all Soviet military small arms production, including of course production of the Kalashnikov series, was done at three state run factories, Izhmash, Tula, and Molot. Under the Soviet system of specialization and centralization of production, each of the three factories was assigned to produce a particular variant of the Kalashnikov. Izhmash made all the assault rifle (AK) variants of the Kalashnikov, Tula made the specialized short-barreled (AKS-74U) variant, and Molot made all the light-machinegun (RPK) variants of the Kalashnikov. So each factory was tooled up to only make its own specific variant of the AK.\r\n\r\nin short, Vepr has a better fit and finish from the factory than the Saiga and is built to take some serious abuse.\r\n\r\nRegards.', 1, 1, '182.177.50.131', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

The car was installed with tracker/anti-jammer device and an additional security alarm and there was no sign of the damned gate lock anywhere in the morning.\n\nAn inquiry has been launched with 5 security guards and President of the community society summoned over the gross neglect and it has appeared that my most trusted of these guards was misguided towards a fake encounter further down the street, while the operation was carried out here, all over in less than 20 minutes. Or, probably - [I]daal mein kaala[/I].\n \nPhone track-records from the networks of all the on-duty guards been requested, since I''m of the opinion that this just cannot be carried out by outsiders without some sort of [I]local assistance[/I].\n\nI insisted on NIL security arrangements in my streets from now on, as even the security guards will be considered threats from my side and will be in direct danger zones, if trespassing around! Let''s see what appears, the car was insured at full value, so I am standing before the choice of MT/SR vs AT/SR once again, hence back to square 1, as six months ago, lolz! \n\nIn the absence of a car, coz the second car had rarely been used and stood without battery charge, a friend sent over an Automatic transmission vehicle for emergency use and I literally couldn''t make the thing move, most issues being when reversing.

He shoos him away. But later, the dog is back inside again. So he goes over to the dog and notices that it has a note in his mouth. He takes the note and reads “Can I have 12 soaps and a shampoo bottle, please. The money is with the dog.” The shopkeeper looks inside the dog’s mouth and to his surprise there is a 100 rupee note in his mouth. So he takes the money and puts the soap, shampoo and change in a bag, and then places it in the dog’s mouth.\nThe shopkeeper is so impressed, and since it is the closing time, he decides to follow the dog. The dog is walking down the street, when it comes to the zebra crossing; he waits till the signal turns green. He walks across the road till the bus stop. He waits on the stop and looks up the timetable for the bus. The shopkeeper is totally out of his mind as the dog gets into the bus and sits on a vacant seat. The shopkeeper follows the dog. The dog waits for the conductor to come to his seat. He gives the change to the conductor and shows him the neck belt to keep the ticket. The shopkeeper is almost fainting at this sight and so are the other people in the bus. \nThe dog then moves to the front exit of the door and waits for the bus stop to arrive, looking outside. As soon as the stop is in sight he wags his tail to inform the driver to stop. Then not even waiting for the bus stop to arrive the dog jumps out and runs to the house nearby. It opens a big iron gate and rushes towards the door. As it approaches the door, he changes his mind and walks towards the garden. The dog walks up to the window and beats his head several times on the window. It then walks back to the door and waits. The shopkeeper maintaining his senses walks up to the door and watches a big guy open the door.\nThe guy starts beating, kicking and abusing the dog. The shopkeeper is surprised and runs to stop the guy. The shopkeeper questions the guy “What in the heaven are you doing?

But parking is a problem.\n\nProcess was very very simple (no need to have reference ), which  surprised me (I have old book form  license, if you have computerised  license, process would be very  slightly change, but keep your original  CNIC with you to get entry pass).\n\n1. Write an application to Section Officer Arms that:\n\nDate:\n\nThe Section Officer Arms\nHome Department\nGovt. of Sindh.\n\nSub: Conversion of Sindh License to All Pakistan.\n\nRespected Sir,\n\nI own All Sindh License # XXXXXX  for NPB issued by ___ dated ______.   Due to traveling needs and prevailing law and order situation you are   requested to allow me to convert the same into All Pakistan. You are   therefore requested to approve my application to convert my license to   "All Pakistan." My particulars are as under:\n\nName: \nLicense Number:\nIssue Date:\nIssued By:\n\n\n\n2. Go directly in the room of Mr. Peer Bux Chanjro and get your application approved by his one signature.\n\n3. Go to Computerised Arms Section room and show them your application,  they  will give you formal printed letter addressed to "Manager National  Bank of  Pakistan" for issuance of Challan for All Pakistan Conversion.\nTake this printout again to Mr Peer Bux he will sign on it, then get stamped it from the room just opposite to him.\n\n4. Get copied this approval letter (3 copies for safe side), License   Copy, CNIC Copy (2 numbers), and most important get National Bank   challan from the person sitting below the tree outside the Sind   Secretariat (Named Shah Ji, a beared person) who will charge Rs 10 for a   photocopy challan. NBP does not have challan form you have to buy from   outside.\n\n5. Go to National Bank Sind Secretariat branch (not FBR branch) which  will open by 11 ''O Clock, along  with original letter of Mr Peer Bux and  CNIC copy, Fill the challan form for Rs 2500 and pay Rs 2500 + 30. \n\n6. Get copied this paid challan (3 copies).\n\n7. Go to the room opposite Mr Peer Bux they will stamp your license and   will write some record on this stamped  area, then get signature of Mr  Peer  Bux Chahjro at this stamped area on your own. \nAgain get photocopy of this page.\n\n8. Get Complete license copy (if not already done) including recently   signed/stamped page, CNIC copy, paid challan copy and go again in the  same room  (opposite to Mr Peer Bux) and give them these photocopies. \nThey will record your license entry in a register and allot you a number in stamped area.\n\nNOW YOU ARE DONE:)[/QUOTE]\n\nnow that is one detailed brief :)', 1, 1, '39.41.49.68', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

He shoos him away. But later, the dog is back inside again. So he goes over to the dog and notices that it has a note in his mouth. He takes the note and reads “Can I have 12 soaps and a shampoo bottle, please. The money is with the dog.” The shopkeeper looks inside the dog’s mouth and to his surprise there is a 100 rupee note in his mouth. So he takes the money and puts the soap, shampoo and change in a bag, and then places it in the dog’s mouth.\nThe shopkeeper is so impressed, and since it is the closing time, he decides to follow the dog. The dog is walking down the street, when it comes to the zebra crossing; he waits till the signal turns green. He walks across the road till the bus stop. He waits on the stop and looks up the timetable for the bus. The shopkeeper is totally out of his mind as the dog gets into the bus and sits on a vacant seat. The shopkeeper follows the dog. The dog waits for the conductor to come to his seat. He gives the change to the conductor and shows him the neck belt to keep the ticket. The shopkeeper is almost fainting at this sight and so are the other people in the bus. \nThe dog then moves to the front exit of the door and waits for the bus stop to arrive, looking outside. As soon as the stop is in sight he wags his tail to inform the driver to stop. Then not even waiting for the bus stop to arrive the dog jumps out and runs to the house nearby. It opens a big iron gate and rushes towards the door. As it approaches the door, he changes his mind and walks towards the garden. The dog walks up to the window and beats his head several times on the window. It then walks back to the door and waits. The shopkeeper maintaining his senses walks up to the door and watches a big guy open the door.\nThe guy starts beating, kicking and abusing the dog. The shopkeeper is surprised and runs to stop the guy. The shopkeeper questions the guy “What in the heaven are you doing? The dog is a genius he could be famous in life.” The guy responds “You call this clever?

The bolt can stick if you use a laquor coated case like Czechoslovakian match ammo but works fine with brass or copper plated steel cases.\r\n\r\n@dragunov I seen Enemy At the Gates film and its the reason I got one of those rifles.

The forum has been really helpful in narrowing down my choices, so i decided to share my experience with fellow members regarding the  Rangers Shooting & Saddle Club. \n\nFirstly the range is really easily accessible, in terms of getting their from my house which is located near Karachi University , compared to the other places, including the airmen club and Arabian sea club, which are both rather far away from my house and also are not really located in areas which are considered very safe, both the airmen club and Arabian sea club facilities are located in very volatile areas, where some thing or the other goes wrong every now and then.\n\nAnother huge factor is that when you are going to the  Rangers Shooting & Saddle Club, you have to cross the toll plaza and both side of the road is covered by different LEA officials, we were pulled over by rangers officials on our way back to home, after spending a leisurely morning at the range, however, once we informed the officials we were members at the club, we were treated very professional and courteously. \n\nFirst impression:\n\nThe minute you enter the cool shade of the club''s admin block, even when you are making arrangements (paying charges for using the range etc) you will witness the military proficiency of the staff, out of no where, emerges a bus boy with a glass of "CHILLED" mineral water, served on a tray and a Doyle, call me a snob, but WHOA!!!! that made me feel really good, the staff at the range is extremely courteous, honest and very very helpful, from the admin to the range, the staff was the high point of my day, every one was constantly checking whether you wanted tea, water or any other refreshment. The instructors at the range even helped me set my gun sights, reload my magazines and offered their advise and assistance in ensuring i had a perfect stance and grip for using my guns. Being my first experience at a Civilian gun range in Karachi, i must say, the 25 meter pistol range is pretty decent, i am not going to compare it with any other places abroad, however, it was far better then the one i have seen at the Arabian Sea Club and airmen club, i cannot give my opinion about the Karsaz range, because i am yet to visit that.\n\nThe Showdown:\n\nThe 25 meter pistol range has 6 shooting stalls, each equipped with its own target display system, however, the display system did need a lot of effort on my part and later on the staff to adjust it for me, that was the only turn off realistically i had in the entire trip. \n\nThe shooting range staff under a Major Maaz of the Sindh rangers, has made sure that strict safety procedures are opted, and the instructors were very professional and polite but at the same time tolerated no horseplay whatsoever, that seemed made me feel really good, that these guys are very serious about safety.\n\nAlso to my surprise the club had ear muffs available (since i had forgotten my entire bag at home containing the ear muffs, eye protection and some extra ammo) also the range has ammo available at subsidised rates for Rifle, pistol and shotgun. \n\nThe club also features a rifle range, designed for any kind of rifle shooting and it could facilitate  a shot set out at 270 meters.\n\nThe Skeet shooting range also is pretty darn decent, again the staff was very helpful and cooperative. Considering the fact that these facilities are used for competitive shooting tournaments, my humble opinion about the facilities is very good and i can easily compare it with any budget shooting range in the US or Canada.\n\nThe membership process is also fairly simply and less problematic , unlike the Karsaz shooting range that requires tons of paper work, the Rangers Shooting & Saddle Club only need basic paper work like copy of CNIC and licenses. The membership cost itself is rather cheap comparatively, the club has defined 2 packages, one will cost a life time fees of 200,000 and then 3000 p/m for maintenance and the 2nd being  a life time fees of 180,000 and then 5000 p/m for maintenance.\n\nThe club members have access to their own lockers and it also houses a changing area, a cafeteria and a souvenir shop.  the cafeteria isn''t much but does have a really nice "KARAK" cup of tea. Also i know this will sound really cheesy, but the bathrooms at the joint were clean and well maintained. \n\n\nI shot around 90 round of my CF-98, 30 rounds of 5.56 and 30 rounds of a 12 gauge and it was a really nice experience all together. \n\nI hope this basic review of one of the facilities was helpful for members.\n\nCheers!', 1, 0, '203.101.170.245', 6, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

But parking is a problem.\n\nProcess was very very simple (no need to have reference ), which surprised me (I have old book form  license, if you have computerised license, process would be very  slightly change, but keep your original CNIC with you to get entry pass).\n\n1. Write an application to Section Officer Arms that:\n\nDate:\n\nThe Section Officer Arms\nHome Department\nGovt. of Sindh.\n\nSub: Conversion of Sindh License to All Pakistan.\n\nRespected Sir,\n\nI own All Sindh License # XXXXXX  for NPB issued by ___ dated ______.  Due to traveling needs and prevailing law and order situation you are  requested to allow me to convert the same into All Pakistan. You are  therefore requested to approve my application to convert my license to  "All Pakistan." My particulars are as under:\n\nName: \nLicense Number:\nIssue Date:\nIssued By:\n\n\nHuzaifa\n\n2. Go directly in the room of Mr. Peer Bux Chanjro and get your application approved by his one signature.\n\n3. Go to Computerised Arms Section room and show them your application, they  will give you formal printed letter addressed to "Manager National Bank of  Pakistan" for issuance of Challan for All Pakistan Conversion.\nTake this printout again to Mr Peer Bux he will sign on it, then get stamped it from the room just opposite to him.\n\n4. Get copied this approval letter (3 copies for safe side), License  Copy, CNIC Copy (2 numbers), and most important get National Bank  challan from the person sitting below the tree outside the Sind  Secretariat (Named Shah Ji, a beared person) who will charge Rs 10 for a  photocopy challan. NBP does not have challan form you have to buy from  outside.\n\n5. Go to National Bank Sind Secretariat branch (not FBR branch) which will open by 11 ''O Clock, along  with original letter of Mr Peer Bux and CNIC copy, Fill the challan form for Rs 2500 and pay Rs 2500 + 30. \n\n6. Get copied this paid challan (3 copies).\n\n7. Go to the room opposite Mr Peer Bux they will stamp your license and  will write some record on this stamped  area, then get signature of Mr Peer  Bux Chahjro at this stamped area on your own. \nAgain get photocopy of this page.\n\n8. Get Complete license copy (if not already done) including recently  signed/stamped page, CNIC copy, paid challan copy and go again in the same room  (opposite to Mr Peer Bux) and give them these photocopies. \nThey will record your license entry in a register and allot you a number in stamped area.\n\nNOW YOU ARE DONE:)[/QUOTE]', 1, 0, '119.154.180.179', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

Never mind carrying the gun or Licensing issue, just travelling on GT Road from Islamabad to Peshawar in the car with your family, you get stoped on almost every check post and then various excuses are made in order to terrorise and bully innocent law abiding public along with their families for XYZ reasons.

Going to home ministry office and showing them the receipt and entry for the weapon and getting it stamped (i assume)\n\nam i missing something? please help me. I am from Karachi, Pakistan.

I was invited by our fellow PG member Iqbal T..  Other top shooters were there, Col. Sakhawat, Maj. Amer, and another gentleman (Brigadier Sikandar) with an AMAZING sense of shooting and humor.\nI got my chance to shoot the Sig P226 SLII aka XZone(heavy but good), and tried my hands on TWO Sig P210s (Swiss manufactured).  \nNow, I don''t know if this means much as to what I state here on PG, but I have one statement to make regarding the Sig P210....  THIS IS AN AMAZING PISTOL CAPABLE OF SHOOTING BULLSEYES AT 50 METERS... OVER AND OVER!  Not only that, the parts were interchangeable.  One P210 belonged to Col. Sakhawat and the other to our PG member Iqbal T.  Great quality, these pistols were hand built in Switzerland, and the internal finish was shockingly good not to mention the interchangeability of parts between the two.  Great Guns Sirs and rightly so named LEGENDs.\nSo on to the CZ which I was too shy to bring out after firing the other two.  Got the courage to start the Sight-in procedure at 25meters.  The CZ75TS felt great to shoot and the groups were tight and I was shooting low five round shots groups initially; after every 5 rounds, I would keep raising the rear sight as you all can see in the photo below.  Once zeroed it was bull after bull... plate after plate.  The red dots on the target represents final shots by Col. Sakhawat to make sure it was properly sighted in.  \nBut the real kicker was Brigadier Sikandar, I wish I could have taken a video of this because quite a few of us here on PG will think I am fibbing.  He shot his first three rounds LITERALLY through the same first shot hole!  The first shot hole only kept getting bigger slightly by NO MORE THAN .5mm!!!!  I also wanted to take that target''s photos but by the time I remembered to take photos of my target, most of the targets were torn down (we had moved to the trap range, when I remembered to take photos).  I will remember to bring my video camera out on their next shoot with my beloved TS. \nAnyways, here is my target at 25meters and you all can see the gradual shift upwards in the groups.  GAME ON... Anyone got a Czechmate?  I wanna melt it. LOLZ.\n[IMG]http://i1109.photobucket.com/albums/h427/pyramids99/1-2.jpg[/IMG]', 1, 1, '58.65.182.221', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

I have others but this has been my main stay since 1982 when the bug bit.  Along the way throughout inception of this time line, there are two things I still own and will probably stay in my family I hope after I am loong gone.  One is a Colt Combat Elite .45acp 1911 pistol (purchased 1986) and the other is the BuckMaster knife model 184 (purchased 1985).  \nI have never been a fan of knives; however, back in the day, this was the knife I had to have.  So one fine day in summer of 1986 I purchased my BuckMaster Model from the Cutlery Shop for $159.00.  I have never used it really except twice.  I asked someone what the saw tooth were for and he gave me a run-down.  Ofcourse, I can never use it for that trial purpose so I chose the next best thing, my old VW Rabbit (Golf).  I walked up to the door stabbed the knife in the door (went in like butter) and used the upward angle to saw my way through the door panel.  The second time I just lugged it around when I went camping and that was good as when we got lost I was able to slightly judge by way of the compass our return.  Thats it, otherwise, I take this knife out every four or five years out of the box to look at it and then put back.  Its a model 184 "patent pend" same is stated on its sheath.\nA fellow PG member just returned from the US, and he bought me a gift, a book named BuckMaster Knives The Authorized History of Models 184 & 185.  The book was written by Richard Neyman.  It seems that there is a history now on this knife and its become a collectors item.  Thanks to fellow PG member Stealth for this kind gift.\nI will quote what is stated on this very informative books back cover:\n"Legend of the BuckMaster: Survival Tool of the 1980s.  This book is the first fully authorized history of the BuckMaster 184.  Read first hand accounts of how this legendary knife came into being.  Originally researched, developed, and then built to serve the U.S. Navy SEALS, the BuckMaster became a 1980s American icon of survival edged knives.  From its humble beginnings in Oceanside, California, PHROBIS Ltd., in collaboration with Buck Knives of El Cajon, California, created the BuckMaster, which has become synonymous with dependability and getting the job done under any circumstances."  Incidentally, one of the creators of this and other goodies for these black-ops people was Q.  LOLZ, funny as it is its true, and due to the Bond movies fame, later on lost contracts.

In the end of the cartridge beneath the primer cap was a small vent-hole, as well as a small teat-like projection or point (later to be known as an anvil) fashioned from the case, such that the firing pin could crush the primer against the anvil and ignite the propellant. This system worked well, allowing the option of installing a cap just before use of the propellant-loaded cartridge as well as permitting reloading the cartridge for reuse. Difficulties arose in practice because pressing in the cap from the outside tended to cause a swelling of the copper cartridge shell, preventing reliable seating of the cartridge in the chamber of the firearm. Berdan''s solution was to change to brass shells, and to further modify the process of installing the primer cap into the cartridge, as noted in his second Berdan Primer patent of September 29, 1869, in U.S. Patent 82,587. Berdan primers have remained essentially the same functionally to the present day.\nBerdan primers are similar to the caps used in the caplock system, being small metal cups with pressure-sensitive explosive in them. Modern Berdan primers are pressed into the "primer pocket" of a Berdan-type cartridge case, where they fit slightly below flush with the base of the case. Inside the primer pocket is a small bump, the "anvil", that rests against the center of the cup, and two small holes (one on either side of the anvil) that allow flash from the primer to reach the interior of the case. Berdan cases are reusable, although the process is rather involved. The used primer must be removed, usually by hydraulic pressure or a pincer or lever that pulls the primer out of the bottom. A new primer is carefully seated against the anvil, and then gunpowder and a bullet are added. Because the Berdan primer is difficult to remove from the case without damaging the anvil, Berdan priming is used by nearly all militaries and most civilian manufacturers (with the exception of those in the United States) to discourage reloading of ammunition.\n\n[B]Boxer primers.\n\n[/B]Meanwhile, Edward M. Boxer, of the Royal Arsenal, Woolwich, England was working on a similar primer cap design for cartridges, patenting it in England on October 13, 1866, and subsequently received a U.S. patent for his design on June 29, 1869, in U.S. Patent 91,818.\nBoxer primers are similar to Berdan primers with one major change, the location of the anvil. In a Boxer primer, the anvil is a separate piece that sits in the primer cup. The primer pocket has a single larger flash-hole in its center. This positioning makes little or no difference to the performance of the round, but it makes fired primers vastly easier to remove for re-loading; the primer assembly is removed by pushing a thin metal rod through the flash hole, which is centered in the case. A new primer, anvil included, is then pressed into the case. Since the primer and anvil are sold as one part, the anvil depth must be correct for the primer that is being inserted so that the primer does not ignite during loading (although priming is done as the first step, before the powder is added.) Boxer priming is universal in the USA, and contributes to the large number of shooters who reload their ammunition.\nBoxer-primed ammunition is slightly more complex to manufacture, since the primer is in two parts, but automated machinery producing primers by the hundreds of millions has eliminated that as a practical problem and while the primer is more complex to make, the cartridge case is simpler. For users who reload their brass, the slight increase in initial cost is more than equalized by the decreased cost of firing reloaded rounds (reloading ammunition can save as much as 85-90% compared with new factory rounds.) However, because of the slightly lower cost of manufacture Berdan priming is found to be much more common in military-surplus ammunition made outside the United States. Military-surplus Berdan-primed ammunition also often uses corrosive or slightly-corrosive priming compounds because they are slightly cheaper to use, whereas Boxer-primed ammunition now is almost always noncorrosive and non-mercury-containing. These corrosive priming mixtures can cause serious damage to the gun unless the barrel and action are cleaned carefully after firing. Assuming corrosive or noncorrosive characteristics based on the primer type is never foolproof, however, and much older U.S. military ammunition used corrosive primers. The two primer types are almost impossible to distinguish by looking at the loaded cartridge, though the two flash-holes can be seen inside a fired Berdan case and the larger single hole seen or felt inside a fired Boxer case. Berdan and Boxer cartridges are both considered "centerfire" and are interchangeable; the same weapon can fire either Berdan- or Boxer-primed rounds if the cartridge dimensions are the same.\n\n[B]Primer sizes.\n\n[/B]Primers come in different sizes, based on the application.The primer size is based on the primer pocket of the cartridge, with standard types available in large or small diameters. The primer''s explosive charge is based on the amount of ignition energy required by the cartridge design; a standard primer would be used for smaller charges or faster-burning powders, while a magnum primer would be used for the larger charges or slower-burning powders used with large cartridges or heavy charges. Rifle, large and magnum primers increase the ignition energy delivered to the powder, by supplying a hotter, stronger and/or longer-lasting flame. Pistol cartridges often are smaller than modern rifle cartridges, so they may need less primer flame than rifles require. A physical difference between pistol and rifle primers is the thickness of the primer''s case; since pistol cartridges usually operate at lower pressure levels than rifles, their primer cups are thinner, softer, and easier to ignite, while rifle primers are thicker and stronger, requiring a harder impact from the firing pin. (Despite the names pistol and rifle, the primer used depends on the cartridge, not the firearm; a few high-pressure pistol cartridges like the .221 Fireball and .454 Casull use rifle primers, while lower-pressure pistol and revolver cartridges like the 32 and 380 Autos, 9mm Luger, 38 Special, 357 Magnum, 44 Magnum and 45 ACP and traditional revolver cartridges like 32-20, 44-40 and 45 Colt, also used in lever action rifles, still would be loaded with pistol primers. Virtually all cartridges used solely in rifles do, however, use rifle primers.)', 1, 1, '110.39.41.229', 0, 1, 4, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

(244922, 8193, 0, 'Ahnab', 6111, 'Walk with Humility, but carry a Big Stick!', 1328544861, 'Salaam everyone!\n\nI wanted to relate to you an SD situation I found myself in a little over a month ago. I wasn''t sure whether I should tell people about this particular incident, but lately I''ve realised that such cases should be discussed openly & frequently so as to learn from our mistakes and to better ourselves collectively.\n\nIt was a Wednesday night and I was coming home from work. It was late night, around 11:30, and I was travelling on Ferozpur Road. I had just come down from the Kalima Chowk flyover and had come to a standstill at the traffic signal opposite Gaddafi Stadium. I wanted to make a u-turn, and was waiting for my signal to turn green. I had been standing at the red signal for not more than 5 seconds when I suddenly heard tires screeching behind me. I immediately looked into the rear-view mirror and saw a pair of headlights gunning straight at me. I instinctively braced myself, and the next moment I felt an impact and heard a loud crash. Apparently somebody had rear-ended me. I took a moment to check that I was fine, took a deep breath to calm myself down, and then got out of the car to assess the damage.\n\nThe first thing I saw when I got out was the other car; it was a brand new E-Class Mercedes, with an "Applied for Registration" tag. It''s front bumper had a nasty dent, the grille was partially hanging out, and the right headlight was flickering like crazy. Looking at the condition of the Merc, I was suddenly quite apprehensive at the damage my car must have taken (I was driving a late model Honda City). So I looked over at my car and, miraculously, all I suffered was a hairline crack on the bumper; everything else was perfectly fine! Relieved, I silently thanked God and started to walk over to the Merc to check on the driver.\n\nThe Merc''s door flew open and a kid in his early 20''s stormed out. He looked at the damage his car had taken, then looked at my car, then turned to me and started accusing me of being a bad driver. He was screaming & shouting, calling me everything from being stupidly blind to being a road menace. I kept calmly reminding him that it was he who had smashed into a stationary car at a red traffic signal and, therefore, the fault lay with him. But he simply wouldn''t have any of it, and even went to the extent of demanding that I pay for his damages!\n\nI tried calming him down and diffusing the situation as civilly as possible, but he was just too "pumped up" to let it go. So after listening to his ranting for a full 5 minutes and trying fruitlessly to make him understand where the actual blame lay, I felt that I was fast running out of patience with his attitude and rudeness. So I cut him short and told him that I''ve had a long day, it''s late and that I''m going home. With that I turned around and started walking back towards my car.\n\nIt was then that things took a turn for the worse. He suddenly started using filthy & abusive language regarding my family. I immediately saw red and turned around to fire off a verbal salvo of my own, when I noticed he was storming off towards his own car. From the way he was walking and cursing, I felt that something was wrong. Alarm bells started going off in my head! I was wearing a suit that day, with my CCW holstered on my right hip under my coat. I swept the front of my coat over to the side and got a good grip on my gun. The jackass got to his car, reached in, fumbled around a bit, and lo and behold, he pulled out a TT! His gun was in a dormant state, and he furiously started trying to insert the magazine. Seeing this, I immediately drew my weapon and pointed it straight at his face. By this time he had finally managed to insert the magazine, and was about to rack the slide when he looked up, and saw my gun aimed right at him.\n\nI calmly but firmly told him, "Put the gun on the ground, and kick it under your car." He didn''t move a muscle and continued to stare at me with utter hate, so I repeated the command again a little more aggressively. I then noticed that his hand was already on the slide and he was slowly pulling it back. I cocked my hammer and shouted, [B]"PUT THE F**KING GUN ON THE GROUND OR I SWEAR TO GOD I WILL F**KING END YOUR F**KING LIFE, YOU MISERABLE F**K!"[/B] (please pardon the language) He looked at me for another second or so and then slowly put his gun on the ground. I then firmly told him to get in his car and drive away. He did as he was told, quietly got in, and slowly drove off. I kept my gun aimed at him the whole time till he had driven about a good 50-60 meters away. I then quickly decocked & holstered, and took a couple of deep breaths to calm myself down.\n\nI then started quietly thanking the Almighty, when 3 traffic wardens came up and started their "interrogation". I informed them of what had happened, told them that I have a licensed firearm (even showed them the license), and even pointed out the TT the jackass had left lying on the road. I then spent the next 20 minutes manoeuvring and dodging around their attempts to "pay them for their trouble". Finally they gave up, gave me a "stern warning" about being careful in the future, and left. I immediately got into my car and drove home, all the while thanking God that everything worked out fine.\n\nI learnt a lot from this particular experience, lessons about both myself and about the crazy world we live in. Not a day has gone by since then when, while leaving my home in the morning, I pray to God that I won''t be put in a situation where I''ll have to take another human being''s life. That being said, now that I look back at this incident, I know for a [B]FACT[/B] that I would have pulled the trigger without any hesitation and shot off atleast 5 rounds into that jackass'' chest. Just because I try to avoid confrontations doesn''t mean that I won''t resort to violence if forced to do so. I''m just happy that this incident ended without anyone getting hurt.\n\nMay Allah bless us, guide us, and protect us all. Ameen.', 1, 1, '110.36.195.23', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

This is where the funny shit happens once I submitted the lic the gun dept ppl tell me to come back in 2 days, I go to them after 5 days they say we need more time come tomorrow I go next day the ask me to come the next day being the nice guy I am I come back the next day finally they tell me they cant find the record and they are cancelling the lic at this point i get pissed and tell them that they have already verified the lic and showed them their stamps, they simply refuse and say they never stamped it.I go to the dealer that I applied through and told him what has happened we went down to the DCO office the next day and after wasting an hour the license was cancelled and the dealer paid me back my money.\n\nThe reason the dealer told me they cancelled the license is because the gun dept clerks have had some tussle and the records have been misplaced and if we pay them 5000 they will validate the license. I did not bother I went to return the gun ,the shop offered to apply a computerized license ( Sorry cant share their name but they are one of the better dealers in Lahore) so I have applied through them and waiting.\n\nI told you it was a long story.', 1, 0, '182.178.228.61', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

We hear all the time the untold damage aerial firing does; thus my extreme reluctance to shoot off a round in the air as a warning. Similarly, one should try and avoid shooting at anything but the intended target because, as Skeeter60 pointed out, bullets tend to ricochet off of hard surfaces and can easily go on to hurt some innocent bystander inadvertently. Clint Smith once said, [B]"Every bullet that leaves your gun has a lawyer attached to it."[/B] Which basically means that you are morally & [B]LEGALLY[/B] responsible for each & every round you fire, hence I think you should [B]ONLY[/B] pull the trigger at your intended target. Therefore, IMHO, the only warning shot worth firing is the one that''s aimed right between the jackass'' eyes!\n\n2) I admit the biggest mistake I made during this entire episode was waiting for that jackass to pull his gun before I drew mine; I should have gone with my instincts and drawn as soon as I felt something was wrong. I guess I was unconsciously trying to "play it by the book", by waiting to see if I have the moral & legal justification to draw my firearm. I think the jackass was a complete idiot because of two things; first, he was carrying a dormant gun (which, I''m sure everyone would agree, is nothing more than a glorified paperweight), and second, he pulled a gun thinking that the other poor sob (me) was nothing more than a pushover who would be scared silly at his posturing. That being said, frankly I was supremely lucky because if his gun was already "hot", then there''s a very big chance  that he could''ve gotten the first shot off and the scenario could easily  have ended badly for me.\n\n3) I was faced with a young, uncouth punk driving a bloody expensive car with absolutely no regard for the law, ethics or social etiquettes. Such a person, in my book, is the spoilt offspring of some powerful, and equally uncouth, father. The [B]LAST[/B] thing I wanted was to entangle myself with such an individual; hence I was reluctant to call the Police because, upon finding out whose son the jackass was, the Police would have inevitably become the jackass'' backup!\n\nSkeeter60, Sir I am 100% completely in agreement with your views and the scenarios you have outlines.

This cup is usually made from a soft metal such as brass or copper. A small amount of an impact sensitive explosive compound (commonly lead styphnate) is placed in the cup and is held against the back of the cup by a three legged metal "anvil". A sealant may be applied to the anvil and explosive compound to guard against moisture and exposure from oils and chemicals (contamination). The sudden impact of a firing pin on the back of the primer dents the back of the cup inward and squeezes the explosive between the anvil and the wall of the cup. This impact causes the explosive to detonate shooting a small flame forward through the flash hole igniting the gun powder inside the bullet casing. The rapidly burning gun powder (smokeless powder) increases the pressure in the casing and forces the bullet down the barrel of the gun.', 1, 1, '110.39.41.229', 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

Ok, standard bore diameter of a 12 gauge barrel is .730". The cyliner choke means the same diameter as the true bore, ie, .730". This means no constriction has been applied.

Never beg for any favour, poke them in their ego after relaxing them, tell them you strong young men didn''t need a gun to rob. \n3.I am weak old or sick you can take the money and the car and the phone.\n4. You have to keep talking to overcome fear and to strike a communication will help you gauge their intentions and how far they will go.\n5. If they are just Phone /wallet robbers you can deal with them easily. If how ever they are kidnappers the sooner you create a distraction and draw your gun the better because these are different animals they are hardened and very well trained. They will be above  30 years going on to mid 40s and not in their twenties, they will be in a car and will be more than 3 people.\nIf you are with your wife, daughter or sister she should be briefed to run to a side immediately and you can decide what to do.\nRelax \nDistract\nCreate an opportunity with a diversion\nShoot to kill\nThese steps can be discussed at length and we can create diversions and distractions with presence of mind[/QUOTE]\n\nThanks for the sound advice sir!

He had 350 magnum classics (the one I like better) for 40k/piece and DIANA RWS 460 magnum for 45k/piece. Better ring him up and confirm price&availability now because back then a few months ago he had alot of stock of DIANA airguns and BROWNING MAXUS.[/QUOTE]\n\n[QUOTE=raja yasir;245501]diana 350 magnum was available only  the classic model was available which is not good for scope because the classic on does not have raised check .and secondly it is not accurate at all specially with locally available pellets .Seen a lot of disappointed people who buy this gun.you can fire accurately only with heavier good pellets and a lot of experience.[/QUOTE]\nSo that was available na, as you said 350 is not available, I was amazed as he had a huge stock and 350Fuerkraft is a 350.\nSecondly ANY newer DIANA/RWS, Weihrauch/Beeman, CROSMAN, etc, ANY GOOD AIRGUN will NOT shoot accurately with ANY LOCALLY AVAILABLE PELLET which includes Afghani, Irani & all types of local pellets BECAUSE they are under-wight at just 7-8grains and not uniformly built, specially ALL TYPES OF LOCAL ones. Secondly every airgun will shoot best with a specific pellets be it of the same model, every single piece enjoys a different pellet the most. \n\nI''d differ @ Diana 350 Fuerkraft not being good. I think it''s the best 350. I just love the SLEEK, Long built of it. Lesser weight than the normal 350 and IT FEELS MUCH MUCH MUCH LIGHTER THAN THE CHUNKY 350M DUE TO SLEEK & LONG BUILT.\nThe raised cheek-piece was hurting my cheeks on the 350M, and I enjoy every shot of the 350F without harming myself. And @ all costs I avoid using Gamo pellets (the only int''l imported pellets available locally which everyone has, in recent times regarded as JUNK).\n\nThe gun is very very accurate. Infact more accurate than RWS/Diana''s most selling model, the 34 (IT''S PROVEN).\nYou need to master the "Artillery hold" on any magnum springer to take full advantage of it''s accuracy.\n\nI think 13-15 grained pellets work the best with this airgun. They are not considered heavy but moderate. The gun is under-powered for heavy pellets like ''H&N Rabbit Magnum II''. Infact I don''t think any springer out there can shoot those pellets accurately.\n\nHaving used both & taking account of personal experience, I rate this airgun at 10/10 and prefer it over the normal 350 magnum.\n\nHere''s a little comparison b/w the 350M & the 350F just to clear some doubts.\n\n(1) They are literally THE SAME GUNS (Same powerplant)m but just in 2 different stocks.\n(2) The 350M comes with a checkered stock with a raised cheekpiece which is the reason lefties have to resell their 350M''s.\n      On the other hand, the 350F has a long, sleek stock with fien grains that makes the guns about (a quarter of a KG         lighter) but the gun feels MUCH MUCH balanced and lighter.\n(3) Power & Accuracy is THE SAME BECAUSE THEY''RE THE SAME THING.\n(4) 350M has CHEAP iron sights opposed to 350F''s quality, crisp Fiber Optics.\n\nI''ll leave it up-to you, I have not been disappointed by the 350. And the disappointed people are the ones without experience of this gun. It needs to be properly tuned to reduce recoil and make it accurate.\n\nUse a good mount like the $100 Theoben Dampa mounts, and literally any scope of good make would do.

Then they will allow you for limited period of time.

Each subsequent constriction is .005 inches apart and is given a name for identification like skeet, improved cylinder, modified, improved modified, full, extra full, turkey etc. \n\nI think it is too confusing. Ok, standard bore diameter of a 12 gauge barrel is .730". The cyliner choke means the same diameter as the true bore, ie, .730". This means no constriction has been applied.

Air riffles are copies of Diana 35, 40 and Panther 31. Prices were low so as the quality. Trigger pull of one gun was like pulling elephant out of well.  During the visit I told one of the dealers to show if he had any imported guns. He said he had no imported gun but have local Beretta 92 9mm. I asked him to show…. He went back in his store and brought a plastic box. The box had a nice look unlike other Pakistani pistols in paper board box. First look, feel and weight was awesome, it was like original one. Even all the written material was engraved and had a nice original look. Slide was more towards imported side and soft unlike Pakistani Pistols. I pulled the cocked trigger and it was creamy soft. I asked the retailed price and it was 25000 in Muzaffarabad which looks too much for Made in Pakistan Pistol, thought made in Italy was written on it.

The embargo is for exporting (from the US) firearms and ammunition of a considerable ($500,000+ worth of ordnance) value. \nb. Yes it is possible to bring from the US firearm/s and ammunition, but so long as you are a \n1. US Permanent Resident (Green Card holder), \n2. Citizen (Passport holder), or\n3. Licensed exporter. The export license costs roughly $2,500, so for personal use at least this option is pointless.\n\nNow, with the above first two conditions fulfilled: You can bring up to three (3) handguns and 1000 rounds TEMPORARILY (for a period of up to 4 years maximum. This is US export regulation. Don''t know if Pakistani regulation allows you temporary import of up to 4 years. Maybe 1, 2 or 3 only. Maybe even 10. Gun of non-prohibited bore obviously, check with FBR from Customs and Excise department.) \nTemporarily also means you cannot sell them once you get back to Pakistan.\n\n The procedure is as follows:\ni. First, if you''re traveling and will return from anywhere other than Islamabad, you need a provincial license (1,2,3 - depending on how many you want to bring back). Then you''ll need an import permit from the Ministry of Commerce. Then an NOC from the Ministry of Defense. Those are the Pakistani requirements. (Remember, although Pakistani laws might allow you to permanently import firearms, which could be in any number, for personal use, the US does not, currently at least, allow you to export permanently for permanent use, unless condition 3 above is fulfilled, in which case you are a licensed exporter.\nii. Now you''re in the United States and depending on the State you are in, you might not require a license to purchase a firearm (only a License to Carry). I''m from PA, and the state does not require a license to purchase a handgun or any non-military firearm, but a license to carry only (loaded, in your car, about your person in any way and in public).\niii. These firearm(s) have to be kept in a hard case, preferably with padlocks with you and can only be transported out of the country in checked baggage, never with carry baggage (obviously). It''s good to check with the airline too, because certain airlines don''t allow carriage of firearms even in checked baggage. Most do however.\niv. Get to the airline counter for getting your boarding pass (arrive early at the airport, because this will take some time) and declare that you are carrying firearms. They will take you to the Customs officer for inspection and permission. He/she might or might not inspect the firearm itself. You have to sign a CBP form 4457 if I remember correctly (look on the internet) which basically has a description of what you''re carrying. Then have the CBP officer record the weapon number and other details on their register (this is important for when you have to bring it back after a temporary period, remember?), show him all the paper work regarding Pakistani law, that you will be allowed entry of your items when you disembark in Pakistan.\nYou will be given a certificate (keep this safe) with the "permission". That''s almost just it.\nv. Now, you''re back in Pakistan (that was it for me). PLEASE DO NOT SELL THESE GUNS. \nI cannot explain about the procedure once you disembark at a Pakistani airport, because I have never had to go the immigration counter and customs (thankfully) so I don''t know the process. But it should be simple. \nCollect your luggage, show the Customs officers the documentation you have, get home, get to the range, pop some cherry.\n\n(Mods, please edit this post for informal language if you like)', 1, 0, '182.185.161.39', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

The frustration often started pretty much from the test fire session. Then further frustration of going back to the dealer which in many cases were in different towns, then arguing your case there while the dealer is sat fogging you off still trying to convince you mentally that there is nothing wrong with the gun and so on then it was a mission convincing the dealer just to change or swap the gun nevermind giving you a refund back that''s often impossible, the word "refund" does not exist in their dictionary. Unfortunately I''ve been through all these frustrating experiences many times.But put all that to a side and let''s talk about the most important issue out of all things which is often why most of us purchase a gun in the first place and that is offcourse the Safety or Defence. That''s where the importance of reliability also comes as the top priority. Its not worth gambling the safety when to it comes to any kind of defence wether its personal/self defence OR home defence. If one wants to purchase clones by all means do so but at the same time I think your primary defence weapons should be the reliable ones.

[/B]\r\n\r\n[B]Option 1:[/B] A nail and a hammer to make small taps/dents on wood as you go along and stipple the area you fancy. be as random as you can be.\r\n\r\n[B]Option 2:[/B] A Dremel tool (die grinder) with a diamond cutter bit attachment. lightly touch the wooden surface with the dremel tool as you go along making small dents/dimples in an extremely random fashion.\r\n\r\n[B]Which one is better?[/B]\r\n\r\nIn my humble opinion, stippling with a dremel tool is a better option as it basically grinds away wood instead of compressing (punching) it with a nail and a hammer. you do not get splintered wood and the dents are much smoother. make sure you run the tool at medium speed as at higher speeds, the wood gets burned, turning the dents/dimples black with excess heat of the cutter bit. another very import benefit with a dremel tool is that it makes a short work of an otherwise very lengthy process. be warned! even with a dremel at your side, stippling is quiet a tedious process.\r\n\r\n[B]So how do we go about it?[/B] A little disclaimer first.\r\n\r\n[B][I]The following content is for informational purposes only.

Truoil is probably the best ready-made solution out there. if you can get your hands on the one made by Birchwood Casey then you are pretty much set for the finishing process, otherwise you can always make your own Tru-Oil. This is how I made mine:\r\n\r\n[B]Home-Made Tru-Oil:[/B]\r\n1. Three Parts Paint Thinner\r\n2. Two Parts Polyurethane Wood Varnish\r\n3. One Part Linseed Oil (Boiled for 10 minutes)\r\n\r\nNow, your Tru-Oil stock finish is ready. apply with a small brush. a little goes a long way. your focus should be on extremely thin/light coats. you may thin it further by mixing it 50:50 with paint thinner. two may be three should be enough to cover the whole area. each coat may take up to 12 hours to dry. wipe off any unwanted areas immediately with a clean cloth/towel.\r\n\r\nHere are the results:\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i998.photobucket.com/albums/af103/12gauge-pakguns/Wood%20Stippling/IMG_1336.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i998.photobucket.com/albums/af103/12gauge-pakguns/Wood%20Stippling/IMG_1338.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i998.photobucket.com/albums/af103/12gauge-pakguns/Wood%20Stippling/IMG_1337.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i998.photobucket.com/albums/af103/12gauge-pakguns/Wood%20Stippling/IMG_1339.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i998.photobucket.com/albums/af103/12gauge-pakguns/Wood%20Stippling/IMG_1340.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i998.photobucket.com/albums/af103/12gauge-pakguns/Wood%20Stippling/IMG_1341.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i998.photobucket.com/albums/af103/12gauge-pakguns/Wood%20Stippling/IMG_1346.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\nWood Stippling might be ugly but is a fast, simple, and easy alternative to checkering that can provide a secure gripping surface.\r\n\r\nRegards.', 1, 1, '182.177.113.57', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

In 1971 after the war he returned to KHI and entered his license with the DC of KHI. Then he brought the gun to our village and got the entry with DC of Abbotabad and finally with the DC of Rawalpindi when we shifted here. \n\nThis time when MOI issues started for re-validation of licenses from NADRA, my father took his both licenses of 12 bore and .30 caliber pistol to the NADRA office and they kept only .30 caliber and returned the 12 bore license with the remarks that it is provincial and it is not required for re-validation as they are entertaining only MOI License.\n  So in the light of the above, I can say that it is the right of every citizen of Pakistan to change his residence within Pakistan[FONT=Wingdings][FONT=Wingdings]:)[/FONT][/FONT]\n\n  But it is obligatory to get the license entry with the relevant authorities of that city.', 1, 0, '124.109.41.210', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

Carrying a gun is a tremendous social responsibility and a great moral burden which should not be taken lightly simply because you''re feeling all "manly & macho" or because you think it''s "cool"; there''s nothing macho or cool about a brainless wannabe who carries a gun around without truly understanding the implications of his choices.

Admittedly, usage of a firearm must [B]ALWAYS[/B] be as a [B]last resort[/B] (when all verbal & non-verbal warnings and attempts to lower the threat level have failed, and the BG is still intent on causing you lethal harm), and should [B]NOT[/B] be employed unless & until [B]you are certain that your life is indeed in immediate peril.[/B]\n\nThat being said, there''s an important rule one must always remember: [B]If you carry a gun, there will always come a time when you will be required to use it.[/B] In other words, there may come a day when you will be forced to take a human life in the defence of your own. This, ladies & gentlemen, is an inevitable statistical [B]FACT![/B] Don''t be fooled into thinking just because you carry a gun, that in itself shall be sufficient to protect you; a holstered gun has [B]NEVER[/B] saved anyone''s life! A firearm, whether it''s the main gun of a tank or an assault rifle or a handgun, is meant for [B]ONE PURPOSE & ONE PURPOSE ONLY: TO END HUMAN LIFE AS QUICKLY, EFFECTIVELY & EFFICIENTLY AS POSSIBLE. [/B]So if you carry, you should [B]ALWAYS[/B] keep in mind that one day you may have to [B]KILL A HUMAN BEING[/B] at any given moment. It doesn''t matter whether the threat you are faced with is a career criminal with no qualms about committing murder or an average Joe having a sudden homicidal fit, you [B]MUST[/B] be [B]ready & willing to eliminate that threat using lethal force.[/B]\n\nTherefore, the very [B]FIRST[/B] thing you must do if you decide to carry a gun is to ask yourself this question: [B]ARE YOU WILLING TO KILL ANOTHER HUMAN BEING?[/B] If the answer is [B]"NO"[/B], then please [B]DO NOT[/B] carry a gun because your reluctance to employ your firearm makes you a liability to yourself and to those around you. Carrying a gun is a tremendous social responsibility and a great moral burden which should not be taken lightly simply because you''re feeling all "manly & macho" or because you think it''s "cool"; there''s nothing macho or cool about a brainless wannabe who carries a gun around without truly understanding the implications of his choices. Your reluctance or willingness to employ your firearm (and in the process, possibly kill somebody) in your defence is [B]THE MOST IMPORTANT[/B] factor in deciding whether you are mentally competent to carry a gun in the first place at all!\n\nRegarding the incident that I mentioned in the first post, [B]I was ready & willing to shoot (and if necessary, kill)[/B] that jackass had he racked the slide and chambered a round; because then he would have become [B]a direct & an imminent threat to my life,[/B] and I would have been [B]justified in using lethal force to negate that threat.[/B] Ideally, as [B]Skeeter60[/B] pointed out, I should have issued [B]a strong verbal warning[/B] as soon as I saw the jackass storm back towards his car and I got a feeling that something bad was about to go down; that could have made him hesitate in reaching for his gun, and then I probably wouldn''t have been forced to draw my own firearm, thus possibly ending this entire episode in a [B]less dramatic[/B] fashion.\n\nAlthough luck played a great roll in the outcome of this incident, I sincerely pray & hope that nobody has to go through a similar experience.[/QUOTE]\n\n\n\nAs always thoroughly explained....', 1, 0, '111.88.30.181', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

It should be dipped deep enough that the choke tube area along with all its thread and seating area gets dipped in WD40. Keep it dipped for 24 hours and try again. Take extreme caution that you should apply force and not let the choe tube wrench slip. As it can destroy the cuts in the choke tube. Which will cause the choke tube to get permanently stuck inside.\r\n\r\nIf you still could not remove it. Just take the gun to a qualified gunsmith. He can easily machine a tool that snuggly fits inside the barrel and attaches itself to the cuts in the choke tube. This causes maximum force to be applied with lowest possibility of damage.\r\n\r\nDont worry too  much. It can happen to anyone. The choke tubes have many threads and when stored for a long period of time they develop a propensity of siezing inside. All it needs is some brute force carefully controlled and your choke will be free.\r\n\r\nRegards.', 1, 1, '141.0.10.90', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

The weapon we carry with/on us should be a deterrent, and not as a killing machine. \nI guess the short version is that I am most definitely not prepared to take a human life...not for a mobile phone... maybe not even a car (my gun is a whole different ballgame though :becky:).

I am grateful that I have not had any experience like what Ahnab went through and pray that nobody does. But the turn that the discussion has been taking has made me think about my own philosophy on guns.\nKudos to Ahnab on coming out of a very difficult situation smelling like roses, but I believe drawing your weapon does commit you to a specific line of action which in turn is determined by how utterly stupid the other guy is or how less he may have at stake. The weapon we carry with/on us should be a deterrent, and not as a killing machine. \nI guess the short version is that I am most definitely not prepared to take a human life...not for a mobile phone... maybe not even a car (my gun is a whole different ballgame though :becky:). But that does not mean that I wont carry because I''m more than willing to shoot at someone if there is an imminent threat to my person or loved ones. My understanding of what Skeeter sir has said is if I start out accepting that I [B][U]will[/U][/B] have to kill someone, I may mentally just be ignoring alternatives.\n\nApologies for the long-winded post. I will try to keep my inputs short in the future[/QUOTE]\n\nCompletely agree. You''re right, nothing is worth pulling trigger other than for your life or of those of your loved ones.

But remember these are recoil less to the shooter. When we talk about using the scope, we find out what is the recoil to the scope not to the shooter.  When we fire 54, the whole action moves back 3/4 inch. This movement keeps us away from feeling any recoil. But the moment this action hits the end of the movement, the scope mounted on this action bears around 5 times as much recoil as it would bear if the gun had not been recoil less.  48 and 54 or 56 are the same guns except the later two have a rail system which does not let the recoil transmit to the shooter. But to the scope it gives much bigger hit than 48.\n\nNow come to the 460. This gun has less recoil than 48.  Please be assure that 54 and 56 are the most recoiling guns to the scopes and 460 is the least recoilng gun to scopes in the category of Diana magnum spring guns.\n\nI hope I help you understand the core issue.

We cannot tolerate this behavior and have been forced to ban both of you from the store. Our complaints against your husband, Mr. Harris , are listed below and are "documented by our video surveillance cameras":\n\n1. June 15: He took 24 boxes of condoms and randomly put them in other people''s carts when they weren''t looking.\n2. July 2: Set all the alarm clocks in Housewares to go off at 5-minute intervals.\n3. July 7: He made a trail of tomato juice on the floor leading to the women''s restroom.\n4. July 19: Walked up to an employee and told her in an official voice, ''Code 3 in Housewares. Get on it right away''. This caused the employee to leave her assigned station and receive a reprimand from her Supervisor that in turn resulted with a union grievance, causing management to lose time and costing the company money.\n5. August 4: Went to the Service Desk and tried to put a bag of M&Ms on layaway.\n6. August 14: Moved a ''CAUTION - WET FLOOR'' sign to a carpeted area.\n7. August 15: Set up a tent in the camping department and told the children shoppers they could come in if they would bring pillows and blankets from the bedding department to which twenty children obliged.\n8. August 23: When a clerk asked if they could help him he began crying and screamed, ''Why can''t you people just leave me alone?'' EMTs were called.\n9. September 4: Looked right into the security camera and used it as a mirror while he picked his nose.\n10. September 10: While handling guns in the hunting department, he asked the clerk where the antidepressants were.\n11. October 3: Darted around the Store suspiciously while loudly humming the ''Mission Impossible'' theme.\n12. October 6: In the auto department, he practiced his ''Madonna look'' by using different sizes of funnels.\n13. October 18: Hid in a clothing rack and when people browsed through, yelled ''PICK ME! PICK ME!''\n14. October 22: When an announcement came over the loud speaker, he assumed the fetal position and screamed ''OHNO! IT''S THOSE VOICES AGAIN!\n15. Took a box of condoms to the checkout clerk and asked where is the fitting room?\nAnd last, but not least:\n16.

Brheaded geese really respond well to a properly used call, besides good matte painted 12-24 decoys, either Carrylites or G&H ones.

There is a Canadian make duck call that I use & it makes an almost similar sound to the usual honk of a barheaded goose and even the excited (whistling) chuckles when flocks are diving into your spread; second one is H.S Waterfowl (USA) goose call which also is (by chance) imitation of our local goose especially when feeding; third one is a local make and 4th is the one made by (late) Awais Malik from Pindi. All are quite good and throw different pitch and sounds on different occasions. Brheaded geese really respond well to a properly used call, besides good matte painted 12-24 decoys, either Carrylites or G&H ones. Ruddy Shelduck (surkhab) call that I use is also from Awais Malik (late) and is quite good especially the typical nasal honk & also makes the nasal ''Grrrrrrr'' but that somehow flares those birds rather than lure them.

Various designs were submitted by a number of private manufacturers and, in the end, Winchester''s offering was selected. The semi-auto 30 M1Carbine was officially adopted in 1941. The cartridge, a modification of the 32 Winchester self-Loading round of 1906, was hardly a revolutionary new design, but it served the purpose. At about the same time, the Germans developed their assault rifle and the 7.92mm Kurz, or short cartridge. The M1 Carbine is not an assault rifle, and the military insists it was designed to fulfill a different purpose. For a few years, starting in about 1966, the Marlin Model 62 Levermatic was available in 30 Carbine caliber. Iver Johnson manufactured several versions of the M1 carbine for the sporting trade. Federal, Remington and Winchester load softpoint sporting ammunition. One version of the Ruger single-action revolver is available in 30 Carbine and Kimball has introduced an auto pistol for the 30 Carbine.\r\n\r\nIn mid 1963, the government released 30-caliber M1 Carbine for sale to civilians through the National Rifle Association at the very moderate price. Thousands of these guns are, as a result, used for sporting purposes. The 30 Carbine cartridge is in the same class as the 32-20 WCF, though slightly more powerful, if anything. It is wholly a small game and varmint number, despite contrary claims by those who love the short, light, handy Mi Carbine. The accuracy of the carbine combined with the ballistics of the cartridge limit the effective sporting accuracy range to about 150 yards, maximum. The author used an M1 Carbine to hunt small game and deer as early as 1943, before most people could get their hands on one, so he has a pretty good idea of the capability of the cartridge. Remember that the 32 Winchester Self-Loading became obsolete in 1920 because it was ineffective and more or less useless for sporting purposes. The 30 Carbine was derived from it and shares the same shortcomings.', 1, 0, '203.81.207.150', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

When the Model 14 slide action came out in 1912, it was also chambered for the Remington rimless line, including the 30-caliber, as was the Model 30 bolt action introduced in 1921. The Stevens lever-action Model 425 and the Standard gas-operated rifle also used the 30 Remington and others of the rimless line. No rifles have chambered this round since immediately following WWII, but the major ammunition companies have loaded it, more or less continously, since the war''s end. There must be a very large number of rifles of this caliber still in use.\r\n\r\nIdentical to the 30-30 in performance, but with two slight advantages, the 30 Remington is strictly in the small, medium and deer-size game class. Its advantages are in the nature of the guns that chambered it. For one thing, it is possible to use spitzer-type bullets in most 30 Remington rifles, and this helps retain velocity at the longer ranges. Secondly, most rifles chambered for this round would stand slightly higher pressures than the typical lever-action 30-30. The 30 Remington can, therefore, be reloaded to somewhat better performance than the 30-30 Winchester.

I always prefer MOD plus 8# regular Shaheen shell...as it gives me lot of room to manouver (15-40 yards).\n\nIn future, if you plan on buying some Cyprus made Olympia shells try #6 in 34 gms load with Full Cyl choke (5 cuts, no choke) ,,, you ''ll be amazed at the patterning and range. Even very close range partridge (10 yard) as well as very long range ones are hit with full pattern consistently with it. A hunting partner uses that very successfully in his Urika2 (Opt). This particular #6 high velocity shell is extremely effective with an IC choke on duck as well (i.e. w.r.t range & patterning).\n\n...But this is just my personal opinion; it has lot of variance from individual to individual.[/QUOTE]\n\nThanks nice Detailed Information.', 1, 1, '39.45.248.50', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

Think of them as more of a tool and less of an art work. Same can be said about Baikal’s IZH-27EM-1C (MP-27EM-1C) Over and Under Shotgun. Tough as hell shotgun that never misses a beat except it fell of the ugly tree.\r\n\r\nHowever there is more than meets the eye. For hunting and casual sports/skeet, Baikal IZH-27EM-1C (MP-27EM-1C) offers more than sufficient reliability for a budget oriented gun intended for hard field use. However sports/skeet shooting is a different ball game altogether where a bird lost due to a misfire caused by a light primer strike can not only cost you a game but can seriously hurt your confidence in your firearm. This is where Baikals have been known to make some owners unhappy about the choice of their equipment.\r\n\r\nFew Baikal owners at my skeet club have also experienced of an odd and totally unpredictable light primer strike from the lower barrels of their [B]Baikal IZH-27EM-1C (MP-27EM-1C)[/B] O/U shotguns. The occurrence though very rare usually happens at an extremely critical moment when everything else seems to be perfect. I am sure you can understand the frustration experienced by the shooter at that particular point in time. It adds insult to injury when a shooter starts missing not only due to lack of talent or technique but also owing to firearm malfunction.\r\n\r\nSame thing happened to me as well on more than one occasion and I simply chose to ignore it. Its not like I am aiming for the Olympics or anything so had nothing to lose. However I started noticing a pattern emerging when more than a few Baikal owners started talking about it over tea after retiring for the day from skeet. Almost all of them had similar complaints. Some were blaming diminishing quality control of Baikal firearms whereas others were of the view that the hammers spring are not strong enough to ensure consistent and strong primer strikes.\r\n\r\nI came back home and started doing a little research on this issue. Found out that [B]Baikal IZH-27EM-1C (MP-27EM-1C)[/B] shotgun is loosely based on Browning Superposed Shotgun which was designed by John Moses Browning to be the first affordable (by the average working man if he was willing to save for it) O/U shotgun. Like most Browning designs, Superposed shotguns are very durable and reliable but they are also known for a few light primer strikes here and there.\r\n\r\nAs the rabbit hole got deeper, I learned that in order to keep the commonality of parts (Hammers, Hammer Springs and Spring Guide Rods etc.) Mr. Browning employed a setup of firing pin that places the lower barrel’s firing pin at an awkward angle which results in these occasional light primer strikes.\r\n\r\nAs they say, every problem has a solution. This too has been solved by using a number of modifications. The most recommended modification is an extended firing pin that ensures strong and reliable strike on the primer. I thought why not apply the same to Baikal and see if the problem can be cured. The most important thing here is the knowledge of the material (to make the firing pin out of) and the heat treatment involved to get maximum service life out of that firing pin.\r\n\r\nInstead of using conventional grade of steels in making the firing pin, I decided to go for Tool Steel. My choices were simple:\r\n\r\n1.	O-1 Tool Steel\r\n2.	S-7 Tool Steel\r\n3.	D-3 Tool Steel\r\n\r\nI decided to go with [B]O-1 Tool Steel[/B] due to the ease in machining and heat treatment of the said tool steel. Compared to S-7 and D-3, O-1 is very forgiving. It can attain relatively high levels of hardness along with good level of toughness. On top of that, O-1 can be easily hardened by heating to a dull red and quenching in oil (for firing pins only).\r\n\r\nS-7 and D-3 though better than O-1 are more like “over kill” for the purpose at hand. Lets just say, the juice isn''t worth the squeeze. Somebody might suggest spring steel but I don''t know, Desi terminologies and homeopathic solutions never turn me on. Spring steel is a whole classification of tools steels and without knowing exactly which spring steel one is getting out of a junkyard; one really cannot say anything about its quality.\r\n\r\nAnyways, O-1 is easily available (in annealed or untreated form) at most metal suppliers in the form of round bars of various diameters. I chose 12.7mm diameter tool steel rod even though the firing pin diameter was around 5-6mm.\r\n\r\n[B][I][B]A disclaimer as usual:[/B] The following content is for informational purposes only.

The process is fairly simple with O-1 Tool Steel. Just heat the tips (front and rear) of the firing pins to a dull red (caution: dull red only and not cherry/bright red) and immediately quench in any oil (mineral or vegetable) oil.\r\n\r\nNOTE: heat front tip to dull red and quench in oil then heat the rear tip to dull red and quench in oil. Leave the pin soaking in oil and removed once returned to room temperature.\r\n\r\nHere is an excellent video by the Harry Potter of the gunsmithing world:\r\n\r\n[video=youtube;SGGZXI3b-Vw]http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGGZXI3b-Vw[/video]\r\n\r\nMr. Larry Potterfield refers to the metal as drill rod.

See for yourself:\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i998.photobucket.com/albums/af103/12gauge-pakguns/Baikal%20Firing%20Pin/Pic19.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i998.photobucket.com/albums/af103/12gauge-pakguns/Baikal%20Firing%20Pin/Pic20.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\n[B]For comparison, this is what the old firing pin strikes looked like:[/B]\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i998.photobucket.com/albums/af103/12gauge-pakguns/Baikal%20Firing%20Pin/Pic01.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i998.photobucket.com/albums/af103/12gauge-pakguns/Baikal%20Firing%20Pin/Pic02.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\nOne can certainly improve the performance of their budget shotguns with this fairly easy modification. At times all you need is a slightly longer firing pin to get the most out of your shotgun in the reliability department.

Denovo87 Bhai for working out different solutions to this problem and guiding me accordingly and for knocking some sense in to me and refraining me from making the firing pin longer by 5mm. lols! believe me the temptation was pretty high.\r\n\r\n2. Moeen Bhai for being the "go to guy" in case of a screw up and recommending the right materials for the job.\r\n\r\n3. Shahzad Sb. and Asadullah Sb. for providing me with fabricating and heat treating facility. I am truly thankful of these kind gentlemen who let me take over their routine business for this "annoying" little project. lols!\r\n\r\n4. Amjab Sb. for providing me the desired Tool Steels from Lahore. I cannot truly express my gratitude for the helping hand extended by this fine gentleman in finding the materials and getting them to me on such short notice.\r\n\r\n5.

To check the power and accuracy I selected a 6 inch thick tree at 10 to 12 yards. The bullet hit near to my aim (Slightly Right). But most amazing thing was that it passes all the way through the tree to hit a stone wall at 6 to 8 yards back. The recoil was on the higher side but it can be easily manageable for 6 to 7 rounds at a time. The bang seems louder than other TTs as I was not wearing my eyes and ears. Therefore for some time a continuous tnnnnnnn sound revolves in my ear (hahahahahahaha). It was freezing cold and the gun was jamming. So now I have decided to change it and go for zastava m57.

In my experience the poor strike of the firing pin on the primer wasn''t due to  PIN''S length but:\r\n\r\n     The main culprit was   SHAHEEN''S HARDER PRIMER SURFACE.\r\n\r\n I used different shells like ELEY(PAK) at that time and the longer firing pins made holes in primers of the shells.[/QUOTE]\r\n\r\nSir, I absolutely agree. what I have experienced that Shaheen on two different production runs has used Steel (Yes!) and Brass primers. I suspect, the steel primers are the main culprits here as they require a strong and relatively deep strike to ensure reliable ignition.\r\n\r\nanother thing worth mentioning here is that I have seen many cartridges (new and used) and found that the primer seating depth varies from cartridge to cartridge. if a primer is seated too deep, it can very be a cause for light primer strikes.\r\n\r\nthen there is the thickness of the cartridge rim. I have also seen them vary a lot in Shaheen which can also increase/decrease the distance between the primer face and firing pin. This can also a potentially result in light primer strikes.\r\n\r\nas for longer firing pins making holes in the primers is concerned, a little too long firing pin could have been causing it. that is exactly why I gave exact before and after measurements of the length of the firing pins. whole idea of firing pins longer by just 0.4mm is to ensure deep/strong primer strikes and at the same time eliminating the possibility of punctured primers.\r\n\r\nRegards.', 1, 1, '182.177.68.148', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

Keep up the good work and enjoy safe and happy shooting. now coming to the gun, I think its an interesting firearm and lets not belittle it without giving this design a serious second thought.\r\n\r\nKindly allow me to explain: Gas driven autoloader shotguns usually operate at much lower pressure compared to semi-auto rifles. therefore an Autoloader shotgun''s action and system needs to be much more efficient in utilizing propellant gases as there is not much pressure to rely on. this puts a great deal of emphasis on the design of the piston and action assembly.\r\n\r\nreason for lower pressure: there is not much oomph in a shotgun shell compared to a rifle round. kindly compare the operating pressures of a shotgun shell to rifle rounds.\r\n\r\nNow coming towards Remington 1100, it is known as one of the most reliable gas autoloading shotguns of its time. reliability, fast cycling speeds and simplicity in design are the main features of this legendary shotgun design. It is the best selling autoloading shotgun in U.S. history with over 4 million produced. it was first introduced in 1963 and the production still continues. The model 1100 holds the record for the most shells fired out of an autoloading shotgun without malfunction, cleaning or parts breakage. Now.... you don''t get to be this famous without anything to back up that fame. do you?\r\n\r\nIt became famous because it efficiently harnessed the power of the low pressure gases in reliably cycling the action while maintaining fast cycling speeds.\r\n\r\nmoving on to Saiga which is built on AK platform. a tough as hell and reliable shotgun indeed but it is built on essentially a rifle platform which operates at much higher pressure. to make the shotgun more reliable the designers had to do some serious modifications to the bolt assembly such as a longer bolt. this setup has proved to be reliable but it can still never compete with a "ground up" design such Remington-1100 as far as reliability and fast cycling is concerned. to make matters worst, the Saiga is built on AK dimensions as well. which in my humble opinion are very uncomfortable for a shotgun, be it combat or sports. you see, rifles are aimed using a combination of front and rear sights. therefore the users can tolerate slightly uncomfortable dimensions by forcefully adjusting their bodies to make better use of the sighting setup. whereas shotgun are always pointed. pointing may be less accurate but it is blazing fast compared to aiming. This is why combat shotguns are employed. to quickly engage your targets and ensuring successful hits by delivering multiple projectiles at the target. only downside to pointing is that you need a shotgun which is comfortable to handle and puts your hands and face where they need to be without any conscious effort.\r\n\r\nThe way I see it, this Akdal MKA 1919 has something else to offer over Saiga as well. that is, the M-16 type ergonomics. built on a larger frame that directs recoil straight into the shoulder. those who have used M-16 (and its derivatives) always say that it is one of the sweetest shooting firearms. So... It must be a better configuration compared to Saiga (if not equal).\r\n\r\nBottom Line:\r\n\r\nFrom design and ergonomics, this shotgun has the potential to be in the league of one of the best combat shotguns. only if they could improve on the quality of manufacturing and its furniture.\r\n\r\nRegards.\r\n\r\np.s.

I haven''t fired the Saiga12 so can''t really compare these two. As you mentioned, the 1100 platform is very reliable and so it is proving to be in Akdal. So far I have fired over 200 rounds in this beast without any failure to feed or eject. These also included shaeen #7,8 and 9 skeet loads. Have also fired some 3" Magnum Federal Hollow Point Slugs. Didn''t Have any problem and the accuracy was very good too. The recoil of this is very minimal, even with the 3" Federal slugs. The trigger is also gotten much much better now. As you have mentioned this gun is based on m16 design, so the ergonomics are very good. The gun is berry comfortable to fire and carry. Have also done some skeet shooting with it and will post a video and pics soon. Iam fully satisfied with this gun now and think this is a best buy in this price range.\r\n\r\nP.s about you missing this thread.

All Browning semis are factory supplied with  14-1/4" LOP whereas Beretta semis are in range of 14.5-14.75" length of pull. So think twice about that. Otherwise you would be wasting 275-300K on it. My suggestion would be go for NON-KickOff (non KO) Xplor Unico in 28" barrel. Reason, apart from above point about LOP, is that we do not use 3 inch magnum shotshells here in this part of the world as they r not available and also not applicable. Steel shells are not used here. With lead shells (e.g. Shaheen the most common one here), such high firepower is definitely not required, even of we were shooting large geese here. Lead is a more powerful (denser) material and we do not need to go higher than 34 gms with the usual 70mm (2-3/4") shell here. That KO only softens the recoil (a bit) after you cross say 36 grams load. I would agree with you with using KO if we were talking about 42 grams mini mag cartridges. Now Shaheen is making a 16mm head length shell in 34 grams (not 36 gms) Shaheen Super which earlier was being supplied in 36 gms. 34 gms is more than enough for any game with LEAD cartrg, be it barheaded or greylag geese, mallard or upland game. So my point is: KO is useless and just a FAD I think. The non KO is a more practical gun and looks more elegant and traditional too.\r\n\r\nSo, go for the 6.8 lbs weight Xplor UNICO (28" brl, non KO version) in my opinion OR alternatively a 7 lbs Urika2 Gold (28" brl, Optimachoke)....both are better options than Maxus for our environment here in my opinion.

But it is 6.4 lbs (very very light) with 26" barrel, and about 6.5 lbs or so with 28" barrel (still very very light for waterfowling, though good for upland only). I have fired with a 28" barrel LIGHT model (a friend''s) - it is  muzzle heavy due to lighter receiver. A good  weight balance with a 28" barrel (favorite among shikaris in general and skeet shooters) comes with the UNICO...or...comes with the Light model in 26" brl. Check these out sometime in market:\r\n\r\n1) UNICO 28" non KO ... good balance! (6.8 lbs - v good for both upland & wtrfowl)\r\n2) LIGHT 28" non KO ... muzzle heavy! (6.6 lbs)\r\n3) LIGHT 26" non KO ... good balance! (6.4 lbs - v good for upland only)\r\n\r\nAfter handling and swinging, you would find that either the 1st one is best suited or the 3rd - 6.4 lbs is tooo light for waterfowling whereas a weightier gun gives a much better swing like at skeet shooting and lesser recoil too. Otherwise many times, a lighter gun goes whipping ahead of the ducks (teals etc) as they suddenly swing in front of the blind. For ducks and skeet especially, a smoother swing with a weightier gun is essential for better consistent shotgunning. So an ideal (OVERALL) weight as well as balance has to be determined first too. \r\n\r\nAnother issue which is probably misunderstood or at least not clear to me is that ... the UNICO has that KickOff3 feature whereas LIGHT model does not have that. KO3 is very helpful too to absorb extra vibrations and safeguard against receiver peening with 34-36 grams or higher loads. But that aspect needs to be re-confirmed. I have my doubts whether LIGHT models are equipped with KO3 mechanism. Can anyone re-confirm?', 1, 0, '110.36.200.15', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

Family went upstairs and I started to take care of my car as it got some mud and I had to clean it. Due to the compact parking area and thus lack of maneuvering around the car, I had to keep the main door slightly opened. Well, big mistake/ blunder/negligence etc etc etc.\r\n\r\nSo here was I kneeling around the front tyre of my car when I noticed a guy getting inside the gate. One thing to mention that we have tenants on the ground floor and one of the lady there used to teach inter-level students. So when I saw him, I was just wondering if he was one of her students or some relative. He also had a bag on his shoulder like students have and may be that is why I was kind of confused. I stood up, and 2 more guys followed him inside. Suddenly the 1st guy pulled up his shirt and started pulling a pistol. \r\n\r\nI had my trusted CF-98 on me at 3-4 o clock position, safety off, chamber loaded and hammer down.The shirt was not tucked. Seeing him reaching for his pistol triggered all the alarm bells in my mind and at that time I decided to not to let them get into the residential area of the house where the family was. I quickly pulled my shirt up and started to draw the pistol while moving on my left side. The distance b/w me and the 1st guy was hardly 6-ft. When he saw me going for the pistol, he stretched his arm and fired a shot. I took the hit on the right side of the chest and lost my balance and fell. Laying down, I returned fire at him. All 3 ran out. I had them in my sights so I fired some more shots. As soon as they were out of the vision, I reloaded, ran upstairs and told my wife that I have been shot and lets go to hospital. \r\n\r\nI was so panicked that I was not able to think of anything else other than getting to the hospital as most of the casualties happen here because of blood loss hence my ultimate goal now was to reach for getting medical aid. I went back downstairs, and drove to the nearest clinic. I could feel the wetness of blood on my shirt and also started to feel the pain of gunshot wound. I reached the emergency ward, told the medics that I have been shot. Usually most private clinics and hospitals here do not take such cases because of the legal issues but may be because I was in a stable state,  they inspected me and my wound. It turned out that the bullet struck almost parallel to my body on the right chest, traveled inside around 4-5 inches parallel to the ribs and then exited. I was shot from a distance of a mere 4ft and I had carbon deposits in the entry and exit wounds and other scratches were also there which may be were from the unburnt propellant hitting me or what, I am not really sure about it.\r\n\r\nThey entry wound was quite small but the exit wound was around 1 inch in diameter. The bleeding was not severe as well. This made me quite relaxed but the pain was increased many folds in intensity. My wife meanwhile contacted the ambulance and I was shifted to a proper hospital of the city where they treated me and I was released the very next day.\r\n\r\nI could not possibly tell whether I hit any of them but my cousin told me that there was some blood near the road which ofcourse could not be mine. The police came, took my statement and I registered the FIR against the usual "unknowns" for attempted murder and robbery. \r\n\r\nI am thankful to Allah that I was saved miraculously. The wounds are yet to be healed properly but there is nothing worrisome about them. I recovered the bullet the very next day from the porch, a .30 caliber. The bullet was not deformed at all and could almost be reloaded. \r\n\r\nThe whole incident got us pretty shaky and I am on extra high alert due to the fear of retaliation from them which may or may not ever happen. I hope there are lessons for all of us in this story. \r\n\r\nI would really like to get feedback on this from all of you and will appreciate any critical comments and mistakes that I might have made except the "You should have complied" thing :) because when they are inside the home, I think we should expect the worst specially when we have ladies in the family and act according to it.\r\n\r\nAnd yes, no news from police regarding success in the suspects being caught.\r\n\r\nThanks', 1, 1, '117.20.16.18', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

Family went upstairs and I started to take care of my car as it got some mud and I had to clean it. Due to the compact parking area and thus lack of maneuvering around the car, I had to keep the main door slightly opened. Well, big mistake/ blunder/negligence etc etc etc.\n\nSo here was I kneeling around the front tyre of my car when I noticed a guy getting inside the gate. One thing to mention that we have tenants on the ground floor and one of the lady there used to teach inter-level students. So when I saw him, I was just wondering if he was one of her students or some relative. He also had a bag on his shoulder like students have and may be that is why I was kind of confused. I stood up, and 2 more guys followed him inside. Suddenly the 1st guy pulled up his shirt and started pulling a pistol. \n\nI had my trusted CF-98 on me at 3-4 o clock position, safety off, chamber loaded and hammer down.The shirt was not tucked. Seeing him reaching for his pistol triggered all the alarm bells in my mind and at that time I decided to not to let them get into the residential area of the house where the family was. I quickly pulled my shirt up and started to draw the pistol while moving on my left side. The distance b/w me and the 1st guy was hardly 6-ft. When he saw me going for the pistol, he stretched his arm and fired a shot. I took the hit on the right side of the chest and lost my balance and fell. Laying down, I returned fire at him. All 3 ran out. I had them in my sights so I fired some more shots. As soon as they were out of the vision, I reloaded, ran upstairs and told my wife that I have been shot and lets go to hospital. \n\nI was so panicked that I was not able to think of anything else other than getting to the hospital as most of the casualties happen here because of blood loss hence my ultimate goal now was to reach for getting medical aid. I went back downstairs, and drove to the nearest clinic. I could feel the wetness of blood on my shirt and also started to feel the pain of gunshot wound. I reached the emergency ward, told the medics that I have been shot. Usually most private clinics and hospitals here do not take such cases because of the legal issues but may be because I was in a stable state,  they inspected me and my wound. It turned out that the bullet struck almost parallel to my body on the right chest, traveled inside around 4-5 inches parallel to the ribs and then exited. I was shot from a distance of a mere 4ft and I had carbon deposits in the entry and exit wounds and other scratches were also there which may be were from the unburnt propellant hitting me or what, I am not really sure about it.\n\nThey entry wound was quite small but the exit wound was around 1 inch in diameter. The bleeding was not severe as well. This made me quite relaxed but the pain was increased many folds in intensity. My wife meanwhile contacted the ambulance and I was shifted to a proper hospital of the city where they treated me and I was released the very next day.\n\nI could not possibly tell whether I hit any of them but my cousin told me that there was some blood near the road which ofcourse could not be mine. The police came, took my statement and I registered the FIR against the usual "unknowns" for attempted murder and robbery. \n\nI am thankful to Allah that I was saved miraculously. The wounds are yet to be healed properly but there is nothing worrisome about them. I recovered the bullet the very next day from the porch, a .30 caliber. The bullet was not deformed at all and could almost be reloaded. \n\nThe whole incident got us pretty shaky and I am on extra high alert due to the fear of retaliation from them which may or may not ever happen. I hope there are lessons for all of us in this story. \n\nI would really like to get feedback on this from all of you and will appreciate any critical comments and mistakes that I might have made except the "You should have complied" thing :) because when they are inside the home, I think we should expect the worst specially when we have ladies in the family and act according to it.\n\nAnd yes, no news from police regarding success in the suspects being caught.\n\nThanks[/QUOTE]\n\nMashallah brother. Thank God you are alright.\nYou did the right thing.

There are many factors on how your hub score increases and decreases. Some of these, are simply put, out of your control. However, there are some things that you can do to increase your hubscore, or at least keep more of your hubs higher. Don''t always expect extremely high expectations though, or you will be disappointed. Gaining a author score in the 90s is generally easier than keeping a hub in the 90s. A hubscore works a bit different than author profile score. In this hub, I will go over some of the ways in which a hub will decrease or increase. There are an absolutely a ton of factors involved so don''t go brain dead over all of these. Again, some of these are not in your full control.\n\n\nHubscores always start out low\n\nWhen you create a hub here on hubpages, it will start out at 50 approximately. Sometimes the hubscore will say 49 or 51, but the score is usually 50. This is normal, and no matter how good or bad that hub is, the score will always start at about that. Many new users on here worry that the score is low at the beginning. The hub score will gradually go up to its normal score.\n\n\nTraffic to your hubs\n\nGetting traffic to your hub is the primarily reason why your hubscore is high,medium, low, or whatever the score may currently be. If a hub consistently gets traffic, the score will be pretty decent. The score will be even higher if the traffic is very high every 24 hrs. So how can you attain good traffic to your hub? Well, having a good quality hub that is not spam or copied content. A hub should also have at least 400 words even though 500 would be better(or more). Technically, it really depends on what type of topic your talking about. Staying relevant, and having good keywords on your hub, will also help gain you more traffic, and ultimately raise your overall hubscore.\n\n\nBacklinks\n\nSending backlinks to your hubs is also quite important in many instances. Some hubbers abide by this rule, while others focus on keyword research more. Nonetheless, sending backlinks can help gain more traffic to your hub,thus raising your score eventually. However, I would not recommend buying backlinks. I originally was going to do this, but if you buy them, then you take the chance of getting penalized in Google. There are some hubbers who buy backlinks, but they acquire legit long term ones. Never buy backlinks that seem to cheap. For example, 1000 backlinks for $9.99. Avoid that....or you will be taking a dirt nap from Google!\n\n[url=http://seoamz.com]buy backlinks[/url][/quote]', 1, 0, '210.2.141.19', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

But it is 6.4 lbs (very very light) with 26" barrel, and about 6.5 lbs or so with 28" barrel (still very very light for waterfowling, though good for upland only). I have fired with a 28" barrel LIGHT model (a friend''s) - it is  muzzle heavy due to lighter receiver. A good  weight balance with a 28" barrel (favorite among shikaris in general and skeet shooters) comes with the UNICO...or...comes with the Light model in 26" brl. Check these out sometime in market:\n\n1) UNICO 28" non KO ... good balance! (6.8 lbs - v good for both upland & wtrfowl)\n2) LIGHT 28" non KO ... muzzle heavy! (6.6 lbs)\n3) LIGHT 26" non KO ... good balance! (6.4 lbs - v good for upland only)\n\nAfter handling and swinging, you would find that either the 1st one is best suited or the 3rd - 6.4 lbs is tooo light for waterfowling whereas a weightier gun gives a much better swing like at skeet shooting and lesser recoil too. Otherwise many times, a lighter gun goes whipping ahead of the ducks (teals etc) as they suddenly swing in front of the blind. For ducks and skeet especially, a smoother swing with a weightier gun is essential for better consistent shotgunning. So an ideal (OVERALL) weight as well as balance has to be determined first too. \n\nAnother issue which is probably misunderstood or at least not clear to me is that ... the UNICO has that KickOff3 feature whereas LIGHT model does not have that. KO3 is very helpful too to absorb extra vibrations and safeguard against receiver peening with 34-36 grams or higher loads. But that aspect needs to be re-confirmed. I have my doubts whether LIGHT models are equipped with KO3 mechanism. Can anyone re-confirm?[/QUOTE]\nFrancolino bro you are right and thats why i wrote A400 light 26'' without ko.i have mounted 400 light with 28'' and even 30'' at orient lahore and they feel out of balance.i have 303 28'' but personally prefer my urika 26'' .i use improved cylender for upland modified for ducks improved modified for geese and full choke for wild boar.\n as far as unico goes you have already explained about ko and magnum shells.', 1, 1, '182.187.97.217', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

A truly classic cartridge, the .375 H&H was only the second cartridge ever to feature a belt, now common among magnum rounds. The belt is for headspace as the case has a rather narrow shoulder. It was introduced by the British company Holland & Holland in 1912 as the .375 Belted Rimless Nitro-Express. It initially used cordite propellant which was made in long strands - hence the tapered shape of this cartridge, which was also to ensure smooth chambering and extraction from a rifle''s breech. The .375 H&H is often cited as one of the most useful all-round rifle cartridges, especially where large and dangerous game occurs] With relatively light bullets in the region of 235 to 270 grains (15 to 17 g), it is a flat-shooting, fairly long-range cartridge ideal for use on light to medium game. With heavy bullets of 300 grain (19 g) and greater, it has the punch necessary for large, thick-skinned dangerous game. In many regions with thick-skinned dangerous game animals, the .375 H&H is seen as the sensible minimum acceptable caliber, and in many places (in Africa, primarily) it is now the legal minimum for hunting such game. African game guides, professional hunters, and dangerous game cullers have repeatedly voted the .375 H&H as their clear preference for an all-round caliber, if they could only have one rifle. A similar preference has been expressed by Alaska game guides for brown and polar bear country. Unlike what is seen in most calibers, many .375 H&H rifles also achieve nearly the same point of impact over a wide range of bullet weights at all commonly used distances] further simplifying a professional hunter''s choice in selecting different grain bullets based upon the game hunted, without requiring significant scope or sight adjustments, which further serves to popularize the .375 H&H Magnum among professional hunters (PHs)..375 H&H cartridge specification • Bullet diameter: .375 in (9.55 mm) • Maximum case length: 2.850 in (72.39 mm) • Trim-to length: 2.840 in (72.14 mm) • Maximum cartridge length: 3.600 in (91.44 mm) • Shoulder angle: 15 degrees • Industry maximum pressure: 53,000 CUP (Copper units of pressure) • SAAMI maximum pressure: 62,000 lbf/in² (430 MPa) • Case capacity: 96.3 grains (6.24 g) of water A typical factory load will launch a 270 grain (17 g) spitzer bullet at 2,690 ft/s (820 m/s) with 4,337 ft•lbf. (5880 J) of energy at the muzzle. This load has approximately the same trajectory as the 180-grain (12 g) bullet from a .30-06 Springfield. There are a great number of rifles (and even a few handguns) chambered for the .375 H&H. Many types of actions are used, including single-shots, double-rifles, and bolt actions. When hunting dangerous game, a double-rifle or a controlled-feed bolt action rifle is most commonly recommended, as a quick follow-up shot may be necessary, and reliability of the firearm becomes of paramount importance. The 9.3x64mm Brenneke cartridge is probably the closest European continental ballistic twin of the .375 Holland & Holland Magnum. When compared to the .375 Holland & Holland Magnum the 9.3x64mm Brenneke has a slightly smaller caliber and it is a rimless cartridge. The 9.3 X 64 does not have the time trusted conical cartridge case of the 375 H&H and will never be as reliable in the field. Extraction of the cartridge is vital when faced with dangerous game. A split cylindrical cartridge will jam. For non dangerous game the 9.3 X 64 is a wonderful weapon and as it has a relatively short case it may be used with interchangeable barrels such as the 7.62 X63 ( 30-06 ) or the 7 X 64 brenneke or together with the 7 X 57 Mauser ( 275 Rigby).The belted magnum case The distinctive belted case of this cartridge was patented in Britain on 31 March 1891 by G. Roth of Austria. The first commercial use of the patent was in 1907 for the .375 Holland-Schoenauer cartridge for a Mannlicher-Schoenauer bolt-action rifle marketed by Holland & Holland. The .375 H&H used an improved belted case shared with the .275 H&H Magnum when they were introduced together in August, 1912.[1] This second belted case design was later used with the .300 H&H Magnum, and has been modified as the basis for "Magnum" cartridges developed by other arms manufacturers. Weatherby used the case as the basis for their .257, .270, 7 mm, .300, .340, and .375 Weatherby Magnum cartridges. Norma Projektilfabrik A/S shortened the case as the basis for their .308 and .358 Norma Magnum cartridges.

(249861, 8334, 0, 'primitive', 6470, 'Shotguns Actions and Designs.', 1330158097, 'The early history of true shotguns begins in the 1800s, when people began to use them to hunt birds. During that time, the flintlock firing mechanism was the ignition system of choice and hence, it should be no surprise to know that early shotguns used them. The problem with such mechanisms is that there is a noticeable delay between pulling the trigger and the weapon actually discharging. The Rev. Alexander Forsythe, a Scottish clergyman and an avid hunter, noticed that the local birds would see the flame in the pan and immediately change direction and thereby escape. Hence, he set about inventing the percussion lock, which was the next big development in firearms technology and was also used by other firearms besides shotguns. The percussion lock was eventually replaced by modern cartridges, which we use to this day.\n Shotguns come in both single barrel and double-barrel types. Double-barreled shotguns have two triggers, one to discharge each barrel. Of the double barreled shotguns, there are two types: "side by side" type and "over and under" type. What this means is how the two barrels are positioned. In "side by side" types, the barrels are placed beside one another, whereas "over and under" types have one barrel positioned on top of another.\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]8669[/ATTACH]\n[SIZE=3][U]Side by side\n[/U][/SIZE]\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]8670[/ATTACH]\n[SIZE=3][U]Over and under\n[/U][/SIZE]\n\nDouble barrel shotgun barrels are never attached parallel to each other, but instead set so that their shot will converge at some point (usually at 40 yards distance). In some shotguns, one of the two barrels may be made different from the other. For instance, one may have rifling and the other is smoothbore, or one barrel may be choked for closer shooting. In other cases, both barrels may be made as identical as possible.\nOf all the actions, the break-open action, such as the two images above, is the most common type and has been around for a long time. This is a breech-loading mechanism. It was realized in 1875 that the movement of opening the action could also be used to cock the weapon at the same time. The first such cocking mechanism was pioneered by Anson and Deerley for their hammerless shotgun and it is still used almost unchanged to this day. Break-open actions are the most common type used for shotguns.\n Another action that was invented in the mid 1800s and rare today, is the side-motion action. In this type of action, the barrels are mounted on the edge of a metal disc. A lever in the bottom of the stock rotates this disc, which causes the barrels to move in an eccentric motion, where they can be reloaded.\n[U][ATTACH=CONFIG]8671[/ATTACH]\n[SIZE=3]Side motion action\n[/SIZE][/U]\n\nAnother action that was invented in the 1800s, but is rare now, is the sliding barrel action shotgun. There are only a few manufacturers around that make this type currently and it was never as popular in the 1800s either.\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]8672[/ATTACH][SIZE=3][U]\nsliding barrel action\n[/U][/SIZE]\n\nAnother action that was invented in the 1800s, but is rare now, is the sliding barrel action shotgun. There are only a few manufacturers around that make this type currently and it was never as popular in the 1800s either.\n[U][ATTACH=CONFIG]8673[/ATTACH]\n[SIZE=3]Winchester_Model_1873\n[/SIZE][/U]\n\nThe action that replaced the lever action design is the pump action shotgun design. The first popular ones of this type were the Winchester M1893 and M1897 models, which were designed by John Browning! It must be noted that when Winchester originally asked Browning to design a repeating shotgun in the 1880s, he had argued that a pump-action mechanism shotgun would be the most appropriate design, but Winchester was a lever-action manufacturing company, so they persuaded him to design a lever-action shotgun, which was the M1887 model described above. However, they did later manufacture his pump-action design as the Winchester model M1893, which was later improved to the model M1897. It must be noted that the M1897 shotgun gained so much popularity that it was used by US soldiers in World War I, where it was found very useful for trench fighting. Its quick shooting speed and the fact that the spread of buckshot could hit multiple enemies at once with minimal aiming, made it a very effective weapon for US soldiers to have. In fact, the German troops feared this weapon greatly and the German High Command even attempted to have it outlawed in combat, by citing Geneva convention laws (this coming from the same people that allowed the use of poison gas!). The pump-action shotgun design is still popular to this day.\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]8674[/ATTACH]\n[U][SIZE=3]winchester-pump-action\n[/SIZE]\n[/U]\nThere are also semi-automatic shotguns, where some of the force generated by the firing cartridge is used to eject the old cartridge, cock the action and load a new cartridge. Semi-automatic shotguns use a variety of mechanisms: long recoil action, inertia operated action or gas-operated action. The first successful semi-automatic shotgun was the Auto-5 (or A-5) action first designed in 1898 by (surprise, surprise) John Browning! The Auto-5 model remained in production until 1998!\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]8675[/ATTACH]\n[SIZE=3]Remington Md11 Semioutomatic\n[/SIZE]\nBolt-action shotguns also exist in the wild, though they are not common. One particular model was manufactured in .410 caliber by the Ishapore arsenal of India, based on the Lee-Enfield SMLE Mark III model.\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]8676[/ATTACH][U]\n[SIZE=3]ishapore shotgun bolt action[/SIZE][/U]', 1, 0, '111.88.31.229', 0, 1, 8, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

But  to make sure residents don''t get caught in the crossfire, they only  allow shotguns. There have been few takers. Hunters are wary of getting  arrested by the police, or even worse — getting mistaken for a  terrorist.\n\nThe animals can weigh up to 180 to 220 pounds (80  kilograms to 100 kilograms) and have razor sharp teeth. Adult males come  armed with upward curving tusks. While they scurry off at the site of  humans, they charge when cornered, alarmed or wounded and are a major  cause of traffic accidents in the city.\n\nThe latest chapter of man versus hog played out in a city center police station last week.\n\n"Someone  shouted ''watch your back'' but before I could look round the animal had  hit me," said Sajjad Hussain, who was on duty when the animal slipped in  past the high, razor wire-topped blast walls after guards opened the  gates to let in a car.\n\nHussain had a gash in his stomach that required eight stitches and is on medical leave.\n\nThe  boar was even more unlucky. In his rush to escape, he bounded into a  large pit where police barracks are being constructed. Trapped by high  walls, he was an easy target for officers out to avenge their wounded  colleague. Not quite fish in a barrel, but close.\n\n"The boar was  like a terrorist. We shot him down," said station chief Fayaz Tanooli.  "I have told the guards if another boar gets in then they will be  dismissed."\n\nThe hogs have also encroached upon the lavish, not to mention tightly guarded, houses of the president and prime minister.\n\nA team has been dispatched to lay poison mixed with molasses or maize, said Malik Aulya Khan, the city''s environmental chief.\n\n"We are making special efforts. We have killed many with poison," he said. "Somehow they enter under the fences."\n\nWild  boars are found all over Pakistan, and are one of its major  agricultural pests, gobbling their way though millions of dollars of  wheat and sugarcane crops.\n\nIn Punjab province in the 1980s, the  government initiated a bounty system whereby villagers were paid for  each tail they delivered, but it was discontinued for lack of funds.\n\nIslamabad  was built from scratch in 1951 on scrubland that runs up against the  Margalla Hills, meaning wild boars have always lived in or close to the  city. But their numbers have grown along with the city and its human  inhabitants, now around 800,000 from just 100,000 originally.\n\nThe  meat of wild boar is prized in many countries, but has no value in  Pakistan because its consumption is forbidden under Islam. The country''s  often persecuted and tiny Christian and Hindu populations don''t keep  pigs or eat wild boar either. That has helped ensure the animals thrive.\n\nThe  animal''s abundance has made the country a prime spot for boar hunting,  said Qaiser Khan, who leads hunting parties to Pakistan, including teams  of foreigners who like to shoot hogs. He said that teams must sign a  contract stipulating they will not cook the meat or ask staff to so.\n\nHe  said hunting in Islamabad was unlikely to get many takers because it  was not "worth the hassle" of coordinating with police and city  authorities. Moreover, shooting hogs with a shotgun was dangerous  because the hunter had to be up close, and the weapon risked wounding,  but not killing, the animal, he said.\n\nProfessor Rashid Ahmad Khan  trapped and killed more than 1,700 pigs during three years of research  into the problem in the 1980s. He said that poisoning and hunting were  both unsuitable methods of controlling the population, and instead  advocates removing their habitat.\n\nCutting down brush in which  they hide during the day, fencing off the many streams that crisscross  the city and better management of the trash that spills out of rubbish  bins and around the back of restaurants in the city will help reduce  their numbers, he said.', 1, 0, '124.109.41.210', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

I was really close to buying a local made turkish Clone Shotgun for around Rs 13.5-15K (slightly used) in the next day or two but this morning my cousin told me that he tested my CF98 Clone and told me it was a complete dissappointment. It kept getting jammed and miss-firing etc. So now I have decided not to go for local made weapons any more.\n\n I would like to know how much do the foreign made Semi-Auto hunting Shotguns start from? What make or country? I would be happy to go for something that is not too expensive as I am not a professional hunter at all, infact I will be a beginner, No point in being shy about admitting it, but on my next holiday to Pakistan I am deffinitely intending to go hunting with my buddies inshallah. The gun will be purchased in Peshawar but I assume the foreign-made prices should be more or less the same as any other city. I am not bothered about the odd couple of thousand price difference here and there.\n\nI would appreciate it if somebody could suggest a foreign made semi-auto hunting shotgun (preferabily below 50K) for a beginner Hunter, other than the obvious ones like Baikal MP153 and Baretta etc. I like the traditional Wooden look rather than black/grey plastic or polymer.

The name \n\nof Shah Saddar got tagged onto that hamlet and that village thereafter is called\n\n  &#8220; Lakki Shah Saddar &#8220; . The Golden tomb of Shah Saddar on the left hand of \n\nIndus highway while traveling from karachi to sehwan,  is a land mark . People \n\nwith skin ailments also visit the village of lakki shah Saddar  to bathe  in a \n\nnatural mineral hot spring located 3 KM away from village amid mountains\n\n   Amongst the descendents of Shah Saddar  was Syed Mohammad Baqa Shah \n\nwho was blessed with a son namely &#8220; Muhammad Rashid Shah &#8220; ,  . His \n\ndescendents  are called &#8220; Rashedi Syeds &#8220;and he was the  founder of Pir Pagaro \n\n&#8220;selsela&#8221;and revered as Ist Peer.the word PAGARO in sindhi means PAGG WARO\n\n  or &#8220;The one who has been blessed with PAGG or turban which is one of \n\nprofound  titles showing the great respect to the title holder . Syed Sikandar Ali\n\n Shah , Shah Mardan Shah , the second ,  was the seventh  Pagaro of Khanqah-\n\ne-Rashdia , at Kingri , Pir-jo-goth . His affiliation and kindness to his pets is \n\nevident from the fact that since his demise till this day , his favorite Macaw \n\nparrot is being  fed liquid food through injecting it  in its beak as it has stopped \n\nto eat any thing since Pir  breath his last  in London       \n\n   \n   Only the pets that he has in his home were not the sharers of his blessings and \n\nmercy full treatment , but the diverse wildlife spread over  vast areas in various \n\ndistricts of Sindh lived and thrived for decades being affiliated with his name only .\n  These areas traditionally called  as RAKH or MUHARI . There are other such like \n\nareas or Rakh under other local influential persons as well , but those are \n\nlimited to a very little particular area only and not spread over  in several \n\ndistricts  , and to  hunt secretly  or by bribing the Rakhas is always a possibility \n\nthere, but the animals and birds  in the Rakh or Muhari attributed to Pir Pagaro \n\nwere termed as PEERANA or  &#8220;belonging to Pir&#8221; , thus there was no body to \n\nthere to even think about to fire a gun except Pir Saen himself  and due to lack \n\nof time , Pir didn&#8217;t go there for decades , hence there passed the generations of\n\n excellent game  birds and animals those were unfamiliar with sound of gun shot \n\nin these days where all and sundry possess a licensed or unlicensed weapon and\n\n HURS ( the disciples of Pir Pagaro are called hurs since the times of Syed \n\nAhmed Shaheed  who on his visit to Sindh got hundreds of Mureeds  from \n\nSighatullah Shah  the first ,the second  Pir Pagaro , on the request of Syed \n\nAhmed,  as reinforcement . With those Hurs, Syed Ahmed Shaheed over ran \n\nPeshawar `during 1824-1825.

In fact there are some states which require people to have arms. Actually  u do nt. have to the citizen to purchase arm. There is no license to get any fire arm and arms are cheap.\r\nMany USA Presidents, in the past tried to amend the right but failed. National Rifle Association (NRA) is a powerful private organization of which I am a life tome time member. NRA has over 4 millions paid members and it fights back to protect the right. Among the famous members are: President Bush, late Charlton Hesston, Chuck Yeager and Sara Palin .\r\nNRA slogan is “Guns do not kill, people does”. In Canada, people own more guns than USA and have far less fire arm killing than USA and no one knows why? \r\n	Genesis of this right was when British ruled 13 American established colonies and in 1776 American fought British, dumped Indian tea ship into ocean (Boston Tea Party), boycotted English made products. Has they required fire arm licenses; they could not have won their independence. Actually British tried to Ban fire arm in America but could not enforce this law which helps American gain their freedom.\r\n	Today, it is a big industry to manufacture fire arms, and ammunition. Just walk into to a super store like Wall-Mart and while u r buying food, right along side u can buy rifle, shot Gun or a pistol plus ammunitions much as u like. What is needed is your Driving License but they are many private sales on week ends what we call “Garage Sales” at home. They sell guns too which does nt’ require anything but cash.  \r\nHowever, if you got caught without the hunting license, or poaching game, exceeding your game limit, then u r in a deep shit. The punishment is Five years no hunting,   possible 6 months jail or both.\r\n	In conclusion, if Pakistan government and the people agreed to a such law, it will not only beneficial to the businesses but also government will reap millions by putting tax on arm sales; just like the USA.', 1, 0, '182.177.244.105', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

When a semi-automatic malfunctions, it can be almost always be remediated with the "tap/rack" actions.  Further, the tap/rack can be executed in the time the shooter is tilting the firearm 10 degrees and inspecting the weapon.  While gathering needed information is never a bad thing.  The shooter can gain the same need information by performing the tap/rack.  If the malfunction clears, then the shooter knows the malfunction was either a failure to feed, failure to fire, or failure to eject and the gun is now functioning.  No time was spent learning which malfunction was in place.\r\n\r\nIf the tap/rack does not clear the malfunction, the the shooter will have a failure to extract and must execute the more complicated remedial action requiring the unloading of the gun and reloading the gun (lock, rip, rack-rack-rack, load).  Since the same about of time was spent arriving at the moment where you knew you needed to execute the failure to extract remedial action, no time was lost.\r\n\r\nShould you be unable to execute the Load-Tap/Rack method in the same amount of time it takes you to assess with the 10 degree tilt, you will have "lost" time in only 1 out 4 possible malfunctions.   However, in 3 out of 4 malfunctions you are already ahead of the power curve- the malfunction was cleared and your back in the fight.\r\n\r\nAs was observed, time is a precious commodity in a gun fight.  Wise investment of that time is potentially life savings.  \r\n\r\nThis investment in time is also to be considered in training.  It is easier to learn two methods or remediating a malfunction than three or four.  Learning two methods well may well save your life as opposed to knowing three or more methods less well; under the stress of someone trying to kill you, it will be easier to misdiagnose and it will be easier to "vapor lock" and stand their staring at a gun which is not working as you try to access higher order thinking and recognize both what is wrong and what needs to be done.', 1, 1, '69.154.246.212', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

Having survived and triumpheted life should taste sweeter.\r\n\r\nAlso, now is time for critical assessment of the situation, how you handled it, the results, and is there improvement to be made.\r\n\r\nThough your recounting of the situation was detailed, I may still misunderstand exactly what took place.  If I imagine in my mind''s eye something not quite accurate, forgive my misunderstanding.\r\n\r\nI believe you could have done two things which might have improved the outcome.  This assessment is based on to presumptions, and presumptions are always speculative.\r\n\r\n1- Used cover.  You said you were in the garage and very near a car.  Could not the car have been used for some concealment if not cover.  Though cars are not universally bullet proof, they can be bullet stoppers around the wheels, tires, and engine.  Anything between you and the aggressor''s gun will slow it down, possibly deflect the bullet.  It is always better to find some level of protection instead of standing in the open and drawing against an already drawn gun.  You are going to be hard pressed to get the first shot off as you learned the hardway.  Moving to cover even a bit is still movement and moving targets are harder to hit.  Having changed the situation by moving to cover and drawing your gun, you might have been in a better situation to win out the situation without being shot.\r\n\r\n2- Psychological belief that being shot means falling down.  Bullets don''t carry enough energy when fired from a gun to knock an adult to the ground.  Adults who are shot fall down because the bullet does enough damage to the central nervous system (brain and spine) or the skeletal structure that physically standing is lost (damaged leg bone or hip bones) or they mimick what they see on TV and in movies and fall down.  Pain is a form of pyschological reactions- the brain receives the pain signals and the shooter attempts to retreat from it.  Also, psychological reaction to threat and injury can make a person go to the ground- it lessens the damage of a real fall.  But, they are all a choice (to one degree of another) to fall down unless the body is forced down. Your options in how to responded to the attacker are reduced when you are prone.  It MAY have been better for you to have remainded standing if only for increased mobility.  \r\n\r\nI offer these observations not as criticism, but as an opportunity to learn.  You survived the armed encounter- that is base level or winning a gun fight.  Now we can look back with 20/20 hindsight and ask, "Could I have more decisively won the gun-fight?  Could I have avoided being shot?  Could I have dominated instead of managing a come from behind win?"\r\n\r\nGod bless you and your family.', 1, 1, '69.154.246.212', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

Without going into the constitutional details and ramblings on political philosophy, basically this particular right was enacted for two things: first, to give the People the ability to physically remove a corrupt, oppressive and/or incompetent government using force if the normal democratic procedures and system of checks/balances fail; and second, to ensure that the defence of the State lies solely with the People themselves and that the possibility of a rising Military-Industrial Complex (and it''s subsequent eventual subjugation of the State) is completely removed.\n\nPersonally, I think the idea of having something like the Second Amendment is great and I''m all for it.

But do imagine the other 80% of our brethren out there....the....morons (for lack of a better word so apologies to those who''re offended)... they''re the ones who actually fire off shots to a drum beat after doing well in an election...the ones who go wrong way on a one way street to avoid driving 200 meters and take pride in breaking as many traffic rules as they know...the ones who cut in line at banks and tellers....park in front of hospital gates...\n....\nthe list goes on...My point being, imagine all these people pulling all this crap, but with the comfort of a gun in their possession. It would be my worst "[B]Baandar ke haath mein maachis[/B]" scenario, only.. replace [B][I]maachis[/I][/B] with [B][I]pistaul[/I][/B]. And I honestly do not believe that we have the infrastructure (read police/judiciary) to control this ''sum of all fears''. So until that happens, I''d rather only worry actual BG with guns at a traffic signal instead of having to look over my back for every other idiot with a gun suffering through a bout of road rage.', 1, 1, '139.190.80.205', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

Let me explain the points that you raised and valid as well.\n1- I had 2 cars (both sedans) in my garage. Both cars get parked side by side with and the distance b/w them about 6ft. I was b/w the both cars when cleaning. The 1 on the right had its bumper only mm away from the wall and I was at its left side near front tyres. To use this car as a cover was impossible because they 1st guy was standing near its trunk and the other 2 behind it. I had to be Max Payne to dive on my right over the engine compartment to use this car as cover :D. My porch is such that the left side car goes further in so I was almost parallel to its center and it was not practical to go behind it as it would have taken too much time and would have exposed my back to them as well. So what I did I basically did movement from right side car to the left side and also moved on my axis as well (which caused the round to hit me almost parallel instead of a perfect 90 degree shot). \n\n2- Totally agreed that bullet can''t knock a person down specially a .30 doesn''t carry that much punch. The 2 reason I could think of falling down : 1- I lost my balance when I got hit as I was moving. 2- Since he shot me by fully stretching his arm thus reducing the 6 ft. distance further by 2 ft, the muzzle blast may have got my full attention and caused me to loose balance and fall down. \n\nI hope things are clearer to you a little better than before.

The round itself may not have impact enough to do a "movie-like knock out".\n\nI personally have seen (live) a .32 revolver bullet hitting the left side of the chest, close to the heart, with the hit person standing upright and wondering about the whereabouts of the shot, until blood started peeping out. It was a 45 degree shot and the bullet was later found stuck in the rear deltoids. No casualty.\n\nI also fully agree with OmKhan bro, draw the gun first, ask questions later.\n\n An hour ago, some short circuiting of my intercom line from the gate to main entrance somehow caused the intercom to ring continuously at this hour of the night/morning.

Let me explain the points that you raised and valid as well.\r\n1- I had 2 cars (both sedans) in my garage. Both cars get parked side by side with and the distance b/w them about 6ft. I was b/w the both cars when cleaning. The 1 on the right had its bumper only mm away from the wall and I was at its left side near front tyres. To use this car as a cover was impossible because they 1st guy was standing near its trunk and the other 2 behind it. I had to be Max Payne to dive on my right over the engine compartment to use this car as cover :D. My porch is such that the left side car goes further in so I was almost parallel to its center and it was not practical to go behind it as it would have taken too much time and would have exposed my back to them as well. So what I did I basically did movement from right side car to the left side and also moved on my axis as well (which caused the round to hit me almost parallel instead of a perfect 90 degree shot). \r\n\r\n2- Totally agreed that bullet can''t knock a person down specially a .30 doesn''t carry that much punch. The 2 reason I could think of falling down : 1- I lost my balance when I got hit as I was moving. 2- Since he shot me by fully stretching his arm thus reducing the 6 ft. distance further by 2 ft, the muzzle blast may have got my full attention and caused me to loose balance and fall down. \r\n\r\nI hope things are clearer to you a little better than before. Thanks[/QUOTE]\r\n\r\nThank you very much for explaining, and now it appears that you did all that you could and it was enough.  While we strive for a perfect outcome, we sometimes get only an acceptable outcome.

Believe me usually they don''t. End of the day, It was a job well done and we are glad that you are still around to tell the tale.\r\nOne thing which comes to mind is that due to close proximity, you were saved. Lets keep aside the fact that the bullet did not hit any vital organ, the damage could have been severe had the round traveled some distance before impact. I mean the energy and momentum would have been much more. Skeeter 60''s or Steve''s comments would be invaluable here.\r\n\r\nSee you at the GTG.[/QUOTE]\r\n\r\nTwo things happen to the bullet as soon as it leaves the barrel.  Gravity starts pulling it to the ground and air resistance begins to slow it down.\r\n\r\nPeople sometimes get confused and believe that bullets "rise" when they leave the barrel.  This misunderstanding comes from the fact that the barrel is actually pointed up compared to the sights or scope.\r\n\r\nImage your sights on a perfect line from you to the target 300 ayrds away.  Your rifle is zero''d for 300 yards, meaning that you do not have to aim above or below the target to hit the X, you point the sights right at the X.  You sight-line looks like this red line:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHowever, because gravity pulls the bullet down immediately after it leaves the support of the barrel, your barrel would pointed up compared to that perfect line of sights, like the thick black line:\r\n\r\nA perfectly straight line down the center of the bore would look like the thin black line:\r\n\r\nGravity however is pulling the bullet down as soon as it leaves the barrel.  So the bullet''s path is like the green line:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI exaggerated the difference for ease of viewing.  In reality the rifle bullet has very little drop over 300 yards because is traveling so fast.  A 55grn .223 caliber rifle leaves the barrel at 3280 fps-- the bullet will reach 300 yards (900 feet) in roughly 1/3.64 seconds (0.274 seconds)... at least it would in an airless environment like the moon.\r\n\r\nThe bullet is traveling through a medium- air.  It''s not very dense but it exists.  That same .223 rfile bullet left the barrel at 3280 fps, but by 200 yards, it has slowed to 2304 fps.  Air resistance has slowed the bullet over 900 fps.  It lost 27.4% of it''s speed as it "slogged" through the air.\r\n\r\nA bullet is given speed because of the pressure of the gases building up behind it as the gun-powder burns.  As soon as the bullet leaves the barrel there is no pressure to increase the speed.  The pressure behind it drops to zero and the resistance in front of it (air) remains the same (presume no wind).\r\n\r\nHere is a ballistic trajectory computer:\r\n\r\n[url]http://www.jbmballistics.com/cgi-bin/jbmtraj-5.1.cgi[/url]\r\n\r\nSorry- the images are in reverse order below.', 1, 1, '139.76.224.66', 0, 1, 4, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

When a semi-automatic malfunctions, it can be almost always be remediated with the "tap/rack" actions.  Further, the tap/rack can be executed in the time the shooter is tilting the firearm 10 degrees and inspecting the weapon.  While gathering needed information is never a bad thing.  The shooter can gain the same need information by performing the tap/rack.  If the malfunction clears, then the shooter knows the malfunction was either a failure to feed, failure to fire, or failure to eject and the gun is now functioning.  No time was spent learning which malfunction was in place.\r\n\r\nIf the tap/rack does not clear the malfunction, the the shooter will have a failure to extract and must execute the more complicated remedial action requiring the unloading of the gun and reloading the gun (lock, rip, rack-rack-rack, load).  Since the same about of time was spent arriving at the moment where you knew you needed to execute the failure to extract remedial action, no time was lost.\r\n\r\nShould you be unable to execute the Load-Tap/Rack method in the same amount of time it takes you to assess with the 10 degree tilt, you will have "lost" time in only 1 out 4 possible malfunctions.   However, in 3 out of 4 malfunctions you are already ahead of the power curve- the malfunction was cleared and your back in the fight.\r\n\r\nAs was observed, time is a precious commodity in a gun fight.  Wise investment of that time is potentially life savings.  \r\n\r\nThis investment in time is also to be considered in training.  It is easier to learn two methods or remediating a malfunction than three or four.  Learning two methods well may well save your life as opposed to knowing three or more methods less well; under the stress of someone trying to kill you, it will be easier to misdiagnose and it will be easier to "vapor lock" and stand their staring at a gun which is not working as you try to access higher order thinking and recognize both what is wrong and what needs to be done.[/QUOTE]\r\n \r\nVERY WELL Mr. STEVE.....', 1, 1, '39.48.35.19', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

I am not a novice to shooting, handguns or reloading and have 20+ years of extensive experience with shooting and reloading.\r\n\r\nI have been completely straightforward with FNH (i.e. Browning) so will now wait and see how they respond."', 1, 1, '119.154.78.167', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

I would never recommend reloading the 5.7mm FN for use in pistols. The margin for error on a high-pressure and bottlenecked pistol round is a lot less than on an old "boring" cartridge like the the 9mm Luger. The maximum pressure of the FN 5.7×28mm is 50,040 psi vs. 34,084 psi for the 9mm Luger/Parabellum and 35,000 psi for the .40 S&W.\r\n\r\nShooting Times once published an article about reloading the FN 5.7×28mm (since taken down, maybe for liability reasons). They listed a number of caveats for any would-be reloaders ...\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are a few things to keep in mind:\r\n\r\nUsing reloaded ammunition in PS90 and Five-seveN firearms voids any warranty and any liability of FNH USA. By choosing to reload, you accept full responsibility.\r\n\r\n\r\nBecause of its tiny case capacity, start at the listed minimums and work your way up in 0.1 grain increments.\r\n\r\n\r\nPublished load data varies greatly, so err on the conservative side. The min. and max. loads in the Western Powders manual are significantly higher than those listed in the new Lyman Reloading Handbook 49th Edition, which is what I used.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe 5.7x28 is very sensitive; adhere strictly to the loading data and COL guidelines.\r\n\r\n\r\nStick with flatbase bullets and Small Rifle primers. If you use Small Pistol primers, expect decreased performance.\r\n\r\n\r\nExcessive muzzle blast and flash are to be expected with this cartridge.\r\n\r\n\r\nFN- and Fiocchi-made ammunition both employ military-style, staked-in primers. You must ream the staking residue from the primer pocket before reloading.\r\n\r\n\r\nBeware of hotrodding the 5.7x28. Though the 1:9-inch twist rate of the FNH USA guns might tempt a handloader to load heavy bullets, I highly recommend projectiles of 40 grains or less. Too-high pressures can be a real safety concern with the straight blowback PS90 and the delayed-blowback Five-seveN pistol.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe maximum average pressure (MAP) for the 5.7x28 is 50,040 psi."', 1, 1, '119.154.78.167', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

The more realistic the better.\n\nThat''s kind of a "duh!" moment if you ask me.\n\n\nETA:\n\nThe actual results and comments by the researchers are as follows:\n\n[quote]I. &#8220;Point shooting&#8221; clarification&#8230;Plus: What new gaze pattern findings mean for your training\n\nPart 2 of a 2-part series\n\nEditor&#8217;s Note: In Transmission #134 [10/9/09], Part 1 of this series reported significant new findings from the Force Science Research Center about how an officer&#8217;s &#8220;gaze pattern&#8221; in evaluating a potential assailant affects his or her ability to win a gunfight. The research reveals that &#8220;elite,&#8221; highly experienced officers are better able to quickly and accurately read visual threat cues, focus sooner and longer on where a possible attacker will present a weapon, and draw and fire faster to defeat an assault, compared to less experienced and less successful officers. Part 2 addresses the training implications of this research..\n\nFirst, a clarification&#8230;.\n\nSome readers concluded from Part 1 that the Force Science Research Center &#8220;endorses&#8221; so-called point shooting, where a handgun&#8217;s muzzle is positioned toward the target and the gun is fired without significant reference to the sights.\n\nThat assumption apparently was drawn from one of the important discoveries of the gaze-pattern study, which was conducted in the United Kingdom by Dr. Bill Lewinski, FSRC&#8217;s executive director, and Dr. Joan Vickers, a visual tracking expert at the University of Calgary in Canada.\n\nThe researchers found that just before firing in an armed confrontation rookies tended to look away from their target and search for their sights for reassurance of their aim, thereby, in Lewinski&#8217;s words, &#8220;pulling themselves out of the gunfight at a critical moment and negatively affecting their accuracy, their speed of response, and their awareness of what the suspect was doing.&#8221;\n\nMost of the highly experienced officers in the study, in contrast, concentrated their visual focus on the target/suspect, catching only a fast glimpse of their sights in their peripheral vision and relying primarily on &#8220;an unconscious kinesthetic sense to know that their gun is up and positioned properly.&#8221;\n\n&#8220;This should not be interpreted as sanctioning or promoting any training method in shooting, especially under life-threatening high stress, becomes problematic, and in this which the sights are ignored,&#8221; Lewinski emphasizes. &#8220;It&#8217;s true that point shooting can be effective at short distances and probably is instinctively used by many officers in responding to close encounters. But at greater distances, the accuracy of just pointing and study officers were responding to a lethal threat that was 15-20 feet away.\n\n&#8220;The rookies had successfully completed firearms training that emphasized traditional sight alignment, but they had no actual street experience. The elite officers began their careers with that same training. But at the time of the study, they were members of a specialized SWAT cadre with years of hard-core street experience. They train constantly and consistently win international competitions.\n\n&#8220;Through innumerable repetitions they have developed a highly accurate feel&#8212;a strong kinesthetic sense&#8212;for raising their gun to a proper alignment without consciously thinking about it or making a pronounced visual or attentional shift to it. If you ran a laser beam from their eye to the target, it would shine right through their sights.\n\n&#8220;Careful sight alignment was an important step in starting them toward that point of excellence. Experience and intensive training are ultimately what brought them there. Over a long time, they were able to transition from one emphasis to another. Yet even at their exceptional performance level, referencing the sights in some manner, however fleetingly or peripherally, was still part of their response in the type of rapidly unfolding encounter designed for this study.&#8221;\n\nAs to the training implications of the gaze-pattern study&#8230;.\n\nMore specifics may be known in 1 to 2 years when a new study soon to be launched in England is completed. That research, Lewinski says, will attempt to identify scientifically which teaching methods are most effective for addressing individual student needs and aptitudes so that trainees can more quickly and confidently acquire elite-level use-of-force skills, including firearms performance.\n\n&#8220;That study will explore how to fit teaching styles to the individual learning styles of trainees, how much and what kind of training most rapidly and lastingly influences behavior, how to maximize benefits in restricted teaching time, and so on,&#8221; Lewinski says. &#8220;We will then be able to set standards based on the science of human performance, rather than on tradition, trainer suppositions and preferences, and lawmakers&#8217; dictates, which will be a major breakthrough.&#8221;\n\nMeanwhile, Lewinski says, there are important lessons to be drawn immediately from the gaze study so far as instructors, investigators, and individual officers are concerned.\n\nFor trainers. For those departments that have not yet joined the 21st century, the message is clearer than ever: It is time to move beyond conventional &#8220;qualification&#8221; firearms training.\n\n&#8220;We are not teaching officers to shoot accurately at the speed of a gunfight before they graduate from academy training,&#8221; Lewinski declares. Much more instruction and practice is needed to prepare them to deal with rapidly unfolding, dynamic, high-threat encounters.&#8221;\n\nIn the recent study, he explains, &#8220;the elite officers were able to read danger cues early on and anticipate the suspect&#8217;s actions ahead of time so they could stay ahead of the fight. They knew where a gun was likely to appear and were focused there before it did. So they were able to get protective rounds off sooner than the suspect and sooner than the rookies.\n\n&#8220;That anticipatory skill can only be developed through experience. At the training level, that means extensive experience with dynamic force-on-force encounters and realistic simulations in which you learn by &#8216;being there&#8217; over and over again in a wide variety of encounters what to expect and how to look for and recognize danger cues.&#8221;\n\nAt the same time, repetitive exposure to weapon manipulation at gunfight speed is critical. &#8220;There needs to be a much better level of pure shooting skill developed than most departments teach at this point,&#8221; Lewinski says. &#8220;A gun is a tool, and officers need to be so practiced with it that the mechanics of using it become automatic and unconscious. That frees up more time and attention for decision-making and for concentration on the adversary&#8217;s behavior.&#8221;\n\nIn the study, for instance, the superior mechanical skill and anticipation of danger exhibited by the elite officers allowed them to expend more time and stronger concentration on the suspect&#8217;s shooting hand when he spun toward them in the encounter. As a result, they scored significantly better at correctly identifying a cell phone vs. a gun in his hand and tailoring their responses accordingly than did the novice officers.\n\nTraining to a gunfight level may well require more time and money than is currently allotted, Lewinski concedes. But departments should ask themselves a tough question, he says: &#8220;What level of liability are you willing to accept with your training?&#8221; And they must acknowledge that &#8220;meeting some current state qualification standard does not in itself mean that officers are going to be successful on the street and make great decisions and deliver great performance when the chips are down and lives are on the line. Any department owes nothing less than the best training for its officers.&#8221;\n\nFor investigators. The sophisticated eye-tracking device used in the study revealed an important finding for investigators. As the testing scenario unfolded, the visual field of expert shooters and rookies alike narrowed significantly. At the moment of firing, the elites tended to have full concentration on the suspect&#8217;s weapon. Many of the novices, because they were searching for their sights, did not even see the suspect himself when they pulled the trigger.\n\n&#8220;What is not given attention cannot be remembered,&#8221; Lewinski says, &#8220;and investigators need to stay conscious of this. There may be much about the gunfight environment, including details about the suspect&#8217;s behavior, that an involved officer simply cannot remember because it didn&#8217;t register on his narrowly focused brain. And that should not be equated with his being evasive or deceptive.\n\n&#8220;The more an investigator pushes an officer to elicit facts that the officer doesn&#8217;t know, the more likely the officer will &#8216;guesstimate&#8217; in an effort to satisfy the questioner and the higher the probability of error and inconsistency.\n\n&#8220;Investigators should probe with their questioning only to the extent that officers are comfortable in responding. Their being unable to remember everything should not diminish their credibility in any way.&#8221;\n\nFor officers. &#8220;So far as line officers are concerned, the study presents a challenge of personal commitment,&#8221; Lewinski says. &#8220;What the study proves is pretty straightforward: Your success in an armed confrontation is likely to be determined by your training and experience.\n\n&#8220;Is the training provided by your department sufficient to convince you that you can perform accurately at the speed of a gunfight when your life depends on it?\n\n&#8220;If not, what are you doing on your own to bridge that gap?&#8221;[/quote]', 1, 1, '69.154.246.212', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

An effective gaze control strategy can help officers minimize or defeat the action/reaction advantage that the suspect might otherwise have.\n\n&#8220;In short, an officer&#8217;s performance can be impaired or enhanced by where his eyes and attention are focused in the midst of a deadly encounter.&#8221;\n\nWhat the new study discovered about that phenomenon, Lewinski says, could have significant repercussions on law enforcement firearms training.\n\nThe study was conducted by Lewinski and Dr. Joan Vickers of Canada&#8217;s University of Calgary, a renowned researcher of the relationship between eye movement and athletic performance. They recently presented the first detailed report of their findings at the prestigious International Conference on Spatial Cognition in Rome.\n\nTheir full paper, &#8220;Gaze Control and Shooting Performance of Elite and Rookie Police Officers During a Force-on-Force Encounter,&#8221; will be posted on the Force Science website once it has been published in an academic journal. Meanwhile, FSN&#8217;s two-part series is the first disclosure to the international law enforcement community about the study&#8217;s surprising practical discoveries.\n\nFORCE-ON-FORCE SET-UP \nField work for the research was conducted a year ago in the United Kingdom with the help of 24 police volunteers. Eleven were highly experienced, male veterans of an Emergency Response Team (ERT), seasoned in fighting terrorists among other assignments, with a median age of nearly 39. The rest were younger rookies (median age just over 30), seven of them female, who had completed their pre-service firearms and simulation training and were considered &#8220;ready for the street.&#8221; Both groups predominately were right-eye shooters.\n\nThe research scenario, designed by Lewinski, was based on an actual incident. One at a time the volunteers were armed with a holstered Glock pistol fitted to fire a single Simunition cartridge and told they were on duty to &#8220;provide security&#8221; at an embassy office where intelligence had indicated an armed encounter would occur that day.\n\nAbout 20 feet in front of the officer being tested was a receptionist at a desk. Presently an adult male, playing the role of a civilian tourist, entered the room and engaged the receptionist in conversation regarding a problem with his passport, keeping his back to the subject officer.\n\nInitially the exchange was polite but as the receptionist proved not to be helpful the man became increasingly agitated. About three seconds before the end of the one-minute scenario, his voice started to rise and he began cursing and slapping the table. Suddenly, in an explosion of rage, he yanked an object from under his coat and pivoted quickly.\n\nIn most instances, the object was a handgun and he fired at the officer. But randomly he spun around only with a cell phone. The volunteers were not advised in advance of this &#8220;catch&#8221; switch. They were told only that they should &#8220;handle the threat&#8221; appropriately, using their handgun.\n\n&#8220;The suspect&#8217;s dynamic turning and shooting unfolded very rapidly,&#8221; Lewinski says, &#8220;and presented quite a challenge for any officer. We wanted to detect the clearest demonstration of operational differences, and that&#8217;s why groups of the best and the least experienced officers were chosen.&#8221;\n\nEach volunteer went through the scenario seven times. According to the researchers, no significant change was noticed in their reactions with repetition.\n\nSOPHISTICATED MONITORING \nDuring the scenario, each officer wore a light-weight, head-mounted apparatus with two sophisticated and highly sensitive computer-interactive components: 1) a small video camera that filmed the scene being played out in front of the officer from the officer&#8217;s perspective, and 2) a mobile monocular &#8220;eye tracker&#8221; that used reflection off of the officer&#8217;s cornea to precisely document his line of sight.\n\nJust where the officer&#8217;s gaze was directed at any given split-second was overlaid on the digital image the camera was recording, in the form of a small red circle. In other words, exactly where the officer was looking, when he was looking there, in what sequence, and for how long were all captured in a continuous, time-coded format that allowed every location of his gaze to be noted and analyzed later.\n\nA separate video camera was placed in the room to photograph each officer frontally from head to toe as he experienced and reacted to the role-playing. These images were later synced with those from the headgear. (The data collection system, developed by Vickers, is called the vision-in-action method. Samples of the recordings will be posted on the Force Science website when the academic paper is posted. For more information, see Vickers&#8217; book, Perception, Cognition and Decision Training: The Quiet Eye in Action.)\n\nKeeping the scenario consistent across all officers, of course, was critical for comparison purposes. So the receptionist (played by FSRC executive Patricia Thiem) and the suspect (played by Lt. Lee Edwards of the Minneapolis PD) worked extensively with an acting coach, who trained them to maintain the same timing and mannerisms across repeated performances.\n\nThe field recordings took two full weeks to complete; the subsequent analysis took months. Here are the most significant findings:\n\nSHOOTING PERFORMANCE \nThe ERT officers &#8212; considered the elite shooters in the study &#8212; strongly out-performed the rookies.\n\n\n&#8226;  First of all, the ERT spent significantly less time assessing the situation before drawing their gun. On whole, they drew &#8220;well before the assailant began his pivot,&#8221; Vickers reports. Most drew early and &#8220;held [their gun] at chest level before aiming.&#8221; The rookies tended to delay drawing until about a second after his turn.\n\n\n&#8226;  The ERT shot before the assailant got his round off 92.5 percent of the time, beating him by an average of nearly 180 milliseconds (ms). The rookies shot first only about 42 percent of the time and on average lagged behind the attacker by more than 13 ms. Responding &#8220;very poorly,&#8221; the study says, the rookies essentially &#8220;reacted to his attack, rather than being ahead of him as were the ERT during every phase of the encounter.&#8221;\n\n\n&#8226;  The ERT hit the assailant nearly 75 percent of the time, compared to about 54 percent &#8212; &#8221;slightly more than chance&#8221; &#8212; for the recently trained rookies. ERT hits were in the upper torso (center mass) 62 percent of the time, versus about 48 percent for the rookies.\n\n\n&#8226;  In more than 60 percent of their trials, rookies fired when the assailant brandished a cell phone instead of a gun, compared to only about 18 percent for the ERT.\n\n\nGAZE PATTERNS \nAnyone would expect highly experienced elites to shoot better than rank novices, but what&#8217;s impressive is the relationship that gaze and focus appeared to have to performance.\n\nAs part of their meticulous analysis of where the test subjects were looking during the last critical seven seconds of the scenario, the researchers tabulated two important factors: fixations (when an officer&#8217;s gaze was stable on an object or location within a three-degree visual angle for 100 ms or longer) and saccades (when the eyes moved rapidly from one fixed location to another for at least 66.66 ms).\n\nAmong their discoveries, these are considered most meaningful: \n&#8226; The ERT officers tended to use fixations of only short duration early in the encounter, during their initial assessment and as the suspect began to pivot toward them. Then they used longer-duration fixations as they aimed and fired. &#8220;They needed less time to &#8216;read&#8217; critical cues&#8221; and acquire external feedback information that &#8220;allowed them to prepare their shooting movements in advance and prevail over the assailant,&#8221; the researchers explain. Thus the ERT &#8220;were ahead of the assailant in terms of their motor phases and gaze control across all phases of the encounter.&#8221; \n&#8226; &#8220;The rookies used an opposite strategy and had long-duration fixations at the outset and shorter durations as they aimed and fired.&#8221; In effect, &#8220;the rookies were behind&#8221; the suspect&#8217;s actions and were &#8220;caught by surprise.&#8221; They &#8220;used a reactive strategy where they acquired information at the last moment, which was inadequate both in terms of its content and timing for the extreme demands of the encounter.&#8221; \n&#8226; &#8220;The ERT had a higher frequency of fixations than the rookies in all phases [of the scenario] except the aim/fire phase, when the ERT had fewer fixations to fewer locations than the rookies, indicative of greater focus and concentration as they aimed and fired.&#8221; \n&#8226; The ERT increasingly directed their attention to the suspect&#8217;s gun hand/arm as the scenario evolved. &#8220;They increased the percent of fixations to this location from 21 percent in the assessment and early pivot phases to 71 percent during the final two seconds. On hits, the ERT directed 86 percent of their final fixations to this one location, revealing a remarkable degree of focus and concentration under fire.&#8221; And, the study explains, they had time for a final, undisturbed period of super-concentration that Vicker&#8217;s calls &#8220;the quiet eye,&#8221; which has been linked with high performance across many different genres of athletics. In this, their eye remained settled on a defined target location through trigger pull. \n&#8226; &#8220;The rookies did not show the same funneling of their attention to the assailant&#8217;s gun hand/arm,&#8221; the study points out. Early on, similar to the ERT, they concentrated a minority of their fixations there. But at the time the suspect aimed and fired, only 33 percent of the rookies&#8217; fixations were directed there, a modest and inadequate increase. And whatever quiet-eye time they exhibited was significantly lower.\n\nTELL-TALE SACCADE \nPerhaps most startling, the officers&#8217; last abrupt shift of gaze before firing was found to be radically different between the two groups.\n\nThe rookie&#8217;s final saccade, especially among those who missed when they fired, &#8220;occurred at the same time they tried to fixate the target and aim,&#8221; the study reveals. At that critical moment in the last 500 ms, the rookies in a staggering 82 percent of their tests took their eyes off the assailant and attempted to look at their own gun, trying to find or confirm sight alignment as they aimed. &#8220;This pulled them out of the gunfight for what turned out to be a significant period of time,&#8221; Lewinski says. Vickers adds: &#8220;On a high percentage of their shots, the rookies did not see the assailant as they fired,&#8221; contributing to inaccurate shooting and the misjudgment of the cell phone as a threat.\n\nAbout 30 percent of the ERT also looked at their gun, but their timing was different. Most of those gaze-shifts occurred before the officers aimed, &#8220;followed by the onset of their aim and fixation on the target and firing.&#8221;\n\nFLAWED TRAINING? \nThe researchers pose the possibility that the rookies&#8217; training may have contributed to their poor performance. They were taught pistolcraft &#8220;similar to how most police officers first learn to shoot a handgun: to focus first on the rear sight, then on the front sight, and finally on the target, aligning all three before pulling the trigger.&#8221;\n\n&#8220;This is a very time-consuming process and one that was not successful in this study,&#8221; Vickers says.\n\nSomewhere across their training, practice, and experience, the successful ERT officers had learned what essentially is a reverse process: Their immediate and predominate focus is on the weapon carried by their attacker. With their gaze concentrated there, they bring their gun up to their line of sight and catch their sights only in their peripheral vision, a subtle &#8220;sight glimpse,&#8221; as Lewinski terms it. &#8220;They have an unconscious kinesthetic sense to know that their gun is up and positioned properly,&#8221; he says. &#8220;This is a focus strategy that Olympic shooters use,&#8221; says Vickers, &#8220;and it is simpler, faster, and more effective.&#8221;\n\nAs the assailant&#8217;s actual attack got underway, the elite officers were zeroed in on a &#8220;weapons focus.&#8221; That is, the ERT officers&#8217; &#8220;fixations were not directed to the assailant&#8217;s centre of mass as he pivoted and fired, but to the weapon itself, which he held away from his body until the moment he fired. The ERT tracked the weapon as soon as it was visible, using a series of fixations. Because he was moving rapidly, it was only during the last few milliseconds that his centre mass presented a viable target.&#8221;\n\n&#8220;This intense attentiveness to the weapon can have memory implications later on,&#8221; Lewinski explains. &#8220;Now we have an empirical study showing why an officer who survives a gunfight may be unable to identify a perpetrator&#8217;s face or recall other important details proximate to the shooting, such as the body position or turning action of the subject.&#8221;\n\nNow that the study has documented important ways in which expert shooters behave, how can trainers best convey these elite skills to other officers? &#8220;FSRC plans to do more work with Dr. Vickers to identify answers to that question,&#8221; Lewinski says. &#8220;But already, these findings suggest some important changes that will point us in the right direction.&#8221;[/quote]', 1, 1, '69.154.246.212', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

Loading the musket and the cannon was difficult and to make duck and bird hunting an easier, people used several smaller balls instead of one. They used one large ball for deer, 3 medium sized balls for smaller game, and several tiny balls for ducks and birds. To hunt birds and ducks at longer ranges Fowler was created, it was a shot weapon that was lighter than a musket, but had very long barrels. The barrel of a Fowler could easily be 6ft long. Soon after the Fowler was created, people figured out that a shorter barrel would make the shot scatter sooner and would be more deadly. The Blunderbuss was born. The  Blunderbuss was a short version of the fowler, with the barrel being as short as 9 inches. Eventually, the Blunderbuss and the Fowler were called shotguns due to the type of ammunition they shot.The double barrel shotgun was created for people to have a chance to make 2 shots before they had to reload again. Years later a man named Lenderhaux created the break-open shotgun. He had to make a new way to load it, so he also created self contained cartridges with a pin that protruded out of it that would get hit by the hammer and explode the charge. Browning invented a 6-shot lever-action shotgun which combined the best features of a lever action rifle and a shotgun. Soon after that, Browning also created the ever-popular pump-action shotgun.Most people had shotguns because few people could afford more than one weapon and the best choice was a shotgun.

Loading the musket and the cannon was difficult and to make duck and bird hunting an easier, people used several smaller balls instead of one. They used one large ball for deer, 3 medium sized balls for smaller game, and several tiny balls for ducks and birds. To hunt birds and ducks at longer ranges Fowler was created, it was a shot weapon that was lighter than a musket, but had very long barrels. The barrel of a Fowler could easily be 6ft long. Soon after the Fowler was created, people figured out that a shorter barrel would make the shot scatter sooner and would be more deadly. The Blunderbuss was born. The  Blunderbuss was a short version of the fowler, with the barrel being as short as 9 inches. Eventually, the Blunderbuss and the Fowler were called shotguns due to the type of ammunition they shot.The double barrel shotgun was created for people to have a chance to make 2 shots before they had to reload again. Years later a man named Lenderhaux created the break-open shotgun. He had to make a new way to load it, so he also created self contained cartridges with a pin that protruded out of it that would get hit by the hammer and explode the charge. Browning invented a 6-shot lever-action shotgun which combined the best features of a lever action rifle and a shotgun. Soon after that, Browning also created the ever-popular pump-action shotgun.Most people had shotguns because few people could afford more than one weapon and the best choice was a shotgun. It was good for protection and hunting. It was also easier to clean, maintain, and repair due to the fact that it was simpler than a rifle.The old rule for gun buying still applies today: "If you can only buy one gun, get a  shotgun."[/QUOTE]\nthanks durrani sb for nice informations :)', 1, 0, '111.88.49.6', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

Quaid accepted,  and, perhaps , appeared before the court for 3 or 4 hearings , but these  hearings were enough for Quaid to feel, from the nature of proceedings,   that , the case was fabricated and the presiding officer was per-determined  to condemn his client , who mostly  didnt have or  occasionally have   a very restricted approach to his lawyer ( the Quaid ). Due to this reason , Quaid , under protest , withdrew his advocacy with  an observation of the decision being a pre-determined one.   The future  proved the fore-sightedness of quaid to be correct as colonial rulers  executed Pir Sibghatullah Shah , Pir Pagaro  the 6th , on  20 march 1943  , at the age of 34 years only . instead of returning the body of slain freedom  fighter to his heirs, it was buried to some unknown place which is  still not known to any one . Pir was executed as during his days, the  HUR movement to seek an independent homeland for Muslims intensified and  reached its peek. In total , hurs fought 108 years against colonial  forces continuously.\n i have a rare copy of a book namely " saints of  Sindh ,written by  an esteemed English historian " Peter Mayne " , an  authority on the issues of the subcontinent of those days. Let me quote a  paragraph out of it and it would , at least , provide u  an insight as to  what the colonial forces think about Pir Pagaro the 6th\n\n  [I]"The  HUrs were watching the boy to grow too..with a passionate ,greedy  devotion , for here, surely , at last was their lord.Young as yet ,but  filled with the most resplendent promise..... and they worshiped him when  he loved them or dishonoured them , killed them or ordered them to kill  others, for this was the golden age and this the true lord......  Sibghatullah was growing into a large man, black bearded , handsome ,  with eyes calm as planets. He had suffered from small p0ox in his  childhood and the disease had left his skin pitted with the scars of it .  But already he had majesty of presence that was commended upon , even  by those who claimed to be unafraid . He had an agile mind and , unlike  his fore bearers, he gloried in his pirhood , he was the lord. Let those  ridiculous viceroys , governors , collectors and district magistrates  and superintendents of police , pore over their files and shake their  heads . His world was with his own to do with as he pleased "  \n\n[/I]2)  During the wars of 1965 and 1971 , Hurs fought shoulder to shoulder  with Pak Army and not only defended the borders of our Motherland but  penetrated deep inside enemy territory and captured vast areas and many  Hurs were recipients of military medals over their gallantry', 1, 0, '182.179.101.243', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

People usually mix up grains Vs grams and high powder Vs Grams thing. \r\n\r\nHigh gram loads like 34 gms and 36 gms Shaheen here called Super and Excel respectively have more pellet count and also longer head length called high brass loads (e.g. 12mm or 16mm in case of Super and Excel if I am not wrong instead of regular 8mm head length regular Shaheen load). This is also a confusion generally. It is very good you cleared the misconception. Kindly throw some light on what is a high brass load too like for instance 34 grams Shaheen Super cartrg or 36 grams Shaheen Excel cartrg VERSUS Shaheen regular 32 gms cartrg.... e.g. 34 gms Super Shaheen has longer head length (high brass). Does it mean more propellent when we say ''high brass''?...and, how much more propellent are we talking about approximately in a Shaheen Super with say 16mm head length VERSUS Shaheen Regular 8mm head length?? All high velocity loads (which I perceive as ''high brass'' loads) kick much more than the regular brass 8mm loads in any gms. It has to be due to the velocity which is depending on propellent (gun powder) of course... isn''t it. I was using a 28 gms, 16mm head length Cyprus made load in 8# pellet size (Victory''s Sonic V1, actually made for sporting clays by Coy) last season on ducks which not only kicked like anything, it performed at ranges beyond my imagination at medium sized ducks, though its a meagre 28 gms #8 load.\r\n\r\nBTW, how is your skeet shooting and duck (backmigration) hunting going?

How ever relevant to the 5.7 FN I will submit some more information. \nAll pistols firing high pressure rounds  are designed to fire from a Locked Breach, it means the Bolt or the Breach/Slide remains Locked with the barrel till the Bullet leaves the Muzzle and the pressure begins to drop rapidly; once it has dropped sufficiently the Slide  is un locked and free to move backwards extracting the fired case, ejecting it and completing the Cocking ,Feeding and Locking Cycles.\nMost Pistols are Recoil Operated.\nIn the recoil Operated weapons, the barrel and slide  move back  to gather a small distance  after  firing due to recoil imparted by the exiting bullet; this leads to Unlocking of the slide and barrel when the bullet has left the barrel, the gas pressure drops and  Obturation of the fired case is released. The slide continues to move back due to remaining gas pressure  and completes the Cycle.\nAll auto matic weapons are designed in a way that unless the Slide or Bolt and barrel are completely locked the Firing pin is out of alignment and cannot be struck by the hammer, also the the trigger does not operate unless the breach is Locked.\nThe FN 5.7 is operated by the DELAYED BLOW BACK system of Operation.\nIt is a very safe and tried method and some thing has to be very seriously wrong to cause it, some thing like a protruding primer, or a broken sear or some thing.\nThe H&K P7, P14 and the MP 5, the Rifle G3 all operate on the ingenious Gas system based on DELAYED BLOW BACK.\nNow based on my personnel experience in Handloading and firing auto matic weapons of the Delayed Blow Back variety for decades, I know one thing.  Cases must not be reloaded which have been fired in this system of operation as the case gets a hell of a lot of punishement as the gas pressure is still high when it is ejected.', 1, 1, '58.27.154.183', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

I would consider a CZ series due to its manual safety and other factors despite of the fact that i Love polymer frame pistol. \n[B]Whats your expert opinion about it? do you consider "Trigger safety" a real safety? secondly do you prefer Trigger safety over manual safety?[/B][/QUOTE]\n\n\n[B]@pakigunner..[/B].........Lolz!\n\nYou should have asked me, you wouldn''t have needed to check all those reviews, lolz!\n\nAnyhow, to come to your point, the trigger safety in safe-action handguns only helps preventing the [I]immediate danger of accidental discharge[/I], when holding the gun with a finger over it''s trigger, since it requires the 2 halves of the trigger to be pressed simultaneously for a shot. \n\nA manual safety is more secure course.\n\nBut let me just state one very important point here with respect to safeties and their use/usefulness, the way that I personally view these things. You may/may not agree, whatsoever:\n\n1) [COLOR=#ff0000][B]You don''t really need any safeties if you don''t carry loaded chamber.[/B][/COLOR] [B][COLOR=#0000cd]Actual purpose of Safeties only comes into play, when it is that you have a habit of carrying a loaded/chambered handgun.[/COLOR][/B] \n\nOtherwise, what''s the danger, since you course first have to rack up your gun, don''t you?\n\nOr is it, that one would rack up the gun in case of dire emergency, and then turn the safety on before disengaging it just prior to the shot? Lolz! [B]NO[/B].\n\n[B][COLOR=#0000cd][I]Hence, I''m of the firm opinion, that we consider safeties only important as a measure against unwanted fingers on our handguns, not our own![/I][/COLOR][/B]\n\nIf we leave a loaded handgun unattended and with even manual safety on, we cannot rule out that any other person''s fiddling fingers cannot cause an accidental discharge, can we?\n\nSo, if you can take care of your weapons and prevent access to them, I really do not consider manual safeties any important thing to have on a handgun. When I''ll use the handgun myself, I''d just squeeze the trigger if my handgun is chambered and not have to remember to disengage a silly extra lever. In the heat of the moment, there''s either no time for this, or it is even forgotten to be disengaged! \n\n[B][COLOR=#0000cd][I]And if I do not carry chambered, I really don''t need any safety, do I? What will it protect if the handgun isn''t chambered? Lolz![/I][/COLOR][/B]\n\nWith this respect, I''d say, even Safe Action trigger safeties are enough. Especially if you don''t carry chambered. It requires however, that you''re proficient with handling handguns, if in the habit of carrying chambered. Nothing is idiot-proof, IMHO, when it comes to weapons.\n\n[COLOR=#ff0000][B]The prerequisite for above stance is, however, that you are proficient with weapons and your gun is "no-go"/restricted area to any others[/B][/COLOR]!\n\nElse, I really don''t think any safety in the world can prevent the un-desirable, can it?\n\n\nI hope I managed passing on my views in understandable manner.\n\n\n\nRegards.', 1, 1, '182.177.101.73', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

You may/may not agree, whatsoever:\n\n1) [COLOR=#ff0000][B]You don''t really need any safeties if you don''t carry loaded chamber.[/B][/COLOR] [B][COLOR=#0000cd]Actual purpose of Safeties only comes into play, when it is that you have a habit of carrying a loaded/chambered handgun.[/COLOR][/B] \n\nOtherwise, what''s the danger, since you course first have to rack up your gun, don''t you?\n\nOr is it, that one would rack up the gun in case of dire emergency, and then turn the safety on before disengaging it just prior to the shot? Lolz! [B]NO[/B].\n\n[B][COLOR=#0000cd][I]Hence, I''m of the firm opinion, that we consider safeties only important as a measure against unwanted fingers on our handguns, not our own![/I][/COLOR][/B]\n\nIf we leave a loaded handgun unattended and with even manual safety on, we cannot rule out that any other person''s fiddling fingers cannot cause an accidental discharge, can we?\n\nSo, if you can take care of your weapons and prevent access to them, I really do not consider manual safeties any important thing to have on a handgun. When I''ll use the handgun myself, I''d just squeeze the trigger if my handgun is chambered and not have to remember to disengage a silly extra lever. In the heat of the moment, there''s either no time for this, or it is even forgotten to be disengaged! \n\n[B][COLOR=#0000cd][I]And if I do not carry chambered, I really don''t need any safety, do I? What will it protect if the handgun isn''t chambered? Lolz![/I][/COLOR][/B]\n\nWith this respect, I''d say, even Safe Action trigger safeties are enough. Especially if you don''t carry chambered. It requires however, that you''re proficient with handling handguns, if in the habit of carrying chambered. Nothing is idiot-proof, IMHO, when it comes to weapons.\n\n[COLOR=#ff0000][B]The prerequisite for above stance is, however, that you are proficient with weapons and your gun is "no-go"/restricted area to any others[/B][/COLOR]!\n\nElse, I really don''t think any safety in the world can prevent the un-desirable, can it?\n\n\nI hope I managed passing on my views in understandable manner.\n\n\n\nRegards.[/QUOTE]\n\nWithout getting into ''what is better'' debate let me continue on safe action thing.\n\nSafe action is a [B][I]MULE[/I][/B]  i.e [I]cross breed[/I] between single n double action ;) \n\na) Double action:  you have to pull the trigger to bring hammer (or striker pin) all the way back to hammer it on primmer & you dont need to do anything except pulling the trigger but trigger pull is heavier than single action.\n\nb) Single action: you have to make striker pin ready to drop at primer by yourself (either by locking the hammer back or racking the slide to do this action for you); your trigger pull will just be used to disconnect the hammer/striker pin thus quite lighter than the double action.\n\nc) Safe action: Here you have to rack the slide which takes striker pin half way (half of the single action job) then pull the trigger to take striker pin remaining half distance back & drop it on the primer; this make trigger pull bit mushy. This action is specifically designed for hammerless pistols except Daewoo pistol which is single acion/double action/1.5 action ;)\n\nNow safeties in most of the safe action pistols, these pistols have group of different safeties working simultaneously; \n\na) Half cocked striker pin: this thing is a safety in itself as dropping pin from this distance will not have enough power to ignite the primer; if by any chance (which are one in millionsss in safe action pistols) striker pin gets free deceiving all the other safeties.\n\nb) Trigger safety: This safety make sure that trigger doesn''t actuate anything attached to it without this safety lever (popping right from the middle of trigger lever) is depressed while pulling the trigger with full finger pad on it, this safety make sure your chambered gun doesn''t go off unintentionally while holstering/unholstering the gun or in case the gun is dropped and trigger lever hits something.\n\nc) Firing pin safety: I would call it [I][B]''heart n soul of modern pistol safeties''[/B][/I] ; it actually is an obstruction in the way of striker pin that obstruct [B](positively)[/B] firing pin to move forward unless trigger is pulled; it basically is a small round piece of metal sitting in the slide tensioned by a small spring, upper part of this piece sits right in a cut made in firing pin (striker pin) while its cocked. This safety is depressed by a lever (connected with trigger) when trigger is fully pulled giving way the pin to move forward with the force of striker spring or hammer. \n\n\nHope above is enough for weeks to digest (to write) ;) .. will be here to clarify/explain if anything is not understood ;)', 1, 1, '110.36.233.170', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

You may/may not agree, whatsoever:\n\n1) [COLOR=#ff0000][B]You don''t really need any safeties if you don''t carry loaded chamber.[/B][/COLOR] [B][COLOR=#0000cd]Actual purpose of Safeties only comes into play, when it is that you have a habit of carrying a loaded/chambered handgun.[/COLOR][/B] \n\nOtherwise, what''s the danger, since you course first have to rack up your gun, don''t you?\n\nOr is it, that one would rack up the gun in case of dire emergency, and then turn the safety on before disengaging it just prior to the shot? Lolz! [B]NO[/B].\n\n[B][COLOR=#0000cd][I]Hence, I''m of the firm opinion, that we consider safeties only important as a measure against unwanted fingers on our handguns, not our own![/I][/COLOR][/B]\n\nIf we leave a loaded handgun unattended and with even manual safety on, we cannot rule out that any other person''s fiddling fingers cannot cause an accidental discharge, can we?\n\nSo, if you can take care of your weapons and prevent access to them, I really do not consider manual safeties any important thing to have on a handgun. When I''ll use the handgun myself, I''d just squeeze the trigger if my handgun is chambered and not have to remember to disengage a silly extra lever. In the heat of the moment, there''s either no time for this, or it is even forgotten to be disengaged! \n\n[B][COLOR=#0000cd][I]And if I do not carry chambered, I really don''t need any safety, do I? What will it protect if the handgun isn''t chambered? Lolz![/I][/COLOR][/B]\n\nWith this respect, I''d say, even Safe Action trigger safeties are enough. Especially if you don''t carry chambered. It requires however, that you''re proficient with handling handguns, if in the habit of carrying chambered. Nothing is idiot-proof, IMHO, when it comes to weapons.\n\n[COLOR=#ff0000][B]The prerequisite for above stance is, however, that you are proficient with weapons and your gun is "no-go"/restricted area to any others[/B][/COLOR]!\n\nElse, I really don''t think any safety in the world can prevent the un-desirable, can it?\n\n\nI hope I managed passing on my views in understandable manner.\n\n\n\nRegards.[/QUOTE]', 1, 0, '59.103.215.77', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

Stay safe and very careful in the hides, rush of blood can be harmful sometime, please ensure your and partners safety first avoid jumping into deep or unknown water to recover the species, birds will never end but life.\n\nAnother spell will also pass after this and there are multiple chances for good game, so please get refrain doing daily based hunts, its a game, enjoy it. we should provide equal chance to bird to flew back after a long hide n seek throughout the year. Any days game is not passion its frustration, we are not in pursuit of winning any race.\n\nWithout advocating bag limits, try to avoid meat collecting, however, we all are not saints, for sure, but please don''t repeat stories like 250 geese at a time. This is massacre and butchering not hunting.\n\nWe all are hunters under the same umbrella, please keep your nerves cool in the hide and one bird one shot is an excellent notion, instead going for bulk which will result in misses sometimes.\n\nHope this month should have lot of fun for everyone, cheers.[/QUOTE]\nPrince brother adhering your nice advise, I packed up my last shoot with 17 ducks.

What happens is that the there''s a little "hook" at the end of the extractor (which is attached to the slide) which snags on to the edge of the casing of the round when it''s chambered. When the shot is fired, the slide goes into recoil, and as the slide moves rearward, it pulls the spent casing along with it until it reaches the ejection port and is thrown out.\n\nSince a snap cap is a dummy round, hence it can''t go off and the slide cannot go into recoil. Hence a snap cap is not ejected when you pull the trigger. You can, however, manually eject a chambered snap cap by manually racking the slide. Infact, doing so is an excellent way to see how the extractor actually works and how the next round is fed from the magazine and fed into the chamber. :)', 1, 1, '110.36.195.23', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

I wasn''t sure whether I should tell people about this particular incident, but lately I''ve realised that such cases should be discussed openly & frequently so as to learn from our mistakes and to better ourselves collectively.\n\nIt was a Wednesday night and I was coming home from work. It was late night, around 11:30, and I was travelling on Ferozpur Road. I had just come down from the Kalima Chowk flyover and had come to a standstill at the traffic signal opposite Gaddafi Stadium. I wanted to make a u-turn, and was waiting for my signal to turn green. I had been standing at the red signal for not more than 5 seconds when I suddenly heard tires screeching behind me. I immediately looked into the rear-view mirror and saw a pair of headlights gunning straight at me. I instinctively braced myself, and the next moment I felt an impact and heard a loud crash. Apparently somebody had rear-ended me. I took a moment to check that I was fine, took a deep breath to calm myself down, and then got out of the car to assess the damage.\n\nThe first thing I saw when I got out was the other car; it was a brand new E-Class Mercedes, with an "Applied for Registration" tag. It''s front bumper had a nasty dent, the grille was partially hanging out, and the right headlight was flickering like crazy. Looking at the condition of the Merc, I was suddenly quite apprehensive at the damage my car must have taken (I was driving a late model Honda City). So I looked over at my car and, miraculously, all I suffered was a hairline crack on the bumper; everything else was perfectly fine! Relieved, I silently thanked God and started to walk over to the Merc to check on the driver.\n\nThe Merc''s door flew open and a kid in his early 20''s stormed out. He looked at the damage his car had taken, then looked at my car, then turned to me and started accusing me of being a bad driver. He was screaming & shouting, calling me everything from being stupidly blind to being a road menace. I kept calmly reminding him that it was he who had smashed into a stationary car at a red traffic signal and, therefore, the fault lay with him. But he simply wouldn''t have any of it, and even went to the extent of demanding that I pay for his damages!\n\nI tried calming him down and diffusing the situation as civilly as possible, but he was just too "pumped up" to let it go. So after listening to his ranting for a full 5 minutes and trying fruitlessly to make him understand where the actual blame lay, I felt that I was fast running out of patience with his attitude and rudeness. So I cut him short and told him that I''ve had a long day, it''s late and that I''m going home. With that I turned around and started walking back towards my car.\n\nIt was then that things took a turn for the worse. He suddenly started using filthy & abusive language regarding my family. I immediately saw red and turned around to fire off a verbal salvo of my own, when I noticed he was storming off towards his own car. From the way he was walking and cursing, I felt that something was wrong. Alarm bells started going off in my head! I was wearing a suit that day, with my CCW holstered on my right hip under my coat. I swept the front of my coat over to the side and got a good grip on my gun. The jackass got to his car, reached in, fumbled around a bit, and lo and behold, he pulled out a TT! His gun was in a dormant state, and he furiously started trying to insert the magazine. Seeing this, I immediately drew my weapon and pointed it straight at his face. By this time he had finally managed to insert the magazine, and was about to rack the slide when he looked up, and saw my gun aimed right at him.\n\nI calmly but firmly told him, "Put the gun on the ground, and kick it under your car." He didn''t move a muscle and continued to stare at me with utter hate, so I repeated the command again a little more aggressively. I then noticed that his hand was already on the slide and he was slowly pulling it back. I cocked my hammer and shouted, [B]"PUT THE F**KING GUN ON THE GROUND OR I SWEAR TO GOD I WILL F**KING END YOUR F**KING LIFE, YOU MISERABLE F**K!"[/B] (please pardon the language) He looked at me for another second or so and then slowly put his gun on the ground. I then firmly told him to get in his car and drive away. He did as he was told, quietly got in, and slowly drove off. I kept my gun aimed at him the whole time till he had driven about a good 50-60 meters away. I then quickly decocked & holstered, and took a couple of deep breaths to calm myself down.\n\nI then started quietly thanking the Almighty, when 3 traffic wardens came up and started their "interrogation". I informed them of what had happened, told them that I have a licensed firearm (even showed them the license), and even pointed out the TT the jackass had left lying on the road. I then spent the next 20 minutes manoeuvring and dodging around their attempts to "pay them for their trouble". Finally they gave up, gave me a "stern warning" about being careful in the future, and left. I immediately got into my car and drove home, all the while thanking God that everything worked out fine.\n\nI learnt a lot from this particular experience, lessons about both myself and about the crazy world we live in. Not a day has gone by since then when, while leaving my home in the morning, I pray to God that I won''t be put in a situation where I''ll have to take another human being''s life. That being said, now that I look back at this incident, I know for a [B]FACT[/B] that I would have pulled the trigger without any hesitation and shot off atleast 5 rounds into that jackass'' chest. Just because I try to avoid confrontations doesn''t mean that I won''t resort to violence if forced to do so. I''m just happy that this incident ended without anyone getting hurt.\n\nMay Allah bless us, guide us, and protect us all. Ameen.[/QUOTE]\n\nJust read the above incident Ahnab bro and I''m glad it all ended up without any serious consequences or you being hurt. I''ve not read other member''s comments and thoughts on this incident yet but just to make afew quick comments immediately after reading the story, Unfortunately these are the kind of threats we have to put up with now adays. Apart from spending sometime in the Royal Territorial Army and further undertaking work placements with the Met Police here in Yorkshire, I now work for the UK''s largest Security Company. As part of my job I have been going undertaking and been attending various different trainings, including the "Conflict Management" training which is probably the most important one out of all the subjects because thats where we are trained on how to tackle and deal with different hostile situations and conflicts in the most appropriate manner with the best outcome.\n From my own experience the way you handled this situation was the best possible solution. Because being a winner in such scenarios doesn&#8217;t always mean the other side being brought down or dead etc, but they say that the tough ones are always the calm ones who stay calm, immediately carries out a quick Dynamic Risk Assesment and then immediately tackle the situation without lashing out or losing control. You quickly assessed the situation or threat, then immediately responded in a way that prevented a potentially deadly attack without any one being hurt or killed and did not lose your calm. \n In that scenario legally you would have been in your rights to shoot the perpetrator if you wanted to because most Laws in every country state that if someone threatens your life with an offensive weapon and you feel your life is in danger you can respond and use necessary force required to stop or prevent the strike. Shooting him could have been justified in the court of law because he was about to pull a loaded gun at you, and that would have been enough to  justify you firing at him as self-defense but you did not do so and the way you handled it was even better. It takes a real man to keep his feet on the ground and do what you did in such scenarios. Well Done.\n\nNow lets talk abit about the other man or the potential attacker. \nOne minor possibility is that the driver driving the Merc could have been under the influence of alcohol or drugs as he failed to stop in the time required for him to break and stop at a safe distance on a traffic light. Because the use such substances slow down your reaction or response time. \nBut in my opinion there is a big possibility that this attack was pre planned. Mugging or robbing someone at the gunpoint is not the only way fraudsters, thieves, muggers, Robbers and Dacoits use to loot or rob people but many other different tactics are also used and this could have been one of them. May be he had stolen the car from somewhere, or maybe he had snatched it from someone at teh gunpoint in a different area and then planned this whole scenario to go, find a victim, bump his car into them from behind, and then try all what he tried with you to make some money.\n\nEven though in this case his plan backfired at him as in this case his chosen target or the victim (YOU) turned out to be a lot more clicked on than him which he most likely never expected but in other cases there are chances that he would have succeeded in his plan because in most circumstances most of our general public out there walk around un-armed and if it was some poor or naive working class citizen who do not want any trouble he would have just said ok brother I will pay you money etc simply because they don&#8217;t want trouble, or being involved in such cases on the legal side, and no trips to Police stations or courts, or no physical fights so often most people would just pay on the spot to avoid any further trouble and then these b*strds (excuse my language) become more and more confident and continue to do so. From what I can gather he was just a thief in a stolen Merc, also in most cases a man who genuinely owns such a car will probably not react or behave in the manner he was behaving.\n\nHe may have not made it obvious on the scene but believe me it was a nasty surprise for him. I bet you he never expected such a response, to him from your first look when you came out of your car was just a random yuppy in the suit with the money who he thought he is going to show is his TT to, pointing at him and you were going to start shaking pleading for your life begging on your knees saying please sir take the money, take the car and let me go. Lol. If anything it turned round to be the other way round.\nOne of my friends recently visited me here in UK from Peshawar and told me a story about his older brother that once his elder brother who I also know was driving his car in Peshawar and had his cell phone on the front passenger seat. All of sudden some guy on a motorcycle hit his cars back bumper from behind, he stopped the car, got out of his car started walking towards the guy on the motor cycle behind him and while he was walking another guy on another motorcycle quickly stopped near his front passengers side door, quickly grabbed the mobile phone from the front passenger seat and both guys on both motorcycles fled. \n\nAfew hints and tips to the fellow PGs, Always keep your doors locked when driving around especially at night time and if somebody bump into your vehicle from behind. DO NOT come out of your car straight away. Keep your doors locked, look around, quickly assess the situation and then decide whether it&#8217;s safe to come out or not. If not, and if necessary to flight, then do not be ashamed or hesitate to press your foot down and fly. DO NOT TRY TO BE A HERO. That&#8217;s what they say here in the British Police training. We back home, meaning in Pakistan often bring &#8220;ghairath&#8221; into everything little thing and try to employ this word &#8220;ghairath&#8221; or pride in the wrong places simply where there is no need.\n\nGod Bless us All.', 1, 0, '90.193.158.139', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

And I guess these differences are same for any kind of shotgun irrespective of manufacturer ?\r\n\r\nRegards,[/QUOTE]\r\n\r\nBro, reliability in autoloader shotguns is directly proportional to propellant gas pressure that is generated when a cartridge is fired. in gas autoloader shotgun, you harness this pressure the cycle the bolt, eject the spent cartridge and load a fresh one into the chamber. if you reduce this pressure, you are in effect, reducing the reliability.\r\n\r\nsimilarly, when we fire a light target load in a 3.5 inch super magnum chamber, the gas pressure generated is much lower compared to a smaller 3inch or a 2.75inch chamber. thats why super magnum autoloader shotguns are never considered reliable with light loads.\r\n\r\nnow lets add a gas regulator to the equation. it serves the purpose of increasing reliability by maximizing the gas harnessing ability of the action. whenever a light target load is fired, it automatically utilizes as much gas as possible to cycle reliably and whenever super hot loads are fired, it vents off excess gas and only makes use of the desired level of gas to for reliable cycling while preventing the action from damage.\r\n\r\ndifferent manufacturers employ different mechanisms for gas regulation. some rely on vents/ports in the barrel where others such as Baikal rely on a spring inside the regulator. which when in tight state for light loads, harnesses maximum gas pressure and when lose for heavy loads, vents off excess gas.\r\n\r\nRegards.', 1, 1, '182.177.49.240', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),
