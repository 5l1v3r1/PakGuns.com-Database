On the other hand Turkish plants are manufecturing some weapons at NATO standard for their troops. Turkish companies have knowledge sharing with the worlds best companies like Stoeger is a subsidery of BERETTA.

Turkish companies have knowledge sharing with the worlds best companies like Stoeger is a subsidery of BERETTA. Turkish walnut is considered one of the best.[/quote]\n\nsir, thats what i said, turkish gunmaking facilities are basically our darra type facilities, however they are more techologically advanced, they got CNC machines in 2001 (courtesy of USA not italy). they are getting better at metallurgy (again courtesy of USA) and thats it. Turkey is not a signatory to CIP, their guns are not proof tested, there is no one to guarantee the safety of their firearms. there are no formal testing standards. (now u know why turkish guns dont carry proof marks/stamps). now dont tell me "proof tested at 12000 psi" stamped on turkish barrels counts for something cause no it does not.\n\none more thing, stoeger plant was not established by beretta, it was in actuality, bought as a fully functional entity by beretta. that ends the debate that beretta quality guns are being produced their. beretta bought a cheaper company to expand their reach to lower price shotgun market. thats it folks, thats it.\n\n[quote]As far as the use of guns in competitions is considered it is not the quality of russian guns that take them to the events, but the patriotic competitors of the Russian block who were not allowed to use anyother gun.[/quote]\n\nsorry sir, european (specially britain, spain, french, even italian) players have intentionally opted for russian guns in international tournaments, not just russian block players.

(28010, ' Smart bullets that follow the twists and turns of their victims after they have left the barrel of a gun are being developed in a US Air Force project. According to recently declassified research by the Department of Defense, the new bullets will allow snipers to hit targets several kilometres away. "This technology could change the nature of war," says Ron Barrett, an aerospace engineer at Auburn University in Alabama who is testing prototypes of these Barrel Launched Adaptive Munitions.\n\nBLAMs steer by twitching their noses. Each bullet has a nose that can swivel, changing the angle it makes with the airflow. "At supersonic speed, very small angles generate huge amounts of lift," explains Barrett. Angling the nose towards the target causes the bullet to veer in that direction.\n\nThe mechanism is simple. The nose is connected to the body by a ball-and-socket joint, and held in place by a number of piezoceramic rods, or tendons, which change length when a voltage is applied to them. Increasing the length of a rod on one side of the bullet while shortening its opposite number changes the angle of the nose (see Diagram). The nose can move by up to 0.1° in any direction.\n\nThese simple actuators are ideal for bullets because they can withstand the huge forces generated during firing, says Barrett. He has already demonstrated that the prototype can survive accelerations of more than 17 000 times gravity.\n\nThey are also able to lengthen and contract hundreds of times a second. This is important because spinning bullets travel at several times the speed of sound, so any control mechanism must be able to react quickly to compensate. In wind tunnel tests, Barrett has proved that the piezoceramic rods can produce good control of a round travelling at more than Mach 3.\n\nSo far the work has focused on the large-calibre bullets with diameters of 20 millimetres or more that are used in aircraft cannon. These bullets are notoriously inaccurate because they are blown off course by the wind and follow parabolic trajectories, dropping significantly over distances of a kilometre or so. "The way pilots guarantee a hit is by filling the sky with lead," says Barrett. Because BLAMs generate lift, they can overcome the effects of wind and gravity, giving them at least twice the range of conventional bullets. "And with BLAM, pilots would need only one bullet to get a hit," says Barrett.\n\nIn addition to the steering mechanism, each bullet would also need a guidance system that tracks the target and controls the actuators. Barrett says this is the easy part of the problem. "Accurate guidance systems have been around for 30 years," he explains.\n\nThe idea is to "paint" the target with a laser beam and equip the bullets with a sensor that homes in on this signal, just like smart bombs. Each bullet would have a sensor behind a quartz window that picks up the signal and controls the bullet. Barrett says that suitable sensors already exist that can withstand the stresses of being fired from a gun and can be made more or less the size of a microchip.\n\nBut the bullets will not be cheap. Aircraft bullets cost more than $30 each. Barrett says the piezoceramic materials would add $10 to this while the microelectronics would cost another $100. But he argues that the increased strike rate would lead to cost savings. "You''d only fire one when otherwise you''d fire hundreds."\n\nAnother advantage of piezoceramic actuators is that they can easily be made smaller. "You don''t have to fiddle around with tiny mechanisms as you would for conventional actuators," he says. This raises the prospect of smart bullets for small arms.\n\nLaser reflection is already a common method of sighting for hand-held weapons. But a sharpshooter must still compensate for gravity and wind, and this limits the range of even the most accurate guns to a kilometre or so. With smart bullets, snipers could hit targets from several kilometres away. The gun and the laser sight need not even be in the same place.\n\nBut a lot of research and development is needed before the first weapon fires a smart bullet. "The technology is not yet fully proven," says Fred Davis, who heads the flight vehicles branch at the US Air Force''s Wright Laboratory in Florida, which funded Barrett''s work. But Davis believes that smart bullets are a practical possibility, although he predicts they are 15 years away. He says that his laboratory has already developed scaled down, cheaper versions of the smart bombs that were so successful during the Gulf War.\n\n[url]http://www.snipercountry.com/Articles/SmartBullets.asp[/url]', ''),

It’s a tough walk up and down the gorges, across rushing icy torrents, along steep narrow trails, through broken rocks, over wire-rope bridges and through many crevassed glaciers.\n\n[img]http://pakistanguides.com/hunting/blue_sheep/images/shimshal_blue_sheep_hunt_l19.JPG[/img]\n\n[img]http://pakistanguides.com/hunting/blue_sheep/images/shimshal_pass_l1.JPG[/img]\n\nOur Team of 1 Hunter +20 Porters +2 Guides +2 Cooks +4 Climbers +Me Marching Towards Shimshal For Blue Sheep Hunt (March 2009) - This Hunt Costed A Little More Than Rs 2,100,000/= See we are all tied with ropes together !\n\n[img]http://i560.photobucket.com/albums/ss46/pakistanguides/shimshal_blue_sheep_hunt_l53.jpg[/img]\n\nOne small slip on this dangerous & scary slope and you may lose your life for the rest of your life !\n\n[img]http://pakistanguides.com/hunting/blue_sheep/images/shimshal_blue_sheep_hunt_l27.JPG[/img]\n\nShimshal is a farming & herding community of 3000 people, situated at north-eastern extreme of the former state of Hunza. The settlement occupies the upper portion of a valley of the same name, which descends west into the Hunza River valley at Passu and separates the Ghujerab and Hispar Mustagh ranges of the Karakoram mountains. Shimshal is also famous for the longevity of its people.\n\n[img]http://pakistanguides.com/hunting/blue_sheep/images/blue_sheep_hunt_shimshal_l6.JPG[/img]\n\nWithin Shimshal''s territory are innumerable peaks, glaciers and trekking routes, including nine peaks above 7,000 meters. Yukshin Gardan, Yazghil Dome, Dataghil Sar, Malangutti, Karoon Koh are the famous ones.\n\n[img]http://pakistanguides.com/hunting/blue_sheep/images/shimshal_blue_sheep_hunt_l28.JPG[/img]\n\n[img]http://pakistanguides.com/hunting/blue_sheep/images/shimshal_blue_sheep_hunt_l29.JPG[/img]\n\n[img]http://pakistanguides.com/hunting/blue_sheep/images/shimshal_blue_sheep_hunt_l30.JPG[/img]\n\n[img]http://pakistanguides.com/hunting/blue_sheep/images/kaiser_blue_sheep_hunt_l5.JPG[/img]\n\nShimshal is rich in fauna & many threatened wildlife species are found here. It is the only place where Tibetan Wild Ass (Equus bemionus kiang), & Blue Sheep (Pseudois nayaur) are found. Snow leopard (Uncia uncia), Himalayan ibex (Capra Ibex Sibirica Hemalayanus) and, Golden Marmots (Marmota caudate) are also found in Shimshal. Migratory birds like ducks & cranes also enroute Shimshal Valley.\n\n[img]http://pakistanguides.com/hunting/blue_sheep/images/shimshal_blue_sheep_hunt_l37.JPG[/img]\n\nThe people of Shimshal are cheerful & friendly. The entire population belongs to the Ismaili Shias sect headed by Prince Karim Agha Khan. The women wear bright clothes, long shirts over baggy trousers and embroided pillbox hats over which they drape their shawls, whereas, men mostly wear simple dress composed of shalwar (trouser) & kamiz (shirt) or western trousers with a hand woven wool cap.\n\n[img]http://pakistanguides.com/hunting/blue_sheep/images/shimshal_blue_sheep_hunt_l58.jpg[/img]\n\nShimshal pastures cover about 2700 sq km of the Central Karakoram. Within that area they maintain their three dozen individual pastures, including three large and highly productive alpine areas. \n\n[img]http://pakistanguides.com/hunting/blue_sheep/images/shimshal_blue_sheep_hunt_l60.jpg[/img]\n\nShimshal’s villages are situated on a series of glacial and alluvial deposits that form a broad strip between the river''s floodplain and steep mountain slopes to the south. These deposits have been terraced for several hundred years. They are irrigated by glacier melt water which currently dissect them.  Shimshalis grow wheat & barley, potatoes, peas, beans, apricots and apples. Small quantities of garden vegetables are also grown. Shimshalis are one of the few communities in Pakistan''s Northern Areas that grows enough agricultural produce to feed itself. \n\n[img]http://pakistanguides.com/hunting/blue_sheep/images/shimshal_blue_sheep_hunt_l51.JPG[/img]\n\nShimshalis complement their irrigated agriculture with extensive herding of sheep, goats, cattle & yaks. They own more livestock per capita than any other Hunza community & earn more by selling dairy produce, yaks and yak hair carpets. This is due, in part, to the community''s exclusive control of vast areas of high altitude land. Serving tourists as porters, guides, drivers & cooks is another source of income.\n\n[img]http://pakistanguides.com/hunting/blue_sheep/images/shimshal_blue_sheep_hunt_l57.jpg[/img]\n\nAs per many popular tales of community, Shimshal was founded four centuries ago by Mamu Singh, a Burusho from Baltit (Hunza), and a member of the ruler''s family. Mamu Singh was sent to Sarikol, Central Asia, as ambassador, but later fled with his Wakhi wife Khodija, when relations with Hunza deteriorated. They were pursued into the Upper Hunza River Valley, as far as Avgarch Pasture on the slopes of Qarun Pir, where they made their home for several years before migrating into the lower reaches of the Shimshal Valley. \n\n[img]http://pakistanguides.com/hunting/blue_sheep/images/shimshal_blue_sheep_hunt_l47.JPG[/img]\n\n[img]http://pakistanguides.com/hunting/blue_sheep/images/shimshal_blue_sheep_hunt_l46.JPG[/img]\n\nNOW ....

(28234, ' [quote=Naazer]I got my CZ Brno .222 from him in 2006 and a Stoeger 2000 Semi auto shot gun. The guy is polite and has a good stock of rifles and keeps getting new pieces. Price wise he was below the other dealers on the road parallel to him and i dbl checked cos the dealer i used to go to (Baluchistan Arms) called him in front of me and asked for the price of the stoeger as he didn have in stock and qouted me Rs 5k above that and variations of some other prices depending on camo,black or walnutr finisih for the stoeger. I went directly to Tahir and he gave me the original price. My experience with him has been good but a few of my friends who intro''d me to him for some reason have fallen out with him.

During the visit, Wazir added, the delegation members would hold meetings with different gun manufacturers and engineers besides holding discussions with heads of government departments regulating arms production in Turkey.\n\nHe said gun manufacturing technology is very latest and advanced in Turkey and the PHSADC realised this during an international exhibition of arms held recently in Germany.\n\nHe said production standards, value addition of products and finishing are very fine in Turkey and the PHSADC wants to get information about the technology and its replication in Pakistan.\n\n“Without improving production standards and value addition of products, we cannot attract foreign buyers for hunting and sporting arms being produced in Pakistan,” he said.\n\nWazir said the company has been set up with the objective of harnessing the untapped potential of gun manufacturing in Pakistan. The PHSADC, he continued, is striving to increase export of hunting and sporting arms manufactured in Pakistan by developing and enhancing skills and craftsmanship of gunsmiths.', ''),

Only 6 boars were shot at night using spot/flash lights. \nMy client Helmut used Blazer 338 but was not so happy because his magazine could only give him 4+1 shots and he missed lots of boars while loading his gun, whereas, his fellow hunter Fischer used the Semi Automatic Wichester 30.06 with large magazine carrying 11 shots .(plus a spare loaded magazine) .. so obviously he had an edge over Hlelmut and had a better score.\n\n[img]http://pakistanguides.com/boar/photo_gallery/images/westfalia_jagdreisen_boar_hunt_26L.JPG[/img]\n\nThis is Fischer proudly exhibiting his 22 + 22.5 cm long wild boar trophy he harvested ij Jan 2009\n\n[img]http://pakistanguides.com/boar/photo_gallery/images/westfalia_jagdreisen_boar_hunt_8L.JPG[/img]\n\n[img]http://pakistanguides.com/boar/photo_gallery/images/westfalia_jagdreisen_boar_hunt_34L.JPG[/img]\n\n[img]http://pakistanguides.com/boar/photo_gallery/images/westfalia_jagdreisen_boar_hunt_33L.JPG[/img]\n\n[img]http://pakistanguides.com/boar/photo_gallery/images/westfalia_jagdreisen_boar_hunt_24L.JPG[/img]\n\n[img]http://pakistanguides.com/boar/photo_gallery/images/westfalia_jagdreisen_boar_hunt_35L.JPG[/img]\n\nMy sons thoroughly enjoyed this wild boar hunt and it was a great experience for them.\n\n[img]http://pakistanguides.com/boar/photo_gallery/images/westfalia_jagdreisen_boar_hunt_21L.JPG[/img]\n\n[img]http://pakistanguides.com/boar/photo_gallery/images/westfalia_jagdreisen_boar_hunt_30L.JPG[/img]\n\n[img]http://pakistanguides.com/boar/photo_gallery/images/westfalia_jagdreisen_boar_hunt_19L.JPG[/img]\n\n[img]http://pakistanguides.com/boar/photo_gallery/images/westfalia_jagdreisen_boar_hunt_23L.JPG[/img]\n\n[img]http://pakistanguides.com/boar/photo_gallery/images/westfalia_jagdreisen_boar_hunt_22L.JPG[/img]\n\n[img]http://pakistanguides.com/boar/photo_gallery/images/safari_international_boar_hunt_4L.jpg[/img]\n\n[img]http://pakistanguides.com/boar/photo_gallery/images/westfalia_jagdreisen_boar_hunt_10L.JPG[/img]\n\n[img]http://pakistanguides.com/boar/photo_gallery/images/safari_international_boar_hunt_3L.jpg[/img]\n\n[img]http://pakistanguides.com/boar/photo_gallery/images/westfalia_jagdreisen_boar_hunt_29L.JPG[/img]\n\n[img]http://pakistanguides.com/boar/photo_gallery/images/westfalia_jagdreisen_boar_hunt_25L.JPG[/img]\n\n[img]http://pakistanguides.com/boar/photo_gallery/images/westfalia_jagdreisen_boar_hunt_37L.JPG[/img]\n\n[img]http://pakistanguides.com/boar/photo_gallery/images/westfalia_jagdreisen_boar_hunt_32L.JPG[/img]\n\nI think these are enough for today but I''ll revert soon and show you guys some more photos of my wild boar hunt that I conducted for my American and Italian hunters ....

The biggest advantage is that depending upon the load one can switch between repester and pump action just with a click of a button and by moving the hand slide. 8 + 1 capacity means you will never be short on ammo in a self defence sitiation. The gun comes with 2 manual safties that makes it very very safe.\nthe recoil is very acceptable. Availible in price range of 125 k (used) I think you should simply go for that. We can go and fire mine before you make any decision.\n\nRegards\nBloodBath', ''),

I wanted to ask ... you had mentioned in some of your posts that it requires a certified measurer for the Trophy hunting.... what if I hunt a boar and its by far a good big sized .. what criteria would there be to judge whether I got the biggest boar?\nSpecially when no certified hunter is accompanying me ... who would certify the hunt?[/quote]\n\nDear Khalidsh\nLike I said earlier, people have undoubtedly hunted extra large trophies around the world, and many of them even possess world record trophies, however, in order to participate in a competition or make your trophy officially registered for the whole world to accept it, so it may become undisputable, you have to register it with the SCI who have a transparent system of measuring all kinds of trophies and they use the services of "master measurers" who are well trained and have lot of experience. To distribute the work load, some other hunting organizations also do this job of measuring, like Grand Slam Ovis, Shikar Safari International, Dallas Safari Club ..etc and pass on the result to SCI accordingly. \nAs regards your question, you don''t have to carry a master measurer with you who must accompany you on hunt to certify that this is your hunted trophy. He just receives the trophy through proper channel and measures it. But to officially certify that this is YOUR trophy, a hunting certificate is issued by the Wild Life department of every country which is issued only after you have bought the hunting permit and paid all the Govt fees. For all big game hunted trophies, the hunter is always escorted by the representative of wild life department plus the representative of the concerned community based conservancy (where you are hunting) and they both sign your hunting certificate as witness to your hunt after which the department issues the hunting certificate and this becomes your official trophy. Then in order to send your trophy for official measurement to SCI you need an export permit from NCCW (@ Rs 5000) and ship it to SCI with their fee. After it is measured and certified, they send it back to you. Then you can display your trophy in your drawing room with the certificate that will not be challenged by anyone anywhere in the world ... BUT you may be very much dissappointed to hear the news on the very next day ... that YOUR world record has been broken by some Tom Dikk or Harry .... lol !\n\nThe same process is to be followed for the wild boar around the world ... fortunately, however, there is no hunting permit or hunting fee for Pakistanis to hunt the wild boar in Pakistan and Pakistani hunters just need the official shooting permit. Whereas, all foreigners pay US$ 100 to Ministry of Tourism, plus Rs 1500 for the shooting license to provincial wild life department.\nNow after you have "legally hunted" the wild boar (with your proper shooting permit) and cleaned its trophy, you have the right to go to the office of the wild life department and claim for the hunting certificate clearly mentioning the size of the wild boar trophy then you can send this hunting to SCI, however, since wild boar is "haram" and obnoxious for all Muslims, the wild life department may refuse to touch or issue such certificate (especially when they are not getting any fees etc) and since there is no such precedence, they may not even consider it !!!\n\nThat''s how they measure it !\n\n[img]http://vermontbiggametrophyclub.com/yahoo_site_admin1/assets/images/IROC_Show_2008.49122803.jpg[/img]\n\nPlease note since there are hundreds of species being hunted around the world, the world record list is very big & keeps changing every day. So you can see the list of top ten trophies of each specie.\n\nClick here :  [url]http://www.scifirstforhunters.org/members/RB/view_minimums.cfm[/url]\n\nIf you determine to enter this list, ... Your today''s dream can become tommorrow''s reality !\n\nLike all other animals, there are many species of wild boars. Pakistan is mainly populated with Sus Scrofa which is of almost same size as Razorbacks of America but much bigger than the Feral Pigs of Europe .. Yet much smaller than the Tusckers of Turkey which are hunter''s favorites because they have big bodies and big fangs. \n\nNevertheless, none of these species can even come closer to the African Wart Hogs whose teeth are very big as compared to their own body and teeth of any other specie. \n\nThis is how an African Wrathog Looks like !\n\n[img]http://www.glenoakzoo.org/PPHTAG/PPHTAGimages/warthog.jpg[/img]\n\n[img]http://i72.photobucket.com/albums/i199/seawolf_2006/Warthog11tommer.jpg[/img] \n\n[img]http://i560.photobucket.com/albums/ss46/pakistanguides/Huge20Warthog20taken20by20little20b.jpg[/img]\n\n[img]http://www.paulbrunner.net/images/Kane%20Photos/Dan%20Holland%20with%20HUGE%20Warthog.jpg[/img]\n\n[img]http://i560.photobucket.com/albums/ss46/pakistanguides/ChineseWildBoar.jpg[/img]\n\nBut this strange boar from China is some strange specie that I never saw before !', ''),
(29082, ' 1.        Look for a gun that is easy to carry. Portability is very important. Because bird hunting involves a lot of walking and the ability to draw and shot very quickly, you will need to select a gun that is light enough to not weigh you down on your hunt. An ideal shotgun for upland hunting weighs around 7 lbs. Your size and overall strength will determine whether or not you can comfortably handle a larger gun. Keep in mind that if you do choose a heavier gun, you must be able to point and swing it accurately. The less a gun weighs the more kick or recoil it will produce.\n\n2.

In another valley, I found at least six ibex horns, two months after a flood ripped through the area. Only one pair  (37"& 35") were intact, the other were single split from each other,, and in the 30"-40" range. You would be surprised to learn that we did not find these horns in the river bed, rather there were entangled in bushes about  eight feet above. Since there was no accompanying carcass, I can only assume that these horns were from animals long dead and had been washed down the hills in the floods. \n\nFinally, sir, please explain "Yet since you found it in wilderness it''s not a crime as bad as poaching".

I meant in the eyes of any wild life department (not Pakistan) this is a smaller crime as compared to poaching because whether you found them in wilderness or you poach ... once they discover these horns from you they won''t spare you but if ultimately proved that it was not poaching and you found them in wilderness, perhaps, they would let you go ... But you made a big mistake by giving them to the wild life department in Pakistan, although, it was a good job you did and we all must appreciate it but do you think they will register it in their syndicate ...

(29196, ' Both the 5.45x45 and 7.62x39 are assault rifle calbers, \n\nwhat is an assault rifle?\nIt is a selective fire rifle with a short to medium range rifle.  Assault rifle was first introduced in World War II, Germany deployed  "Stoßtruppen" (Shock Trooper), who were equipped with "Sturmgewehr 44" (Storm Rifle) chambered for 7.92x33mm Kurz, major battlefield results showed that major engagements occurred at less distance than 300 meters, which meant that the heavier 7.92x57mm round rifles were over powered and were heavy and difficult to assault with. This was the dawn of Assault rifles. Now the performance showed for it self, soldiers were able to fire in bursts while moving, and they moved faster too. This idea was the result of "Blitzkrieg", a German Army assault tactic. \n\nWhat is a battle rifle?\nA battle rifle incorporates a heavier round for e.g 7.62x51, with a range and accuracy upto and beyond 1000 meters. These rifles have been in the world since the begging of the 19th century.\n\nNow, Armies and their commanders are not stupid, they know what they are doing, The US Army standard issue is M16, heavier and longer barrel, while an M4 is a special forces weapon with a shorter barrel and its compact, SF''s job is to infil and exfil light and quick and complete their objectives, while the Army has to stick it to the enemy. \n\nPak Army standard issue rifle is the G3 for a soldier, which is dead accurate and lethal at range, but JCO''s get the MP5, which is 9mm, so if the point is lethality then the JCO with the MP5 is worthless who is supposed to be leading his squad/platoon. Why does the Pak Army and Germans still incorporate the MG3 as their primary machine gun, Power? No its meant for suppression, a 7.62x51 will suppress an enemy the same as a .50 BMG, they want it to be light, deploy able and suppress the enemy by volume.\n\nThe lighter the round, the lighter the rifle, more a soldier can perform and more he can carry in volume.\n\nThe debate about penetration, when you are in Close Quarter Battle, having a heavier bullet makes a bullet prone to penetrate walls, in a hostage situation do you want that? NO\nBoth 9mm and 50 BMG can kill a man, the 50 BMG will only make his guts spill out more.\n\nThe 7.62 and the 5.45 are both great rounds in their category, the 7.62 Assault rifle is intended for a powerful barrage of bullets while deadly at short range, while the 5.45 is intended for accurate and controllable hits. the 5.45, 7.62, 223, and 308 are excellent calibers in battlefields they are to be.\n\nThe objective and conditions decide which caliber, not vice versa.', ''),

Read its specs on the net and ask the shop keeper to show you some wide tapes. you will easily spot it.\n\n[b]Its less plastic and more fabric stuff. The one doctors put to keep the bandage intact.

(30083, ' @shabbar ali\nBoth the licenses are equally well. It depends on your requirement. I would prefer a MOI license as the movement is not restricted to a single province. But at the same time I have 2 licenses issued by Sindh government and I had them All Pakistan.... this way I can use them throughout pakistan like MOI ... but one catch is that the Local Provincial government can cancel their Provincial license anytime ... whereas the MOI license cannot be cancelled by the provincial government unless a person enters into some legal issues .. then only a court can order cancellation of license.', ''),

(30096, ' Shotgun you choose should also fit your physique "Most important factor to me atleast". I am 5''10 and weigh around 85 Kgs and am most comfortable with any gun that is between 6 1/2 to 7 pounds but have seen people who are 6ft+ and they consider the same weight of gun too light! and when used such guns they had tendency of stopping the swing!!! Same way I feel OK with a barrel length of 28'''' or a total length of 46''''  but the guys who are 6ft+ may consider it shorter in length and they feel OK with 30''''+ or a total length of 50 to 52''''. I had a discussion with one of my friends who I consider the GURU of guns and he told me that 30''''+ barrels are back in fashion at skeet & clay shoots..... I''ll explain the phenomenon some other time but in short longer barrels give better acquisition of tartget.............. ;) Other important factors while selecting a shotgun are its LOP, drop at comb, drop at stock, cast on and cast off... you guys probably have fair idea of these factors OR I''ll explain it', ''),
(30097, ' This brief by RANDY WAKEMAN on weight of shotgun would help you guys to understand much better ;);)\nThere are trends as to what shotgun weight works best, trends that have proved their merits over time. By no means absolutes; they are good starting points in looking at a new shotgun for a specific application.\n\n [b]UPLAND[/b]\nIn upland hunting you are walking all day and your shotgun must constantly be at the ready to fire. Author John Brindle (Shotgun Shooting Techniques and Technology) has noted that six to seven pound shotguns are in the area that makes the most sense. Anything much lighter than a six pound gun is too whippy to easily maintain a smooth swing and too much over seven pounds becomes a real pain to lug around by the end of the day. A Beretta A303 20 or Browning B-80 20 gauge is about as light a shotgun as I can swing smoothly and follow through. These are guns approaching the six pound area. Browning A-5 20 Mags and Sweet Sixteens are both closer to seven pounds, depending on barrel length, year of manufacture, and wood density, yet are still pleasant to carry. As much as I really appreciate A-5''s, there is nothing truly light about a "Light Twelve." Weighing around eight and a half pounds, the older I get the more I can feel such guns at the end of the day. An easy way to test shotgun weight is just to shoot a few crossers at the local skeet field or sporting clays course. If you need to consciously force your scattergun to keep swinging, you have probably gone a bit too far in the lightweight, whippy, stutter swing direction.\n\n [b]DOVE / SPORTING CLAYS[/b]\nFor dove hunting and sporting clays use, guns weighing from seven to eight pounds appear to be the most popular. Not having to walk nearly as far, the smoother swing and lower recoil of a heavier gun helps far more than it hurts. Most any weight gun can be used, but as far as I''m concerned any type of high volume shooting calls for a heavier, softer shooting gun.\n\n [b]SKEET[/b]\nEight to nine pounds is most popular in American skeet, in all gauges, because smoothly redundant swings are needed and hundreds of shells may be fired in one day. In the long run, it''s easier to be better with a heavy gun. Since we can shoot with our shotguns pre-mounted, there is no rush getting them up to the shoulder, either.\n\n [b]TRAP[/b]\n[i]Most of the top shooters want a gun over eight pounds and a lot of winners go to ten-pound guns or even heavier. Like skeet, trap shooting starts with the gun pre-mounted, and hundreds of shells may be fired in a day. Weight is not much of an issue, while long sighting planes (30-34 inch barrels are typical) and smooth swings rule the day.[/i]\n\n [b]WATERFOWL[/b]\nPumps and semi-autos are a fairly easy choice in a tight blind, as guns that need to be broken open to reload can be a real pain. Weight is no issue, and the heavier loads used and longer shots sometimes presented mean many opt for 30" barrels and a heavier, smoother swinging guns for pass shooting. Over decoys, 30 inch tubes have little advantage over shorter barrels, with the exception that some of the slower powders loaded in steel or other "no-tox" shot loads need plenty of barrel length to combust fully. A 16 or 20 gauge gun can actually do a pretty good job killing ducks over decoys.\n\n [b]TURKEY[/b]\nShooting relatively stationary targets on the ground is the antithesis of wing-shooting. Most anything can, and has, been used. However, most folks seem to want short-barreled, lightweight guns that are easy to carry. Fortunately, considering the heavy payloads normally employed, turkey hunting isn''t high-volume shotgunning. Not too many folks feel the gun after calling in a big tom.\n\n [b]CONCLUSION[/b]\nThese are just generalizations, and what you choose is a matter of individual preference. It does suggest that, although shooters are often searching for the best "all-around" shotgun, there really is no such thing and never has been.', ''),

If you have bought a gun try to hide it from the children till the time they don’t get elder (above 10 yrs of age). \n\nIf you are in habit of carrying weapon in routine try to pick and keep the weapon beyond their eyes and keep the weapon in a safe and locked place where they should not have access. \n\nAs khalidsh said earlier that kids have even higher level of curiosity than cats, its true but I think till the time they don’t know and seen gun they will not be able to get into curiosity until they reach to the age of 10.', ''),

(30148, ' [b]SriLanka Orders 22 Al-khalids Tanks[/b]\n\nIt was the Pakistani defence cooperation with Sri Lanka as one of the largest suppliers of high-tech military equipment that has played a major role in the ultimate defeat of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) at the hands of the Lankan army.\n\nThe three decade long quest of the LTTE to carve out a separate state for Tamils, as well as the myth that the Tamil Tigers are militarily invincible, has effectively been laid to rest, along with its supremo, Velupillai Prabhakaran, and the entire LTTE top brass. According to well placed sources in the Pakistani establishment, defence cooperation between Sri Lanka and Pakistan had grown significantly in recent years as Islamabad, unlike New Delhi, had no problems supplying the Lankan army state-of-the-art weaponry to accelerate its counter-insurgency operations against the LTTE which has finally ended with the killing of the most wanted Tamil guerilla fighter Vellupillai Prabhakaran. The sources say it was exactly a year ago in the first week of May 2008 that Sri Lankan Army Chief Lt-Gen Fonseka came to Pakistan and held detailed talks with his Pakistani counterpart Chief of Army Staff General Ashfaq Pervez Kayani to finalise the purchase of high tech arms for the Lankan armed forces, which were embroiled in an intense battle with the LTTE forces even at that time.\n\nDuring his talks with Pakistani military authorities, Lt-Gen Fonseka had finalised a deal as per which Pakistan sold 22 Al-Khalid tanks to Sri Lanka in a deal worth over US$100 million. General Fonseka also gave a shopping list of weaponry worth about US$65 million to the Pakistani military authorities. While the Sri Lankan army chief’s shopping list for the army was pegged at $25 million, the inventory for the Lankan Air Force was worth $40 million. He had further sought 250,000 rounds of 60mm, 81mm, 120mm and 130mm mortar ammunition worth US$ 25 million and 1, 50,000 hand grenades for immediate delivery to the Lankan army within a month. Pakistan also accepted the visiting General’s request to send one shipload of the wherewithal every 10 days to bolster the Lankan military efforts to take over Kilinochchi, the headquarters of the LTTE.\n\nOn Jan 19, 2009, in a meeting between Pakistani Defence Secretary Lt-Gen (retd) Syed Athar Ali and his visiting Lankan counterpart Gotabhaya Rajapakse in Rawalpindi, the two countries had agreed to enhance cooperation in military training, exercises and intelligence sharing regarding terrorism. The agreement came amidst Sri Lankan media reports that the Pakistan Air Force (PAF) pilots had participated in several successful air strikes against several military bases of the LTTE in August 2008. These reports further claimed that a highly trained group of the Pakistani armed forces officers is stationed in Colombo to guide the Sri Lankan security forces in their counter-insurgency operations against the LTTE.\n\nHowever, it was not the first time that the Pakistan army was helping Sri Lanka militarily in its prolonged fight against the LTTE guerrilla fighters. Back in 2000, when LTTE offensive code-named Operation Ceaseless Waves overran Sri Lankan military positions in the north and captured the Elephant Pass Base and entered Jaffna, and was being feared that LTTE would run down thousands of Sri Lankan troops stationed in Jaffna, the Sri Lankans had sought Multi-Barrel Rocket Launcher System (MBRLS) and other high tech weaponry from Pakistan on urgent basis.\n\nSubsequently, MBRLS and weapons and ammunition, including artillery shells and multi-barrel rocket launchers, were airlifted in an emergency operation from Karachi to Colombo in May 2000. Later, in 2006, the Sri Lankan authorities had again sought Multi-Barrel Rocket Launcher System (MBRLS) and other advanced weapons from Pakistan when Sri Lankan President Mahinda Rajapaksa visited Pakistan in March 2006 along with an 80-member delegation that included some high ranking military officials. During his talks with the Pakistani leaders, the Sri Lankan President had sought military help from Islamabad to effectively put an end to the LTTE separatist movement.\n\nThat the Lankan and the Pakistani armed forces had been working together in militarily stamping out the LTTE insurgency has already been confirmed by the Sri Lanka Army Spokesman, Brigadier Udaya Nanayakara, in a statement he had made on April 28, 2009, saying Pakistan and India had been training the Sri Lankan troops to deal with the LTTE forces. Separately but consistently, he said, the two countries had trained and equipped the Sri Lankan army to prepare and fight the LTTE. He said Lankan forces have been procuring the latest technology from both countries.\n\n“We had been sending our military officers regularly to India and Pakistan for specialised training. I myself did four courses in India and three in Pakistan. We know they are rivals but we have nothing to do with that and we are benefited from both India and Pakistan,” said the Sri Lankan military spokesman, Brigadier Udaya Nanayakara.\n\nLINK\n\n[url]http://www.netspikes.com/news/pakistannews/Pakistan%E2%80%99s-crucial-role-in-the-death-of-tamil-tigers/[/url]', ''),

A sonar array is a radar towed behind a ship that listens and locates underwater sounds.\n\nThe incident occurred near Subic Bay off the coast of the Philippines.\n\nThe official, who declined to be named because the incident had not been made public, would not say whether the U.S. ship knew the submarine was that close to it.\n\nHowever, the Navy does not believe this was a deliberate incident of Chinese harassment, as it would have been extremely dangerous had the array gotten caught in the submarine''s propellers.\n\nThe Navy has complained in the past that Chinese vessels, including fishing boats, have deliberately tried to disrupt U.S. naval activities in international waters near China. In one widely publicized incident in March, five Chinese vessels maneuvered close enough to the USNS Impeccable to warrant the use of a fire hose by the unarmed American vessel to avoid a collision. The Navy later released video of that incident.\n\nlink\n\n[url]http://www.cnn.com/2009/US/06/12/china.submarine/index.html[/url]', ''),

As far as the reputation of cracked frames is concerned, I should add that this problem only occurred in the earlier models of PT111. The problem was rectified in later models.\n\nThe Taurus PT92 and related series have proven themselves to be extremely reliable over time. An article in Guns&Ammo (sometime in 1989-1990) cited that the Taurus 92 series actually had better steel than their original Beretta counterparts.\n\nNow, if only the Taurus 809 were available...

(30454, ' @12Gauge: Sir, no offence, but when, GOD FORBID, you fall into a situation requiring you to use your weapon, wouldn''t it be better to have a loaded, ready gun? All of us know of the crime situation in Pakistan, and its only a matter of time when one-on-one confrontations depend on who shoots first. Unlike the armed forces, we have no indication of threats in our surroundings. Waiting until the threat has revealed itself to rack the slide seems to be a tad too slow. In many situations, it''s pretty much impossible to use both hands to load the gun (I do know of single handed loading, but its a trick I would never trust). We carry guns for a simple reason: personal defence. An unloaded gun is of as much use as no gun. Today''s double action pistols are designed to be carried loaded. True, there are pistols like the TT which can go off, chambered and hammer down, but then there are others like Sig, Beretta and Stoeger, which are extremely safe.\n\nMy opinion: If you are close enough to draw a gun, it should have a full magazine, with one round down the pipe, safety PREFERABLY on. Flicking off the safety takes a fraction of a time taken racking the slide, and is a simple one-handed task.\n\n@Omkhan: Today''s polymer pistols are built to high standards and have gone through several torture tests.

While I dont agree with those who advocate racking the slide in the heat of the moment.. with enough practice it can be done in roughly the same time and has a greater deterring factor.. so they do have some valid points. You need to be real good at weapon handling (read = RESPONSIBLE) if you want to carry a round in the chamber.\n\nSecondly and coming back to the topic.. A round "cook off" happens at 200+ degrees celsius. And even then its a remote chance, especially with quality SD ammo that i''m sure all you fine folks carry. No way in hell a car''s ambient temperature will ever get THAT high.

But you can keep it anywhere once you get back in the ride.\n\nApparently, the best position i''m told for in car weapon drawing is a belt cross draw, so you should holster your weapon on the  weak hand side and pull a cross draw. Also helps to keep the piece on your body than on the floor or car in case you have to disembark in a hurry and make a run for it.

(30581, ' [quote=TalalKhan]This brief by RANDY WAKEMAN on weight of shotgun would help you guys to understand much better ;);)\nThere are trends as to what shotgun weight works best, trends that have proved their merits over time. By no means absolutes; they are good starting points in looking at a new shotgun for a specific application.\n\n [b]UPLAND[/b]\nIn upland hunting you are walking all day and your shotgun must constantly be at the ready to fire. Author John Brindle (Shotgun Shooting Techniques and Technology) has noted that six to seven pound shotguns are in the area that makes the most sense. Anything much lighter than a six pound gun is too whippy to easily maintain a smooth swing and too much over seven pounds becomes a real pain to lug around by the end of the day. A Beretta A303 20 or Browning B-80 20 gauge is about as light a shotgun as I can swing smoothly and follow through. These are guns approaching the six pound area. Browning A-5 20 Mags and Sweet Sixteens are both closer to seven pounds, depending on barrel length, year of manufacture, and wood density, yet are still pleasant to carry. As much as I really appreciate A-5''s, there is nothing truly light about a "Light Twelve." Weighing around eight and a half pounds, the older I get the more I can feel such guns at the end of the day. An easy way to test shotgun weight is just to shoot a few crossers at the local skeet field or sporting clays course. If you need to consciously force your scattergun to keep swinging, you have probably gone a bit too far in the lightweight, whippy, stutter swing direction.\n\n [b]DOVE / SPORTING CLAYS[/b]\nFor dove hunting and sporting clays use, guns weighing from seven to eight pounds appear to be the most popular. Not having to walk nearly as far, the smoother swing and lower recoil of a heavier gun helps far more than it hurts. Most any weight gun can be used, but as far as I''m concerned any type of high volume shooting calls for a heavier, softer shooting gun.\n\n [b]SKEET[/b]\nEight to nine pounds is most popular in American skeet, in all gauges, because smoothly redundant swings are needed and hundreds of shells may be fired in one day. In the long run, it''s easier to be better with a heavy gun. Since we can shoot with our shotguns pre-mounted, there is no rush getting them up to the shoulder, either.\n\n [b]TRAP[/b]\n[i]Most of the top shooters want a gun over eight pounds and a lot of winners go to ten-pound guns or even heavier. Like skeet, trap shooting starts with the gun pre-mounted, and hundreds of shells may be fired in a day. Weight is not much of an issue, while long sighting planes (30-34 inch barrels are typical) and smooth swings rule the day.[/i]\n\n [b]WATERFOWL[/b]\nPumps and semi-autos are a fairly easy choice in a tight blind, as guns that need to be broken open to reload can be a real pain. Weight is no issue, and the heavier loads used and longer shots sometimes presented mean many opt for 30" barrels and a heavier, smoother swinging guns for pass shooting. Over decoys, 30 inch tubes have little advantage over shorter barrels, with the exception that some of the slower powders loaded in steel or other "no-tox" shot loads need plenty of barrel length to combust fully. A 16 or 20 gauge gun can actually do a pretty good job killing ducks over decoys.\n\n [b]TURKEY[/b]\nShooting relatively stationary targets on the ground is the antithesis of wing-shooting. Most anything can, and has, been used. However, most folks seem to want short-barreled, lightweight guns that are easy to carry. Fortunately, considering the heavy payloads normally employed, turkey hunting isn''t high-volume shotgunning. Not too many folks feel the gun after calling in a big tom.\n\n [b]CONCLUSION[/b]\nThese are just generalizations, and what you choose is a matter of individual preference. It does suggest that, although shooters are often searching for the best "all-around" shotgun, there really is no such thing and never has been.[/quote]\n\nTalalkhan\nI am very thankful to you for your detailed reply. I must say it is awesome and classic information. Take care gentleman, with best regards.', ''),

I sold min coz I missd those wingy rascals too... either u adjust or get rid.[/quote]\n\n\nhold u''r horses bro, russian guns dont hit higher than normal. allow me to explain.\n\nrussian guns are made with typical european standards of short length of pull (distance between trigger and where the buttstock ends). to put it in simple words, russian use shorter buttstocks.\n\nhaving said that, if a gun''s length of pull is short for a shooter it will cause it to shoot high, if a gun''s length of pull is long for a shooter, it will cause the shooter to shoot low.\n\na shotguns fit is very important, lemme repeat very important, unfortunately most people dont even know how to get their shotgun fitted to their body, once fitted, brother! u''ll be amazed, a properly fitted gun doesnt even need open eyes to mount and aim, once u get u''r shotgun fitted, just close u''r eyes mount and aim, open u''r eyes and u''ll be dead smack on the target.\n\nthis is exactly the reason i requested the starter of this post to google around and read a few articles, LOP (length of pull) is just one variable to consider, there are many such as cast, comb, drop and each and every one of the variables change the point of impact of the pellets.\n\nRegards.\n\np.s. i didnt even hire the services of a gun fitter, i did it myself, had to add two inches to the LOP of my guns, man! what  a difference it makes, makes shooting absolutely reflexive in nature. aiming needs are totally diminished, just mount the gun, look at the target and u''r gun will automatically follow.', ''),

(30853, ' excellent work 12 gauge. Just to add to the above mentioned information about the fit of the shotgun i would add few simple things. To my understanding the most important measurments of the shotgun with refference to its fit are LOP(Length of pull), DAC(Drop at comb) and cast. To check that which one is required to be adjusted following things can be done.\n\nFirstly, to check the length of the pull. Bend your shooting arm at right angle the way a bodybuilder shows his mussels. Hold your shotgun in such a way that butt of the gun rests on your arm and receiver of the gun touches your palm and barrel straight up. Now first joint of your index finger must touch the trigger of the gun, if it does length of pull is right for you. If it touches above your first joint of the fingger it needs to be reduced and it needs to be increased if it touches below the joint. Length of pull is the easiest to be changed as some guns come with spacers or you can use a longer or shorter recoil pad as wel. Length of the pull is greatly dependent on the hight of the shooter, length of his arms, his body weight  and the length of his hands. \n\nSecondly, to check the drop at comb(DAC) just close your eyes and mount your shotgun. Now open your eyes and look down the barrel of the shotgun. For an ideal DAC you must see the front beed fully neither too much of the rib nor too much of the back of the receiver. If you see too much of the back of the receiver of your gun, it means that DAC is low and it needs to be reduced (if the comb is adjustable just raise it ). I f you see too much of the rib it means that DAC is high and it needs to be increased(Just lower the comb to get an ideal sight of the front beed). If your gun does not come with an adjustable comb as almost all guns except some sporting models come with fixed combs you need an expert to do the job. You may ruin the beauty of your gun and at the same time can''t measure the exact change to be made.\n\nFinally, cast of the gun. It is the tilt of the butt towards the shooter or away from the shooter. Butts are tilted twards the shooters and a gun tilted towards the right hand shooter is said to be CAST OFF gun. As most of the guns are made for the right hand shooters so they can''t fit the lefties. For a left hand shooter cast will be required to be adjusted. This should also be done by an expert as amount of cast will depend on the built of th shooter.', ''),

If you see too much of the back of the receiver of your gun, it means that DAC is low and it needs to be reduced (if the comb is adjustable just raise it ). I f you see too much of the rib it means that DAC is high and it needs to be increased(Just lower the comb to get an ideal sight of the front beed).[/quote]\n\nhere u are dead smack on the target. however i must add that there are latest techniques to this, sometimes, operator cannot tell correctly what he is seeing. it is therefore advised to do pupil alignment test while aiming the gun. here the gun fitter asks u to mount the gun then sees the bead from the muzzle end of the barrel with pupil of the eye in the background, if everything is correct, bead should be right in the middle of the pupil (black/blue/green/brown portion of the eye).\n\ngun fitting is a proper science with a dab of art (my humble opinion). however this process no matter how lengthy and painful will do wonders for the operator.\n\nRegards.', ''),

I will start from the point that is not disputeable.\n\nFirstly, your coments about the cast of the gun.\n[quote]\nbutts are never tilted towards the shooter in any case, for a right handed shooter the butt is tilted towards right (cast off). for a left handed shooter, butts are tilted towards the left (cast on). see the above picture for cast off configuration( bottom and far right).\n [/quote]\n\nFriend, this is what i said, you mistakenly took wrong. when we say cast towards the body of the shooter, CAST OFF will be tilted towards the body of the right hand shooter and CAST ON will be tilted towards the body of the left hand shooter. Look in both cases "TOWARDS THE BODY OF THE SHOOTER". You can do this test just by mounting a gun on your left shoulder and right shoulder and there is no need to do any rocket science.\n\nNow the length of pull thing. You have added so many things, so many uncalculated things. You said..\n[quote]Now first joint of your index finger must touch the trigger of the gun\na very common mistake among inexperienced gun fitters, first of all, this bending of arm test is only an informal test (sort of like checking the tyre pressure by pressing it down with a foot, if its firm, tire is probably ok, however it is no concrete evidence of adequate air pressure in the tyre). second, if one has to do this age old test, make sure to measure it up to the middle of the second segment of the index finger, it is never advised to measure it up to the first joint of the index finger. third, it is never advised to put the gun there to measure up, why? cause the weight of the gun will press the biceps down, allowing more length to be squeezed in.\n[/quote]\n\nStarting an argument with the example of cheking air pressure by a foot in a tyre to the measurement of length of pull by gun bedding test is just comparing apples with oranges. As there is no way that by just pressing tyre with foot you can come to an exact numerical reading but by doing a gun bedding test you come to an exact measure.\n\nIn my previous post i said...\n[quote]Length of the pull is greatly dependent on the hight of the shooter, length of his arms, his body weight  and the length of his hands.[/quote]\n\nYour all measurements are regarding these variables arent they?? Now if we want to discuss other specific detais that are for gun smiths i would love to participate. The simple things that i mentioned were within the scope of a shooter not a gunsmith.\n\nLet me explain things again and keep them simple at the same time. Most of the guns are manufectured with a length of pull of 14.5" to 14.75". This length of pull is ideal for a person with 5'' 9" hight 33" arms length and 165lbs weight or that person wears a 40 size suit. When a gun is mounted its receiver shouldn''t be less than 2-3" from shooters face. This is what we get from the shelf. Here, you know there is no need to measure the nose, cheek bone or collar bone of the shooter. When we try to check the fit of the gun we just try to chek if there is a sizeable difference and that can easily done by this simple test that i mentioned in my earlier post. As far as that squeeze of bicep of the shooter with the weight of the gun is considered i leave it to the fellow shooters to do this test and furnish us the measurements that they get. In my humble opinion that squeeze of musseles of bicep will be offset by the squeeze of the musseles of the shoulder when gun will be mounted. \n\nHope you will post the other formal test that you pointed on in your post.\n\nNow another thing, you mentioned in your post that you have customized your gun by adding 2" in its length of pull.\n[quote]p.s. i didnt even hire the services of a gun fitter, i did it myself, had to add two inches to the LOP of my guns, man! what  a difference it makes, makes shooting absolutely reflexive in nature.[/quote]\n\nThis seems very nice work, Will you please give us the total LOP of your gun and your hight, arms length and weight. You can skip length of your nose.... :). As even BAIKALS don''t come with a LOP less than 14", your addition of 2" to any normal gun will end up with a gun with at least 16" LOP making it suitable for a person with hight of 6'' 4" or with extra ordinary long arms.\n\nHope this discussion will help us.', ''),

As even BAIKALS don''t come with a LOP less than 14", your addition of 2" to any normal gun will end up with a gun with at least 16" LOP making it suitable for a person with hight of 6'' 4" or with extra ordinary long arms.[/quote]\n\nwhat a coincidence, i''m 6 feet 3 inches tall, I used to play basketball for the Punjab team, WAPDA team, Rawalpindi division basketball team, Pakistan International Public School abbottabad team. i''ve got extra ordinary long arms.\n\nmoving on, I absolutely agree with u on the figures u gave 14 1/2 to 14 3/4 LOP for a 5''8 to 5''10 average male. i also agree with u when u said that i''m solving the LOP problem from a gunsmith point of view. cant help it there, the ones i consulted were professional gunfitters. \n\nbut the things that i dont agree wid u:\n\n1. look at the above posted picture again, u''ll see that the butt is tilted away from the right handed shooter and similarly tilted away from the left handed shooter (cast off and cast on)\n\n2. sir u said that i''ve added so many uncalculated things, sorry to disappoint u sir but the variables/tests that i gave are actually considered by professional gunfitters, the one u gave, arm bedding, allow me to quote what gunsmiths think of arm bedding test.\n\n"That tells you the length between your arm and your trigger finger, not much about how the stock fits you when your gun is mounted"\n\nKENT SUTTON: master gunfitter at browning center, arnold missouri. fitting guns since last 39 years.\n\nI can post multiple quotes brother, gimme sometime, I''m searching for email responses that I got when i was learning the gun fitting philosphy. i''ll post those emails too. almost every gunfitter i contacted simply brushed aside this proceedure for measuring LOP by arm bedding. it is only considered as a crude approximation. I wish i could do some of the gun fit tests on u in person to show u how detailed and mathematical my tests are. dont worry, my tests dont hurt a bit. ;)\n\none more thing: there is a popular saying in a gunfitter''s world. "beware of the fitter that fits a gun without a pattern board"\n\n3. u mentioned squeeze of the bicep is offset by squeeze of the shoulder, consult a doctor brother, he''ll correct u, biecps squeeze far more than shoulder, here is how my doctor just explained to me:\n\nwhen u lift u''r arm up (parrel to the floor) u''r shoulders actually buldge out. try it, lift ur arm up and out u''r body and feel ur shoulder. in the same position feel u''r bicep, it''ll be all mushy while u''r shoulder muscle (the one u mentioned) will be hard. having said that, there is no such thing as offset.\n\n[quote]Hope you will post the other formal test that you pointed on in your post.[/quote]\n\nwhich formal test are we talking about brother, as i''ve said earlier, gun fitting is a science with a dab of art. informal tests are arm bedding, nipple alingment and the foreplay part that i''ve mentioned earlier. formal tests are:\n\n1. add 3.175mm to 361.95mm for every inch taller you are to a 5 feet 9 inch person. example say a person is 6 feet, he is three inches taller than a 5''9 person, he needs to:\n\n3*(3.175) + 361.95 = 371.475mm = 14.625 inch LOP (mathematical approximation only, now way guarentees perfect fit as it doesnt take into account sleeve length)\n\n2. eyeballing: funny story, gunfitters kept saying eyeballing and i actually thought that they want me to scare the shooter by eyeballing into submission, i thought maybe with eyeballing the shooter kinda agrees with you that the gun is fit. it was later that i discovered that they were talking about pupil alingment test. this pupil alignment tests are extremely accurate in determining gun fit. this is the first test done by almost all experienced gunfitters.\n\nRegards.', ''),

(30956, ' @12 gauge, i am very much aware of the fit of the shotgun. It is as important for shotgun as important for the rifle are its sights. As in shotgun shooting there is no need of the front beed if gun fits to the shooter and shooter mounts the gun correctly. As we all know shotguns are shot both eyes opened and dominant eye of the shooter just behind the sight plane focused on the target. These all things point towards just one thing and that is fit of the shotgun. If the gun will not fit to the shooter there will be a below average shooting.\n\nAt the same time i am also aware of the fact that gun fit is not an absolute science of perfections but just a  \nbetter approximations of art. As killing range of shotguns dosen''t involve great distances and at the same time neither a pointblank perfeection(keeping in view the size of the pattern). So we can buy a readymade suit of an approximate size or get a tailor made for exact measurements. They both will serve the pupose unless we have bought a wrong size of a readymade garment. \n\nI am a practical rifle guy but a shotgun lover as wel, as they are my first love.

If you have a wapon then educate all adults about the safety precausions and how to use it in case of emergency (for Self Defence ONLY)\n4. As far as security of your valuables are concerned, the only advice would be, not to keep all your eggs in one basket (always scatter your valuble in seperate places)\n5. Please visit CPLC web-site for security instructions, they are really good. \n6. Never try to complete the scene by your self only... always seek help (call 15 or call your friends or family member to call 15 on behalf of you) \n7. Always make sure that your network of friends or relatives is there when you need them\n8. In case of any such miss-hap of break-in, bring all your family members in a room which is safe (strong doors, ideally have a cell-phone, some supplies (like water or food or First-aid stuff), Gun is good to have )\n9. In case if you are sure that the treat is reall and there is no false alarm then you can call police and fire some arial shots as a deterent.

(31159, ' [u][b]Gun culture in Pakistan[/b][/u]\n\nGun culture in Pakistan refers to the long-standing tradition of owning and carrying guns among Pathan men in the Northwest Frontier Province.The gun culture is linked to the "twin pillars of Pathan tribal society, melmastia—hospitality and badal—revenge. One of the centers of gun-manufacturing is the town of Darra Adam Khel, near Peshawar, which was historically known for manufacturing the Lee Enfield .303; however, the town now produces ordnance including the AK-47, the mini-Kalashnikov, and hand-held firearms, including the James Bond pen gun.\n\nThe North West Frontier Province (NWFP) is the smallest province of Pakistan with rugged and hilly terrain. Pashtun tribal feuds are common and guns are used both for protection and self-defense.\n\nIn the rural society Swat, the gun culture arose in part out of the traditional antagonism between a man and his tarbur (father''s brother''s son). According to Charles Lindholm:\n\n“ The pervasive hostility between the sons of brothers led to the development of a network of alliances within every village that divided it across lineages into two approximately equal parties, called dulla. Every man belonged to the dulla opposite that of his tarbur. This division ramified throughout the (Swat) valley, so that all of the nearly one million inhabitants visualized themselves as members of one of two eternally warring parties. ” \n\nOld customs and cultural norms also promote the gun culture. In NWFP, where the strong and tough Pashtuns reside, carrying a gun or a Klashinkov is a sign of honour and respect. A gun is also considered to be the jewel of a man in N.W.F.P., thus the social necessity emerging as an intimidating component of provincial culture.\n\nPakistani citizens and special category of foreigners can legally own firearms. A license is required to purchase a firearm which involves payment of fees, a processing time ranging from a few days to months and registration of the firearm with the local authorities. Present laws allow ownership of handguns of any caliber (at one time this was restricted up to the .38). However, rifles above the .22 caliber are prohibited (excluding those which were bought before this restriction was imposed). Shotguns above 12 gauge are not allowed. A person may keep a firearm at his/her place of residence, in one''s vehicle and concealed on person; public display is prohibited (though this law is honored more in the breach than in the observance, especially outside urban areas and in particular by private bodyguards of politicians). Special permits are required for carrying firearms during times when local authorities impose restriction on public gatherings to preempt civil unrest or protests that can turn ugly. In large cities, facilities exist for gun enthusiasts to practice shooting on targets, etc.\n\nSource:-http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gun_culture_in_Pakistan', ''),

Khyber Pass Copy rifles cannot generally stand up to the pressures generated by modern commercial ammunition.[81] and it is generally advised that Khyber Pass made firearms not be fired under any circumstances.[3]\n\nKhyber Pass Copies can be recognised by a number of factors, notably:\n\nSpelling errors in the markings; as noted the most common of which is a reversed "N" in "Enfield") \nV.R. (Victoria Regina) cyphers dated after 1901; Queen Victoria died in 1901, so any rifles made after 1901 should be stamped "E.R" (Edwardius Rex—King Edward VII or King Edward VIII) or "G.R" (Georgius Rex—King George V or King George VI). \nGenerally inferior workmanship, including weak/soft metal, poorly finished wood, and badly struck markings.[81]', ''),

Don''t know any provisions for light though.\n\nHaving a flashlight with the gun in a self defence situation is really useful, but then, everywhere a beam from a mounted light goes, the muzzle of a loaded, ready-to-go gun goes. I am not sure that I want the muzzle to be pointed in places it shouldn''t be. \n\nAs far as laser dots are concerned, my preference would be something integrated into the grips, like Crimson Trace, though I understand that it is a more expensive option. In my humble opinion, laser dots are more useful in the hands of a trained Special Forces member, rather than a civilian. I am willing to concede to the fact that laser dots do make aiming in the dark easier, but it takes a lot of practice.\n\nNow if they could make lights/lasers much more obtrusive (as in not requiring different holsters) the whole rail problem would cease to exist.', ''),

The Walther P22 (.22Lr) is a good, well made reliable pistol, but the fact remains that the .22 caliber is not much of a self defence round. That, and the fact the misfires are common in .22LR ammo, due to its nature (rimfire as compared to centrefire as in 9mm).\n\nThe .22LR round is not a very viable option as a personal defence round. In contrast, the 9mm is a much better option. Though, a .22 pistol is the best self-defence option for the handicapped or the elderly.\n\nI don''t know why but I wouldn''t want to trust my life to local made guns. I know that there are some very good pieces out there but... reliability is still a factor.\n\nIF given the above two to choose from, I would go with the Walther P22, due to it being compact and easy to carry.

(31804, ' Siachen is the Heighest Battle ground of World.Siachen is still an awful place to wage a war.Temperatures can fall below -55°C; and more soldiers are killed in avalanches than by gunfire. To mount an assault on an enemy-held mountaintop is often suicidal. Because of the lack of oxygen, attacking soldiers can climb only about five meters before they have to stop to catch their breath. If you let bare skin touch steel for more than 15 seconds—a finger on a trigger, for example—you risk severe frostbite.\nThe 50-mile-long glacier could not be a more unlikely battlefield. Located at altitudes of 18,000 ft. to 20,000 ft., the area is so inhospitable that when Kashmir was split between India and Pakistan following the war in 1971, peace negotiators did not bother to draw the line through it. Patrols from the two countries skirmished on Siachen in 1982. Since then, Islamabad and New Delhi have decided that vital strategic interests, particularly the control of mountain passes bordering the glacier, are at stake. Today a total of 10,000 Indian and Pakistani troops occupy bases in the area. The high altitude makes it especially hazardous duty for soldiers. Indian officials say as many as 500 Indian troops on the glacier die each year from altitude sickness or in accidents.\n\n\nGathered some pics for you of our brave soldiers at those heights.\n\n[url=http://www.postimage.org/][img]http://img6.imageshack.us/img6/143/46905480.jpg[/img][/url]\nAt 4,200 meters above sea level, a Pakistani Army soldier practices a mountain descent during exercises in the Siachen Glacier region.\n\n\n[url=http://www.postimage.org/][img]http://img189.imageshack.us/img189/1746/17080322.jpg[/img][/url]\nAn officer sits in front of a fiberglass igloo used as living quarters.

They have also initiated a move to plant trees to preserve nature which is under threat due to climate change, persistent water scarcity and low-intensity of rains.\n\nThe two men are related by blood. They hail from Nabi Bux Palari village, situated near scenic Jhimpir off Keenjhar lake. They are the only literate people in their village and seemingly the icons for their coming generations.\n\nKamal and Hameed of local Palari family used to be hunters of partridges and water birds at the Keenjhar lake area for quite a long time. According to Hameed, they used to hunt about 50 birds (partridges) in a single trip and had also been facilitating visiting hunters.\n\nThey give credit to the survey team of WWF (World Wildlife Fund) Indus for All Programme that visited their village and convinced them about the importance of preserving natural resources such as water, fish, forests and birds. “The words of the visiting WWF official made us think,” says Kamal Palari.\n\nAccording to him, after frequent visits of the WWF team they realized that how much importance the natural resources bear for the local community and why they should help protect nature around their own village. Then the villagers not only formed a community-based organization (CBO) but at the same time a cluster of nine villages became members of the Keenjhar Maroora Welfare and Development Organization.\n\nAfter the formation of the CBO, they took initiatives, particularly the “declaration of a no-hunting zone” in the area, convincing hunters to not kill birds. These two guys are active members of the CBO which had given this idea. Nobody is allowed to go for hunting of any kind of birds or mammals in the jurisdiction of the sanctuary from Jhimpir to Chull (the northern side of Keenjhar lake).\n\nThey took this decision after realizing the fact that the hunting pressure is the main cause of population decline of wild animals. After community involvement, WWF Indus for All Programme’s Keenjhar Site Manager Zahid Jalbani said now there was a significant increase in the number of birds and other animals in the no-hunting zone.\n\nThe availability of partridge groups indicates that now the birds were not facing any threat of hunting, particularly in the no-hunting zone, explained Hameed.\n\nJalbani claims that the CBO has now taken the initiative to plant Eucalyptus and Jatropha in their village. Farmer Field School has been established in which about 30 farmers from different villages have been enrolled to adopt the best practices management model (BMP) with the implementation of integrated pest management (IPM) technology.\n\nThrough the BMP model, four farmers have been trained as master trainers and they have established a demo plot for growing vegetables as per IMP technology.', ''),

(31955, ' AOA Guys, \n\nWell check out the below link which might help you in making your decision about CF98. \n\n[url]http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15qsJgnm0sw[/url]\n\nAs far as NP-42 is concerned it would be very difficult to find nowadays as CF98 is more in the market due to the transfer of manufacturing to Chang Feng Machinery Tools from where it gets its designation as CF. By the way Chang Feng is working under NORINCO. \n\nAs for my experience, i fired 50 rounds in about 20 mins from my CF98, without any jam or misfire, fired at a range of more then 50 meters, having pretty accurate results. Recoil is minimum as you can see in the video, but if you loosen your grip then it will definitely give a big recoil, which you guys can also see in the video as i did loosen my grip a few times.\n\nIts a robust weapon which can fire any type of bullet be it chinese, russian 9mm luger, POF or american. It can fire even DAP rounds. \n\nGuys do keep in mind that CF98 or NP42 has become the standard weapon of the Chinese Army, Police, Hong Kong Police and also as Type-92 of Bangladesh Army, which would mean that this is a pretty good & reliable weapon good as Chinese don''t induct average weapons. The chinese TT is a good example in front of you, which has been in service for decades now and is like by nearly everyone as its a strong and reliable weapon. And today''s CF98 are 8000 round barrel life which is more then enough for ppl who wish to keep it as a SD weapon. \n\nCF98 in Peshawar is for 35K nowadays. The one i bought has CF98-9mm written on it with a Shaheen Logo. \n\nI had pasted the image on some of the CF98 related forums. \n\nWould like to have your guys feed back also. \n\nThx', ''),

In a nutshell is there anything specific break in that you recommend ?[/quote]\n\nbreak-in proceedure is pretty simple, just fire 100-200 typical hunting cartridges cartridges before trying out lighter loads.\n\nanother new discovery in the break-in I read somewhere is that just load two snap caps or fired/spent cartridges in the magazine tube and then simply pull the cocking handle then dry fire then cycle the cocking handle/bolt manually as this will eject the snap cap/cartridge and load the other one into the chamber then dry fire again and maually cycle the cocking handle/bolt. do this proceedure 100 times and you are finished with the break-in proceedure.\n\ntry this, theoratically, i dont see a reason why this proceedure shouldnt work. as far as plain theory or mechanics is concerned, break-in is just supposed to cycle to the gun multiple time in order to settle all working parts in their desired position and rub/grind the action smooth to permit easy future cycling.\n\nRegards.', ''),

(381474, ' [QUOTE=selfdefence26;219986]Dear Brothers,\r\nI went last week to the Home Dept to make a computerized licence. I got there at about 10 am. You have to get a guest pass in order to enter Home Dept. Since the line was very long I got hold of a Police Constable and told him I want to enter. He refused first, but after some haggling allowed me to enter the building with a promise to give him some "Chai Pani" on my way back.\r\n\r\nOnce I entered, there was 3 or 4 other policeman near the entrance to the HOme Dept. They also asked me for a pass, but after talking with them, they also asked for Chai Pani. Promised them also for something on my way back.\r\n\r\nWent straight to the "Computerized Licences Dept". Quite straightforward from that moment on. First showed one guy copies of my original and photocopied Gas bill, PTCL bill and NTN Certificate. He looked at them (all in my own name) and told me to come along with him to the Section Officer Arms Mr.Peerbux for approval. He took me to his room which was filled with people. Anyways, managed to get approval within 10 mins and the SO signed on one of my docs for approval.\r\n\r\nAfter this, the person told me to go fill the Challan in National Bank Income tax branch which is close to HD. Got the form (photocopied from outside) and then attached my NIC copy and paid the Challan for Rs.4500/.\r\n\r\nAfter paying the challan then went again to HD and the person made me the Token (Just like nadra). After taking the TOKEN i went home because they was a lot of rush and I had to get to work soon.\r\n\r\nNext day I came to HD on Friday around 9.45 am. There was no one there except me. Took the photo and the other guy took out a printout of my details (just like passport printout) and then gave me a Verification form (Police) which is addressed to the SSP Verification branch/Special branch. This I asked is the Arambagh PS branch. Now the verification seems quite long. I hope to get some source to do the verification for me and will let u all know.\r\nAll in all a ONe day process if u have all yr docs.\r\nSD 26[/QUOTE]\r\n \r\nThank you brother for the information.', ''),

After getting the license there would be entry at NBP and after purchase there would be an entry at DCO Office  which is common for both licences. There are empty pages in computerized licences for these endorsements.  It is not like Card licence where everytime u purchase or change weapon u need a new card.

The balance is great, the rear sights are adjustable and it also comes with a loaded chamber indicator which is quite rare in a .22 pistol. This is the kind of pistol that you want to get if you''re into light competition shooting or using at the range. The Walther P22 series and Sig Mosquito are more of a conceal carry light backup pistols. \n\nThis pistol sells for around 125 - 130 K that is if you can find it which is next to impossible.

It''s in dire need of an overhaul, along with a rethinking of our current gun laws and attitudes towards firearms in general. I think it''s high time we legally begin to accept a couple of things:-\n\n1)  Weapons are MUCH easier to procure than licenses\n2)  ANYBODY can get their hands on automatic weapons\n3)  Firearm forensics & techniques simply don''t exist in Pakistan\n4)  Although we, as a nation, feel that it is our God-given right to bear arms, we are not willing to accept the great responsibility that comes with it\n\nI think ultimately even if we modernize the laws, it will make little or no difference because we, as a people, are simply unwilling to change. For example, despite knowing the hazards and potentially fatal outcomes of aerial firing, every Tom, Dick & Harry continues to blast away!

(32328, ' [quote=Imu10]i know adnan very well and adnan alo knows me very well but u know when it comes to business he never does anything he is expensive as his shop is in such a posh location like zamzama but still i can talk and ask for a favor from him \nand as for the rifle i dont know if u have a budget i would advic you to buy a [b]270 win [/b]bolt action this calibre will fullfill all ur plain hunting game needs available in pakistan 270 is a much better calibre than and much better hitting power and flatter trajectory than a 7mm but what is ur budget for a bolt action rifle ?[/quote]\n\n\nExcellent advice!! A 270 Win. is more than enough rifle for all Pakistani game, ranging from chinkara to Ibex and Urial.  Frankly hitting power (retained energy) at range between 100-200 yards matter a lot more than muzzle velocity and trajectory. There are many proponents of the relatively flat shooting 22-250, which is essentially a varmint calibre, but they will never tell you how many animals they have lost despite shooting them through and through (aar paar).  Therefore, it is better to be over-gunned  than under-gunned. \n\nIn terms of what available in the market these days, if you are looking for an all rounder rifle, with which you can take everything from chinkara, hogdeer, ibex, urial and wildboar,  your first choice shd be the 270, followed by 30-06, 308 and 7mm. \n\nHowever, in Pakistan, choice of rifle is often dictated by the choice of ammo available. Before you finalise your rifle, I would suggest you look for ammo - 130 grain soft nose for 270 Win, 150-168grain soft nose for 30-06, 140-145 grain soft nose for 7mm and 150-165 grain for 308. \n\nOnce you find a good batch of relatively fresh bullets in this weight range, buy abt 200 of them. Make them sure that they are from the same batch and the same weight and the same brand. Different bullets have different points of impact. For example, a 130 grain 270Win bullet made by Prvi Partizan might hit dead on at 200 yards through your rifle, but the same bullet made by Winchester may hit an inch higher. \n\nIdeally speaking, you should first buy your rifle and scope then shoot 5 shot groups of all different brands and weights available for you calibre to see which ones group the best at say 200 yards. For this exercise your rifle just needs to be bore sighted, and hitting the bull''s eye since you are interested in seeing which bullet your rifle prefers the most. Allow your rifle to cool down between the groups, as hot  barrels behave differently than cold ones, and may not give you a true group. \n\nOnce you have found the bullet your rifle likes the most, go out an buy hundreds of those, zero your scope on them, and then use those bullets for the rest of your rifle. \n\nHowever, this is in an ideal situation. In a country like Pakistan,. where you dont have much choice, you must first find a rifle you like, then look for suitable ammo. Once you have found the ammo, buy a large enough batch of it, say 200 bullets at least, then get your rifle and scope, zero your rifle.  And then hunt happily ever after.\n\nAvoid the temptation to collect a motley crew of bullets, as this will do you no good. It is much better to be skilled with one rifle and one bullet, than to be unskilled with several. Thoise who shoot one rifle and one bullet often have their freezers stocked, and their walls adorned with trophies. Those who collect guns and bullets, have just those.', ''),

They also asked me for a pass, but after talking with them, they also asked for Chai Pani. Promised them also for something on my way back.\r\n\r\nWent straight to the "Computerized Licences Dept". Quite straightforward from that moment on. First showed one guy copies of my original and photocopied Gas bill, PTCL bill and NTN Certificate. He looked at them (all in my own name) and told me to come along with him to the Section Officer Arms Mr.Peerbux for approval. He took me to his room which was filled with people. Anyways, managed to get approval within 10 mins and the SO signed on one of my docs for approval.\r\n\r\nAfter this, the person told me to go fill the Challan in National Bank Income tax branch which is close to HD. Got the form (photocopied from outside) and then attached my NIC copy and paid the Challan for Rs.4500/.\r\n\r\nAfter paying the challan then went again to HD and the person made me the Token (Just like nadra). After taking the TOKEN i went home because they was a lot of rush and I had to get to work soon.\r\n\r\nNext day I came to HD on Friday around 9.45 am. There was no one there except me.

(32495, ' Wadcutter\nFrom Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\nA wadcutter is a special-purpose bullet specially designed for shooting paper targets, usually at close range and at subsonic velocities typically under 800 ft/s (244 m/s). They are often used in handgun and airgun competitions. A wadcutter has a flat or nearly flat front that cuts a very clean hole through the paper target, making it easier to score and ideally reducing errors in scoring the target to the favor of the shooter. Because the flat nosed bullet is not well suited for feeding out of a magazine, wadcutters are normally used only in revolvers or in specially-designed semi-automatic pistols.\n\nWadcutters are typically made from lead; as such, deposition of lead into the rifling grooves of barrels, and into the forcing cones of revolvers, limits the maximum usable velocity of wadcutters to less than about 900 ft/s; as a few shots fired at higher velocities may cause severe leading of the rifling and of the forcing cone, introducing a potentially dangerous condition from overpressure if FMJ (Full Metal Jacket) bullets are subsequently fired without first removing the lead buildup. Either a mechanical lead removing tool (i.e., a Lewis Lead Remover or a generic equivalent) and/or chemical removal techniques may be used to remove the lead build-up from shooting wadcutters at too high a velocity.\n\nWadcutters can be loaded flush with the brass case, such as seen in the accompanying picture, or they may also be set to extend out of the brass case, depending on what provides the most accuracy, the desired powder capacity of the case, or other desired criteria. Both varieties of wadcutters (flush, or extending out of the case) are commercially available. Although primarily intended for target practice, wadcutters are also sometimes used for close-in self-defense and hunting, because their sharp edges and close-range accuracy increase lethality. (See Keith bullet for more on these wadcutter and semiwadcutter applications involving self-defense and hunting applications.)\n\nTarget airguns used for 10 metre air rifle and 10 metre air pistol competitions generally shoot wadcutter pellets at velocities around 175 m/s (574 ft/s). The use of wadcutter match diabolo pellets is nearly universal in airgun target shooting where often paper targets are used.\n\n[url=http://www.postimage.org/][img]http://img127.imageshack.us/img127/9913/96714573.jpg[/img][/url]\n\n[url=http://www.postimage.org/][img]http://img127.imageshack.us/img127/6972/20307791.jpg[/img][/url]', ''),

At this stage don''t tighten them fully as you might want to slide them up and down a little.\n\nNow take scope and place it on top of the open rifle mounts.\n\nPosition the eyepiece by sliding the scope back and forwards. You may have to move one or both rings to get this right. \nPosition the rings so the scopes eyepiece will be the correct distance from your shooting eye when the gun is held naturally. \nThis is usually between 2 and 3 inches from the eyepiece lens, but it is the spot at which the image in the scope appears as full and bright as it gets. \nTo see what this looks like, move your head back and forth along the stock, as you look through the scope with both eyes open. \nThen, position your head on the cheek piece where you want it to be and move the scope back and forth until the image appears bright and full. \nMake sure the windage and elevation turrets are positioned correctly - Elevation (up and down cross-hair adjustment) on top and windage (left and right movement) to the right.\n\n\nThen put the top mount brackets on and tighten - Tighten them until the scope is held secure but can still be rotated with your hand (Not very tight)\n\n\nNow align the vertical cross-hair with both eyes open and the gun held naturally to your shoulder. Rotate the scope until the vertical reticle seems to bisect the gun perfectly. \nOK? Yes - Now tighten the base of the rings securely to the gun top (NOT the top rings yet, that''s next)\n\n\nNow it''s time to tighten the top cap rings. You need to take this carefully and slowly as it''s a critical step. It''s not hard, just be patient. \nTighten each screw partially, then move to the next one and go around the pattern of screws many times, rather than tightening each screw all the way on the first try. \nYou will put even tension on the caps and be less likely to dent the scope tube this way. \nIf there are two screws on the side of the ring, tighten only one, then tighten the one on the opposite corner of the other side of the cap (see graphic below). \nLeave the other two screws for the moment and tighten two screws on the other ring next. \nThen come back to mount one and tighten the two screws you left loose. \nThen back to the other ring and keep rotating until the scope is secure. \nIt takes less tightening that you might think. They need be firm not as tight as possible. Err on the side of too loose, rather than too tight.\n\nThis is the order of screw tighten in the case of a double screw mount. If you have a single screw each side then do it as 1 - 4 - 5 - 8 (you get my drift I hope) basically you want pressure to be as even as possible throughout the process and not risk damaging the tube of having uneven pressure on one side that will make zeroing more difficult.\n\n[url=http://www.postimage.org/][img]http://img6.imageshack.us/img6/2184/92231829.jpg[/img][/url]', ''),

(32501, ' Air rifles can be zeroed in by shooting at a pellet target card or card in a trap at only 10 feet.\n\nTo do it this way you MUST wear safety glasses and ricochets ARE going to happen 100% definite. Also make sure that anyone else with you has them on too. \n\nIf you don''t have safety glasses get some! If you don''t and are impatient to get going (sighs) then try this method but extended distance to 30 feet or more.\n\nNow it''s time to zero the scope for shooting:\n\n1- Adopt your standard prone/lie down shooting position. \n\nProne is the best way as if you test shoot from standing or kneeling positions you waver more and it''s harder to do a "true test". \n\nMake sure your windage and elevation turrets are ready for adjusting i.e., caps removed.\n\n2- Draw 1 or 2 small dots on a piece of cardboard about 6.5cm apart vertically.  \nThere''s no precision to this step. You just want enough room on the target so no shots are lost. At 10 feet, they can''t go too far. \n\nIf your scope has parallax adjustment, adjust it as close as it will go. If it has variable power, adjust it as low as it will go. \n\nThe aim point will probably be a little fuzzy at this distance. \n\nAim at the top dot. Expect your first shot to be as much below the dot as the center of your scope is above your gun barrel. If that''s 7cm then that''s how low the shot should go. \n\nThen take another shot using the same aim point - this is to confirm the aim point as good as you can.\n\n[url=http://www.postimage.org/][img]http://img6.imageshack.us/img6/9521/30123263.jpg[/img][/url]\n\n3 - Keeping in mind where your first 2 shots went adjust the windage and elevation turrets . \nAt only 10 feet this will take a lot of clicks. \n\nYour objective is to get your shots in line with the lower target dot. Keep shooting and adjusting until you get there.\n\n[url=http://www.postimage.org/][img]http://img6.imageshack.us/img6/6364/15008467.jpg[/img][/url]\n\n4- Now it''s time to get serious. Move the target out to 10 metres (33 or so feet) \nTake more shots and see where they land. \n\nIn this example they went off to the right a bit too much so adjust the windage (left and right) dial and few clicks - not so many are needed at this longer distance. Experiment.\n\n[url=http://www.postimage.org/][img]http://img6.imageshack.us/img6/1134/68380807.jpg[/img][/url]\n\n5- One you''re aligned correctly at the horizontal level at 10 metres it''s time to get the vertical zero sorted out. \nYour shot pattern should look like this now (see point 4) \n\nAt longer distance your shots will rise but stay in line side to side.\n\n[url=http://www.postimage.org/][img]http://img6.imageshack.us/img6/9489/80307909.jpg[/img][/url]\n\n6- Now move the target out to 20-30 metres and shoot 5 shots. \nIf you know what your standard - average shooting range is then set your target at that range. \n\nThey should all be pretty close on the top dot now. \n\nMake any small tweaks to bring them closer to the dot and you''re about done.\n\n[url=http://www.postimage.org/][img]http://img6.imageshack.us/img6/8518/52915667.jpg[/img][/url]\n \nYou now know that at less than this range your shots will fall lower than the aim point so you can mentally adjust your aim to compensate. \n\nAlso, at about 5 metres further away the pellet will again fall lower than the aim point, so you can adjust again. \nIt''s trial and error basically but with testing you''ll get to where you need to be and be able to trust that your shots will go where it says they will! This may take some time and a lot of shots. Be patient!', ''),

I also enjoyed firing the RUGER, pistol has a bull barrel, crisp trigger, excellent balance, comfortable grip, easily accessible controls and nice adjustable(rear, also drilled for scope) sights. Gun fired flawlessly during the entire shooting session that wasn''t short. We used three types of bullets, hollow points, ELEY sporter. RWS 22 CLUB, all went flawlessly. I think the gun is made to break the myth about being ammo selective of the 22 semi auto pistols. The gun is ideal for target shooting and small game hunting as it has 6 and half inches long bull barrel with excellent accuracy. Gun is also ideal for learning shooting as it has full size dimensions of big bores and economy of 22lr. In short the gun is an excellent purchase and is a must have for every shooter.', ''),

(32634, ' Quail is a collective name for several genera of mid-sized birds in the pheasant family Phasianidae. New World quails (family Odontophoridae) and buttonquails (family Turnicidae) are not closely related but named for their similar appearance and behaviour.\n\n\nIn his posthumously published Meditations, the Roman Emperor Marcus Aurelius mentions quail-fighting, so we know that the practice is at least two thousand years old and probably far older. \nQuail fighting is a common hobby in Pushtun society. Once a Batair (fighting quail) runs away from the Maidaan (quail fighting arena) then it loses its heart and cannot face even a weaker quail to fight, hence is called “Bhagail Marraz”. Usually such quails are slaughtered by the Batair Baaz (quail betters) for a delicious roast.\n\n[url=http://www.postimage.org/][img]http://img12.imageshack.us/img12/2683/69534939.jpg[/img][/url]\n\nSerious injuries are far more common among hockey players, and birds have no teeth to get knocked out. \n[url=http://www.postimage.org/][img]http://img12.imageshack.us/img12/3034/57300720.jpg[/img][/url]\n\n[url=http://www.postimage.org/][img]http://img12.imageshack.us/img12/5185/59220638.jpg[/img][/url]\n\n\n[url=http://www.postimage.org/][img]http://img12.imageshack.us/img12/9127/38158861.jpg[/img][/url]\nWatching the actual fight often consists of seeing the two birds strut about for a minute then go into a spinning ball of feathers.

In theory it''s not that difficult but in reality and for the first time does get a few curse words out of you that you didn''t realize you knew ;)\n\nTo help future owners of the Mark III, I''m adding a few links that will prove invaluable should you decided to do a disassemble clean.

Two tone. slide not completely black, rather gives more sportish looks.. its dark maroon/black mix, sort of some alloy made slide, have polished barrel bore, shallow rifling , like that we find in colt 1911 barrel, 6-groove right hand twist. \nSights vs, barrel''s center bore line vs slide fitting alignment is 100% perfect and upto the mark.. shoots straight where you aim at. doesnt exhibit any sort of rust on it after use of 1 year.\nInstalled hogue full wrap around grips for 3000rs, pistol was tagged as 25K where as i had special links through another person with the shopkeeper after a lil hanky panky i paid only 16500rs for it and took it to home. \nThe gun is used on range once and our own piece of land several times where we have shot on paper targets with it using norinco/POF/american eagle FMJs and federal JHPs. To this day it has never failed to feed a round or failed on extration, being very honest with this pakmade weapon.\nHave fired more than 600 rounds through it, along better desi rounds.. yes it has misfired a couple of times with desi rounds, not pistols fault rather the round was hit harder on the primer than it ever could ideally, and sometimes a dumb primer takes a DA trigger pull to fire after once it has misfired but thats all with desi ammo. Otherwise it has never misfired on chinese or POF ammo. \nBarrel is still going good, i was a lil upset when on day 2nd i found its rifling to be so shallower but after this much of a drag, i would say apprently the rifling is still clean and clear as it was on day 1. But again thats only 600 rounds, i hope it to last upto 4000 rounds but thats again my guess. \nIts acurate upto 20 meters. With my amateur skills i can manage to deliver a couple of rounds within 8 inch circle before i get fatigued due to continous firing.. i am not an expert on trigger control yet but if this thing goes on good i think ill love to master a beretta 92FS on it before buying an italian one which ofcourse i currently dont afford. Over all i am pretty damn sure that with a quick draw from holster and simple point shooting this gun will deliver the bolt to the chest within 15 meters. So i rate it as my SD gun nonetheless.\nYes - firepin once got broken, after only a box of 50 rounds, replaced it and now its going like smoothest butter gun.. shoots everytime on demand. After every shooting tour i prefer to check its internals more specifically the 1- locking block and 2- the slide corners where the locking block hits upon blow back action. To my goodness they are as good as they were on the day 1.\nI can bet my life on this gun because i know it will send a bolt right where i will point it and whenever i demand it to do so. Yes its a little heavier like 1 KG approx a few like 50 grams more than an original FS. I trust this weapon and feel confident with it. Usually I carry it with concealed carry permit inside Punjab having NPB Lahore based license. \n\nPFA pictures below with and without Hogue wrap arounds.\nand for the target video click below:\nVideo Link:\n[url]http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zb7Grt3wkG8[/url]\n\nHappy shooting and safe carry.. ;)\nRegards,\nM.

You cannot leave your barrel un-cleaned and relubed, immediately after a shooting session.\n\n-You cannot trust your fire pin and extractor in NIB clone gun, always perform a remake by an expert gunsmith who have mastered 92''s. Believe me there are such good gunsmith available who have a command on this weapon atleast. Same story goes with the trigger, you might like to have a trigger job done too by such a gunsmith (but do this sometime later like after firing 500+ rounds) - just for the sake of break-in period. Un-refined firearms do require more break-in time.\n\nBefore buying, you really need to verify these points, because they vary... in piece to piece within the same brand/manufacturer''s collection:\n\n- slide to frame fit, the weapon should not rattle when shaked vigorously (take magazine out before doing that)\n\n- Locking block''s balance with respect to Slide recesses where it fits in, when gun is in full lockup, i.e. when slide is fully forward. Imbalanced pistol in this aspect will break the locking block or crack the slide recesses very soon.\n\n- barrel rifling and feed ramp (modern shallow type rifling is looked for here in this regard) and a good polished smooth feed ramp.\n\n- the most important of all is, barrel to slide fit. When pistol is in lock-up (slide fully forward) hold your muzzle and try to move your barrel horizontally. It should not move or atleast it should seem to avoid any such movement(if not rock solid in this position)\n\n-also keeping above point in mind next thing you should do is, rack the slide once, (DOUBLE CHECK MAGAZINE IS OUT AND WEAPON IS EMPTY CHAMBERED), look through the muzzle by keeping it 2 feet away from your eye, such that you manage to exactly align the front sight with the rare sight. Keep holding in that position, verify visually, the barrel / the slide / the sights MUST BE in perfect alignment and straightness. Here at this point, if there''s any manufacturing/Fitting flaw, it will be disclosed to you. SUCH A PISTOL will never shoot good, infact such a pistol is not to be labelled as a true firearm indeed. This flaw is very much likely to occur in every 2/3 pistols that are born in our LOCAL factories. \n\nI hope by looking at all above aspects with clear mind and great detail.. you can pick a nice piece. It will serve you well and you will enjoy shooting it.\n\n\n\n******* UPDATE - Practice time *******\n\nMy Sunday Shoot (25th Oct, 09)\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nLocation: private land enclosure, Sadhoke GT road, Pakistan.\nWeapon: Beretta 92FS clone\nAmmo: Local factory reloads w/ Federal 9mm cases\nTarget Distance: 12 meters approx +/- 1 meter\nTarget type: Home made unprofessional type/white chart paper wrapped on dead tree trunk\nNumber of Shots: 30approx\nShooter: Myself \nIssues: Last round from the mag FTE reason might be under powered as its local reloaded ammo.\n\nVideo Link:\n[url]http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WxbBl-CTjTg[/url]\n\nTarget Later on:\n\n[url=http://www.postimage.org/][img]http://s2.postimage.org/sat0i.jpg[/img][/url]\n\n[url=http://www.postimage.org/][img]http://s2.postimage.org/savvr.jpg[/img][/url]\n\n[url=http://www.postimage.org/][img]http://s2.postimage.org/sax_A.jpg[/img][/url]', ''),

Last i heard provincial licenses to be made for 12-14k. Well i could be of some help if you tell me which zone do you live in like east or other. If you live in the east side and your TPO/DIG lies in Gulshan side then i can refer you to a dealer who can make all sindh license for 12-14k within 20 days. They are actually having problems for police verifications in other zones.\n@Memon, the direct process is too hectic and nearly impossible to go on with. If nothing happens you will be waiting for your book for months and in the end you will have to pay a hefty amount to get your book. The direct process however sounds simple but is not. You first have to download the form from sindh home dept website and then fill it in. You will have to take the filled form and the verification form to the dco and then he will keep the form and tell you to get the verification form filled by your TPO and DIG. After youve done that and submitted it to the dco, you simply relax for an indefinite time period and then your form will be fwded to the home dept. After approval from home dept. they will ask you to bring the challan paid from the post office. After submitting the challan you will again have to relax and wait for an indefinite period and then you will start visiting the dco asking them for your book but in the end they will either ask you upfront money and you will pay them or you will loose hope and forget about the license. And one day you will get a call to collect your license finally lol :D hows that..\nEarlier on when the powers rested with the Dco''s it was a little easier and would cost you less but now without prior approval from the home dept. no license can be issued by the Dco.', ''),

So it''s always a challenge for him to walk uphill. In Feb 2009, Mr. Bond shot a Sindh Ibex & Blandford Urial for which he had to walk all the way to the top of two hilly habitats and undertook 8 hours of walk for each of his hunts. During these long & hard walks, he felt so breathless and suffered so much pain in his knees any other macho man would have given up.

Once prepared, the licences would be issued to the applicants in person. Copies of the arms licenses would be issued only after the approval of the interior secretary or by an officer authorised by him.\n\nMeanwhile, a meeting of the sub-committee of Standing Committee on Interior was held at Parliament House, with Interior Secretary Kamal Shah informing the committee that action was being taken against corrupt officials in the arms licensing branch.\n\nSource: [url]http://www.dailytimes.com.pk/default.asp?page=2009\\07\\08\\story_8-7-2009_pg7_26[/url]', ''),

(33630, ' In response to the keen interest shown by the members to my earlier post "How to zero a rifle scope", here is an article to help members understand how a rifle scope works, what are its major components and what various numbers printed on them mean. I hope members would find this article interesting and helpful.\n\nCC.\n\nIf you''ve just bought a fancy new rifle and you need a new scope to put on top of your rifle, you need to understand all the different models and styles available today.\n\nThe first thing to understand is how a scope works. A scope is a metal tube that encases a series of coated glass lenses. This allows the target to be viewed on the same focal plane as the sights. Rather than trying to keep the rear sight and front sight and the target all in focus all at the same time, everything is in focus together and if you add magnification, you have an almost perfect system for sighting.\n\nHere are some of the terms used by the optic industry and what they mean for you.\n\nSpecifications of a scope are usually stated as: 3-9x40mm, or 4x32mm, or some variation of numbers. The numbers before the ''x'' refer to the magnification and this can be a fixed number (ie, 4), or a variable number, (ie. 3-9). Whatever that number, it means your target will appear that many times closer than it actually is. The number after the ''x'' refers to the diameter of the objective lens, expressed in millimeters.\n\nScopes are either fixed-power or variable-power. Fixed power scopes are permanently set at a given level of magnification, but variable-power scopes allow for adjustment. In the past, variable-power scopes weren''t as durable as fixed-power scopes and gained a bad reputation from a lot of hunters. But, today there are so many advances in technology as well as exhaustive training by manufacturers, that most variable-power scopes are just as rugged as fixed-power scopes. It is hard to beat the versatility of of a variable-scope. Variables in the 2-7x, 3-9x, or 2.5-10x are most popular for hunting big game and fixed powers of  4x or 6x are more popular with hunters who still prefer the simplicity of a fixed-power scope.\n\nVariable power scope allows you to crank up the magnification to a higher setting if you find yourself needing to take a long shot and yet keep the scope on a low setting whenever you encounter game up close or moving. \n\nWhen it comes to the size of the scope''s objective lens, the bigger it is, the larger the field of view FOV) will be at any given magnification setting.  Depending on the coatings on the lenses, the brighter the scope will be. This is a major advantage scopes have over iron sights.\n\nHigher quality scopes are able to gather all available light into the scope and utilizes it in such a way that you can actually see better during low-light conditions than with the naked eye. The key here, is high-quality! What makes a high quality scope? Special coatings are applied to the surface of a lens to reduce glare and the amount of light lost during the transmission of the target to your eye. The quality, number and  position of these coatings determine how much light is transmitted. Here are your options:\n\ncoated – a single layer is applied to at least one lens\nfully coated – a single layer is applied to all air-to-glass surfaces\nmulti-coated – multiple layers are applied to a least one lens surface\nfully multi-coated – multiple layers are applied to all air-to-glass surfaces\n\nThe more coatings,  usually translates into a more expensive and high-quality scope. Most of the high-quality scopes are also waterproof, fogproof, and shockproof. These are not cheap! As in most optics, you do get what you pay for.', ''),

(34049, ' [quote=PakistanGuides][quote=Turumti]I have heard of a 36" urial being taken by a local hunter. I didnt see the trophy, but I have little reason to doubt him, as the man has some of the best trophies you will ever see.\n\nAs for ibex, I think the largest so far has been a 52" shot a by a local hunter. \n\nFinally, regarding poaching, I consider shooting females and young ones poaching, shooting animals from helicopters is poaching. But a nice big male taken fairly is not poaching. It''s all a question of ethics.[/quote]\n\nLol ... my dear Turumti Jee before I reply you, let me first underline your comment starting with "FINALLY" !\n\nNo I''m afraid I & millions of ethical hunters & conservators around the world will not agree with your above or any other definition of poaching because it has become an established fact that any hunting that is done without procuring license from your Govts, paying the hunting permit fees or generating fiscal benefit for the conserving community or contributing to the conservation of the animals which you are hunting  and/or hunting in off season or hunting over and above the prescribed bag limits or usinf traps .. etc are all illegal forms of hunting and falls in the category of poaching ... no matter whatever logic, reasoning and justrification you give ...! It''s just like some pathans from NWFP justifying their smuggling as legitimate business ...! and when you listen to their logic and reasons ... you get so easily convinced that they are right but actually they are not ![/quote]\n\nKaiser Sahab, \n\nWho do you think the poachers in Pakistan are? The man who shoots an urial with his single barrel shotgun to get some meat deep in the heart of Balochistan, hundreds of miles from the nearest K&N outlet. Or the moneyed shikaries who drive out to the border line, courtesy of their connection with karnal falaana and brigadier dhamaka, and then rip loose on chinkaras, pharas, and nilgai with shotguns and SMGs, wound half a dozen animals, collect only one, and let the other five die a miserable death. \n\nMy friend the ultimate law is your conscience. \n\nAs for permits not being fairly issued to Pakistani hunters, let me quote a verse from Allama Iqbal here, "Jis Khet Se Dehkaan Ko Muyassar Nahi Rozi;\nUss Khet Ke Har Koshah-e-Gandum Ko Jala Do!!', ''),

Simply because those local poors become the rightful owners of those  conservancies. \n\nI wonder if you know that one of Pakistan''s Army Chief (when in power) wanted to hunt a Suleman Markhor in Torghar but he was bluntly refused by the members of STEP (society of torghar environmental protection) who owns the habitat and is responsible for catering legal hunters.', ''),

I bet they won''t succeed because these communities have established themselves and have become stong institutions and their indigenous members including their waderas have been educated and they have realised that their future is in conservation of their assets.\n\nBut you are right sir, it happens where the roots of this neewly born system has not taken strength and like any other business or institute,,, this will take some time ...

Similarly, ligitimate big game hunting is an expensive hobby & it is not for every body ! \n\nHowever, the only solution is to protect & conserve the animals through communitya based programs and let their population grow to such an extent that the communities will voluntarily sell the extra animals to Pakistanis at low cost. \n\nThis sounds like a dream but it has actually happened many of the Northern Conservancies & District of Jamshoro Sindh where speedy growth of Himalayan & Sindh Ibex has enabled the communities to sell them at a subsidized costs to Pakistanis ! \n\nFor example : For Sindhi Domicile holders, the Sindh Ibex is Rs 50,000/= For Non Sindhis it is Rs 100,000/= For Foreigners it is Rs 350,000/= .. so the difference visible. \n\nYou''''ll be surprised to know that in just a few of the highly populated conservancies of Colorado, every indigenous hunter can shoot ONE WHITE TAIL EVERYDAY ... this makes 365 Bucks a year ... in other places the quota is less (as per their population) ... and you know what''s the price of hunting permit ???  Surprisingly, it varies from US$ 5 per hunt to US$ 25 per year (for all hunts) ... whereas the residents of other states this fee is more and for foreigners it is even more .. it goes over several thousand dollars ... and so on ! \n\nTo enable such a luxury .. a small group of people  have to work hard to make a conservancy & then within a short period of 3 to 5 years the results are great !\n\nThe problem with Pakstanis is that most of us want to become Robin Hoods without getting any training or learning the thics of hunting and we would want to shoot anything which moves in wilderness ... regardless of what it is and we all want to shoot it free of cost & in big numbers so the result is obvious ... we lack Shikar every where in pakistan except for the protected areas !', ''),

If we send them emails on large numbers and ask them to bring down prices to 70K maximum for MP5 and MP4 pistols and likewise 100K maximum for the POF semiauto rifle.\nI hope this will atleast make them realize of their fault. Specially keeping in view the POF chief''s recent statement. In which he regretted that he asked govt to let POF run on business footings but govt. running it as a govt organisation. So hopefully this email sending will help them rationalise the price.\n\n\n\nBrother, agree that these pistols don''t worth such high prices...\n\nBrother, besides your experience in general firearms... would you please enlighten us about these particular models if you used them and if not whats your experience with older MP5s?[/QUOTE]\n\n[QUOTE=Leon;467957]I am just sharing my thoughts:\n\nWe are criticizing prices but will anybody tell me that what substitutes do we have? When we are paying Rs. 45K for USD 100/- (this is landed cost not factory) Chinese pistol or Rs. 150K for USD 600/- (again landed cost) Chinese AR-15. Why cannot we pay Rs. 200K for a far more superior rifle of a far more superior caliber. Does any of us has some idea about price of nearest substitute? HK 762A2 costs around USD 4,000/- in USA. Now excluded the taxes there and include the taxes and dealer''s commission here or check with Majeed Sons. He is asking for Rs. 2.5 M for HK 556A2.\n\nThe issue here is not of price only. The availability of such products comes before price. We are unable to find a good bolt action rifle (i.e. Remington 700 or Winchester 70) in .308 Win at some reasonable (which BTW is Rs. 300K) price leave aside any good semi-auto Rifle.\n\nIt is demand and supply. They don''t need customers as they have many abroad. While you need a supplier and you don''t have any good supplier. Even Chinese and Russian supplier won''t sell you .308 win semi-auto rifle.\n\nAnyway, to me, we have a very narrow Window open to get these pistols and rifles especially 9mm POF PK pistols and .308 Win sporter rifles as this is definitely going to attract lot of hue and cry from so called liberal and anti-gun quarters. These fools don''t spare any chance to hit at Pak Army and this offer has given them a lot to speak. I am seeing roll back of this offer soon. And these pistols and rifle are going to be collector items in near future.[/QUOTE]\n\n[QUOTE=Jibz;467988]Very valid points and totally in agreement. \n\n\nJazakAllah. Couldn''t say it any more louder.[/QUOTE]\n\n[QUOTE=hmd;467991]It is really very interesting to read all your comments but I am surprised that most of you are complaining about the price I would love to know that if these option are available to you guys in any cheaper price or a similar option in same price . Seriously We are ready to pay 300k for Glock and over a million for an AR but not ready to pay 200k for Pak made riffle and that also in 308 not in 5.56 and let''s just not forget Norinco 5.56 for 165k which we are also declined heavily towards and if you compare G3 with Norinco AR Pak made G3 wins by far . Civilian or military version at the end it''s a same platform . As far army people getting it for cheaper price well they deserve to get it for free they earned it with their blood and guts we owe them more then just discount . We start comparing our market prices with US prices keep in mind they have different rules and regulations so the comparison should not be there . In my opinion this is the best option available in 308 semi automatic rifle if you have any please do share . I will agree with Leon we have a very narrow window to get our hands on these riffles grab it while you can . It''s a win win situation . Again it''s just my opinion yours may differ no disrespect to any one .[/QUOTE]\n\nIf someone is paying 300K for a glock it does not mean that POF can sell their weapons at whatever price they deem fit. This is not customer friendly approach rather it is just an excuse for POF. The glock is for 300K for multiple reasons but even then and we dont agree with its price and we dont buy it. Some people do however buy but that does not mean that POF should sell their weapons at this price. By this logic it only means that the target customers for POF are just a handful of people and not the majority of gun enthusiasts. \n\nIf there is no other option in this range in this calibre i would rather just stay away from them. I am a user of military grade POF products and would not pay this much for them.

(34571, ' Most parents are concerned about the safety of their children, and do their best to provide them with a safe environment, including using car seats, seat belts, life preservers, bicycle helmets and gates on stairs. Too many parents forget about gun safety though. \nHaving a gun in your home, especially if it is not stored properly, can be a significant risk factor for injury and death in children. In fact, firearm related injuries are a leading cause of death in children, and include deaths from unintentional injuries, homicide and suicide.\nBetween 1994 and 1998, 6,287 children committed suicide with a firearm and an additional 1,896 children were killed by unintentional gun injuries in the United States. All together, 18,297 children under age 19 died from a gun-related injury during these years, according to CDC National Injury Mortality Statistics. \nAn even larger number of children are hurt by nonfatal gun-related injuries. Although gun-related injuries peak in adolescence, they can affect infants and younger children too. Younger children are most likely to be injured, either shooting themselves or a playmate, after playing with a gun that they have found in the home, not realizing that the gun is real or that it is loaded. \nIt is estimated that guns are in half of all homes in the United States. Although most of these guns are purchased for safety reasons, it is important to keep in mind that a firearm in the home is much more likely (up to 43 times more likely in some reports) to kill or injure a family member or friend than an intruder. \nBecause of the number of injuries from guns, which many say has reached epidemic levels, programs have been developed to educate parents and children about gun safety. These include the Eddie Eagle gun safety program from the National Rifle Association, which educates children who find a gun to ''Stop! Don''t Touch. Leave the Area. Tell an Adult.'' The American Academy of Pediatrics also has a ''Keep Your Family Safe from Firearm Injury'' program that educates parents about gun safety and advises ''the safest thing is to not have a gun in your home, especially not a handgun.''\nMany parents incorrectly assume that their child is educated about gun safety, can tell the difference between a real gun and a toy gun, and would know not to handle a real gun. A study in the June 2001 issue of Pediatrics showed this to not be true. \nIn this study, ''Seeing is Believing: What Do Boys Do When They Find a Real Gun?,'' 29 groups of boys aged 8-12 years were observed in a room where a gun was hidden. Many of the children found and handled the gun, and half of the children actually pulled the trigger. \nMost of the children that handled the found gun and pulled the trigger had previously received gun safety education. This study helps to prove that to keep your children safe and prevent firearm related injuries, it is important to restrict their access to guns, either by not having a gun in the home or by storing it properly. \nProper storage of a gun includes keeping the gun in a gun safe, lock box, or a locked cabinet or drawer. The gun should also be stored unloaded with the bullets locked separately. \nA gun put in a shoe box on the top shelf of a closet is not considered to be a safely stored gun. Neither is a gun placed under the mattress or somewhere else where your child ''would never look for it.'' Children are naturally curious and if a gun is not stored properly, there is a good chance that a child may find it and injure himself or someone else. \nOther steps you can take to ensure gun safety include: \n·	Use a gun lock or trigger lock. \n·	Make sure that your children do not have access to the keys used to lock your guns and bullets. \n·	Teach your children to not handle guns without adult supervision. \n·	Avoid letting your children play with realistic toy guns and nonpowder firearms, such as pellet guns, air guns, air rifles and BB guns.\nEven if you don''t have a gun in your own home, it is important to educate your children about firearm safety in case they discover a gun outside the home or in the homes of their friends. They should know the 4 steps of the Eddie Eagle gun safety program, including: \n·	Stop! \n·	Don''t Touch. \n·	Leave the Area. \n·	Tell an Adult.\nYou should also discuss gun safety with other parents or family members if your child spends time in their homes. It is not enough to assume that if they do have guns in the house, then they have them stored properly. \nAs the American Academy of Pediatrics states in their book, ''Injury Prevention and Control for Children and Youth,'' the ''risks of hangun ownership outweight the benefits.'' If you have children in your house, then consider getting rid of your guns. If you must have a gun in the house, then at least learn to store it properly. \nIf you do decide that you want to get rid of your guns to protect your children, you can look to see if a gun ''buy back'' type program is available in your area. Or call the non-emergency number of your local police department and ask if they will pick it up. \nMany communities also have free gun lock and/or trigger lock give away programs.', ''),
(34572, ' Guns go bang. That''s what they do. They are used safely millions upon millions of times every year, but the potential for injury and death is always there. For this reason, we need to follow basic safety rules at all times when handling firearms, including handguns like revolvers and pistols, rifles, shotguns, muzzleloaders, air guns, etc.\n\n[b]1. Assume That Any Gun, at Any Time, is Loaded.[/b] \n\nWhen someone tells you a gun is not loaded, that''s fine - but don''t believe it until you see it for yourself. If you offend your buddy by checking a gun after he''s told you it''s unloaded, then so be it. Better safe than dead. Make it a habit to check no matter what. This is a very important habit to get into.\n\n[b]2. Always Point a Gun in a Safe Direction.[/b] \n\nThis one should be self-explanatory. It is the bedrock of all gun safety, and is the most important rule. Another way to say it, which Dad taught me many years ago, is, "Never point a gun at anything you''re not willing to shoot."\n\n[b]3. Keep Your Finger off the Trigger.[/b]\n\nThis is something I see way too often. Some doofus will have his or her finger on the trigger of a gun they are simply carrying, looking down the sights of, etc. Don''t do it! Keep that finger outside the trigger guard until you are ready to shoot, and after shooting, move it back out of the trigger guard. And please don''t be offended that I used the term "doofus" if you have been guilty of this, because I have been a doofus before, too.\n\n[b]4. Know What You''re Shooting at.[/b]\n\nYour target is whatever you have decided to shoot. And - this is extremely important - it must be a conscious decision when you shoot something. Don''t get lax about this. You need to know what you are going to shoot at, what is between you and it, and what is beyond it. Pay attention.\n\n[b]5. Be Familiar With Your Gun.[/b]\n\nTake the time to learn about the operation and features of the firearm you are planning to use. The time to learn this is not while you are shooting... that is when you need to be learning about grip, shooting positions, trigger control, etc. When you step up to the firing line, you should already know how to operate the gun you''ll be shooting.\n\n[b]6. Don''t Shoot at Hard Surfaces (Including Water).[/b]\n\nWater might not seem like a hard surface, but its density makes it pretty dangerous. It has a tendency to allow bullets and shotgun shot to ricochet (glance off) and fly off in an unintended direction. Not good. Hard surfaces like metal, rocks, and hard wood can do this too - and they can even send the projectile back to the shooter, which can be hard on a feller, because shooting oneself, even indirectly, can be a pretty nasty experience.\n\n[b]7. Don''t Rely on a Safety Mechanism.[/b]\n\nMany guns have a safety device to prevent the gun from firing. These are often reliable, but not always. And some guns have even been known to fire when the safety is released, most notably Remington bolt-action centerfire rifles, which naturally leads to the conclusion that safety mechanisms are often useful, but not completely reliable. Use the safety, but don''t count on it! Continue to follow the number one rule: Always keep the gun pointed somewhere safe.\n\n[b]8. Load Your Gun When You Need to.[/b]\n\nSome, including the NRA, will tell you to keep every gun unloaded until you''re ready to fire it. This is not a sensible rule, because guns used for hunting and defense purposes will be needed in a hurry whenever they are needed, and there is no time to be messing around loading your gun when you need it to save your life, or to take the game you''re hunting. If you need your gun for defense from human or animal attackers and it''s not loaded, it becomes a liability rather than a benefit, and your safety goes down the tubes. So load your gun, and handle it responsibly.\n\n[b]9. Use the Right Ammo.[/b]\n\nMake certain the ammunition you''re using is right for your gun. Just because the ammo can be crammed into the gun, don''t assume it''s the right stuff for that popper. The groceries you feed your gun need to match up with the gun''s design and strength factors. This is usually marked on the gun. If you have any doubt, contact the gun''s manufacturer or a qualified gunsmith.\n\n[b]10. Pay Attention![/b]\n\nIt''s easy to get distracted when you''re having fun, and target shooting can be a lot of fun, especially if you''re enjoying it with friends and family. Take extra care to follow safe gun handling rules, and don''t be afraid to correct others when you see them improperly handling firearms. They may not like it, but all participants must follow gun safety rules if everyone is to come home safe and sound. And that''s what we always want to see!', ''),

(34691, ' Barrel twist rate is critical in rifles, in handguns most have a twist of 1:12 , meaning one complete turn in 12 inches of travel, for a lay man the bullet will take one complete turn on it''s axis after travelling 12 inches in the barrel.\n\nIn rifles it could be as high as 1:7 like in M4/M14 rifles. This high twist rate produces a very fast spin on the bullet when it leaves the barrel to stabilize it during it''s flight in the air. Lighter bullets require higher spin for stability. A 5.56 Nato fired from a M4/M14 usually spins at around 180,000 rpm. A barrel with a very high twist rate, like 1:7 has a shorter barrel life and requires early replacement.\n\nMost rifles have a twist rate of 1:9, an AK has a twist rate of 1:9, so does G3.\n \nBarrel twist rate is a whole science. There are scientific formulas to compute barrel twist rate. It depends mostly on the Length of the bullet, diameter of the bullet, muzzle velocity, etc.\n\nLocal gun manufacturers only make copies and are not very scientific in their manufacturing, hence they may not be aware of the methods used to compute the required twist rate for their weapons, especially because the twist rate is computed for a specific ammo to be used in a specific weapon, like in military weapons.\n\nThere have been many experts who derived their own formulas to compute barrel twist rate, one very commonly used was derived by Greenhill, known as Greenhill equation to copute barrel twist rate is as under.\n\nT'' = 150 / L'' \n\nwhere the twist and the bullet length are in calibers. Removing bullet diameter from twist and length gives the equation often found: \n\nT = 150 * D^2 / L \n\nThe Greenhill equation includes no term for muzzle velocity, and several sources suggest replacing the 150 with 180 for muzzle velocities over 2800 fps. Increasing muzzle velocity increases bullet spin, and spin provides the stability. An article in the 11/2001 Single Shot Exchange cites an article by Les Bowman in the 1962 Gun Digest offering an equation which includes muzzle velocity (in fps): \n\nT = 3.5 * V^0.5 * D^2 / L \n\nAt 2800 fps, this equation is equivalent to using 185 in the Greenhill equation, and at 1840 fps, this equation is the same as Greenhill''s.', ''),

(34774, ' [quote]btw whats a roll crimp an how is it differnt from a star one. . .an while we are at it? whats a crimp anyway?[/quote]\n\ncrimping is: closing the business end of a shotgun cartridge.\nstar crimp: if u look at u''r regular No. 4, No. 8 shaheen cartridges, the mouth of the cartridge is crimped in a way that resembles a star\nRoll Crimp: also called disc crimped, if u look at shaheen''s SG cartridges, a flat circular disc is placed at the mouth of the cartridge to close it. its called roll crimped.\n\n\nmy humble opinion:\n\nRoll crimp is more efficient packing wise, it leaves more space for the shot load, powder and wadding however roll crimp suffers from pattern efficiency. star crimp leaves less space for the shotload, powder and wad (look at typical loading data, says to leave atleast 0.25 inch for the star crimp whereas roll crimp only needs 0.125 inch) however star crimp is more pattern friendly.\n\nReason: all petals of the star in a star crimp open with the same force at the same time where as in a roll crimp the circular disc doesnt leave the shell evenly, causing the pressure to leak out unevenly, thats why where pattern efficiency is required star crimp is the global standard and where high load is desired, roll crimped is prefered around the world.\n\nRegards.', ''),

What was and has happened many times is when a cop has shot a criminal the bullet over  penetrates and makes its way through the body and hits someone else.  This ofcourse has meant lawsuits, this was one of the biggest contributing factor where the ammunition manufacturers who are catering to mainly law enforcement agencies developed these types of ammunitions.  The second factor is the sporting aspect such as bowling pin matches.  I have shot at many matches in my day and a standard jacketed round nose ammo would hit the bowling pin and go right through without making the bowling pin fall from the stand.

(35025, ' The Aérospatiale Alouette III (Skylark) is a single-engine, light utility helicopter developed by Sud Aviation and later manufactured by Aérospatiale of France. The Alouette III is the successor to the Alouette II, being larger and having more seating. Originally powered by a Turbomeca Artouste IIIB turboshaft engine, the Alouette III is recognised for its mountain rescue capabilities and adaptability.\n\nThe first version of the Alouette III, the SE 3160 prototype, first flew on 28 February 1959. Production of the SA 316A (SE 3160) began in 1961 and remained in production until 1968, when it was replaced by the SA 316B.\n\nThe Alouette III entered in service with the French Armed forces in 1960. From April 1964-1967, three machines were delivered from France for local assembly in Australia, and were used by Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) at the Woomera Rocket Range for light passenger and recovery of missile parts after test launches at the Range.\n[b]Served in Indo-Pakistani War of 1971 when 2 planes of the PAF were lost in the war,[/b]and the Portuguese Colonial War, during 60''s and 70''s with large utilization in Angola, Mozambique and Guinea, where it proved its qualities.\nThe SA 316B and the SA 319B both remained in series production up to the early 1980s, when the main production line in France was closed down. However, HAL of India continues to licence-build Alouette IIIs as the Chetak. Versions of the Alouette III were also either licence-built or assembled by IAR in Romania (as the IAR 316), F+W Emmen in Switzerland, and by Fokker and Lichtwerk in the Netherlands.\n[b]Production numbers are as follows:[/b]\n\n    * France: 1453\n    * India: 300+ (Still in production.)\n    * Romania: 230\n    * Switzerland: 60\n\nIn June 2004, the Alouette III was retired from the French Air Force after 32 years of successful service. It will be replaced by the Eurocopter EC 355 Ecureuil 2. In the same year, the Swiss Armed Forces announced the retirement of the Alouette III, from the front line by 2006, and entirely by 2010. Venezuelan Air forces retired their Alouette IIIs in the late 90s.\nOn 21 September 2007 after 44 years of successful service, in which hundreds of lives were saved, the Alouette III was retired from the Irish Air Corps.\n\n[b]Specifications (SA 316B)[/b]\n\nThis aircraft article is missing some (or all) of its specifications.

(35115, ' [quote=Moeen]Guys why would you want hollow point???  All bullets kill, hollow points were mainly developed in the states to stop over penetration - meaning stop at the terminal target only.  What was and has happened many times is when a cop has shot a criminal the bullet over  penetrates and makes its way through the body and hits someone else.  This ofcourse has meant lawsuits, this was one of the biggest contributing factor where the ammunition manufacturers who are catering to mainly law enforcement agencies developed these types of ammunitions.  The second factor is the sporting aspect such as bowling pin matches.  I have shot at many matches in my day and a standard jacketed round nose ammo would hit the bowling pin and go right through without making the bowling pin fall from the stand.  Hence when I used hollowpoints the pin would litterally fly off the table... having said that don''t anyone assume that the same will happen with humans.  This is Pakistan, and most of us are NOT employed by any LE agency.[/quote]\n\nOver panetration espacly wiht powerful calibres is an issue everywhere in the world.

(35186, ' Striker 1, this is a very important topic and concern for any firearm owner and enthusiast. Modern gun manufecturing industry is quite aware of this and has devised many state of the art triggers, hammers, firing pin blocks, strikers to get rid of an unwnted accidental firing, either by gun drop or by slip of hammer. All modern gun manufecturers put their arms to different tests and gun drop test is a must. Let me explain few safety features regarding our topic that are a regular part of all reputable modern guns. \n\n[b]FIRING PIN BLOCK:[/b]\n\nAll modern reputable handguns have this feature. When gun is loaded firing pin is blocked by a plate, bar or another pin so firing pin cannot hit the primer unless the trigger is pulled. This firing pin block acts like the shutter of a camera and gives way to the pin when it is needed.\n\n[b]HALF COCKED STRIKER:[/b]\n \nThis is a modern feature popularised by the GLOCK although we find this feature on other guns aswel. In this action there is no hammer to hit the primer through firing pin rather firing pin is striked by a tension spring. This spring does not get fully cocked by loading the pistol rather get half cocked. It gets fully cocked when trigger is pulled. So, there is no question of firing by the drop of gun as firing pin does not have the required energy to ignite the primer. This is the reason why GLOCK and SIGMA have heavy triggers. \n\n[b]TRIGGER BLOCKS:[/b]\n\nMostly guns come with different type of blocks those prevent trigger to get slipped unless hand gun is properly held in the hand and trigger is pulled. In all 1911''s there is a trigger lock at the back of the grip just under the hammer guard, this lock prevents the pull of the trigger unless this guard is pressed by the palm of the shooter. This guard is pressed by the shooter''s palm when shooter holds the gun in his/her natural grip. Other guns like GLOCK come with a towpart trigger that serves the same purpose but in a different way.\n\n[b]DECOCKER:[/b]\n\nThese guns come with a decocker that just drop the hammer without hitting the firing pin so gun can be carried chambered but with dropped hammer leaving any chance for firing by the dropping of the gun.\n\nSo, there are many safety features available to prevent any accident, and combination of these features on almost all reputable guns make them pretty safe but there is no safety that can sbstitute the safety of the unchambered gun in the hands of a careful shooter.', ''),

(35196, ' Well they have given every detail about the incident but they have not mentioned the brand of Pistol or Revolver which was used. I dont think that there is any issue with any of the First Tier brands. I do carry a Glock 26 and i have never thought about this scenario. If you go through the whole thread below you can clearly read that if right circumstances were given, even a Glock can fire while dropped.\n\n[i]After far too long a time it has dawned on me that the mistake in this thread has been to consider the "trigger" safety in isolation. We should have considered the safeties of the Glock as a system.[/i]\n\n[i]First, the Glock is intended to fire if you pull the trigger with a round in the chamber. The weight and length of trigger pull adds a small margin of safety against a "twitch" of the trigger finger but not much in comparison to a cocked and unlocked 1911. It has no where near the margin of a revolver in double action mode. If your finger is on the trigger when you are startled enough you are very likely to pull the trigger hard enough to fire the piece. To this extent, as many keep saying, the primary safety is between your ears. Handle the gun sensibly and you won''t have a negligent discharge.[/i]\n\n[i]Second, with the negligible exception of protecting against a push or pull against the side front of the trigger, all proper Glock safeties guard against drops, but not always as you might think.[/i]\n\n[i]A drop of a solid object onto a solid surface can produce remarkably high G forces. A drop where the pistol lands on the top of its slide could easily unsafe the firing pin safety as its inertia would easily overcome the spring loading. Fortunately the same G forces would push the trigger bar upwards, relative to the normal orientation of the pistol, and push it more firmly into engagement with the firing pin. So that is a safe drop orientation.[/i]\n\n[i]The most serious risk is from a drop onto the tail of the slide. Here the full mass of the trigger and trigger bar will be pushed back. If the impact is large enough then, without the trigger safety, this force could, in principle, push the trigger bar back far enough to act as though the trigger had been pulled. That is, it would disengage the firing pin safety, further cock the firing pin against its spring, cam the trigger bar down against the connector/disconnector and fire the pistol. The trigger safety stops this from happening because it is in neutral balance against this force and its spring holds it in place unless the pistol is spinning very rapidly, as in the infamous Frisbee test. [/i]\n\n[i]Lastly we have the simply named drop safety. This provides a guide for the cruciform of the trigger bar which prevents it moving downwards until the trigger is pulled most of the way back. Ostensibly this guards against an upward impact on the but of the pistol forcing the trigger bar down and releasing the partly cocked firing pin. What would happen if it did? The gun would not fire because the firing pin would be blocked by the firing pin safety which would be held more strongly in its safe position by this direction of impact. [/i]\n\n[i]So what is the drop safety for? It protects you from the circumstance where you drop your Glock, perhaps in the course of a fight, then pick it up and try to shoot. Without the drop safety the result might not even be a click because the firing pin would have been disengaged from the trigger bar cruciform by the drop. That is, the firing pin would be fully forward against the firing pin safety. If it is not partially cocked it will not fire! So the drop safety protects you from the gun not firing when you need it to fire rather than from firing when it shouldn''t fire. [/i]\n\n[i]It should be clear from this that the PRIMARY mechanical safety of the Glock against accidental discharge when the gun is dropped is the trigger safety. [/i]\n\n[i]There is no safety against it being fired once it is in your hand with your finger on the trigger and nor should there be. [/i]\n\n[i]There is no safety worthy of the name against discharge when something other than your trigger finger snags the trigger and pulls it back. This is actually a major failing of what is an ingenious piece of engineering. [/i]\n\n[i]All mechanical systems can fail and in this case we are trusting a lot to a small engagement of two pieces of cheap molded plastic. Apart from that the firing pin safety can get stuck in the up position if it gets too dirty, the firing pin/cruciform engagement can be insecure if it has been modified and/or damaged so that there is a very small engagement but this combination would also probably need a soft primer to fire. [/i]\n\n[i]For what it is worth, I do not believe that any pistol design solves the re:holstering/snagging problem in a reasonably fail safe manor. A manual or thumb safety will do so provided you remember to put it on safe every time you holster. The psychological fact is that the time you are least likely to do this is in the immediate aftermath of combat. This is also the time when you are most likely to be clumsy as you re-holster. [/i]\n[quote=HasanJamshad]\nSo, there are many options available to prevent any accident. But there is no safety that can sbstitute the safety of the unchambered gun.[/quote]\nI dont agree with you on this point at least for your carry weapon as if ever you have to defend yourself then you hardly get time to get it out let alone chamber a bullet and fire it.', ''),

This weapon was very deadly and consisted of a wood or metal shaft with a mounted head of bronze, copper, wood, or steel. The mace was carried and used by both foot soldiers and Calvary men. Maces were very effective in battle and could puncture even the heaviest of armor. This was a barbaric weapon and left battlefields filled with torture and blood. \n\n\n[b]2)Hawaiian Throwing Axe[/b]\n\n[url=http://www.postimage.org/][img]http://img197.imageshack.us/img197/1833/phplta9mg.png[/img][/url]\n\nThis Hawaiian Throwing Axe was a deadly hand held weapon that could be used at both short and long range. This weapon was made out of wood and shark teeth had the power to take men’s limbs off. This weapon was mainly used when opposing Hawaiian armies closed upon each other. They were then thrown at the opposing troops to help soften enemy ranks before close combat. They could also be used in hand to hand combat and had the muscle to rip open skin as if it was butter. This was a very dangerous weapon and is not something you would want to go up against.\n\n[b]3)Hunga Munga[/b]\n\n[url=http://www.postimage.org/][img]http://img20.imageshack.us/img20/439/phpy01jtg.png[/img][/url]\nThe Hunga Munga is an African tribal weapon that is way ahead of its time. It is a handheld weapon and contains a metal pointed blade with a curved back section and separate spike near the handle. This weapon was used in fighting between African tribes and was often times throw in a rotating motion causing deep wounds and even death. Its variation of blades allowed it to be used as more then a weapon. It was used as a tool in farming and even in building structures. It was a great all around tool and has been found all throughout Africa. Today you may have seen the Hunga Munga in the show Buffy the Vampire Slayer. Buffy uses it once in a while to fight off evil demons that she faces. \n\n\n\n\n[b]4)Throwing Star[/b]\n\n[url=http://www.postimage.org/][img]http://img36.imageshack.us/img36/5493/phpikqmfa.png[/img][/url]\n\nThe throwing star known as the shuriken which means “a dagger hidden in a palm” were used and invented by the Japanese. The stars had much variation in the shape; some were shaped like a star and thrown with spin, yet others were needlelike and thrown like a throwing dagger. These daggers couldn’t penetrate armor, but the ninjas, who used them, usually didn’t fight armored opponents. Venom was normally used with the shuriken. \n\n\n\n\n[b]5)Caltrop[/b]\n\n[url=http://www.postimage.org/][img]http://img129.imageshack.us/img129/2369/phpclmdao.png[/img][/url]\n\nThe Caltrop is a weapon made up of two or more sharp spikes or spines arranged so that one of them points upward from a stable base. Caltrops serve to slow down the proceeding of horses, war elephants, and human troops. It was said to be particularly effective against the soft feet of camels. These were very painful if stepped on and were spread all throughout battle fields. They also were deadly because if stepped on it would cause a bad infection that would cause a slow agonizing death. They also have been used in modern times. In the Vietnam War the Vietcong put them into booby traps. If an American soldier was punctured by one he died from infection almost 90% of the time. \n\n\n\n\n[b]6)Crossbow Pistol[/b]\n\n[url=http://www.postimage.org/][img]http://img129.imageshack.us/img129/2227/phpr1mo52.png[/img][/url]\n\nThis 17th Century Crossbow was way ahead of its time and is very cool. This crossbows look like an early form of a pistol and was very powerful. This hand held crossbow was both accurate and effective but it just was too hard to reload. Because of this it was not used very often in battle and was used more for target practice. Another problem with this weapon was making the arrows which was to time consuming especially if they were just going to get lost in battle. Overall this weapon was still badass and really shows what type of technology and ideas the 17th Century had. \n\n\n\n[b]7)Trebuchet[/b]\n\n[url=http://www.postimage.org/image.php?v=gx1zGeRr][img]http://img200.imageshack.us/img200/1779/phpb7vttp.th.png[/img][/url]\n\nA trebuchet is basically a high powered catapult and had many uses in ancient times. Mainly used as a weapon it had enough power to break through castles and destroy towns. It was first used in the 16th Century. Rocks, dead horses, dead people, and dead animals were all used as ammo. In the 16th and 17th Century when plagues and diseases were looming over civilizations plagued bodies were thrown by the trebuchet into enemy territory. The bodies decomposed passing the plague to the enemies slowly killing them. This is one of the first forms of biological warfare.\n\n\n\n\n\n[b]8)Ancient Rocket Launcher[/b]\n\n[url=http://www.postimage.org/image.php?v=Pq1ttWNi][img]http://img188.imageshack.us/img188/8334/phpsr1iaf.th.png[/img][/url]\n\nIn the 14th century, the Chinese invented rocket-launchers. These were weapons which shot arrows with rockets attached near the tip into the air toward the enemy. Also in the 14th century, multi-stage rockets were made. When the rockets near the front of the device burnt out, they lit fuses for the second-stage rockets at the back. The bombs the Chinese used in the 17th century were made of gunpowder wrapped in paper and had a fuse covered in gunpowder. \n\n\n\n\n[b]9)Ancient Flame-Thrower[/b]\n\n[url=http://www.postimage.org/][img]http://img195.imageshack.us/img195/3488/phplzijxp.png[/img][/url]\n\nThe Chinese invented the continuous flame-thrower in the tenth century. In the picture above we see the tank standing on four legs, with the pump and device above it. Because the Chinese invention of a double-acting Piston-bellows was used with this device, a continuous stream of flame could be emitted. The metal used was brass. The Flame-Thrower was used in naval or boat combat and allowed the Chinese to easily set enemy ships on fire and sink them on the spot. It was a great technology and has been used ever since. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nSource:-http://trifter.com/practical-travel/adventure-travel/ancient-warriors-nine-deadly-weapons-blast-from-the-past/', ''),

Hasn''t been used in more than a decade. the slide has much of the original bluing but the frame(body?) has lost some of the finish. If you pull back the slide, the outer surface of barrel has lost its luster and slightly rusted all over. Inside of barrel is also uniformly rusted. According to a website, to strip it, its slide should lock somewhere in the middle of the pull, on an empty mag. Then the little pin near the top of the trigger guard is pushed through to the other side to start dis-assembly. The pin on our piece doesn''t budge as if its welded...\n\nPlease guide about how it should be cleaned? Is stripping necessary for a thorough cleaning after so long a period? Can the cleaning mixes suggested by 12gauge be used in this case? If so, should i keep it dipped in cleaner/solvent etc?

(35489, ' [b]The JF-17 Thunder:[/b]\n\nThe JF-17 ‘Thunder’ had until recently been under a cloud over controversies surrounding its Russian powerplant. However, cynics were proved wrong with the arrival in Pakistan of two small batch production (SBP) aircraft in March, and also assurances from the Pakistan Air Force (PAF) that the issue has been resolved. The two SBP aircraft will be joined by six more by the end of the year for weapons and systems integration, and indigenous construction of the first batch (complete with in-flight refuelling capability) is slated to begin next year. With further improvements being made to the design, the JF-17 will be entering frontline service in 2009, and is on course to replace all the PAF A-5C, Mirage-III/IV, and F-7P/PG aircraft on a one-for-one basis by 2015, five years earlier than initially envisioned. Furthermore, efforts are already underway to find the first export customer with considerable interest already been shown by some countries. Whilst even at the beginning of the year the project appeared in trouble, it certainly appears on track now that aircraft are beginning to land in Pakistan.\n[b]Avionics and airframe developments[/b]\n\nImprovements in other areas have already been made. Aerodynamic changes have increased the manoeuvrability and versatility of the aircraft, and the SBP aircraft probably represent the final airframe configuration. The most notable of these has been the convex [b]DSI (Divertless Supersonic Inlets)[/b] intakes. These have helped reduce the overall weight of the airframe, and after an internal redesign, freed up space for more stores, most notably fuel for slightly increased range. These weight saving changes have also allowed the [b]maximum speed to be increased to Mach 1.8[/b]. Though this is still limited compared to current fighter aircraft, further changes, (most notably the powerplant), are likely to improve matters somewhat. Other internal changes include a full fly-by-wire set of controls, and more high tech avionics. The issue of the radar (which will probably be joined by an Infra Red Search Tracking - IRST - sensor), has also seen a number of potential developments. Since the design of the airframe was decoupled from the avionics set up in 1998, things have changed considerably. [b]The PAF had initially hoped to have a full set of Western avionics in the JF-17, but the imposition of Western sanctions in 1998 scuttled this[/b]. However, increases made in Chinese avionics design, have resulted in a f[b]ull glass cockpit, and for the first 51 production aircraft, installation of the Chinese Nanjing KLJ-7 radar[/b]. The PAF is said to be very impressed with this radar and sources say it has a comfortable advantage over the APG-66 radar fitted to the current PAF F-16 fleet. This in itself is no major breakthrough, as though still quite capable, the APG-66 is a fairly old design now in terms of modern radars. However, it does represent the advances the Chinese avionics industry has made in trying to bridge the gap between western radars and its own products. [b]The KLJ-7 radar is actually a very important development for another reason, as it will mean the initial batch of aircraft will be fully able to fire the Chinese SD-10 BVRAAM.[/b] Such a capability has been a core requirement for the PAF for some time, so the first batch of JF-17s will be taking a huge load off the current interceptor fleet. However, there had been speculation that the I[b]talian Grifo S-7 or the British Vixen 500E may be installed[/b], but the PAF may yet be looking for an even more [b]advanced AESA radar[/b]. No decision has yet been taken in this regard, but it is likely to be resolved with the induction of the second batch. Finally a data-link is to be incorporated allowing for secure data transmission between various platforms. This is an important capability with the impending arrival of the Saab-2000 EIRIYE AEW&C aircraft, and also the possibility that not every aircraft in the strike role will carry a targeting pod, for financial reasons. T[b]he JF-17 will also have an advanced electronic warfare system housed in the fin top fairing. This will be linked to the Missile Approach Warning System (MAWS) sensors fitted fore and aft to give 360 degree coverage[/b]. In terms of electronic warfare capabilities, [b]the JF-17 will be second only to the F-16C Block-52 in PAF service.\n[/b]\n[b]Indigenous production[/b]\n\nPakistani engineers are currently being trained in China in readiness for indigenous construction, and the assembly line itself is being ‘tooled up’. Indigenous construction will begin in 2009, [b]and will start at 15 aircraft per year before being increased to 25 – 30[/b]. The number may well be boosted by Chinese built airframes in order to replace the existing legacy types sooner if the need arises. This probably entails the initial number of [b]150 JF-17s ordered being increased to 200 – 250 in order to equip up to 12 squadrons[/b]. It is hoped that within three years up to 50 percent of the airframe and avionics will be indigenously manufactured, and this percentage may well rise in the future. Some of the parts manufactured in Pakistan are likely to also feature in any potential export aircraft.\n[b]Armament[/b]\nThe JF-17 can carry a payload in the region of [b]3,800kg[/b] on [b]seven hardpoints[/b], three of which (centreline and inner pylons) are plumbed for fuel. However, in-flight refuelling capability will allow weapons to be carried in lieu of tanks if required. Furthermore, though prototype aircraft have been seen with multiple ejector racks fitted, it is not currently known if the [b]JF-17/FC-1 can carry two BVRAAM missiles per under-wing station in a manner such as the F-18 can[/b]. The combat proven, Gsh-23-2 twin-barrelled cannon, is mounted on the underside in a pack between the port intake and fuselage.As stated the BVR engagement capability of the JF-17 is a key requirement. [b]With the order of 500 Aim-120-C5 [/b]missiles for the expanding F-16 fleet, the AMRAAM may well be integrated onto the JF-17. This is by no means a certainty, and the PAF is rumoured to also be examining a further option from a western source, most likely the French MBDA Mica. Though the AMRAAM currently sets the standard for BVRAAMs, the Mica is highly capable with its ability to engage targets at BVR ranges, as well as during close-in dogfights. The PAF’s interest in the Mica is despite it being due for replacement by the MBDA Meteor BVRAAM. However, if all else fails then there is still the Sino SD-10/PL-12, China’s first successful BVRAAM, which as stated, can no doubt be easily integrated with the KLJ-7 radar. For the principal WVR missile the PAF is hoping to equip the JF-17 with an agile fifth generation dogfight missile (though the current Aim-9 Sidewinder will still be fitted), which will be integrated with a likely Chinese origin helmet mounted sight (HMS) similar to the Boeing Joint Helmet Mounted Cueing System (JHMCS) ordered for the new PAF F-16s. During IDEAS2006 in November last year, the Diehl BGT IRIS-T was being touted as the likely candidate. With its High Off Bore Sight (HOBS) engagement capability (including the ability to engage threats in the rear hemisphere), and incredible manoeuvrability, the IRIS-T may well be an effective counter to Thrust Vector Control (TVC) capable Indian fighters such as the Su-30MKI, a plane the JF-17s development was stretched out in order to counter. The integration on an affordable airframe of such potent missiles clearly makes the JF-17 a dangerous opponent for potential adversaries. Prototypes had a stated maximum [b]G limit of +8.5[/b], which is limited in modern terms. However, the ability of a fighter to quickly establish itself into a turn may be more important than its continued turning capability in some respects, and the use of HMS/HOBS missile capability may negate the need for such close in manoeuvrability even if proposed improvements do not increase the ‘G’ limits. Integration of air-to-ground weaponry will follow that of air-to-air weapons. This will include PGMs already in the PAF arsenal and used by the Mirage-III/IV fleet, such as the H-4 (thought to be a local production of the Denel Raptor-II MUPSOW – MUlti-Purpose Stand-Off Weapon). Pakistani, and especially Chinese, PGM design and manufacture are continuing a pace. Chinese air-to-ground weaponry is improving especially rapidly, with satellite guided weaponry becoming available; it is likely that such weapons will be integrated on the JF-17 in due course.\n[b]Characteristics[/b]\nLength: 14.97 m (49 ft 1 in)\n\nWingspan: 9.46 m (31 ft 0 in)\n\nHeight: 4.77 m (15 ft 8 in)\n\nEmpty weight: 6,450 kg (14,220 lb)\n\nLoaded weight: 9,100 kg (20,062 lb)\n\nMax takeoff weight: 12,700 kg (27,999 lb)\n\nWeapons payload: 3,800kg (8,378 lb)\n\nPowerplant: 1 x RD-93 turbofan (81.3 kN), 8,290 kgf (18,277 lbf)\n\nMaximum speed: Mach 1.8.

Stoeger is a tested gun ppl have no reliabilty issues n 909 still needs to prove its self apart from its look.\nso a brotherly advise wait for sm1 who has crossed 2000-5000 rds limit on 909 otherwise if u want to buy a hand straight now then dont even give it a 2nd thought n go for Stoeger', ''),

(35721, ' In the end, it will all be down to a matter of personal preference. Some has more say that the Cougar has more recoil in the first 100 or so rounds, and that its rotating barrel mechanism is more accurate. What I believe is that the slight differences in recoil and accuracy will matter very little in an actual combat/ defence scenario. The only questions that come to my mind when choosing between these two is that are they equally reliable? Are they easy to conceal? Are the safeties easy to engage/ disengage in a stressful situation? There are others, but you get the gist.\n\nWhile on the topic of Stoeger Cougar vs Taurus PT909, why don''t we add the PT911/915 to the discussion too (no rail, same mag cap., slightly shorter in height that PT909).\n\nMy own personal opinion goes towards the Taurus (if reliability issues are justified) due to the fact that I like frame mounted safeties better than slide mounted safeties. I simply feel that is will be easier to operate under tension, with lesser chances or error.\n\n@AAH: What you suggest is the best option.

(371764, ' [QUOTE=snowleopard;207908]Dear Prince Bhai....... You have started a nice thread.......\r\n\r\n"Raiin" or " The Goral/ The Grey Goral" is a Goat definitely...... a very beautiful animal once roamed  commonly in most parts of the Hazara Division.... usually it is found from 1000 to 4000m altitudes.. both in lower mountainous terrain of Haripur to the alpine forests of the Kaghan Valley.It is relatively a small sized animal that''s why commonly locals call it a '' BAKRI" OR "TEDY BAKRI" along with its common name of "RAAIIN" through out the region, and  undoubtedly like any other goat it has some remarkable climbing and running skills on the slopes.\r\n\r\nOnce it was in good numbers on the bordering mountainous range of Tarbela Dam along with many other bird species like seesee and chakors, but all these three are nearly vanished due to relatively easy approach and lot of hunting/poaching. In my limited knowledge still few groups are surviving in Khanpur range which is bordering the Margalla Hills.\r\n\r\nIn Kaghan valley a moderate population is surviving in Shogran range and specifically the "Malakandi Forest". In summer mostly it is not hunted, because of  many reasons but most obvious is that it remains in very difficult slopes or areas of the jungle. In winter locals usually hunt it in a party formation after heavy snow fall. The "ustaads" locate good passing spots on specific tracks in snow on which these animal move after heavy snow.Few hunters are placed on these spots and a good climber drives the animals from difficult area to that track and when the animals pass across any sitting hunter he takes his chance with mostly single barrel 12g shot gun having No.4 "wallaity cartoos" or SG.\r\n\r\nThe meat of the  harvested animal/animals is equally distributed among the party and the skin is dried and used mostly used as "Massalla/Jai-Namaz".\r\nIn Azad Kashmir the numbers of this animal is on higher side, two major factors one is due to presence of army in most of its habitat, where locals have some restrictions. secondly due to some good conservation work for the "MUSK DEER" which is also benefiting this specie.\r\n\r\nLast month we visited "Moji Game reserve" in leepa valley near "Dao khun" on an excursion trip. our host mentioned few road side spots for "Raaiin hunts" during winter.\r\nin Azad Kashmir locals use same hunting method and guns for this animal. Rifle shooting is only possible when one or more animals are trapped in a"Nalla"  or under a "Parrhi" (big rock) after an overnight heavy snow, but in this case it is very difficult to reach the spot within 200-300 yards for a shot and if done by any means retrieving the animal is another big task.........\r\n\r\nin the end one most important thing that =\r\n" hunting Raaiin is not legally authorised" so:frusty: .............[/QUOTE]\r\nDo you have to name spots brother?

Apart from the reason you pointed out there are numerous others, contributing to their scarce numbers in wild, such as, untrained staff handling them at the mentioned pheasantry, improper rearing of these birds under controlled conditions, improper planning at the time of their release,etc.I am sure their handlers never thought of the fact that, these were being reared to be released in the [B]WILD[/B] where conditions are tough to survive.There is a lot of difference between rearing for domestication,sport,and wild.\r\nThe rehabilitation project (in fact there were 2 of which i know.one in the capital territory on the Margalla hills forest reserve and another in Malakandi reserve , Kagan valley) you mentioned was unsuccessful because of improper planning of the concerned people who only want to gobble funds allocated for such projects and give a " Saab Acchha Hai" ki report to their superiors.As you all might know that as a nation we have gone into a habbit of applying cosmetics to wounds.Its a pitty.\r\nRegards.', ''),

Russians take weapon durability very seriously, there is a reason why Baikal mp153 was "russia''s 100 best exports" and was "guns and ammo" gun of the year and was "shooting times" gun of the year.[/quote]\n\ni''m afraid that i might have conveyed a wrong message above, when i said their patterns can be improved, in reality their pattern are absolutely are absolultey fine in more open chokes, its the performance of their tighther chokes (full, extra full) that is not upto standard. so, if u''r gonna use it for any type of hunt that requires more open chokes, their patterns should be fine. otherwise like i''ve recommended before, buy aftermarket choke tubes (carslons, clonial, trulock).\n\nthink for a second, u can improve the patterns of Baikal by buying aftermarket chokes which cost less than 1500 rupees each (shipping, handling and duty paid) but how will u improve the reliability of a turkish shotgun (I dont see a quick solution to that problem).\n\nRegards.\n\n\np.s.

Bad Ammo, i dont think so here. Its bad Manufacturing by Taurus. I dont that with so much power provided by the gun powder, a bullet should ever be lodged like that halfway through the barrell.[/quote]\n\nTher could be two possible reasons that i can think of,\n1- Insufficient charge: There is a possibility that the round had less than required charge, which pushed the projectile out of the casing and in to the barrel, but did not provide enough force to push it all the way through the barrel.\n\n2- Charge dampened by moisture: This is another possibility, and the chances are that if it was due to ammo, this could really be it. The moisture somehow got into the casing and destroyed most of the powder, which did not burn and thus the blast of gas produced was not enough to push the bullet all the way through the barrel.\n\n3- The dia of the bullet was somewhat larger than the one which could easily pass through the barrel.\n\nWhen you get out the lodged bullet, inspect it for dia and compare it with others of the same lot.\nDo not fire remaining bullets of the same lot in this or any other gun.\nDO NOT TRY TO PULL THE LODGED BARELL. PUSH IT ALL THE WAY THROUGH MUZZLE END. or you will destroy the barrel.\nOnce the bullet is out, check the barrel for a "BULGE"on inside and outside, if any present, change the barel.\n\nPost results for everyones benefit.', ''),

Mr. CC have listed all the possible causes of a weaker bang. Had there been a full bang there could have been a greater damage to the slide and a nasty recoil of the pistol as full energy must have released backward. I have seen a that kind of accident at LRC and the guy involved was a medalist shooter Mr Raza Tarin(whom ABBAS bought Rugger) and the gun was Glock. Whenever there is a weak bang we find a lot of unburnt gunpowder in chamber and slide, mostly shell dosen''t get ejected(due to the lack of power) and pallet stuck in the barrel(due to lack of power).\nIf the ammo go off with full force then there can be wrong diameter projectile or way too accessive jammed barrel to create a such result of stuck projectile. Beleive me, this kind of situation seldom go without damaging the gun.\n\nNow few words about the TAURUS, i really feel odd when i see so many bad reviews about this gun. Fortunately my experience with Taurus is completely different. Besides Glock 17 i have PT92 and 24/7. My PT92 is the gun of my choice on range, have fired more than 3000 rounds (Chinese and POF)since i have bought this gun and have never came across a single FTF or FTE. A friend of mine Mr MUNIR a senior member on our forum, an experienced shooter also have the same experience. Mr Munir won Silver medal in big bore shooting this year and the gun he used was a PT92.

While most modern arms are fine to dry fire. The firing pins can be damaged by constantly hitting the backside of the breach face. Hence why snap caps are recommended for dry fire practice.

(36042, ' Now to clear the point Abu made kindly read the following;\nThe older guns and primarily revolvers had a tendency to work the firing pin loose at the hammer. Back when the hammer held the firing pin. Todays revolvers don''t have that problem. In the older rifles that had a hammer set firing pin the soft pin that held the firing pin in the hammer would sheer off and you would lose or damage the firing pin. Floating pin assemblies on hammered rifles( like winchesters and sharps) would sometimes sheer the tip of the firing pin or the pin would jam in the forward position literally wedging itself into it''s own frame. We don''t have these problems today with the end of the use of brass springs. On rim fire guns especially revolvers and some bolt action rifles you can get a pinging effect inside the breech or on the revolver cylinder damaging them. The firing pin is also blunted and ultimately shortened causing misfire. The only real dry fire damage today is on rim fire revolvers most other guns have that extra space to keep the firing pin from striking steel. That extra 1/1000 of an inch makes a big difference.\n\nFrom the above it seems that modern Fire Arms can be dry fired but why would you risk such a thing which might turn out bad for you.', ''),

All firearms must be registered, both handguns and long guns. We are trying to do away with the long gun registry, but it is a struggle.\n\nWe can use any type of long gun for hunting except Assault rifles such as the AR15. We can use semi auto as long as it is not an AR configuration. Rifles and shotguns are permitted depending on the species hunted. I''m fortunate to live in Alberta as we have a wide variety of game to hunt and a great deal of land to access.\nI have access to several million acres of both private and public land.\n\nI use a 60 gr bullet in my Swift for the wolves, and a 52 gr.

(36621, ' I''m a new member here and some of this info may be a repeat of what you already know.\nI will assume that some of you are unfamiliar with some things in Canada and make this post on that basis.\n\nWe have several levels of government that regulate firearms ownership, usage and hunting.\n\nThe country is divided into provinces[states]. \n\nThe federal [national] government sets regs in our criminal code.\n\nThe provinces fine tune these regs and add hunting rules to them. \n\nThen smaller governments,[city, county] add further restrictions as to where a firearm may be discharged etc.\n\n\nTo own, borrow, buy or possess a firearm in Canada requires a federal permit. To obtaim that permit an individual must take a course. The course is approx. 10 hours for long guns and an additional 6 hours for handguns. It includes instruction re: safety, function, storage and laws pertaining to different types of firearms. There is a written test as well as a practical test.\n\nI am a federal firearms instructor, and have put approx 400 students through the course.\n\nThere are background checks for criminal records etc.\n\nOnce the permit is issued. The individual can buy as many firearms as they wish with some restrictions.  Assault type rifles and handguns require a different level of instruction and a different permit.\n\nAll firearms must be registered by the owner in a national registry.\n\nThe provincial and city governments will also have some restrictions as to how where and when firearms may be used within their boundaries.\n\nIf a person wants to hunt, they must take a provincial hunter education course. This course requires about 25 hours of instruction and a written and practical test. The hunt course covers ethics, safety, firearms functions, wildlife identification, archery hunting, survival etc.\n\nI''ve been a provincial hunting instructor since 1975 and have lost track of how many students I have put through the course.\n\nWe are fortunate in Alberta in that we have  terrain and an abundance of wildlife and birds to hunt. We do not have a large population of hunters, but we do have access to a large and base to hunt on. This made up of both public and private land.\nthe terrain ranges from large rugged and isolated mountain ranges to open gras plains and everything between. \n\nAlberta is about 661,848 km2  in area and has a population of 3.6 million. Most of those are in the cities of course, so we can go fro days hunting and not see another person.\n\nHere''s a link to some information about Alberta.\n\n[url]http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alberta[/url]\n\nIf you have any questions, fire away:D i''ll try to answer them.

They range in color form blond through brown, cinnamon, and  black. A good bear will be 2 meters from nose to tail.\n\nI use calls to hunt them. I set up on the ground in my ghillie suit and use animal distress sounds to call them in. Fawn distress or cub bear sounds are effective. We can call them into bow range.

The 8 x 57 was stamped later at DARRA as 8x57 was a German Cartridge and not American.\n8X 57 military surplus ammo was and still is lying in abundance in Darra so this rifle was stamped as an 8x57. I am not sure whether it was re-barreled; in all probability the bore was enlarged from .300 to .315 to shoot  the .323 bullets with out excessive presures. This was done by using bits in hook cutting devices employed usually in Darra, I have seen M1 Garrands also similarly converted to 8X57 from 30-06.', ''),

(36696, ' These two rounds are the most widely used over here in Pakistan. Also for SD and LE role both of these are in use. So what do you people think about these two?\nI would lik to post my opion on both of these rounds as follows:\n\n- There are 2 types of .30 bores which can be used in TT pistols, a Tokarev(Russian) bullet and a Mauser(German) bullet\n.30 bore = 7.62x25mm cartridge = Also called Tokarev Round = Thinner bullet\nalso there is a .30 Mauser bullet which can also be used in a TT pistol = 7.63x25mm Mauser \n\n- on the other hand:\n9mm = 35.56 bore = 9x19mm cartridge = Also called 9mm parabellum or 9mm Luger = Fatter bullet\n........................\n"Tokarev round" is a very powerful round a generating power levels upto 300 to 600 foout pounds,HPs are also available for this round by Sellior & Bellot company though someone should import themt to Pak. these tokarevs have velocities normally from 1400 upto 1700 fps depending upon the charge and even higher upto 2200 fps in specialized AP ammo used by some militaries. Bullet weights range from 80 to 100 grains. The mauser bullet(7.63x25mm) was from Germany which was the base bullet for Tokarevs technically. They are very similar bullets and that is why Soviets used Mauser bullets used by Germans in their C96 Mauser captured and then later used in their TTs.. however tokarev is loaded to higher pressures and little greater powder charge as compated to Mauser ammo, that is why it generates nearly identical or sometimes higher energy levels/velocities than mauser ammo. Armour Piercing rounds are also available for this. They are better suited for Submachine gun ammo.. however tokarev''s stopping power is less as compared to 9mm. they are more flat shooting than 9mm. in SD role only JHP tokarev bullet would do a difference otherwise its a zipper round. wont stay inside body and drill a very narrow hole, if bleeding is stopped, man shot by tokarev can reach hospital on his own feet :) steel core russian/eastern europian ammo is easy to find for this round, also JHPs are now available. Normal FMJs are real good penetrators in car chassis and windshields.. but their ability to kill after penetration is 50% cuz of light weight and fast moving hence unstable projectile afterwards an initial hit.\n....................................................\n"9mm" is a very high pressure cartridge like SIG .357. using a smaller case and gaining higher case pressures make it versatile .. still used at war fronts. 9mm still have adequate usage all around the world due to its over all volume of the round. easy on transporting/carrying and manufacturing. 9mm also is quite a zipp through round on human targets so in SD role a JHP 9mm is taken as something serious all around the world. Ball round is basically used in subguns in LE and military. Powerlevels of 9mm ranges from 350 to 500 Foot pounds max/ Velocitis vary from subsonic 900+ fps to 1400 fps depending on powder and even as high as 1700fps in some specialized AP ammo. Weights of projectile varies from usually 100 to 147 grains. Its a round that is commercially available in so many configurations of bullets and power levels. FMJ/JHP, bonded cores, EFMJ, Wadcutters, steel cores etc. 9mm loaded to higher power levels with steel cores do penetrate level 2 bullet proof vests and in normal FMJ configuration it does penetrate and still kill a target behind a wind shield and common automibile   chassis. also 9mm is most widely used semi auto pistol cartridge all over the world. It is a very well balanced round that sits of the edge of performance/ballistics with respect to cost of manufacturing. not too much power and not too less, just a middle rounder cartridge makes it versatile all the way.\n\n- In my opinion Tokarev or their modern counter parts such as FN 5.7x28mm are better suited for specialized use such as AP, flat shooting, and war fronts. It is war front where hitting and injuring is preferable than killing. injured army men are demoralizers to rest of army.\n- 9mm is more versatile and can perform within civilian regime as well as battle grounds.\n[url=http://www.postimage.org/][img]http://img6.imageshack.us/img6/7221/88907234.jpg[/img][/url]', ''),

(36702, ' there we go again, I guess it was just a matter of time before this forum consumes itself over this age old debate of SxS vs O/U. in almost every single forum on internet and where ever two or more shotgunnners meet this topic eventually pops up. to me this is like which came first, "chicken before the egg" or "the egg before the chicken" type dilema.\n\nallow me to simplify it for you guyz in a bid to put this blaze out before it does any serious damage.\n\n[b]O[/b]riginally if u look back through the history pages, the first double barrel was infact an O/U (contarary to a popular belief that Adam and Eve used to hunt with a SxS shotgun). it was later a SxS was designed, not because it offered any advantage by its design, it was basically that vertical stacked barrels (in O/U) posed problems in designing an efficient/effective/reliable trigger mechanism. A double barrel SxS''s trigger mechanism (hammer and flint lock types) was easier to design in a horizontal configuration. as the technology progressed, browning gave re-birth to O/U design with the legendary trigger mechanism still considered the most reliable of any shotgun ever produced. now with dawn of international sporting events and splendid media converage of those events and styles/trends associated with it, O/U are making a huge come back, pushing SxS in to the haze which for long has been the domain of O/U.\n\nThat was the histroy lesson, now lets get digging into the advantages/disadvantages of each type.\n\n\n[b]SxS:[/b]\n\nBarrels are stacked horizontaly, this gives low profile to the receiver (a plus), breaking open the sidelock/boxlock is easier as user doesnt have to open it to a larger angle to insert/eject the cartridges. it gives a large sighthing plane, somewhat usefull in bird hunting (flushing). then there is that traditionalism associated with a fine SxS shotgun. since barrels are horizontally stacked, their over all profile is lowered, giving an impression (only an impression) they''ll swing more smoothly to a fast moving target.\n\nDown side to this type of barrel configuation is that recoil is a mess, one barrel pushes the shoulder one way and other barrel pushes it the other way (to a degree i''m not comfortable with). the muzzle jump is screwy too, one barrel flips right and other barrel flips left.\n\n[b]O/U:[/b]\n\nHere, barrels are stacked vertically, one barrel on top of the other hence single sighting plane for both barrels. your both barrels (ideally) should behave as if its a single barrel gun. narrow and single sighting plane is a big plus in skeet/trap (as the target is small and fast moving). the same can be said about hunting scenarios as single sighting plane is quiet helpful. recoil is superb, single recoil angle, same barrel jump/flip for both barrels is also very helpful (when u consider second shot at the same fast moving target).\n\nDownside to vertically configured barrels would be that receiver is odd looking, its not sleek enough (with newer machining however receivers are comming in ever slimmer and low profile shapes). you have to break open the shotgun to a larger degree to insert/eject cartridges since reaching down to the chamber of bottom barrel can be considered difficult (can be a pain if you have to do it over and over and over and over and over again). larger angle break opening also poses problems in duck blinds (limited space).\n\n[b]Summary:[/b]\n\nWell, in the end it all boils down to personal preferance, however if u look at the general trend worldwide, sport shooters almost always prefer O/U (its the "in-thing" these days), a fine over and under shotgun is perfect for serious sports shooting along with hunting every now and then. infact internationally anybody who prefers sports shooting (given a O/U user) would almost always prefer a O/U for hunting as well.\n\nOn a sports field, a Side by Side is like an extinct species, u cant do skeet or trap with it (ok u can, sorta like Suzuki Mehran can do a little bit of off-roading if the need ever arises). the wider sighting plane might be useful in bird hunting but poses serious problems in skeet/trap as the target totally disappears between the two barrels. thats why u dont see any SxS in any international sporting event. for hunting this wider sighting is a plus (for some).\n\nin the end it all boils down to personal taste and preference. if u see ur self in the mirror as a person wearing a traditional khaky safari suit with brown leather long boots smoking a cigar, i''m sure if u''ll also see a SxS shotgun in the picture as well.\n\nand if u see ur self wearing a half sleeve polo shirt, NIKE/ADDIDAS sports shoes/joggers, sports/digital watch, a very cool shade, ducks unlimited eyewear, and an energy drink in the nearby then ur probably the O/U type of a guy.\n\n[b]Regards.[/b]', ''),

It beats having to lug around a full size auto.  If its only for self defence then I would recommend it.', ''),

Today RUAG Ammotec Austria GmbH is the distributor for civil ammunition of the RUAG group in Austria and many countries in Eastern Europe and Latin America, as well as representative of many other important brands in Austria, as REMINGTON, RIO, GLOCK, ANSCHÜTZ, TITAN, NORINCO, DIANA, KAHLES, MEOPTA, OPTOLYTH, EAW-Apel, GFT-WEGU, LYMAN-PACHMAYR, SICKINGER, BARNETT, etc. For export they offer also WALTHER, SIG, H&K, CZ, and more to some countries.\nThere earlier models were named Gustav as I have seen some...A friend has one with 32" barrels and we call it canon :) Rifles produced by Geco were named Gecado. Geco were also known for production of First Ever Botl Action 12 Guage Shotgun :) the gun used to be known as GEHA and its nickname was HHH (Hard Heart Hitter). \nGustav Genschow OR Geco were an early manufacturer of such guns…this company also made single-shot .22 S-L-LR rifles in the 1920’s.  Due to Jewish ownership, however, the Third Reich redistributed Genschow’s assets to Nazi-friendly companies such as Gustloff-Werke.

(37196, ' Bore sighting is a popular technique that helps set the scope "in the ball park" very quickly.  Still one need to fire a few shots to get sighted in perfectly, but it will always adjust the bullet impact within a few inches or less.   The person who demonstrated this process used a 25 yard pistol target located 100 yards away.   This provides the perfect view for best results.   \n[url=http://www.postimage.org/][img]http://www.postimage.org/aV1ulxCJ.jpg[/img][/url]\nStart by removing the bolt, then using a good rest, position your rifle so that you can look through the barrel and see the target.   Be sure that your rifle doesn''t move after it is positioned. \n\nRemove your bolt, and position your rifle so that the target \nappears centered when looking through your barrel.\n\n\n[url=http://www.postimage.org/][img]http://img11.imageshack.us/img11/9248/29564866.jpg[/img][/url]\n\nBore sighting is an easy preliminary method of sighting in that doesn''t require any special equipment.   It''s an easy procedure, and all you need is a rest that can hold your rifle steady, while you make the scope adjustments.   I''ve seen many new shooters that would have saved lots of time and ammunition, if they just knew how to bore sight their rifle.\n\n\n[url=http://www.postimage.org/][img]http://img31.imageshack.us/img31/3015/74587351.jpg[/img][/url]\nThe crosshairs might look like this . . . . so the steps to adjust this difference is as follows:\n\nNow that your barrel is perfectly lined up with the target, you know that your crosshairs also need to be centered.   However, this is where shooters often get confused.   You don''t want to move the crosshairs LOW and LEFT according to the turret markings, because that would move your bullet impact right off the target.\n\nThe markings on scope turrets indicate the direction of bullet impact, not the direction of crosshair movement.   In this case, you need to adjust your scope UP and RIGHT according to the turret markings, until the crosshairs are centered on the pistol target.   Remember to not move your rifle at all when making these adjustments.\n\nHave fun.\n\nThanx to Larry W.', ''),

Having said this, I myself do use the word Mosque and have also heard many ulema also use the word. In fact there is a popular Islamic QnA website where people write in to get fatawa and the shaikh on that site who is a very big alim in the Arab world has not objected to the usage of the term Mosque. Anyway I found this short article on the subject quite interesting and informative\n\n\n[quote]\n [b]Question:[/b] I was flipping through this book the other day called ‘The Complete Idiot’s Guide to Understanding Islam’ and it is filled with fun facts. One of them concerns the term ‘Mosque’. This book pointed out that the term ‘mosque’ is derived from the Spanish word for ‘mosquito’. It was termed as such because during the Crusades, King Ferdinand said they were going to go and swat the Muslims ‘like mosquitoes’. Please let me know.\n\n\n   [b] Answer:[/b] From my research, I have found that there are four possible origins for the word ‘mosque’ in the English language. The first possibility is that it derives from the French word ‘mosquee’ that existed during the period in French linguistic history known as ‘Middle French’. The second possibility is that it is a derivative of the Arabic word ‘masjid’. The third possibility is that it derives from the Old Italian word ‘moschea’ and the final possibility is that it comes from the Old Spanish word ‘mezquita’. These various words were used to describe the Muslim place of worship in the various languages mentioned. \n    My research found no indication that mosque was derived from the word ‘mosquito’. Regarding the appearance of the term mosque in the English language, scholars suggest it was around 1711 AD. This is far after King Ferdinand and the Crusades. It might be that the term ‘mezquita,’ used to describe a masjid in old Spanish, came from the word ‘mosquito’ and then subsequently the term ‘mezquita’ was used to form the term mosque. However, this would not mean that the term mosque was developed as a result of the story you related.\n    With the above in mind, I believe it is important to keep a sensible perspective when approaching the origin of words. Words are dynamic and over time often change their meanings from what they originally may have been intended for. It is likely that there are many words in all languages that result from the ignorance or hatred that may have once existed between peoples, races, tribes or religions. We should consider contemporary usage of words and the intention of their current meanings as most important. \n    Two examples of this might help give a better perspective. The term ‘picnic’ in the English language came under fire some years back when certain scholars suggested that it was actually a shortened version of ‘pick a nigger’. Some decades ago, in the US, there was a racist and vulgar practice known as lynching, where a mob of white people would torture and mutilate a black person (then derogatively called a ‘nigger’), often under the false pretext that this person was guilty of a crime. This lynching often involved an entire event where people brought food and family to a park and watched the lynching. Subsequent to the lynching they would take pictures next to the mutilated body! Some scholars contend that the concept of a picnic, and the actual term, resulted from this practice of ‘picking a nigger’ to lynch and having a small feast at the event. Now despite the possibility of a treacherous background to this word, its usage in common times connotes nothing of the sort. \n    Similarly, the Arabic term ‘ajami has commonly been used, throughout Islamic history, to refer to non-Arabs or those who did not speak Arabic. The meaning of this word is actually in reference to those animals, like goats and cows, that make one syllable sounds. Hence, the term contains cultural superiority and a arrogant insult towards non-Arabic speakers. However, now this term has become synonymous with non-Arabic speaking peoples, forsaking its original background.\n\n(Adnan Zulfiqar)\n\n[/quote]', ''),

To summarise there is nothing wrong with using the word mosque and it does not mean "the house of mosquito".\n\n\nTo quote just one  paragraph from this detailed article.\n\n[quote][b]"So we may rest assured, a mosquito remains a mosquito and a mosque remains a mosque. Neither Ferdinand or Isabella were ever recorded to have ever stated that they would squash the mosques like mosquitoes, and even if they did, they would have used the word mezquita anyway which was the word already established in Spain for a masjid.\nIt is unfortunate that I have on many occasions read ‘warning’ chain e-mails informing Muslims to desist in using the English word ‘mosque’ due to its evil origins.. This should serve as a reminder to at least attempt to properly verify such things, and a lesson to not believe everything we read (especially from books which self-describe themselves as being for idiots). Feel free to use the words mosque, mosqueé, mezquita, and ponder over the history of this word and how it carries with it part of our Islamic legacy and is a testament to the great Muslim nation of al-Andalus which for 800 years existed in Western Europe." \n[/b][/quote]\n\n\n[url]http://muslimspeak.wordpress.com/2009/01/15/the-meaning-and-evolution-of-the-word-mosque/[/url]', ''),

I also have three extended chokes and have always found their patterns to be less than ideal with lead, with steel shot however they are fine. but since in Pakistan most shooting is done with lead shots, its pointless to have "steel rated only" choke tubes.\n\ni''ve heard about carlsons but cant say much about them, If u''r thinking of buying aftermarket chokes to improve patterns then go for Trulock (i''ve ordered four for my cousin and used them) or colonial arms. as far as these two manufacturers are concerned, their chokes definately improve patterns and are true to their advertisement/claim.\n\nRegards', ''),

We should inform all Muslims and discourage foreigners using such a bad name of our holly places. \n\nPlease note, the "Gora" wants his worshipping place to be called as Church but it is the height of his disregard for the other cultures that in English language he''ll use a general term like "temple" for worshipping places of other followers, whereas, the Hindu''s temple is called Mandar, the Sikhs call them Gurduwara, Muslims call them Masjid, Jews call them Synagogue and so on !  ... So !!!!\n\nIT  IS  MASJID -  NOT  MOSQUE !\n\nMany of us think that perhaps Mosque is the English translation of Masjid but in reality, it is not …! \n\nHave you ever wondered how this came into being when it does not sound anywhere close to Masjid or to be an adaptation ?\n\nMosque is a distortion of the Spanish word MOSQUITO which is used as such in English with same meaning - insect mosquito !\n\nThe word MASJID came to be termed as MOSQUE because King Ferdinard of Spain boasted that Muslims in Spain would be killed like MOSQUITOES.  The places where Muslims used to gather in large numbers were the masjids and that is where it was most convenient to attack and murder them.\n\nTo the Spaniards, taking their lead from their king, attacking congregations  of  Muslims  in  Masjids  was  indeed  like swatting mosquitoes, so the term MOSQUE (abbreviation for the place where Muslim Mosquitoes were best ''swatted''  in large numbers) was introduced.

(37935, ' [b]BE SURE YOUR WEAPON IS UNLOADED!!![/b] You could shoot yourself or someone else and we really don''t want that. Remove the MAGAZINE by pressing the MAGAZINE RELEASE BUTTON. BE SURE that the chamber is EMPTY by pulling back on the slide. Lock the slide open by pushing the slide catch lever up with the slide back. Look in the chamber (from the side not down the barrel) and make sure there is no bullet there. \nWith the slide locked open twist the slide disassembly latch down (clockwise) until it stops.\nCompletely remove the slide disassembly latch from the frame.\n\nCarefully release the slide catch, and with the slide under FULL control, pull the slide forward off of the frame. - If the slide sticks on the frame, be sure the chamber is empty (YOU DID DO THAT, RIGHT???) and firmly pull the trigger fully to the rear while pulling the slide forward off the frame. - If the slide does not move because the barrel remains to the rear and tilted upward, be sure the chamber is empty and push the muzzle against the palm of your hand while pushing the slide forward with the other. \nTake out the spring. Note: this is a spring. Be careful. \nTake out the barrel and that''s as apart as this gun ever needs to get without a gunsmith. \nUse a wire brush to get all the really tough stuff out of the barrel. You should only push the brush in the direction that the bullet would travel. Do this a few times. \nYou don''t need to remove the bore brush to pull it back through the barrel as the cleaning rod rotates provided that you grip it from the handle. Still always push the brush and the patch through the bore from the breech end of the barrel only, never from the muzzle end. \nWet a patch with solvent and run it through the bore a few times, then set the barrel aside and leave it wet with solvent. Go clean the frame/slide. By leaving the barrel to soak you allow the solvent to soften and losen any hard caked on fouling. \nNow you come back to the barrel. Get several patches ready. Wet the bore brush with solvent and grip the cleaning rod at the base just above the handle and rotate the brush in the chamber first, this scrubs the chamber and headspace area. Next grip the t-handle of the rod and push all the way through the bore back and forth several times, allowing the rod to rotate in the bore as the brush contacts with the lands and grooves. Make sure the brush is screwed on tight and does not come loose from the rod when pulling it back through the bore, sometimes they tend to come loose making them ineffective on the pull through. Next attach your slotted jag and take a wetted patch and run it back and forth a few times through the bore. Make sure these patches fit reasonably snug in the bore. I like to to rotate them in the chamber first to allow the patch to swirl around the jag for better surface contact once in the bore. Repeat with a new wet patch a few more times and keep changing them until one comes out clean. When you are satisfied take a snug fitting dry clean patch and dry the bore. Hold your barrel up to a light and inspect it, or use a light. Is it clean? Any area where the is still fouling? If so, then repeat the barrel cleaning prosess until you are satisfied. About every 5000 rounds or so use a copper solvent to remove copper fouling from your bore. Just to keep it in check, copper fouling really isn''t that detrimental to pistols as it is to accuracy in precision rifles. When using a copper solvent for copper removal make sure to use only a steel or aluminum rod and plastic bore brush and plastic slotted jag, no brass or bronze. \nPut the cleaning rod through the barrel. Put a large patch (square piece of cloth from ur old T Shirt.. lolz) on the end of the cleaning rod, dip the patch in solvent and pull it through the barrel. Pull the patch through in the same direction as the bullet would travel. Repeat with a new patch until the patches comes out clean. You can then wipe the outside of the barrel with a patch and solvent. \nSlide/Frame: Get some clean cotton cloths (again old laundered T-shirts) cut to about 7X7 inches or so. You will need at least 4 of these per cleaning. Get several Q-tips. Get a wooden chopstick and whittle the end to a chisel tip. Pipe cleaners also come in handy. Wet one of the cloths with solvent and wipe the inside of the frame and slide. Pay special attention to the breech face and extractor area. Use solvent wet Q-tips and a wet patch with the chopstick to get crud out of the rail and rail grooves, fouling out if the breech face and extractor claw. Pay attention to the locking lugs too. Use as many q-tips, cloths, and patches as you need for this. When satisfied, take your last clean dry cotton cloth and wipe dry all the solvent and crud from your slide/frame. \nLook at all the metal flakes inside the slide. Clean out the slide with a patch and some solvent.\nDo the same with the handle full of metal flakes.\nPut the barrel and spring back together the same way they came apart just in reverse order.\nBefore re-assemebly make sure all the solvent is wiped dry. A blow works well for blowing out any residual solvent still hiding in hard to reach places. Inspect all the parts for wear, cracks, or breakage. Make sure to never over oil your gun. The better method for oiling any firearm is to use only a very very slightly dampened patch and wipe oil residue on the rails, lugs, and outside of the barrel before assembeling. All you need is a very slight and very thin film of oil on guns, you should barely be able to see it with your eyes. Remember that if you see any oil running or oosing out any time, you''ve got way too much oil.\n\nOnce in a while disassemble your magazines and clean them with solvent then wipe dry. \nPut the slide back on the same way it came off. Pull it all the way back and lock it open with the slide catch lever.\n\n\nPut the slide disassembly latch back in. UPDATE: Be sure that the barrel is all the way forward before attempting to replace the slide disassembly latch.\n\n\nThae spring makes insertion of the slide disassembly latch VERY difficult. Orient the slide disassembly latch with the tab facing the rear of the pistol and push it in. It will be hard but it does go in other side\n Source: [url]http://www.kaptain.us/guns/clean.html[/url]', ''),

Is this not to be done during initial period?[/quote]\n\n\nwhen the manual says "lubricate each time...." it means lubricate each time before any firing session, it doesn''t mean to lubricate before each shot. the purspose of the above statement is to ensure that the operator purposedly over lubricates the gun as during the break-in period all moving parts are sorta grinding with each other before setting down to their desired position.\n\nfrom over lubrication I recon: lubricate to the point where u can see a very thin film of oil on all critical/moving parts (they should look shiny), it doesnt mean that the film be thick enough for u to see ur own reflection or the oil should drip all the way down to ur boots.\n\nabout the break-in period, it is recommended to fire 100-150 regular 32g hunting loads then check with light target loads and if it cycles, perfect, if it doesnt do an extra 50 rounds before adjusting the gas system. in the meanwhile dont even touch the gas valve/regulator/gas nut.\n\nContemporary thought:\n\njust load two snap caps or fired/spent cartridges in the magazine tube and then simply pull the cocking handle to chamber the cartridge then dry fire then cycle the cocking handle/bolt manually as this will eject the snap cap/cartridge and will load the other one into the chamber then dry fire again and maually cycle the cocking handle/bolt. do this proceedure 100 times and you are finished with the break-in proceedure.\n\nthen go to the range, try the lighter loads, if they cycle, perfect!, if they dont, try the above mentioned proceedure again.\n\ntheoratically, i dont see a reason why this proceedure shouldnt work. as far as plain theory or mechanics is concerned, break-in is just supposed to cycle to the gun multiple time in order to settle all working parts at their desired position and grind/rub the action smooth to permit easy cycling.\n\nRegards', ''),

(Angelina Jolie In Wanted) You have to be extremely accustomed with your weapon to fully utilize it in an SD/HD situation as most of the time Panic kicks in and while using a .45 ACP or 9MM, we might be empty before we even hit the culprit. Its not just about killing the person but actually saving yourself and your family at that time. If we go into detail of using any Calibre other then 9MM, then its extremely expensive at the end of the day. We might have to fire at least 500 Rounds to just get accurate enough to shoot something at the first try. I feel that there is still room for error in that.

The results of killing an indl (that is 302) is much different then injuring a person. Human life is too precious to be wasted like this. I think that small bullets like 32 bore or even .22 are very effective in stopping anyone with less chances of killing and then facing the sweat music of our judicial /police system.\nBullets like hallow point and buck shots are very lethal and should not be used at all except by security forces.', ''),
(38361, ' Problem is, smaller bullets like those aforementioned have lower energy upon impact. The aim of selecting the correct ammo is not to kill, not to injure. It is to simply STOP, whichever way possible. Now the smaller (and faster) calibers do create wounds, but due to lower energy at impact time (or simply zipping through the body tissue, due to higher velocities), they are unable to stop the assailant in time. Agreed that all of them can kill, maim, injure, etc, but some of them have a higher probability of stopping an assailant than others due to the fact that they deliver higher impact energy, thus the word "stopping power".\n\nThe objective of someone in an SD situation is to simply stop the assailant as quickly as possible. Granted that the smaller calibers can stop the fight, but the more powerful ones may be able to stop it in one go.\n\nBtw, the best caliber for SD/HD in handguns would preferably be the .45ACP or the .357 Magnum, but due to the higher recoil of these rounds, the 9mm, .38 Special and the .40 S&W (where it''s available) are more than enough.\n\nAs far as only [b]HD[/b] is concerned, the best bet would be a 12 Gauge shotgun.

"THOROUGHLY" :) Information & Knowledge levels of members were challenged as well :)) The mystery of NPB & PB in terms of rifles is based on the licences issued by MOI and that issued by provincial government! Ministry Of Interior considers any calibre (OF RIFLES) above .22 (Bolt Action) as a PB!!! And for the issuance of licence there is a set proceadure where earlier Prime minister''s senction was required but later it was transfered to Interior Minister! On the other hand provincial governments i.e. Sind, Punjab & N.W.F.P. do not consider rifles as a PB but licence I beleive restricts you to carry the weapon from one province to the other! Charm of the licence issued by MOI is the permission to carry the weapon all over Pakistan. It is my knowledge so far ;) Now, this is the reason....whenever members from Capital or rawalpindi give their comments they confirm such rifles as a PB & those from Sind always take it as a NPB. I always say we have different experiences and this forum is meant to provide us a platform to share it. In earlier discussion couple of members got confused and instead of realizing the nature/base of information, started challenging the source of information and knowledge levels of each other :) That''s little absurd I believe!

(38386, ' Steven, Its nice to know your interest in PAKISTAN scene. Let me summarize few things which can enable you to understand the overall scenario.\n1. GUNS are very expensive here, especially premium products like GLOCKS etc. A GLOCK 17 costs around $4000 here. This makes the ownership a very exclusive affair. Thats why Chinese 7.62 (.30 calibre) handguns & 9mm s are the most common. A chinese SIG clone costs around $500 in the local market.\n2. Ammo is also very expensive. 9mm chinese ammo costs around $45 per 100 rounds. That also makes things a lot on the up side considering our per capita income.\n3. Ranges & clubs are very few. You can say only 3 in whole of PAKISTAN. \nDespite all this GUNS are a very traditional things here. They are regarded are a MAN''s JEWELLERY. Lot of enthusiasts here prefer it over owning a nice car etc etc. Also in certain TRIBAL & remote areas where you can see a lot of guns , you will be amazed at the shooting skills the people can display. In my opinion its always the passion which counts above esay access or availablity, otherwise similar countries like ours in SOUTH AMERICA would not have been producing so much classy soccer players', ''),

(38540, ' This is what US states what an assault rifle is and is once again trying to pass into law PERMANENTLY.\n\nDefinition of assault weapon\nNote: there are differing definitions of ''assault weapon'' that are listed at Assault weapon. This page refers to the usage in the United States under the previous and proposed assault weapon bans. \nAssault weapon refers to firearms that had been developed from earlier fully-automatic firearms into semi-automatic civilian-legal versions. Semi-automatic firearms, when fired, automatically extract the spent casing and load the next round into the chamber, ready to fire again; they do not fire automatically like a machine gun, rather, only 1 shot comes from each trigger pull.\n\nBy former U.S. law, the legal term assault weapon included certain specific semi-automatic firearm models by name (e.g., Colt AR-15, TEC-9, all non-automatic AK-47s, and Uzis) and other semi-automatic firearms because they possess a minimum set of features from the following list of features:\n\n \nA semi-automatic AK-47 rifle. \nAn Intratec TEC-DC9 with 32-round magazine; a semi-automatic pistol formerly classified as an Assault Weapon under Federal Law.Semi-automatic rifles able to accept detachable magazines and two or more of the following: \nFolding or telescoping stock \nPistol grip \nBayonet mount \nFlash suppressor, or threaded barrel designed to accommodate one \nGrenade launcher (more precisely, a muzzle device which enables the launching or firing of rifle grenades) \nSemi-automatic pistols with detachable magazines and two or more of the following: \nMagazine that attaches outside the pistol grip \nThreaded barrel to attach barrel extender, flash suppressor, handgrip, or suppressor \nBarrel shroud that can be used as a hand-hold \nUnloaded weight of 50 oz (1.4 kg) or more \nA semi-automatic version of an automatic firearm \nSemi-automatic shotguns with two or more of the following: \nFolding or telescoping stock \nPistol grip \nFixed capacity of more than 5 rounds \nDetachable magazine \nThe earlier term assault rifle refers to rifles that are capable of fully automatic fire. In contrast, the term "assault weapon" refers to weapons capable of semi-automatic fire that had those certain features, as listed above. The ban did not cover "assault rifles", but merely the new category of "assault weapons" which did not include automatic firearms of any type.\n\nThis information was a quick search in Wikipedia.', ''),

As the trigger is pulled they sequentially disengage, and as the pistol fires and the trigger returns to its forward position, they re-engage.

Nice rackie mission ; it takes some effort to do that. However: (1) Daldal position there at spots (2) Local wooden boat availability there to reach center, and (3) A day before you plan your shoot, NUMBER of flocks passing LOW during early morning 2 hrs ... have to seen further (reported by your guides etc).\r\n\r\nOur areas/spots don''t have full potential reports till now. Only 4-5 flocks (teals and pintails some) reported crossing daily at shooting range (not the sky busting ranges which are IRRELEVANT as far as rackie is concerned); am waiting for better (full potential reports). Heat wave has not subsided yet ... thats one reason too.\r\n\r\nThe spotting scope picture (of loafing ducks) seems good ... is that scope digital photo enabled ... like digital binocular cameras are ?[/QUOTE].\r\n\r\n@Francolino brother, no doubt its Ducks Heaven, my today''s fresh report is also good one. Site is Khanki 7Km-8Km downstream, not an easy to approach there, you have to cross the dense thick & tall bushes and grass for exit and entrance, also a wide sand bed East to West like breath breaking desert with soft sand paches (Daldal) to be need a technical drive, no local boat is there, and without local friends  crimenology senes can be there. So, these are the reasons why ducks are in good numers at these spots.\r\nFurther we will discuss on phone , inshaAllah.\r\n\r\nYes scope is an able for digital photos spots, I have came-scope connecter but rarely I am mounting, its good if you have only Wildlife photography trip, regards.', ''),

They will serve to drive away the bad guys.\n\n\nHowever, if your house has been invaded and the BD(s) are inside, then you have to be the one to take the initiative. They are threatening you on your turf, and if you don''t do something about it, some loved one might get injured or GOD FORBID, killed.\n\nGoing through this topic, I am reminded of a passage in a fiction story I read long ago. A young boy questions an elderly cop (or cowboy) how has he survived for so long, seeing as he doesn''t have particularly impressive skills. The old man answered: my opponents hesitated, and I didn''t.\n\nIMHO if someone is inside your house, threatening you or your family, stay safe. Shoot first.\n\nIf someone says I don''t know what I''m talking about, let me just say that I''ve been a victim of a holdup at gunpoint inside my own house. The experience is quite scary to share, as I was quite young at the time (around 11), but let me tell you this: If I can help it, I will never let myself or a loved one go through that experience again.', ''),

I would welcome your views/advice.\n\nI would prefer something that can be carried in an ankle holster. If the Glock 19 were not so obscenely overpriced in Pak, I would have preferred that. At the moment, I am thinking of Stoeger Cougar. Though, I am not sure if it would work with an ankle holster (any views on that?). What would be better alternatives in your opinion?.\n\nI do not want to spend too much over a 100K but can be flexible.\n\n-----------------------\n\nAny views on availability in Karachi (of Stoeger or others that you may recommend) and price would be very welcome, as well.\nAlso, what ammo would you recommend (Chinese/POF/other?). I anticipate shooting 300-400 rounds a month so nothing too expensive, yet don’t want to damage gun (or lose a finger), either.\n\n-------------------------\nPS In 9mm handguns, I only have experience (about 1500 rounds) with a CZ 75 and was happy with its accuracy and recoil.\nPPS Just out of curiosity, what is the price of a Glock 19 or 26 in Pak?

As expected the trolling did not yield much results save for a ‘cuda ,so we decided to hunker down for bottom action. Soon as we lowered the first couple of lines, we started striking phukkis and kapartans etc. in the 1 kg range which felt great on light tackle. Knowing that we were positioned correctly over structure, lines at different columns were set out with dead and live baits. Ali expertly rigged his lure with all bells and whistles which attracted fish soon as he would hit bottom. We followed suit and the game was on. At around sundown all hell broke loose! Real screamed relentlessly as these bottom dwellers went on a feeding frenzy, there was non stop action for more than two hours….the action was so exhilarating that span seems like a blur now. We started hitting ‘cudas at mid-water and bottom, they would not let anything else take bait. But then it happened, a bigger strike peeling line away, I had to quickly tighten the drag before the fish headed into the rocks. The fight lasted a few minutes and there it was in all its glory a 6 kg Red Snapper. Moments later Salman felt a nibble on a TLD-15 with a light action rod and then it took! Salman fought his first fish on light tackle beautifully and now has been initiated with great honour!! Ali not to be out done, quickly matched the ante with a Red Snapper of his own which he brought up very briskly (must be all that tuna fighting experience ;) Now that we were in a blissful state of fishing nirvana and were content with our catch, with the fish still biting strong specially cuda’s we started releasing fish. Having fished with Mufti, now I can see why he inspires others and is able to create conversation and ethical awareness to differentiate between fishing and sport-fishing. \n\nCourtesy:  [url=http://www.pgfa.org]www.pgfa.org[/url]', ''),

This shape causes a rifle to recoil back - right into shooter''s face.   This stock design almost always delivers brutal recoil.   The 30-30 Win. is not a powerful caliber by any means, but just shoot one of these Winchesters, and one will feel a whole lot more recoil than he should.   It''s mostly due to this stock design.   The angle of the butt plate is another problem.   The top of the butt plate is slanted to the rear, and that causes recoil to pound the upper part of your shoulder.   This is the very worst stock design there is for comfortable shooting.\n\n[url=http://www.postimage.org/][img]http://img17.imageshack.us/img17/6691/81224318.jpg[/img][/url]\nThis particular Remington stock recoils straight back.   It''s much better.\n\nNotice how the comb of this stock is perfectly parallel with the barrel.   This allows the rifle to recoil straight back along (but not into) your face.   This stock design is a major improvement, and you''ll feel a great deal less recoil with this stock design.   The angle of this butt plate is also much better than the Winchester.   It''s still slanted slightly to the rear, (but not as much) and it delivers recoil lower on your shoulder where it''s more comfortable.   A well designed recoil pad obviously reduces recoil even more.\n\n[url=http://www.postimage.org/][img]http://img43.imageshack.us/img43/7797/47996581.jpg[/img][/url]\nThis type of (e.g. Weatherby) stocks are well designed, and one will feel much less recoil with this stock design.\n\nNotice how the front of the comb on this stock slopes downward.   This allows the rifle to recoil straight back, and away from your face.   This stock design also delivers recoil to your shoulder the way it should.   However, the butt plate is still not "perfectly" perpendicular to the barrel.   The top of the butt is slanted "very slightly" to the rear.   This puts recoil just a bit high on your shoulder.   Changing this angle just enough to make it perpendicular to the barrel would make the recoil feel noticably lighter, especially when shooting from the prone position or from a bench.\n\nThanx to Larry W.', ''),

(38711, ' [quote=Enigmatic Desires][quote=rizshu]This happens few months before when me and my wife and two kids were coming back from a friend’s sister wedding. It was around 2:30 am and both of my kids went to sleep in a car’s back seat when we left for home. As I am living with my parents but in a separate portion which is at the backside of the house. \n\nAs soon as I reach in my street I noticed that two persons with a motorbike were standing in front of a house, which was 4 houses away from my home. I stop the car in front of my home and my wife got out opens the door and I rushed the car into the porch. While my wife was opening the door I was noticing the two guys standing 4 houses after my home. \n\nAfter going in and locking the doors I got on the roof and start watching both of then as my sixth sense was telling me that there is something going wrong as the occupants of that house were a man and his wife with one son and a mother and a father.\n\nI was standing on the roof and after 10 mints both the boys start pushing their bike and after obtaining some distance they start the motorcycle and went away. I waited for almost next 15 mints and then I came down and change my cloths and was preparing to going to bed. \n\nI have routine that before going to sleep I check all the doors and windows of the house and lock the main gate my self. So I did the same and after that I went up on the roof and saw that a car was standing in front of that house and a boy who was previously on the motorbike was standing next to the car. \n\nAs I was noticing all that I saw that one BG came out of the car and jumped into that house. After seeing this I just rushed down to call the police as my cell was not with me and picked up my 12 gauge shotgun and start running on the roof and after coming on the roof I simply fire 3 shots one after another in air and forth one on the car and moved back. \n\nAs soon as I fired the 4 shots, (the bang was so powerful at 3:00 or 3:15 am) that BG comes out of that house from the main gate and just rushed out in hurry and then I came to know that they were not two they were actually 5. \n\nOne was sitting in the car, one was standing outside the car and one was standing inside the house right in front of the main gate and other two were I think was busy to get them inside the house[/quote]\n\nSir, That was a brave thing u did. Mostly people dont give a damn when some1 is being robbed or looted.\n\nWHen u fired on their car.. did U hit any one?[/quote]\n\n\nWell, sir I really don’t know whether it hit any one of then or not because as soon as I hit on their car I moved back thinking that may be they are armed and fire in return.', ''),

(38715, ' [b]AoA Everybody![/b]\n\nJust thought I should share something regarding the merits and demerits of the two most encountered types of shotgun stocks. Plus it’s Sunday and I’m sorta keeping myself busy or rather unavailable. ( I’m sure any married man would understand)\n\n[b]1. English Stock AKA Straight Grip or English Grip:[/b]\n\n[img]http://www.gunsinternational.com/images/listings/100036245-5-L.jpg[/img]\n\nEnglish stock was originally designed to allow quick selection of the rear trigger on a double trigger gun. The design also allowed the gun to be just a tab bit lighter, sleeker and easier to swing. Since the angle of the wrist is less awkward, the gun also becomes easier in field carry.\n\nHowever the benefits of this stock design comes at a price, the operator essentially loses right hand control over the shotgun. Meaning, the operator lets go of some of the right hand control and relies more on the left hand, the hand that grips the forend (I’m assuming the shooter is right handed). With this sort of setup, the gun becomes difficult to maneuver. During mount there is more reliance on the left hand, however after a successful mount, since there is more reliance on the left hand, the swing is more controlled.\n\n[b]2. Prince of Wales Grip AKA Pistol Grip or Modified Pistol Grip:[/b]\n\n[img]http://www.gunsinternational.com/images/listings/100086136-3-L.jpg[/img]\n\nThe fact that most people call it pistol grip is wrong, it is actually modified pistol, originated by the prince of Wales who was weak in the right hand, he desired more control in the right hand therefore the modified pistol grip was born.\n\nWhile it is true that forehand is highly important in moving the barrel with the bird, the rear hand is equally important in maintaining gun mount and trigger control. Neither hand is more important. One hand should not be weakened just to improve the importance of the other.\n\nI’m sure by now you must have guessed that semi pistol or Prince of Wales grip takes some of the control from the left and puts it in the right hand. Therefore permits a more controlled mount, more authority over the trigger and increased maneuverability. Why it got popular? Hmmm.... quiet simple, the gain in the right hand control is greater than the loss in the control of the left hand. To put it short, gain in right hand control = huge, loss in left hand control = insignificant.\n\nThis type of grip proved to be quiet popular among hunters and sport shooters alike as it results in a more controlled mount, more control over the triggers, more maneuverability of the gun along with an excellent swing. A testimony to the success of a modified pistol grip is that English stocks are practically on the endangered species list in the sporting events around the globe. Competitive shooters of today, realizing the importance of control in both hands, almost always prefer modified pistol grips.\n\nHope it helps, (it sure did for me, otherwise my wife had like a million home chores lined up for me today and everyone of them was a major turn-off).\n\n[b]Regards[/b]', ''),

I have tried to shoot it with safely on and found it pretty safe. Also, the trigger pull is long which also minimises chances of accidental firing. The price is around 50 -55 k in karachi.

I thought it would be "compact"; just checked and I was woefully wrong.\n\nIf your heart isn''t set on ankle holster carry, you could also consider the Norinco-made Sig clones (NP-34) or the Taurus PT111, 24/7 Compact or PT609, all of which are well in your budget.\n\nBest of luck in your search.', ''),

(38906, ' Ok now to answer your question. Kindly go through my answers in Bold.\n\n[quote=OnTarget9]Greetings!\n\nI am looking to acquire a ‘concealed carry’ (for SD and sport) 9mm pistol that is reliable, accurate and safe. I would welcome your views/advice.[b]If you are going for SD/Sport then you dont need a weapon that should be CCW. Your location says Dubai so if you are planning to use it in Pakistan then i would recommend you PT92/99 from Taurus. Its a very tried and tested Hand Gun and i have used it with every kind of ammo without any issues. Other Taurus Hand Guns are Ammo Sensitive.[/b]\n\nI would prefer something that can be carried in an ankle holster. If the Glock 19 were not so obscenely overpriced in Pak, I would have preferred that. At the moment, I am thinking of Stoeger Cougar. Though, I am not sure if it would work with an ankle holster (any views on that?). What would be better alternatives in your opinion?.[b]If you are thinking about using an Ankle Holster then you better gear up for a dissapointment as they are nothing but Shashka and that is the end of that. No matter how good is the Ankle Holster, you will not be comfortable with it. Stoeger is not good for Ankle stuff. Othe ralternative is Taurus 609 which is readily available in market for around 50 to 60K but do read my Topic Another Taurus Failure before you make up your mind as again its Ammo Sensitive.[/b]\n\nI do not want to spend too much over a 100K but can be flexible.[b]Flexibility to another 10 or 20 K will get you no where so you are btter off buying a Taurus which will cost you much less. Flexibility to around another 100K is a different issue as that will open up many possibilities.[/b]\n\n-----------------------\n\nAny views on availability in Karachi (of Stoeger or others that you may recommend) and price would be very welcome, as well.[b]Stoeger and almost all models of Taurus are readily available in Karachi and are priced around the point i mentioned above. You should do some searching when you are shopping[/b]\nAlso, what ammo would you recommend (Chinese/POF/other?). I anticipate shooting 300-400 rounds a month so nothing too expensive, yet don’t want to damage gun (or lose a finger), either.[b]Chinese is your best bet in this regard as its cheap and also doesnt hurt your weapon[/b]\n\n-------------------------\nPS In 9mm handguns, I only have experience (about 1500 rounds) with a CZ 75 and was happy with its accuracy and recoil.\nPPS Just out of curiosity, what is the price of a Glock 19 or 26 in Pak? What is availability like?[b]Glock 19 is avilable from 220 to 275K and its avilability is quite a lot at almost all dealers. Glock 26 is aroound 300 to 340K but its not that easily available at dealers.[/b]\n\nNow after all is said and done, my personal recomendation to you just like Dr. Zakir and Glocky is to go for a Glock 26. I own it and you can never go wrong with it. Get a 12 Round Magazine with it and it will be great for CC and also your Sports purpose. But hey this is my opinion. If you are hard pressed for money or dont want to spend 300K on a Hand Gun then you already know what to buy.[/quote]\n\n[b]A.A[/b]', ''),

Is there similar information available relating to Taurus revolvers?\n\nI know Taurus provide a life time guarantee but I don''t know if that would be valid in Pak as you would need to send the gun back to the factory for any repair it might need.

(39060, ' Why every clock or watch shows 10:10 in every advertisement?\n\n\n1) Symmetrical Look: When the watch is at 10:10 we get a vertical symmetry in the face of the clock. But we get the same with 9:45 or8:20 or some other time. Then why is it 10:10 ?\n\n2) Smiley Look: When we look at a watch at 10:10, we see as if the watch is smiling. It is better to have a smiling face, rather than having a crying face when the time is at 8:20. Well that is one good reason, since it enlightens peoples mind while looking at the ad.\n\n3) Victory: When the clock is at 10:10, the hands are similar to the letter "v" which symbolises victory. May not be the actual reason, but we can say this as one of the reasons.\n\n4) Abraham Lincoln: Many say that it is due to Abraham Lincoln died at that time and so the watches are showing 10:10. But some say that, Lincoln is shot at night at around 10:15, and died in the next day morning at around 7:22. So this ain''t the correct the reason.\n\n[b]5) Visibility: When the hands are at 10:10, we have the makers name and other details (if any) clearly visible when they are placed at above or below the center.[/b]\n\n6) First Watch: Some say that first watch is made/completed at that time. But why are most companies adopting it ? and in fact clocks are been around for many 100s of years. So this aint the reason.\n\n7) Hiroshima and Nagasaki Attack: Few say, it is because during that time, first atomic bomb was used and in remembrance of all the victimes, all unused clocks or the clocks which are presented in show-cases have the same time of 10:10. But it seems the practise of 10:10 has been in there from 1920s. So I doubt this also.\n\nSo seeing all this, visibility along with symmetry, smiling face and victory seems to be a good reason for most watch companies , to show 10:10 in watches during their ads.', ''),

(39089, ' Thanks, gents.\n\n@KageFox - Thanks. Appreciate your advice.\n\n@StevenCline - If we get enough US based members on this forum perhaps we could persuade them to lobby for lifting of the handgun export ban to Pak. Seems a bit disingenuous, in any case, to ban export of handguns to a country because it has got nukes :-) but that''s politics for you. Some handguns (Glocks, for e.g.) are obscenely expensive in Pakistan but on the plus side you can employ a chauffeur for about 60 dollars a month. Beat that :-)\n\n@Adeel Ahmad - Thank you. Really useful advice. I was looking to kill two birds but realise that it is a bit of a trade-off. PT92 is bigger than I would prefer but 911 (suggested by KageFox, above) seems doable. Also, I tend to agree with your views on ankle-carry though it could possibly work with a snub revolver (2" or 3" .357) in line with CougarMan''s suggestion.\n\n@MHMalik - Some people get $5 haircuts and look like a million dollars while others spend $50 (in Pakistan) but the expense does not appear justified to the casual observer. Personal choice, I suppose.\n\nAny experience with the following or idea about prices/availability of the 9mm below would be very helpful.

(39309, ' In a modern revolver at rest, the hammer is down, and the cylinder is motionless, locked (prevented from turning) by a cylinder stop (also called the bolt, or latch by some makers) fitting into a notch in the cylinder. When the gun is fired in double action, the trigger is pulled, the stop is pulled out of engagement from the cylinder notch, a pawl rotates the cylinder by engaging a ratchet, the hammer comes back, the cylinder continues to rotate while the cylinder stop is released to contact the cylinder. As the cylinder continues to rotate, the hand stops trying to turn it just as the cylinder stop engages the next notch in the cylinder. This must happen before the trigger moves far enough that the hammer will be released to fire the gun. \n\nAs you see, everything must happen in a precise series of actions, all at the right time. This process is called timing and when it is correct, the revolver is "in time". As you can also see, there are many places in the series where something can go wrong; there might be more than one such place. When that happens, the revolver is "out of time". That can mean failure to fire, firing with the cylinder unlocked, or something else that can cause damage to the gun.\n\nWhen a gun is "out of time", it can be fixed by replacing parts, or working on the old parts. Sometimes, on old guns, parts are not available and the wear is such that the gun cannot be fixed by any economically feasible means. Then, the gun must be discarded or retired to wall hanger status.', ''),

(39315, ' This post is a sticky on a few American gun forums it gives instruction on how to inspect revolvers when purchasing.\n\n[quote]So you''re buying a revolver. New, used, doesn''t matter, you want a good one, right?\n\nHow do check one over without firing it, right at the dealer''s counter or gun show table?\n\nThis is how. All of this works with DA or SA wheelguns..."close the action" on most DAs means swing the cylinder in, on SA types, close the loading gate, on breakopens, close ''em. UNLOADED.\n\nWARNING: most of these tests require violation of the "finger off trigger" rule. Therefore, be extremely careful about safe muzzle direction and making sure the gun is unloaded ahead of time, PERSONALLY, as you begin handling it.\n\nNote: bring a small flashlight, something small and concentrated. A Photon or similar high-powered LED light is perfect. You also want feeler gauges if you''re not used to eyeballing cylinder gaps; at a minimum, bring a .002", .004" and .006".\n\nNote2: no dry firing is required or desired at any point. It just pisses off the gun''s current owner.\n\nCylinder play.\n\n1) With the gun UNLOADED (check for yourself!), close the action.\n\n2) Thumb the hammer back, and while pulling the trigger, gently lower the hammer all the way down while keeping the trigger back - and KEEP holding the trigger once the hammer is down. (You''ve now put the gun in "full lockup" - keep it there for this and most other tests.)\n\n3) With the trigger still back all the way, check for cylinder wiggle. Front/back is particularly undesirable; a bit of side to side is OK but it''s a bad thing if you can wiggle it one way, let go, and then spin it the other way a fraction of an inch and it stays there too. At the very least, it should "want" to stop in just one place (later, we''ll see if that place is any good). The ultimate is a "welded to the frame" feeling.\n\nCylinder gap\n\n4) Still holding the trigger at full lockup, look sideways through the barrel/cylinder gap. If you can get a credit card in there, that ain''t good...velocity drops rapidly as the gap increases. Too tight isn''t good either, because burnt powder crud will "fill the gap" and start making the cylinder spin funky. My personal .38snubbie is set at .002, usually considered the minimum...after about 40 shots at the range, I have to give the front of the cylinder a quick wipe so it spins free again. I consider that a reasonable tradeoff for the increased velocity because in a real fight, I ain''t gonna crank 40 rounds out of a 5-shot snub .\n\nIf you''re eyeballing it, you''ll have to hold it up sideways against an overhead light source.\n\nSAFETY WARNING: This step in particular is where you MUST watch your muzzle direction. Look, part of what''s happening here is that you''re convincing the seller you know your poop . It helps the haggling process. If you do anything unsafe, that impression comes completely unglued.\n\nTiming\n\n5) You really, REALLY want an unloaded gun for this one. This is where the light comes in. With the gun STILL held in full lockup, trigger back after lowering the hammer by thumb, you want to shine a light right into the area at the rear of the cylinder near the firing pin. You then look down the barrel . You''re looking to make sure the cylinder bore lines up with the barrel. Check every cylinder - that means putting the gun in full lockup for each cylinder before lighting it up.\n\nYou''re looking for the cylinder and barrel holes to line up perfectly, it''s easy to eyeball if there''s even a faint light source at the very rear of both bores. And with no rounds present, it''s generally easy to get some light in past where the rims would be.\n\nBore\n\n(We''re finally done with that "full lockup" crap, so rest your trigger finger. )\n\n6) Swing the cylinder open, or with most SAs pull the cylinder. Use the small flashlight to scope the bore out. This part''s easy - you want to avoid pitting, worn-out rifling, bulges of any sort. You want more light on the subject than just what creeps in from the rear of the cylinder on the timing check.\n\nYou also want to check each cylinder bore, in this case with the light coming in from the FRONT of each hole, you looking in from the back where the primers would be. You''re looking for wear at the "restrictions" at the front of each cylinder bore. That''s the "forcing cone" area and it can wear rapidly with some Magnum loads. (Special thanks to Salvo below for this bit!)\n\nTrigger\n\n7) To test a trigger without dry-firing it, use a plastic pen in front of the hammer to "catch" it with the off hand, especially if it''s a "firing pin on the hammer" type. Or see if the seller has any snap-caps, that''s the best solution. Flat-faced hammers as found in transfer-bar guns (Ruger, etc) can be caught with the off-hand without too much pain .\n\nSA triggers (or of course a DA with the hammer cocked) should feel "like a glass rod breaking". A tiny amount of take-up slack is tolerable, and is common on anything with a transfer bar or hammerblock safety.\n\nDA triggers are subjective. Some people like a dead-smooth feel from beginning of stroke to the end, with no "warning" that it''s about to fire. Others (myself included) actually prefer a slight "hitch" right at the end, so we know when it''s about to go. With that sort of trigger, you can actually "hold it" right at the "about to fire" point and do a short light stroke from there that rivals an SA shot for accuracy. Takes a lot of practice though. Either way, you don''t want "grinding" through the length of the stroke, and the final stack-up at the end (if any) shouldn''t be overly pronounced.\n\nDetecting Bad Gunsmithing:\n\n8) OK, so it''s got a rock-solid cylinder, a .002" or .003" gap, and the trigger feels great. Odds are vastly in favor of it being tuned after leaving the factory.\n\nSo was the gunsmith any good?\n\nFirst, cock it, then grab the hammer and "wiggle it around" a bit. Not too hard, don''t bang on it, but give it a bit of up/down, left/right and circular action with finger off trigger and WATCH your muzzle direction.\n\nYou don''t want that hammer slipping off an overly polished sear. You REALLY don''t want that . It can be fixed by installing factory parts but that''ll take modest money (more for installation than hardware costs) and it''ll be bigtime unsafe until you do.\n\nThe other thing that commonly goes wrong is somebody will trim the spring, especially coil springs. You can spot that if you pull the grip panels, see if the spring was trimmed with wire cutters. If they get too wild with it, you''ll get ignition failures on harder primers. But the good news is, replacement factory or Wolf springs are cheap both to buy and have installed.\n\nThere''s also the legal problems Ayoob frequently describes regarding light triggers. If that''s a concern, you can either swap back to stock springs, or since you bought it used there''s no way to prove you knew it was modified at all .\n\nIn perspective:\n\nTiming (test #5) is very critical...if that''s off, the gun may not even be safe to test-fire. And naturally, a crappy barrel means a relatively pricey fix.\n\nCylinder gap is particularly critical on short-barreled and/or marginal caliber guns. If you need every possible ounce of energy, a tight gap helps. Some factory gaps will run as high as .006"; Taurus considers .007" "still in spec" (sigh). You''ll be hard-pressed to find any new pieces under .004" - probably because the makers realize some people don''t clean ''em often (or very well) and might complain about the cylinder binding up if they sell ''em at .002".\n\nThe guns in a dealer''s "used pile" are often of unknown origin, from estate sales or whatever. Dealers don''t have time to check every piece, and often don''t know their history. These tests, especially cyliner gap and play, can spot a gun that''s been sent off for professional tuning...like my snubbie, the best $180 I ever spent .\n\nAs long as the gun is otherwise sound (no cracks, etc) a gunsmith can fix any of this. So these tests can help you pick a particularly good new specimen, or find a good used gun, or help haggle the price down on something that''ll need a bit of work.\n\nHope this helps.\n\nJim[/quote]', ''),

I think a carpenter and wielder worth of two days work each and about Rs. 7000 worth of materials should do the trick.[/quote]\n\nAbass Bhai, it looks like a neat thing but dont want to sound like a party pooper (nor want to rain on this parade) but here are some of my concerns:\n\n1. a simple wooden gun cabinet costs 7K-10K as i''ve made two myself, one for me, one for my best friend''s elder brother. from wooden i''m not  talking about real wood, i''m talking engineered wood (chipboard, plywood, my preference sheesham chipboard/plywood). therefore I dont think one could make a steel bed with 10 gauge sheets with a materials budget of 10K\n\n2. initially before moving on to gun cabinets, i was strictly a gun chest (made that myself as well) kinda person, fully enclosed space and sealed with guns neatly packed together fully assembled. but any guy who uses gun chests knows the menace of humidity and its adverse effects on steel. guns rust pretty easily in a humid and dark environment. some organism even grow on wooden gun parts if kept for long in dark and humid environment. solutions require constant heat/light source in the chest and its a real pain in the neck. otherwise options are to put silicone gels in the gun chest but then again they require periodical changing.\n\n3. when even long guns are placed/stored flat against any surface, they have a tendency to bend after extended storage duration.\n\n4. bolting all metal parts together will not work either, upon closer inspection it looks that sheet metal has been bent (process: SHEET METAL BENDING) and corners welded together, this would require services of an industrial welder, ordinary "TUCH" WELDERS are not upto the task.\n\n5. if u look at the bed closely, it looks like the bed shifts to make enough room for the gun safe''s door to open.  moving such a bed would require desigining of ball bearing which will have to move on a ramp, otherwise the bed will simply slide off to the other side.\n\n6. safe''s door construction seems to be of a typical hinge type, double sheet, internal lock mechanism, very difficult to custom make as it requires alot of technical know how.\n\nConsidering all these, I would say: given the lack of technical expertise, lack of economies of scale (which reduces price of such an item as specialized machines/tools are created to do a difficult job with ease), lack of materials available. designing/making such a thing would easily cross 100-150K.\n\nRegards\n\np.s. incase u guys wondering what kinda gun cabinet i can make. well... i''m no professional however since i love woodwork and tend to be very careful with my calculations (ok i admit I usually solicit the services of a maths genius cousin of mine), the projects turn out not too bad (if i do say so myself).\n\nhere it is, this one I''ve recently made like 2 months ago (for my friend''s elder brother).\n\nstorage space: 8 guns\nMaterial: all 3/4inch sheesham plywood construction (all sides/walls made of 0.75inch sheet of sheesham plywood, back/bottom/top, resulting in a much solid contruction)\nentry: sliding glass (tempered glass) locked by simple sliding glass lock\nbottom storage: simple pull down type door, with round knobs, lock and key setup\npriority: to keep the overall profile down, I had to exclude skirting and crown.\nTotal Cost: 8K (all materials as i did everything myself, except glass fixing). for polishing/varnish/paint/sealing, add another 2K.\n\n[img]http://img199.imageshack.us/img199/6870/32877225.jpg[/img]\n\n[img]http://img35.imageshack.us/img35/981/74973036.jpg[/img]\n\n[img]http://img35.imageshack.us/img35/4422/61192676.jpg[/img]\n\nRegards', ''),

Revolvers have advantages over semi autos and vice versa. \n\n[quote]remember it has a bang voice and too much recoil..plus i dont think revolvers are even practical for self defence as they are not accurate even on 10 metres any revolver i have seen is not practical  [/quote]\n\n\nI don''t have any practical experience with revolvers bro but from my research I would have to disagree with your assertion that revolvers are inaccurate at even 10 meters.Many people  carry small frame revolvers for self defense and they report them to be very accurate at close range.Some of the larger revolvers are accurate to  50+ meters and are used for hunting large game.\n\nIts all a matter of personal preference, each to their own, different strokes for different folks as they say.', ''),
(39419, ' For the less experienced shooter, the semi-auto is more prone to jams. This is fact, not opinion. A revolver is not subject to these jams and is, therefore, a more reliable weapon. There is little that can go wrong with a revolver in an emergency. If a round were to fail to fire for some reason, all you have to do is to pull the trigger again and a new round will rotate up into the firing position.\n\nPerhaps your friend was speaking from a gunsmith''s position when he was talking about the difficulties in getting the timing of the cylinder set correctly. But once it is done at the factory, it will stay in time barring any unusual event or long time wear.\n\nThe bottom line is that from the standpoint of simplicity and reliability of operation, the revolver is the better choice. The main advantage of the semi-auto over a revolver is in the number of rounds it carries. The fact is that rarely does an actual gun fight, where you are defending yourself, go much beyond 2 or 3 rounds anyway. By that time, the bad guy is either on the ground or long gone. In fact, when they see a gun, he and his friends will scatter like quail without you even having to fire one shot.', ''),

This B-2 stealth bomber crashed shortly after taking off from an air base in Guam on February 23, 2008. Investigators blamed distorted data in the flight control computers caused by moisture in the system. This resulted in the aircraft making a sudden nose-up move which made the B-2 stall and crash. This was 1 of only 21 ever built and was the most expensive aviation accident in history. Both pilots were able to eject to safety.\n \n[url=http://www.postimage.org/][img]http://img127.imageshack.us/img127/4084/54134038.jpg[/img][/url]\n\n[url=http://www.postimage.org/][img]http://img107.imageshack.us/img107/161/19883168.jpg[/img][/url]', ''),

(39700, ' # 06. Exxon Valdez - $2.5 Billion\n\nThe Exxon Valdez oil spill was not a large one in relation to the world''s biggest oil spills, but it was a costly one due to the remote location of Prince William Sound (accessible only by helicopter and boat). On March 24, 1989, 10.8 million gallons of oil was spilled when the ship''s master, Joseph Hazelwood, left the controls and the ship crashed into a Reef. The cleanup cost Exxon $2.5 billion.\n\n[url=http://www.postimage.org/][img]http://img119.imageshack.us/img119/497/66153965.jpg[/img][/url]\n\n\n# 05. Piper Alpha Oil Rig - $3.4 Billion\nThe world''s worst off-shore oil disaster. At one time, it was the world''s single largest oil producer, spewing out 317,000 barrels of oil per day. On July 6, 1988, as part of routine maintenance, technicians removed and checked safety valves which were essential in preventing dangerous build-up of liquid gas. There were 100 identical safety valves which were checked. Unfortunately, the technicians made a mistake and forgot to replace one of them. At 10 PM that same night, a technician pressed a start button for the liquid gas pumps and the world''s most expensive oil rig accident was set in motion.\n\nWithin 2 hours, the 300 foot platform was engulfed in flames. It eventually collapsed, killing 167 workers and resulting in $3.4 Billion in damages.\n\n\n[url=http://www.postimage.org/][img]http://img129.imageshack.us/img129/21/63176621.jpg[/img][/url]\n\n# 04. Challenger Explosion - $5.5 Billion\nThe Space Shuttle Challenger was destroyed 73 seconds after takeoff due on January 28, 1986 due to a faulty O-ring. It failed to seal one of the joints, allowing pressurized gas to reach the outside. This in turn caused the external tank to dump its payload of liquid hydrogen causing a massive explosion. The cost of replacing the Space Shuttle was $2 billion in 1986 ($4.5 billion in today''s dollars). The cost of investigation, problem correction, and replacement of lost equipment cost $450 million from 1986-1987 ($1 Billion in today''s dollars). \n\n[url=http://www.postimage.org/image.php?v=aV4TM5i][img]http://img104.imageshack.us/img104/8104/47419279.th.jpg[/img][/url]', ''),

Prestige Oil Spill - $12 Billion\nOn November 13, 2002, the Prestige oil tanker was carrying 77,000 tons of heavy fuel oil when one of its twelve tanks burst during a storm off Galicia , Spain . Fearing that the ship would sink, the captain called for help from Spanish rescue workers, expecting them to take the ship into harbour. However, pressure from local authorities forced the captain to steer the ship away from the coast. The captain tried to get help from the French and Portuguese authorities, but they too ordered the ship away from their shores. The storm eventually took its toll on the ship resulting in the tanker splitting in half and releasing 20 million gallons oil into the sea.\nAccording to a report by the Pontevedra Economist Board, the total cleanup cost $12 billion. \n\n[url=http://www.postimage.org/][img]http://img239.imageshack.us/img239/3294/91176751.jpg[/img][/url]\n\n# 02.

It was destroyed during re-entry over Texas on February 1, 2003 after a hole was punctured in one of the wings during launch 16 days earlier. The original cost of the shuttle was $2 Billion in 1978. That comes out to $6.3 Billion in today''s dollars. $500 million was spent on the investigation, making it the costliest aircraft accident investigation in history. The search and recovery of debris cost $300 million. \n\nIn the end, the total cost of the accident (not including replacement of the shuttle) came out to $13 Billion according to the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics. \n\n[url=http://www.postimage.org/][img]http://img239.imageshack.us/img239/8655/32554259.jpg[/img][/url]\n\n\n# 01. Chernobyl - $200 Billion\nOn April 26, 1986, the world witnessed the costliest accident in history. The Chernobyl disaster has been called the biggest socio-economic catastrophe in peacetime history. 50% of the area of Ukraine is in some way contaminated. Over 200,000 people had to be evacuated and resettled while 1.7 million people were directly affected by the disaster. The death toll attributed to Chernobyl , including people who died from cancer years later, is estimated at 125,000. The total costs including cleanup, resettlement, and compensation to victims has been estimated to be roughly $200 Billion. The cost of a new steel shelter for the Chernobyl nuclear plant will cost $2 billion alone. The accident was officially attributed to power plant operators who violated plant procedures and were ignorant of the safety requirements needed.   \n\n[url=http://www.postimage.org/image.php?v=PqYJGK9][img]http://img125.imageshack.us/img125/903/65568445.th.jpg[/img][/url]', ''),

Its a good weapon, not very heavy, just like the latest western guns of about .0750 gram weight empty, the dis-assembly & assembly is easy, can be used rough and tough, can fire any kind of round, russian, chinese, POF, western. The firing mechanism is just like the Stoegar 8000 model. This weapon has been adopted by the Bangladesh Army, Chinese Army in the 5.8mm version, Hong Kong Police, Chinese Police and their counter terrorism units. \nI do hope this weapon would just perform like the Chinese TT did for so many decades.\nPrice is also very good these days, has come down to 30K here, peshawar i mean, dont know about the other cities. \nIf u wana go for chinese, then this is the best one.', ''),

A good pistol, packing greater punch than the Walther (9x18mm vs 9x17mm AKA .380Auto). The Makarov, unlike the Tokarev, is fitted with a safety and decocker, if I''m not mistaken.

(39874, ' The advances in the development of outdoor clothing, equipment, emergency food and techniques have been growing rapidly in recent years. For those beginners interested in using the outdoors there is unlimited information on wilderness survival skills and equipment available. However, experience is the best teacher in any outdoor situation and your reaction in a wilderness survival situation depends on your education. Always keep in mind that it can happen to you. Those who are mentally and physically prepared to survive are more likely to do so. To deal with an emergency situation one must be able to make decisions, improvise and remain calm. \n\nFear - For anyone faced with a wilderness emergency survival situation, fear is a normal reaction. Unless an emergency situation has been anticipated, fear is generally followed by panic then pain, cold, thirst, hunger, fatigue, boredom and loneliness. It is extremely important to calmly assess the situation and not allow these seven enemies to interfere with your survival. \n\nPain - Pain may often be ignored in a panic situation. Remember to deal with injuries immediately before they become even more serious. \n\nCold - Cold lowers the ability to think, numbing the body and reducing the will to survive. Never allow yourself to stop moving or to fall asleep unless adequately sheltered. \n\nThirst - Dehydration is a common enemy in an emergency situation and must not be ignored. It can dull your mind, causing you to overlook important survival information. \n\nHunger - Hunger is dangerous but seldom deadly. It may reduce your ability to think logically and increase your susceptibility to the effects of cold, pain and fear. \n\nFatigue - Fatigue is unavoidable in any situation so it is best to keep in mind that it can and will lower your mental ability. Remember that in an emergency situation this is often the bodies way of escaping a difficult situation. \n\nBoredom & Loneliness - These enemies are quite often unanticipated and may lower the mind''s ability to deal with the situation. \n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nHOW TO: \n\nBuild a Fire\nBuilding a fire is the most important task when dealing with survival in the wilderness. Be sure to build yours in a sandy or rocky area or near a supply of sand and water as to avoid forest fires. The most common mistakes made by those attempting to build a fire are: choosing poor tinder, failing to shield precious matches from the wind and smothering the flames with too large pieces of fuel. The four most important factors when starting a fire are spark - tinder - fuel - oxygen. \n\nThe most common ways to create spark are: \n\n \n\n1. Waterproof, strike-anywhere matches are your best bet. Matches may be water-proofed by dipping them in nail polish. Store your matches in a waterproof container. \n\n2. A cigarette lighter is also a good way to produce a spark, with or without fuel. \n\n3. The flint and steel method is one of the oldest and most reliable methods in fire starting. Aim the sparks at a pile of dry tinder to produce a fire. \n\n4. The electric spark produced from a battery will ignite a gasoline dampened rag. \n\n5. Remove half of the powder from a bullet and pour it into the tinder. Next place a rag in the cartridge case of the gun and fire. The rag should ignite and then may be placed into the tinder. \n\n6. Allow the suns rays to pass through a magnifying glass onto the tinder. \n\nDry grass, paper or cloth lint, gasoline-soaked rags and dry bark are all forms of tinder. Place your tinder in a small pile resembling a tepee with the driest pieces at the bottom. Use a fire starter or strip of pitch if it is available. \n\nIt is important to keep in mind that smaller pieces of kindling such as, twigs, bark, shavings and gasoline, are necessary when trying to ignite larger pieces of fuel. Gather fuel before attempting to start your fire. Obviously dry wood burns better and wet or pitchy wood will create more smoke. Dense, dry wood will burn slow and hot. A well ventilated fire will burn best. \n\n Build a Shelter\nA small shelter which is insulated from the bottom, protected from wind and snow and contains a fire is extremely important in wilderness survival. Before building your shelter be sure that the surrounding area provides the materials needed to build a good fire, a good water source and shelter from the wind. \n\nWilderness shelters may include: \n\n1. Natural shelters such as caves and overhanging cliffs. When exploring a possible shelter tie a piece of string to the outer mouth of the cave to ensure you will be able to find your way out. Keep in mind that these caves may already be occupied. If you do use a cave for shelter, build your fire near its mouth to prevent animals from entering. \n\n2. Enlarge the natural pit under a fallen tree and line it with bark or tree boughs. \n\n3. Near a rocky coastal area, build a rock shelter in the shape of a U, covering the roof with driftwood and a tarp or even seaweed for protection. \n\n \n\n4. A lean-to made with poles or fallen trees and a covering of plastic, boughs, thick grasses or bark is effective to shelter you from wind, rain and snow. \n\n \n\n5. A wigwam may be constructed using three long poles. Tie the tops of the poles together and upright them in an appropriate spot. Cover the sides with a tarp, boughs, raingear or other suitable materials. Build a fire in the center of the wigwam, making a draft channel in the wall and a small hole in the top to allow smoke to escape. \n\n \n\n6. If you find yourself in open terrain, a snow cave will provide good shelter. Find a drift and burrow a tunnel into the side for about 60 cm (24 in) then build your chamber. The entrance of the tunnel should lead to the lowest level of you chamber where the cooking and storage of equipment will be. A minimum of two ventilating holes are necessary, preferably one in the roof and one in the door. \n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nCLOTHING AND EQUIPMENT \n\nClothing\nClothing must provide warmth and offer protection from the elements. Layers of light, natural fibers are best. Hats are a must, as they offer protection from both the heat and cold. Water proof outer layers are necessary. \n\nEquipment\nEquipment must be easily manageable and promote survival in any situation. Items to carry in your pockets may include a fire starter, waterproof matches and/or lighter, a pocket knife, goggles, compass, small first-aid kit and some sort of trail food. \n\nSurvival Kit\nItems for your survival kit should be packed in a waterproof container that can double as a cooking pot and water receptacle and be attached to your belt. \n\n \n\nBackpack\nIn addition to a survival kit, a good, comfortable backpack is mandatory. Loads of about 18 kg (40 lb.) are average. Items to include are; flashlight, extra jacket, socks and mittens, a pocket saw, gas camp stove, first aid kit, emergency food, and a tent and fly. \n\nCHECK LIST \n\nUseful items to include on your hike are:\n\n1. A map and compass.\n\n2. A large, bright plastic bag will be useful as a shelter, signaling device or in lieu of raingear.\n\n3. A flashlight with extra batteries.\n\n4. Extra water and food.\n\n5. Extra clothing such as raingear, a toque and gloves, a sweater and pants.\n\n6. Sun protection such as sunglasses, sunscreen, a hat and long sleeved clothing.\n\n\n\n7. A sharp pocket knife.\n\n8. Waterproof matches, a lighter and/or a flint.\n\n9. Candles and fire starter.\n\n10. A first aid kit.\n\n11. A whistle, flares, a tarp. \n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nBefore venturing into the wilderness check weather forecasts and hazards.\n[url=http://www.postimage.org/][img]http://img372.imageshack.us/img372/9710/88687502.gif[/img][/url]\n\n[url=http://www.postimage.org/][img]http://www.postimage.org/Pq139wNA.gif[/img][/url]\n\n[url=http://www.postimage.org/][img]http://img24.imageshack.us/img24/4629/12818830.gif[/img][/url]\n\n[url=http://www.postimage.org/][img]http://img24.imageshack.us/img24/4004/87317831.gif[/img][/url]\n\n[url=http://www.postimage.org/][img]http://img24.imageshack.us/img24/446/89694950.gif[/img][/url]\n\n[url=http://www.postimage.org/][img]http://img24.imageshack.us/img24/5594/98739016.gif[/img][/url]\n\n[url=http://www.postimage.org/][img]http://img372.imageshack.us/img372/1660/60340458.gif[/img][/url]', ''),

A young and pretty lady posted this on a popular forum: \nTitle: What should I do to marry a rich guy? \nI''m going to be honest of what I''m going to say here. I''m 25 this year. I''m very pretty, have style and good taste. I wish to marry a guy with $500k annual salary or above. You might say that I''m greedy, but an annual salary of $1M is considered only as middle class in New York. My requirement is not high. Is there anyone in this forum who has an income of $500k annual salary? Are you all married? I wanted to ask: what should I do to marry rich persons like you? Among those I''ve dated, the richest is $250k annual income, and it seems that this is my upper limit. If someone is going to move into high cost residential area on the west of New York CityGarden(?), $250k annual income is not enough. \n\nI''m here humbly to ask a few questions: \n1) Where do most rich bachelors hang out? (Please list down the names and addresses of bars, restaurant, gym) \n2) Which age group should I target? \n3) Why most wives of the riches is only average-looking? I''ve met a few girls who doesn''t have looks and are not interesting, but they are able to marry rich guys \n4) How do you decide who can be your wife, and who can only be your girlfriend? (my target now is to get married) \n\nMs. Pretty \n\nAwesome reply: \nDear Ms. Pretty, \n\nI have read your post with great interest. Guess there are lots of girls out there who have similar questions like yours. Please allow me to analyse your situation as a professional investor. My annual income is more than $500k, which meets your requirement, so I hope everyone believes that I''m not wasting time here. From the standpoint of a business person, it is a bad decision to marry you. The answer is very simple, so let me explain. Put the details aside, what you''re trying to do is an exchange of "beauty" and "money": Person A provides beauty, and Person B pays for it, fair and square. However, there''s a deadly problem here, your beauty will fade, but my money will not be gone without any good reason. The fact is, my income might increase from year to year, but you can''t be prettier year after year. Hence from the viewpoint of economics, I am an appreciation asset, and you are a depreciation asset. It''s not just normal depreciation, but exponential depreciation. If that is your only asset, your value will be much worried 10 years later. \n\nBy the terms we use in Wall Street, every trading has a position, dating with you is also a "trading position". If the trade value dropped we will sell it and it is not a good idea to keep it for long term - same goes with the marriage that you wanted. It might be cruel to say this, but in order to make a wiser decision any assets with great depreciation value will be sold or "leased". Anyone with over $500k annual income is not a fool; we would only date you, but will not marry you. I would advice that you forget looking for any clues to marry a rich guy. And by the way, you could make yourself to become a rich person with $500k annual income. This has better chance than finding a rich fool. \n\nHope this reply helps. If you are interested in "leasing" services, do contact me... \n\nsigned, \n\nCEO \nJ.P. Morgan', ''),

I have never seen any Mak jam, but cannot say that about the TT.\n\nThe Mak also has a much easier and faster field stripping procedure.  It is way better than the TT or the PPK with the 9x18 round offering better performance than the .380 and less penetration than the .30 TT without the excessive penetration.  And the bullet will make a bigger hole.  \n\nIt is a much safer pistol, with a proper safety and de cocker (and DA/SA).  Safety also locks the slide, making it easier for holster less carry.  Barrel is fixed like the PPK, so accuracy is up to you.  You can also swap the barrel for a .380, but this is more difficult to procure.\n\nThe Makarov PM is available in Pakistan in Russian, Chinese and Pakistani versions (quality in decending order).

(40148, ' [u][b]Find north by finding\nthe north star[/b][/u]\nBeing able finding the North star is a basic celestial navigation skill for all wilderness travelers in the northern hemisphere. Navigation by the stars is an old method that is still useful, assuming the sky is clear. Mariners have used celestial navigation for thousands of years.\n\n\nNorth Star\n\nIn the northern hemisphere, the location of north can be determined by the North Star. The North Star, also known as the Pole star, is a valuable navigation aid because it''s located almost above polar north. The North star is not a very bright star, but unlike the other stars, it remains at a fixed location in the sky.\n\nIn finding the North Star, the Big Dipper (Ursa Major) and Cassiopeia (shaped like a W) are helpful. Neither of these constellations ever sets and they are always visible on a clear night, however, they are not always in the same place. The position of the stars in the sky depends on the time, date and geographical position (latitude and longitude). You probably have noticed how stars appear to move across the sky during the night. The reason for that is due to the Earth''s rotation around its axis. That''s also the reason the sun moves across the sky in the day. That means the picture you see on this page probably does not match the sky you are viewing, but that is an easy fix as you can just rotate the image.\n\nTo locate north:\n\n• Find the Big Dipper in the sky. Follow the edge of the cup 5 times its length toward a medium bright star. You have found the North Star, which is virtually north.\n\n• To double check that it’s really the North Star, locate Cassiopeia. The North Star resides halfway between Cassiopeia and the Big Dipper.\n\n\nSky maps\n\nSky maps show the positions of stars in the sky at a certain day, time and the latitude and longitude of your observing location. Stars appear to move across the sky during the night because of the Earth’s rotation around its axis. That''s also the reason the sun moves across the sky in the day. There are many types of sky maps, and it requires a bit of explanation to use it. Are you new to sky maps, read this.\n\n\nWhat does the sky look like where you are?\n\nDo you want to find out? First you need to know the latitude and longitude of your location.\n\nNow, when you know your geographical position and how to read a sky map, create a sky map adaptable to your location.\n\n\nCelestial navigation\n\n \nCelestial navigation is more than just finding the North Star.

(40149, ' Thanks Hasan, appreciate that. One more thing, how do you get the fired round of correct diameter as brass gets bit swolen after its fired & quite thick to insert in the chamber.', ''),
(40150, ' This does not happen to all shells firstly and secondly this seldom happens to rimfires due to the low energies. We can get ample wel shaped shells after a session of firing.', ''),
(40151, ' I suppose that depends on how tight or loose the chamber of the weapon is. If using the same weapon in which the shell was fired, I dont think the case expands more than the chamber..\n\nThink of it in this way.. if it can be extracted and ejected, it can go back in since the two processes take place AFTER the process of case expansion..\n\nI''ve never tried it.. I''m speaking from a purely theoretical point of view.. reality is not always the same as theory.. So I could be wrong and hopefully someone will correct me here if wrong.\n\nOne thing though.. with rimmed cartridges such as the 9mm etc, putting the bullet or the case directed into the chamber and slamming home the bolt or slide is not good for the extractor.. since it is hard steel (usually) and slamming it means the extractor has to slide over the rim. Hard steel being brittle.. well you can imagine the rest I suppose.. So try wherever possible to load it through a magazine. Although chances are that nothing will happen to it, but considering our lack of access to spare parts and weapons being on the expensive side, I figure why take a chance.. With magazine loading the rim part slides up nicely behind the extractor and all is fine.. :)\n\nHappy Dry Firing', ''),

(40155, ' [quote=CougarMan]Sorry Starfish, but it [b]IS [/b]the Mak which is considered the AK47 of pistols not the TT.  \n\nMy personal experience has also shown that, especially with locally made versions of both.  I have never seen any Mak jam, but cannot say that about the TT.\n\nThe Mak also has a much easier and faster field stripping procedure.  It is way better than the TT or the PPK with the 9x18 round offering better performance than the .380 and less penetration than the .30 TT without the excessive penetration.  And the bullet will make a bigger hole.  \n\nIt is a much safer pistol, with a proper safety and de cocker (and DA/SA).  Safety also locks the slide, making it easier for holster less carry.  Barrel is fixed like the PPK, so accuracy is up to you.  You can also swap the barrel for a .380, but this is more difficult to procure.\n\nThe Makarov PM is available in Pakistan in Russian, Chinese and Pakistani versions (quality in decending order).  They are obviously not as common as the ubiquitous TT, but are present in the market.  \n\nIf you get a chance to buy one, do so.[/quote]\n\ncougarman: i totaly agree with you on this post, the [b]mak is a wonderful pistol, safe , very good for SD[/b] and all.\nbut these are the [b]exact[/b] reasons why i consider this NOT to be like the AK :)\nconsider these:\nDo you think ak was meant to be on the defensive side or the offensive one?\ndo you think the ak round was meant NOT to overpenetrate?\nwhat is the price of a third party manufacture mak compared to TT? (similarly what is the price of AK compared to others like say an m16?)\nwhat is the price of a mak round compared to TT? (and what is the price of an AK round compared to other riffles))?\nHow easily can you get a mak round and how easily can you get a tt round?\ncan you get a mak in tanzania? somalia? eastern europe? more easily than a TT?\nis the mak cheaper to manufacture or is TT cheaper to manufacture?\nhave you seen a gorrila fighter in africa carry maks?\nAre there more Maks in the world than the TT? \n\nThese are the reasons why i consider TT to be the AK of pistols. Its NOT mean to be safe, its meant to be ready to fire at all times. its meant to be more powerful than most handguns out there (without caring about over penetration). its meant to be cheap and easily manufactured. its round is readily available and is cheap as well, plus its everywhere just like the AK.\n\nAK is meant to be a rugged, overpowered and cheap assault riffle. so is the TT. Mak is all things finesse.\n \nAgain, i consider Mak to be a [b]better[/b] pistol than the TT. its very safe, reliable, easy to carry and all. The best part is, it has a certain finesse which TT doesnt. and thats exactly why its not comparable to the AK. \n\nIn simple words, AK and TT consider quantity to be a better option than quality. Mak focuses a bit more on quality and finesse.\nin the words of Joseph stalin, "Quantity has a quality all its own" :)\ni hope i make my point of view clear and dont take me wrong i [b]agree with you[/b] that the Mak is a better pistol and is definitely what i would like to have if given the option between a TT and Mak.\nHaving said all this, I totally respect your opinion as well :)', ''),

There is a friend who handload .357 magnum and .44 magnum, he collects all spent shells of the said calibers at the shooting range, will ask him how does he manage the deformed shells. Untill then i can offer the following advice.\nFirstly you can remove the projectile of the bullet without firing it. this is nither dangerous nor difficult. This way you will have a shell in perfect shape.\nSecondly, these revolvers come with a red round plastic strip packed in cylender if you haven''t thrown that strip that is ideal for dry firing. I use that strip in my RAGING BULL .44 magnum for dry firing. \nFinally, try to figure it out why your spent shells are deforming beyond the size of the cylender of your revolver. It must be hard to remove these from the cylender as ejection of spent shells in side opening cylender revolvers need only hand energy.', ''),

It can be fired at the highest velocities for given amount of airgun energy which results in the flattest trajectory.If the main purpose of your air rifle is going to be target shooting then choosing a .177 cal air rifle is a smart choice. .177 air rifles shoot around 1000 FPS and at this velocity one easily kill small squirrels, birds and other small rodents.', ''),

(40226, ' Depends on where you hit. Stopping power is usually considered a myth. Generally speaking, bigger and moderate velocity is better than  smaller and high velocity, reason being that a high velocity, relatively smaller caliber bullet like the .30 tends to zip through fleshier parts of the human body, without doing much damage, as compared to, say a .45 or a 9mm.\n\nIMHO, you can stop anyone with any bullet, as long as you hit the right place. Number of shots taken can never be justified, as there have been reports from people dying from a single .22 bullet. I also recall reading a report in an old Handguns magazine, in which a criminal survived a couple of magazine-fulls of 9mm, a couple of 12G shotshells and was only taken down with a heavy deer slug which smashed his heart.\n\nAs this is a topic about .30, I must say that this caliber has plenty of range potential and can hit targets farther away than the other average handgun calibers.

Leave this bullet aside much smaller bullets like .17Mach2 have enough energy, penetration and wound size to kill any humanbeing.

(40420, ' Stainless Steel is not exactly "stainless". In order to make steel totally rustproof (stainless), the carbon content has to be removed and chromium has to be added. If you remove all the carbon, the steel will become brittle and will not be suitable for use in firearms, knives, etc. So, for the manufacture of these products, some percentage of carbon has to be in steel (which determines hardness and ability to stand up to pressure). It is this carbon which slowly causes the oxygen in the air to react, forming brownish-orange iron oxide aka rust. I also infer that due to extreme barrel heat, this reaction occurs at a quicker rate.\n\nSo, the "stainless steel" we commonly use is not, repeat not, truly stainless or rustproof.', ''),

(40422, ' [quote=PakistanGuides][quote=Starfish][quote=PakistanGuides]I wish I could take all my friends at Pak Guns to Concordia but the problem is it is very expensive .. even if we rough it out with daal roti .. the main expense is of porters which always makes the trek very expensive.\n\nUnfortunately, the porters always prefer to go with the climbing expeditions because they can go fast with them, drop their baggage at the base camp & with no baggage on their backs they run back quickly to catch another one, whereas, with a trekking party they have to go slow and walk every day (in & out) and carry the loads till the end so they dont like this and usually overcharge or creat problems with trekkers. To avoid problems, we over pay them but only when we have foreigners with us but in case of poor Pakistanis ... they show no mercy ... ! All other items of the treks are managable ! \n\nI''m lucky to have been to Concordia over six times while escorting with my treks & expeditions but I can''t forget my solo trek which I did in Oct 88 with 01 cook & 6 porters and this is was the firs time I carried no weight on my back. Even my camera was carried by one of my porters so I really enjoyed and made lots of photos. \nIn 1988, this solo trek costed me Rs 165,000/=  .. but its duration was quite long ![/quote]\n\n:o qaiser sb, the cost is too much. in 2004, it cost 25k per person for a group of 7 ppl to go including the porters food equipment and all and travel from lahore... some equipment was provided by our adventure club but still.\ni dont know how your cost was so high.[/quote]\n\nDear Starfish,\nMy treking cost to concordia was high because i went there in October when the snow was waist deep .. so obviously, the porters charged me winter wages which are two to three times more plus I had to give them complete winter cloting from head to toe including jackets, boots, sleeping bags, tents + all other items you normally give them in summer treks. \nSecondly, my trip was very long all the way from Dasu to Concorda, K2 base camp & back then to the base camps of G1 & G2 and then up to Convoy Saddle, Left Thumb, Laghari Post ... etc. and as you know the porters charge you according to stages and not as per the actual days so the total number of stages to all these camps costed me lot of money. And last but not the least, since I was alone, it costed me more because I had to carry the same camping & kitchen gear which a group of 4 to 6 people need ... the only increase is the number of plates and spoons !!! so if I had 4 to 6 more people in my group it would have costed me the same amount ! .. hope this is clear now ![/quote]\n\n\nYeah it is. thanks a lot :)\n\nGuys, a group of friends is going to snowlake in a week. The trek will be of 22 days including travel and rest at hunza at the end.\ncost is around 30k all inclusive. (subsidized by the adventure society adn some kind kind sponsors )\nwe start from dassu askole, and hop on to biafoo glacier, from traversing the glacier will lead us finally to snowlake. camp for a day at snow lake and then take the hisper la (hisper pass) and come down via the hisper glacier and off to hunza. a weeks rest in hunza then :P\nPorters will be provided for communal weight.\nmajority equipment will be provided. you will need to get a backpack. sleeping bag and some warm clothes yourself. oh and your  shoes as well:P\n\nPlease be advised that you will need to be fit, and carry approx 18 kgs of weight on your back (or whatever you decide to bring).\nWe have 3 seats on the squad available so far. 9 ppl have already signed up including 2 foreigners. let me know if you guys are interested.\nYou will be briefly interviewed / screened for physical fitness before you can join in :)', ''),
