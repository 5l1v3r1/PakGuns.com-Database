(412526, ' [QUOTE=durrani;250753]The first guns were small hand cannons, crude pipes that were filled with gun powder and a ball.Then the musket was invented, it was a bigger version of the hand cannon and was much more accurate. Loading the musket and the cannon was difficult and to make duck and bird hunting an easier, people used several smaller balls instead of one. They used one large ball for deer, 3 medium sized balls for smaller game, and several tiny balls for ducks and birds. To hunt birds and ducks at longer ranges Fowler was created, it was a shot weapon that was lighter than a musket, but had very long barrels. The barrel of a Fowler could easily be 6ft long. Soon after the Fowler was created, people figured out that a shorter barrel would make the shot scatter sooner and would be more deadly. The Blunderbuss was born. The  Blunderbuss was a short version of the fowler, with the barrel being as short as 9 inches. Eventually, the Blunderbuss and the Fowler were called shotguns due to the type of ammunition they shot.The double barrel shotgun was created for people to have a chance to make 2 shots before they had to reload again. Years later a man named Lenderhaux created the break-open shotgun. He had to make a new way to load it, so he also created self contained cartridges with a pin that protruded out of it that would get hit by the hammer and explode the charge. Browning invented a 6-shot lever-action shotgun which combined the best features of a lever action rifle and a shotgun. Soon after that, Browning also created the ever-popular pump-action shotgun.Most people had shotguns because few people could afford more than one weapon and the best choice was a shotgun. It was good for protection and hunting. It was also easier to clean, maintain, and repair due to the fact that it was simpler than a rifle.The old rule for gun buying still applies today: "If you can only buy one gun, get a  shotgun."[/QUOTE]\nthanks durrani sb for nice informations :)', ''),

Shah Mardaan Shah was also fond of Horses.\n\nThanks for sharing...[/QUOTE]\n\nbrother mujtaba , wat ever i have written is not a friction about the  Pagaro family . i want to share some more interesting facts, not very  much known to our generation.\n\n1)  Quaid-e-Azam Muhammad Ali  Jinnah , on his return from England as a young and extra ordinarily  brilliant barrister  , after completion of his Law education , was  requested to defend Syed Sibghatullah Shah , the father of Shah Mardan  Shah , in a case pending trial before a colonial court . Quaid accepted,  and, perhaps , appeared before the court for 3 or 4 hearings , but these  hearings were enough for Quaid to feel, from the nature of proceedings,   that , the case was fabricated and the presiding officer was per-determined  to condemn his client , who mostly  didnt have or  occasionally have   a very restricted approach to his lawyer ( the Quaid ). Due to this reason , Quaid , under protest , withdrew his advocacy with  an observation of the decision being a pre-determined one.   The future  proved the fore-sightedness of quaid to be correct as colonial rulers  executed Pir Sibghatullah Shah , Pir Pagaro  the 6th , on  20 march 1943  , at the age of 34 years only . instead of returning the body of slain freedom  fighter to his heirs, it was buried to some unknown place which is  still not known to any one . Pir was executed as during his days, the  HUR movement to seek an independent homeland for Muslims intensified and  reached its peek. In total , hurs fought 108 years against colonial  forces continuously.\n i have a rare copy of a book namely " saints of  Sindh ,written by  an esteemed English historian " Peter Mayne " , an  authority on the issues of the subcontinent of those days. Let me quote a  paragraph out of it and it would , at least , provide u  an insight as to  what the colonial forces think about Pir Pagaro the 6th\n\n  [I]"The  HUrs were watching the boy to grow too..with a passionate ,greedy  devotion , for here, surely , at last was their lord.Young as yet ,but  filled with the most resplendent promise..... and they worshiped him when  he loved them or dishonoured them , killed them or ordered them to kill  others, for this was the golden age and this the true lord......  Sibghatullah was growing into a large man, black bearded , handsome ,  with eyes calm as planets. He had suffered from small p0ox in his  childhood and the disease had left his skin pitted with the scars of it .  But already he had majesty of presence that was commended upon , even  by those who claimed to be unafraid . He had an agile mind and , unlike  his fore bearers, he gloried in his pirhood , he was the lord. Let those  ridiculous viceroys , governors , collectors and district magistrates  and superintendents of police , pore over their files and shake their  heads . His world was with his own to do with as he pleased "  \n\n[/I]2)  During the wars of 1965 and 1971 , Hurs fought shoulder to shoulder  with Pak Army and not only defended the borders of our Motherland but  penetrated deep inside enemy territory and captured vast areas and many  Hurs were recipients of military medals over their gallantry', ''),

If you ran a laser beam from their eye to the target, it would shine right through their sights.[/quote]\r\n\r\nWhat the study is showing is that through dedicated practice you can make sights work with the instinctive reaction to focus on the threat.  It appears the draw practice has to be well ingrained to press the gun and sights right between the eye and the threat.\r\n\r\nBut I also note this import statistic:\r\n\r\n[quote]&#8226; The ERT hit the assailant nearly 75 percent of the time, compared to about 54 percent &#8212; &#8221;slightly more than chance&#8221; &#8212; for the recently trained rookies. ERT hits were in the upper torso (center mass) 62 percent of the time, versus about 48 percent for the rookies.[/quote]\r\n\r\nThe threat was only 20'' away.  At this time I will arrogantly state that at less than 7 yards I would never, NEVER miss.  Not at 20'', not with gun out and ready for a press to shoot position.\r\n\r\nI would love to put that device on me during a match.  I wonder what it would show.', ''),

People usually mix up grains Vs grams and high powder Vs Grams thing. \r\n\r\nHigh gram loads like 34 gms and 36 gms Shaheen here called Super and Excel respectively have more pellet count and also longer head length called high brass loads (e.g. 12mm or 16mm in case of Super and Excel if I am not wrong instead of regular 8mm head length regular Shaheen load). This is also a confusion generally. It is very good you cleared the misconception. Kindly throw some light on what is a high brass load too like for instance 34 grams Shaheen Super cartrg or 36 grams Shaheen Excel cartrg VERSUS Shaheen regular 32 gms cartrg.... e.g. 34 gms Super Shaheen has longer head length (high brass). Does it mean more propellent when we say ''high brass''?...and, how much more propellent are we talking about approximately in a Shaheen Super with say 16mm head length VERSUS Shaheen Regular 8mm head length?? All high velocity loads (which I perceive as ''high brass'' loads) kick much more than the regular brass 8mm loads in any gms. It has to be due to the velocity which is depending on propellent (gun powder) of course... isn''t it. I was using a 28 gms, 16mm head length Cyprus made load in 8# pellet size (Victory''s Sonic V1, actually made for sporting clays by Coy) last season on ducks which not only kicked like anything, it performed at ranges beyond my imagination at medium sized ducks, though its a meagre 28 gms #8 load.\r\n\r\nBTW, how is your skeet shooting and duck (backmigration) hunting going?

Chaacha Din surely coined an interesting word for ''em. The fats make them a real delicacy (IF properly marinated/cooked).

Both guns (blinds) had good fun though I could not gather both blinds'' bags in one pic wherein after shooting we departed opposite ways in 2 vehicles with our respective decent enough bags, after a lavish bfast at river edge. The second gun had about 60% of this much bag though, but was more than happy at the brief 1.5-hr constant shooting (''Thaakke'') in early morning.\r\n[IMG]http://i1225.photobucket.com/albums/ee387/Francolino/DSC02095.jpg[/IMG]\r\nThe front ones are all the bigger ones (pintails & gadwalls mainly alongwith 3 shovelers & a pochard) and second lane is all teals, mainly the males, as at this time of season, many full bloom male teals were seen ''graciously'' decoying into the spread in mid sized flocks of which most landed in or near the pocket at 15-20 yds in front ... pretty amazing sight with many landings seen in decoys!! The last line of 4 birds are Avocets (2) and Bar-tailed Godwits (2) which seemed like flocks of Curlews landing into the decoys. Pretty large birds and I hv not seen them much here previously.

Now that I''ve read about its over penetrative nature, I feel very sad. When I had went to the dealer, he showed me both CF 98 and .30 bore.... one of the main reasons why I purchased .30 bore was because I could easily rack its slide... I don''t know if it was because of my build, but I simply couldn''t rack CF 98 slide! It was too hard for me.... I was only racking it like 80% travel, not 100%; but .30 bore was piece of cake. (holding Cf 98 was a treat, very well balanced).\n\nSince I like to keep this for SD/HD, over penetration looks bad, then again, if I can''t rack CF 98''s slide, what good is it in God forbid difficult situations?[/QUOTE]\nDid I make a bad decision???

How ever relevant to the 5.7 FN I will submit some more information. \nAll pistols firing high pressure rounds  are designed to fire from a Locked Breach, it means the Bolt or the Breach/Slide remains Locked with the barrel till the Bullet leaves the Muzzle and the pressure begins to drop rapidly; once it has dropped sufficiently the Slide  is un locked and free to move backwards extracting the fired case, ejecting it and completing the Cocking ,Feeding and Locking Cycles.\nMost Pistols are Recoil Operated.\nIn the recoil Operated weapons, the barrel and slide  move back  to gather a small distance  after  firing due to recoil imparted by the exiting bullet; this leads to Unlocking of the slide and barrel when the bullet has left the barrel, the gas pressure drops and  Obturation of the fired case is released. The slide continues to move back due to remaining gas pressure  and completes the Cycle.\nAll auto matic weapons are designed in a way that unless the Slide or Bolt and barrel are completely locked the Firing pin is out of alignment and cannot be struck by the hammer, also the the trigger does not operate unless the breach is Locked.\nThe FN 5.7 is operated by the DELAYED BLOW BACK system of Operation.\nIt is a very safe and tried method and some thing has to be very seriously wrong to cause it, some thing like a protruding primer, or a broken sear or some thing.\nThe H&K P7, P14 and the MP 5, the Rifle G3 all operate on the ingenious Gas system based on DELAYED BLOW BACK.\nNow based on my personnel experience in Handloading and firing auto matic weapons of the Delayed Blow Back variety for decades, I know one thing.  Cases must not be reloaded which have been fired in this system of operation as the case gets a hell of a lot of punishement as the gas pressure is still high when it is ejected.', ''),

You may/may not agree, whatsoever:\n\n1) [COLOR=#ff0000][B]You don''t really need any safeties if you don''t carry loaded chamber.[/B][/COLOR] [B][COLOR=#0000cd]Actual purpose of Safeties only comes into play, when it is that you have a habit of carrying a loaded/chambered handgun.[/COLOR][/B] \n\nOtherwise, what''s the danger, since you course first have to rack up your gun, don''t you?\n\nOr is it, that one would rack up the gun in case of dire emergency, and then turn the safety on before disengaging it just prior to the shot? Lolz! [B]NO[/B].\n\n[B][COLOR=#0000cd][I]Hence, I''m of the firm opinion, that we consider safeties only important as a measure against unwanted fingers on our handguns, not our own![/I][/COLOR][/B]\n\nIf we leave a loaded handgun unattended and with even manual safety on, we cannot rule out that any other person''s fiddling fingers cannot cause an accidental discharge, can we?\n\nSo, if you can take care of your weapons and prevent access to them, I really do not consider manual safeties any important thing to have on a handgun. When I''ll use the handgun myself, I''d just squeeze the trigger if my handgun is chambered and not have to remember to disengage a silly extra lever. In the heat of the moment, there''s either no time for this, or it is even forgotten to be disengaged! \n\n[B][COLOR=#0000cd][I]And if I do not carry chambered, I really don''t need any safety, do I? What will it protect if the handgun isn''t chambered? Lolz![/I][/COLOR][/B]\n\nWith this respect, I''d say, even Safe Action trigger safeties are enough. Especially if you don''t carry chambered. It requires however, that you''re proficient with handling handguns, if in the habit of carrying chambered. Nothing is idiot-proof, IMHO, when it comes to weapons.\n\n[COLOR=#ff0000][B]The prerequisite for above stance is, however, that you are proficient with weapons and your gun is "no-go"/restricted area to any others[/B][/COLOR]!\n\nElse, I really don''t think any safety in the world can prevent the un-desirable, can it?\n\n\nI hope I managed passing on my views in understandable manner.\n\n\n\nRegards.', ''),

(413172, ' [QUOTE=AK47;251466][B]@pakigunner..[/B].........Lolz!\n\nYou should have asked me, you wouldn''t have needed to check all those reviews, lolz!\n\nAnyhow, to come to your point, the trigger safety in safe-action handguns only helps preventing the [I]immediate danger of accidental discharge[/I], when holding the gun with a finger over it''s trigger, since it requires the 2 halves of the trigger to be pressed simultaneously for a shot. \n\nA manual safety is more secure course.\n\nBut let me just state one very important point here with respect to safeties and their use/usefulness, the way that I personally view these things. You may/may not agree, whatsoever:\n\n1) [COLOR=#ff0000][B]You don''t really need any safeties if you don''t carry loaded chamber.[/B][/COLOR] [B][COLOR=#0000cd]Actual purpose of Safeties only comes into play, when it is that you have a habit of carrying a loaded/chambered handgun.[/COLOR][/B] \n\nOtherwise, what''s the danger, since you course first have to rack up your gun, don''t you?\n\nOr is it, that one would rack up the gun in case of dire emergency, and then turn the safety on before disengaging it just prior to the shot? Lolz! [B]NO[/B].\n\n[B][COLOR=#0000cd][I]Hence, I''m of the firm opinion, that we consider safeties only important as a measure against unwanted fingers on our handguns, not our own![/I][/COLOR][/B]\n\nIf we leave a loaded handgun unattended and with even manual safety on, we cannot rule out that any other person''s fiddling fingers cannot cause an accidental discharge, can we?\n\nSo, if you can take care of your weapons and prevent access to them, I really do not consider manual safeties any important thing to have on a handgun. When I''ll use the handgun myself, I''d just squeeze the trigger if my handgun is chambered and not have to remember to disengage a silly extra lever. In the heat of the moment, there''s either no time for this, or it is even forgotten to be disengaged! \n\n[B][COLOR=#0000cd][I]And if I do not carry chambered, I really don''t need any safety, do I? What will it protect if the handgun isn''t chambered? Lolz![/I][/COLOR][/B]\n\nWith this respect, I''d say, even Safe Action trigger safeties are enough. Especially if you don''t carry chambered. It requires however, that you''re proficient with handling handguns, if in the habit of carrying chambered. Nothing is idiot-proof, IMHO, when it comes to weapons.\n\n[COLOR=#ff0000][B]The prerequisite for above stance is, however, that you are proficient with weapons and your gun is "no-go"/restricted area to any others[/B][/COLOR]!\n\nElse, I really don''t think any safety in the world can prevent the un-desirable, can it?\n\n\nI hope I managed passing on my views in understandable manner.\n\n\n\nRegards.[/QUOTE]\n\nWithout getting into ''what is better'' debate let me continue on safe action thing.\n\nSafe action is a [B][I]MULE[/I][/B]  i.e [I]cross breed[/I] between single n double action ;) \n\na) Double action:  you have to pull the trigger to bring hammer (or striker pin) all the way back to hammer it on primmer & you dont need to do anything except pulling the trigger but trigger pull is heavier than single action.\n\nb) Single action: you have to make striker pin ready to drop at primer by yourself (either by locking the hammer back or racking the slide to do this action for you); your trigger pull will just be used to disconnect the hammer/striker pin thus quite lighter than the double action.\n\nc) Safe action: Here you have to rack the slide which takes striker pin half way (half of the single action job) then pull the trigger to take striker pin remaining half distance back & drop it on the primer; this make trigger pull bit mushy. This action is specifically designed for hammerless pistols except Daewoo pistol which is single acion/double action/1.5 action ;)\n\nNow safeties in most of the safe action pistols, these pistols have group of different safeties working simultaneously; \n\na) Half cocked striker pin: this thing is a safety in itself as dropping pin from this distance will not have enough power to ignite the primer; if by any chance (which are one in millionsss in safe action pistols) striker pin gets free deceiving all the other safeties.\n\nb) Trigger safety: This safety make sure that trigger doesn''t actuate anything attached to it without this safety lever (popping right from the middle of trigger lever) is depressed while pulling the trigger with full finger pad on it, this safety make sure your chambered gun doesn''t go off unintentionally while holstering/unholstering the gun or in case the gun is dropped and trigger lever hits something.\n\nc) Firing pin safety: I would call it [I][B]''heart n soul of modern pistol safeties''[/B][/I] ; it actually is an obstruction in the way of striker pin that obstruct [B](positively)[/B] firing pin to move forward unless trigger is pulled; it basically is a small round piece of metal sitting in the slide tensioned by a small spring, upper part of this piece sits right in a cut made in firing pin (striker pin) while its cocked. This safety is depressed by a lever (connected with trigger) when trigger is fully pulled giving way the pin to move forward with the force of striker spring or hammer. \n\n\nHope above is enough for weeks to digest (to write) ;) .. will be here to clarify/explain if anything is not understood ;)', ''),

MOI (ALL PAKISTAN licenses issued in ISB) are not being issued since a long time, but the DEALER WILL GET YOU a license from your respective province i.e SINDH. He''ll take some documents from you, and charge 16k-24k for a license in KHI (that''s what I''ve heard) though I am getting my Punjab licenses @11k each.\nHe''ll get you the licenses within 1 month. Then you have to buy the gun and get it registered on the license.\nThen you have your own gun and can take it anywhere in SINDH.\nThen you''ll need to get a Hunting License made, someone closer to you might guide you better. It costs 2000 rupees annually in Punjab. The hunting season is from November to March, and there''s a list of birds you can shoot legally and the bag limit written on the license.\nThen go for hunting (outside city limits).', ''),

(413353, ' AK 47 bro thank you for your prompt response. i really appreciate your effort. \n\n[QUOTE=AK47;251466][B]@pakigunner..[/B].........Lolz!\n\nYou should have asked me, you wouldn''t have needed to check all those reviews, lolz!\n\nAnyhow, to come to your point, the trigger safety in safe-action handguns only helps preventing the [I]immediate danger of accidental discharge[/I], when holding the gun with a finger over it''s trigger, since it requires the 2 halves of the trigger to be pressed simultaneously for a shot. \n\nA manual safety is more secure course.\n\nBut let me just state one very important point here with respect to safeties and their use/usefulness, the way that I personally view these things. You may/may not agree, whatsoever:\n\n1) [COLOR=#ff0000][B]You don''t really need any safeties if you don''t carry loaded chamber.[/B][/COLOR] [B][COLOR=#0000cd]Actual purpose of Safeties only comes into play, when it is that you have a habit of carrying a loaded/chambered handgun.[/COLOR][/B] \n\nOtherwise, what''s the danger, since you course first have to rack up your gun, don''t you?\n\nOr is it, that one would rack up the gun in case of dire emergency, and then turn the safety on before disengaging it just prior to the shot? Lolz! [B]NO[/B].\n\n[B][COLOR=#0000cd][I]Hence, I''m of the firm opinion, that we consider safeties only important as a measure against unwanted fingers on our handguns, not our own![/I][/COLOR][/B]\n\nIf we leave a loaded handgun unattended and with even manual safety on, we cannot rule out that any other person''s fiddling fingers cannot cause an accidental discharge, can we?\n\nSo, if you can take care of your weapons and prevent access to them, I really do not consider manual safeties any important thing to have on a handgun. When I''ll use the handgun myself, I''d just squeeze the trigger if my handgun is chambered and not have to remember to disengage a silly extra lever. In the heat of the moment, there''s either no time for this, or it is even forgotten to be disengaged! \n\n[B][COLOR=#0000cd][I]And if I do not carry chambered, I really don''t need any safety, do I? What will it protect if the handgun isn''t chambered? Lolz![/I][/COLOR][/B]\n\nWith this respect, I''d say, even Safe Action trigger safeties are enough. Especially if you don''t carry chambered. It requires however, that you''re proficient with handling handguns, if in the habit of carrying chambered. Nothing is idiot-proof, IMHO, when it comes to weapons.\n\n[COLOR=#ff0000][B]The prerequisite for above stance is, however, that you are proficient with weapons and your gun is "no-go"/restricted area to any others[/B][/COLOR]!\n\nElse, I really don''t think any safety in the world can prevent the un-desirable, can it?\n\n\nI hope I managed passing on my views in understandable manner.\n\n\n\nRegards.[/QUOTE]', ''),

The reason was lack of safety on the Duty (i know it''s interchangeable but it was either this or that). Second reason was that two of my close friends (and colleagues) also have the Cougar so i have someone to learn from. I got the 8000F without rails.\n\nTo be honest i still have my heart on the Duty and Insha Allah once i have learned my ropes i will definitely get it :) I would like to thank all the members and their patience who took time to go through my endless seemingly idiotic questions and answered them.

The viking i own is an " all steel version " so i cant comment on the polymer frame version problems as those who own  polymer  one can, but one thing create doubts in my mind and that is " why all incidents of cracking a frame in viking happened and reported in Pakistan. Since the day i red about the issue , i have been searching to find any such like incident over the other forums based abroad specially in the countries where baikal viking is available but i havent came across a single one . the only incident of baikal kaboom  i  came across was reported on a canadian gun forum , and in that incident too, the kaboom appeared to have been caused due to use of a non-factory load. the gun enthusiast community in those countries is much organized in comparison to our region , so i cant believe any hypothesis of happening of any such like incident in any of those countries and its non-reporting on any forum. So wat i conclude ( and its my own personal view and every body has a right to differ ) that the vikings with cracked frames are either clones , as already mentioned by brother Denovo , or there is some thing market related to defame the gun', ''),

(413578, ' AoA Everybody\r\n\r\nIn my observation, the moment we hear about any firearm''s catastrophic failure, we immediately jump to a conclusion that its probably some sort of manufacturing flaw or the diminishing quality. which in my humble opinion is unjust.\r\n\r\nI am not saying that manufacturing flaws and/or diminishing quality cannot be the reasons. all I am saying is that catastrophic failures can just as easily be caused other factors which are beyond the control of a firearm manufacturer. such as:\r\n\r\n1. improper use or maintenance\r\n2. poor quality ammo or wrong type of ammo\r\n\r\n\r\nit doesn''t end here. the user/owner/operator could unknowingly be using a clone instead of an original.\r\n\r\nkeeping all that in mind, we need to investigate this matter further. cause, if we look at Baikal''s slide design, we''ll see that it rides on steel block (instead of metal inserts like in a glock) which is held inside the polymer frame by a punch pin. which in my humble opinion is a pretty solid setup and should relieve (atleast in theory) the polymer frame of any stresses (which can cause it to flex and break) that are generated during routine/normal operation of the handgun.\r\n\r\nhowever, I have also seen a NIB Baikal Viking with a crack in its frame. 2-3mm crack was in the round hole in the opposite side of the frame where the slide release (which also acts as a disassembly lever) is inserted. the crack was probably caused by a bad assembly job and was no way detrimental to the durability/reliability/performance of the handgun.\r\n\r\nRegards.', ''),

(413616, ' [QUOTE=zainulabdeen;251910]i have a baikal viking mp 446 and i am happy with it , though it is not in polymer frame . The viking i own is an " all steel version " so i cant comment on the polymer frame version problems as those who own  polymer  one can, but one thing create doubts in my mind and that is " why all incidents of cracking a frame in viking happened and reported in Pakistan. Since the day i red about the issue , [COLOR=#ff0000]i have been searching to find any such like incident over the other forums based abroad specially in the countries where baikal viking is available but i havent came across a single one . the only incident of baikal kaboom  i  came across was reported on a canadian gun forum , and in that incident too, the kaboom appeared to have been caused due to use of a non-factory load[/COLOR]. the gun enthusiast community in those countries is much organized in comparison to our region , so i cant believe any hypothesis of happening of any such like incident in any of those countries and its non-reporting on any forum. So wat i conclude ( and its my own personal view and every body has a right to differ ) that the [COLOR=#ff0000]vikings with cracked frames are either clones , as already mentioned by brother Denovo , or there is some thing market related to defame the gun[/COLOR][/QUOTE]\n\n\nyes, i m also searching here and where but the report is only from Pakistan users...i m also in favor of man made mistakes.\n\n\n[QUOTE=12GAUGE;251912]AoA Everybody\n\n[COLOR=#ff0000]In my observation, the moment we hear about any firearm''s catastrophic failure, we immediately jump to a conclusion that its probably some sort of manufacturing flaw or the diminishing quality. which in my humble opinion is unjust[/COLOR].\n\nI am not saying that manufacturing flaws and/or diminishing quality cannot be the reasons. all I am saying is that catastrophic failures can just as easily be caused other factors which are beyond the control of a firearm manufacturer. such as:\n\n[COLOR=#ff0000]1. improper use or maintenance\n2. poor quality ammo or wrong type of ammo[/COLOR]\n\n\nit doesn''t end here. the user/owner/operator could unknowingly be using a clone instead of an original.\n\nkeeping all that in mind, we need to investigate this matter further. cause, if we look at Baikal''s slide design, we''ll see that it rides on steel block (instead of metal inserts like in a glock) which is held inside the polymer frame by a punch pin. which in my humble opinion is a pretty solid setup and should relieve (atleast in theory) the polymer frame of any stresses (which can cause it to flex and break) that are generated during routine/normal operation of the handgun.\n\n[COLOR=#ff0000]however, I have also seen a NIB Baikal Viking with a crack in its frame. 2-3mm crack was in the round hole in the opposite side of the frame where the slide release (which also acts as a disassembly lever) is inserted. the crack was probably caused by a bad assembly job[/COLOR] and [COLOR=#008000]was no way detrimental to the durability/reliability/performance of the handgun[/COLOR].\n\nRegards.[/QUOTE]\n\n\nfirst of all thanks for input and you are the [B][COLOR=#ff0000]first solid source reported the cracked seen by yourself[/COLOR][/B].\ni m also in favor that y people just blames the QC or manufacturer and didnt want to investigate.\n\nas quoted by you ""[COLOR=#FF0000]1. improper use or maintenance [/COLOR][COLOR=#FF0000]2. poor quality ammo or wrong type of ammo""\n[/COLOR]these are the man made mistakes and responsibility is not on manufacturers.\n\nas you are the witness of seeing the cracked in NIB guns, the correct things is you are assuming bad assembly job and still your faith on this gun is toooo much..\n\nagain thanks for your input..', ''),

(413719, ' No they don''t bro. Ejection [B]ONLY[/B] happens when the slide goes into recoil. What happens is that the there''s a little "hook" at the end of the extractor (which is attached to the slide) which snags on to the edge of the casing of the round when it''s chambered. When the shot is fired, the slide goes into recoil, and as the slide moves rearward, it pulls the spent casing along with it until it reaches the ejection port and is thrown out.\n\nSince a snap cap is a dummy round, hence it can''t go off and the slide cannot go into recoil. Hence a snap cap is not ejected when you pull the trigger. You can, however, manually eject a chambered snap cap by manually racking the slide. Infact, doing so is an excellent way to see how the extractor actually works and how the next round is fed from the magazine and fed into the chamber. :)', ''),

This particular model is ideal if you wish to use the gun in various disciplines of hunting/shooting. very reliable shotgun that functions very well through out the range of "Hunting and Target" cartridges available in the market however this reliability comes at a cost in the form of inability to fire 3.5 inch super magnum shotgun cartridges.\r\n\r\n[B]2. 3.5 inch or 89mm Chamber (Steel Shot Approved)[/B]\r\n\r\navailable in either polymer or wood furniture and in barrel length of 26 or 28 inches. This particular model is ideal for waterfowl where one can get some benefit out of the 3.5 inch cartridges. very reliable shotgun that functions very well through out the range of "Hunting only" cartridges available in the market with an added benefit of the ability to safely shoot 3.5inch super magnum cartridges. however this benefit comes at a cost in the form of lesser reliability in light target loads.\r\n\r\n[B]3inch vs 3.5inch Chamber:[/B]\r\n\r\nwell.....answer to that mostly depends upon your use. if its strictly going to be a waterfowl gun then 89mm chamber would be better as it gives you the option of using the [B]"never around when you need one"[/B] and [B]"highly expensive"[/B] [B][I]shoulder busting[/I][/B] 3.5 inch roman candles. :)\r\n\r\nor its going to be a shotgun that would see multiple uses then 3inch would be better as it gives you versatility in the form of reliably firing the [B]"wimpy"[/B] and mostly [B]"out of stock"[/B] target loads that are only good for quail size birds or smaller.\r\n\r\nso......with 3inch chamber you get excellent reliability through out the range of hunting/target loads (24g-46g). whereas a 3.5 gives you excellent reliability through out the range of hunting (28g-63g) loads.\r\n\r\n[B]Ask your self this question:[/B]\r\n\r\nwill you be shooting more 24g target loads OR more 63g super magnum loads? then decide accordingly.\r\n\r\nRegards.', ''),

(414004, ' [QUOTE=Ahnab;244922]Salaam everyone!\n\nI wanted to relate to you an SD situation I found myself in a little over a month ago. I wasn''t sure whether I should tell people about this particular incident, but lately I''ve realised that such cases should be discussed openly & frequently so as to learn from our mistakes and to better ourselves collectively.\n\nIt was a Wednesday night and I was coming home from work. It was late night, around 11:30, and I was travelling on Ferozpur Road. I had just come down from the Kalima Chowk flyover and had come to a standstill at the traffic signal opposite Gaddafi Stadium. I wanted to make a u-turn, and was waiting for my signal to turn green. I had been standing at the red signal for not more than 5 seconds when I suddenly heard tires screeching behind me. I immediately looked into the rear-view mirror and saw a pair of headlights gunning straight at me. I instinctively braced myself, and the next moment I felt an impact and heard a loud crash. Apparently somebody had rear-ended me. I took a moment to check that I was fine, took a deep breath to calm myself down, and then got out of the car to assess the damage.\n\nThe first thing I saw when I got out was the other car; it was a brand new E-Class Mercedes, with an "Applied for Registration" tag. It''s front bumper had a nasty dent, the grille was partially hanging out, and the right headlight was flickering like crazy. Looking at the condition of the Merc, I was suddenly quite apprehensive at the damage my car must have taken (I was driving a late model Honda City). So I looked over at my car and, miraculously, all I suffered was a hairline crack on the bumper; everything else was perfectly fine! Relieved, I silently thanked God and started to walk over to the Merc to check on the driver.\n\nThe Merc''s door flew open and a kid in his early 20''s stormed out. He looked at the damage his car had taken, then looked at my car, then turned to me and started accusing me of being a bad driver. He was screaming & shouting, calling me everything from being stupidly blind to being a road menace. I kept calmly reminding him that it was he who had smashed into a stationary car at a red traffic signal and, therefore, the fault lay with him. But he simply wouldn''t have any of it, and even went to the extent of demanding that I pay for his damages!\n\nI tried calming him down and diffusing the situation as civilly as possible, but he was just too "pumped up" to let it go. So after listening to his ranting for a full 5 minutes and trying fruitlessly to make him understand where the actual blame lay, I felt that I was fast running out of patience with his attitude and rudeness. So I cut him short and told him that I''ve had a long day, it''s late and that I''m going home. With that I turned around and started walking back towards my car.\n\nIt was then that things took a turn for the worse. He suddenly started using filthy & abusive language regarding my family. I immediately saw red and turned around to fire off a verbal salvo of my own, when I noticed he was storming off towards his own car. From the way he was walking and cursing, I felt that something was wrong. Alarm bells started going off in my head! I was wearing a suit that day, with my CCW holstered on my right hip under my coat. I swept the front of my coat over to the side and got a good grip on my gun. The jackass got to his car, reached in, fumbled around a bit, and lo and behold, he pulled out a TT! His gun was in a dormant state, and he furiously started trying to insert the magazine. Seeing this, I immediately drew my weapon and pointed it straight at his face. By this time he had finally managed to insert the magazine, and was about to rack the slide when he looked up, and saw my gun aimed right at him.\n\nI calmly but firmly told him, "Put the gun on the ground, and kick it under your car." He didn''t move a muscle and continued to stare at me with utter hate, so I repeated the command again a little more aggressively. I then noticed that his hand was already on the slide and he was slowly pulling it back. I cocked my hammer and shouted, [B]"PUT THE F**KING GUN ON THE GROUND OR I SWEAR TO GOD I WILL F**KING END YOUR F**KING LIFE, YOU MISERABLE F**K!"[/B] (please pardon the language) He looked at me for another second or so and then slowly put his gun on the ground. I then firmly told him to get in his car and drive away. He did as he was told, quietly got in, and slowly drove off. I kept my gun aimed at him the whole time till he had driven about a good 50-60 meters away. I then quickly decocked & holstered, and took a couple of deep breaths to calm myself down.\n\nI then started quietly thanking the Almighty, when 3 traffic wardens came up and started their "interrogation". I informed them of what had happened, told them that I have a licensed firearm (even showed them the license), and even pointed out the TT the jackass had left lying on the road. I then spent the next 20 minutes manoeuvring and dodging around their attempts to "pay them for their trouble". Finally they gave up, gave me a "stern warning" about being careful in the future, and left. I immediately got into my car and drove home, all the while thanking God that everything worked out fine.\n\nI learnt a lot from this particular experience, lessons about both myself and about the crazy world we live in. Not a day has gone by since then when, while leaving my home in the morning, I pray to God that I won''t be put in a situation where I''ll have to take another human being''s life. That being said, now that I look back at this incident, I know for a [B]FACT[/B] that I would have pulled the trigger without any hesitation and shot off atleast 5 rounds into that jackass'' chest. Just because I try to avoid confrontations doesn''t mean that I won''t resort to violence if forced to do so. I''m just happy that this incident ended without anyone getting hurt.\n\nMay Allah bless us, guide us, and protect us all. Ameen.[/QUOTE]\n\nJust read the above incident Ahnab bro and I''m glad it all ended up without any serious consequences or you being hurt. I''ve not read other member''s comments and thoughts on this incident yet but just to make afew quick comments immediately after reading the story, Unfortunately these are the kind of threats we have to put up with now adays. Apart from spending sometime in the Royal Territorial Army and further undertaking work placements with the Met Police here in Yorkshire, I now work for the UK''s largest Security Company. As part of my job I have been going undertaking and been attending various different trainings, including the "Conflict Management" training which is probably the most important one out of all the subjects because thats where we are trained on how to tackle and deal with different hostile situations and conflicts in the most appropriate manner with the best outcome.\n From my own experience the way you handled this situation was the best possible solution. Because being a winner in such scenarios doesn&#8217;t always mean the other side being brought down or dead etc, but they say that the tough ones are always the calm ones who stay calm, immediately carries out a quick Dynamic Risk Assesment and then immediately tackle the situation without lashing out or losing control. You quickly assessed the situation or threat, then immediately responded in a way that prevented a potentially deadly attack without any one being hurt or killed and did not lose your calm. \n In that scenario legally you would have been in your rights to shoot the perpetrator if you wanted to because most Laws in every country state that if someone threatens your life with an offensive weapon and you feel your life is in danger you can respond and use necessary force required to stop or prevent the strike. Shooting him could have been justified in the court of law because he was about to pull a loaded gun at you, and that would have been enough to  justify you firing at him as self-defense but you did not do so and the way you handled it was even better. It takes a real man to keep his feet on the ground and do what you did in such scenarios. Well Done.\n\nNow lets talk abit about the other man or the potential attacker. \nOne minor possibility is that the driver driving the Merc could have been under the influence of alcohol or drugs as he failed to stop in the time required for him to break and stop at a safe distance on a traffic light. Because the use such substances slow down your reaction or response time. \nBut in my opinion there is a big possibility that this attack was pre planned. Mugging or robbing someone at the gunpoint is not the only way fraudsters, thieves, muggers, Robbers and Dacoits use to loot or rob people but many other different tactics are also used and this could have been one of them. May be he had stolen the car from somewhere, or maybe he had snatched it from someone at teh gunpoint in a different area and then planned this whole scenario to go, find a victim, bump his car into them from behind, and then try all what he tried with you to make some money.\n\nEven though in this case his plan backfired at him as in this case his chosen target or the victim (YOU) turned out to be a lot more clicked on than him which he most likely never expected but in other cases there are chances that he would have succeeded in his plan because in most circumstances most of our general public out there walk around un-armed and if it was some poor or naive working class citizen who do not want any trouble he would have just said ok brother I will pay you money etc simply because they don&#8217;t want trouble, or being involved in such cases on the legal side, and no trips to Police stations or courts, or no physical fights so often most people would just pay on the spot to avoid any further trouble and then these b*strds (excuse my language) become more and more confident and continue to do so. From what I can gather he was just a thief in a stolen Merc, also in most cases a man who genuinely owns such a car will probably not react or behave in the manner he was behaving.\n\nHe may have not made it obvious on the scene but believe me it was a nasty surprise for him. I bet you he never expected such a response, to him from your first look when you came out of your car was just a random yuppy in the suit with the money who he thought he is going to show is his TT to, pointing at him and you were going to start shaking pleading for your life begging on your knees saying please sir take the money, take the car and let me go. Lol. If anything it turned round to be the other way round.\nOne of my friends recently visited me here in UK from Peshawar and told me a story about his older brother that once his elder brother who I also know was driving his car in Peshawar and had his cell phone on the front passenger seat. All of sudden some guy on a motorcycle hit his cars back bumper from behind, he stopped the car, got out of his car started walking towards the guy on the motor cycle behind him and while he was walking another guy on another motorcycle quickly stopped near his front passengers side door, quickly grabbed the mobile phone from the front passenger seat and both guys on both motorcycles fled. \n\nAfew hints and tips to the fellow PGs, Always keep your doors locked when driving around especially at night time and if somebody bump into your vehicle from behind. DO NOT come out of your car straight away. Keep your doors locked, look around, quickly assess the situation and then decide whether it&#8217;s safe to come out or not. If not, and if necessary to flight, then do not be ashamed or hesitate to press your foot down and fly. DO NOT TRY TO BE A HERO. That&#8217;s what they say here in the British Police training. We back home, meaning in Pakistan often bring &#8220;ghairath&#8221; into everything little thing and try to employ this word &#8220;ghairath&#8221; or pride in the wrong places simply where there is no need.\n\nGod Bless us All.', ''),

(413977, ' [QUOTE=Mig;252235]Can you tell the technical reason of lighter loads are not supported with 3.5 chamber ? And I guess these differences are same for any kind of shotgun irrespective of manufacturer ?\r\n\r\nRegards,[/QUOTE]\r\n\r\nBro, reliability in autoloader shotguns is directly proportional to propellant gas pressure that is generated when a cartridge is fired. in gas autoloader shotgun, you harness this pressure the cycle the bolt, eject the spent cartridge and load a fresh one into the chamber. if you reduce this pressure, you are in effect, reducing the reliability.\r\n\r\nsimilarly, when we fire a light target load in a 3.5 inch super magnum chamber, the gas pressure generated is much lower compared to a smaller 3inch or a 2.75inch chamber. thats why super magnum autoloader shotguns are never considered reliable with light loads.\r\n\r\nnow lets add a gas regulator to the equation. it serves the purpose of increasing reliability by maximizing the gas harnessing ability of the action. whenever a light target load is fired, it automatically utilizes as much gas as possible to cycle reliably and whenever super hot loads are fired, it vents off excess gas and only makes use of the desired level of gas to for reliable cycling while preventing the action from damage.\r\n\r\ndifferent manufacturers employ different mechanisms for gas regulation. some rely on vents/ports in the barrel where others such as Baikal rely on a spring inside the regulator. which when in tight state for light loads, harnesses maximum gas pressure and when lose for heavy loads, vents off excess gas.\r\n\r\nRegards.', ''),

Assemble your gun and rack the slide number of times alongwith dry firing.

Half hr from home is surely a comfort, whereas we mostly travel long distances from our places and the travel is pretty hectic sometimes too which difficult terrains and off roading sometimes.\n\nBeautiful looking contemporary shaped semi gun...howz is it going at ducks and upland, as I remember its some Franchi semi-auto model.[/QUOTE]\nThanks francolino brother. Yes each and every kid in the family is crazy about the sport as now it is inherited in 3rd generation. They are used to see the trophies, Albums and sport related items at homes and naturally these things made them the sport lovers.\nNow I am near to 50:smile: and because of age factor, family and business commitments I prefer not to travel long unless there is a rifle shooting oppertunity. By virtue of our homes in Gujrat and Sialkot we are very near to all kinds of sports from upland to waterfowls and from plain fields to uphills so have got lot of nearby chances to quench the thirst for this sport. We in our family have got two 6 seated wooden boats with engines each placed at head rasool and head khanki. Since last year head rasool is dry so we are focusing on head khanki which has got some good spots for the game. From next season I am planning to have one more boat for down stream head marala.\nThe gun is franchi raptor 4+1 which I am using only for water fowling since 2007, for uplands I love to use doubles from last many years.', ''),

Wilhelm Bubits as we know worked for Glock and Steyhr, and what he learned from those designed he incorporated into the Caracal. So he just built off his previous designs. For example, the grip angle is that from a Springfield XD9(I dont think he worked for Springfield) as many people dont like the sloped angle grip from that of a Glock. It took the simplicity and few parts from the Glock and made them fewer and simpler. There is also a loaded chamber and cocked indicator, which i dont recollect in a Glock if I am not mistaken. There is a lot more, but the Caracal shouldn''t be downplayed because it is new to the market, rather it improves on the many great designs we have today.\n\np.s. One great thing it has from which is liken to the CZ line of pistols, is that it has as slim slide which is mainly inside the frame of the gun and the railings are really long for excellent accuracy and lower recoil.

I wasn''t the one who pulled his gun first; what I did was simply in self-defense.

(414377, ' I think the money one spends on SD/HD is worth every single penny. everyone has the right to defend himself and his loved ones and should be prepared for any threatening situation.\n\nHowever carrying a weapon can be risky as people tend to get cocky when they are armed i.e. one should only draw the weapon once in a life threatning situation.\n\nIn my opinion carrying a gun on you is not useful as in most of the self defence situations you may not even get a chance to draw the weapon as it requires an early warning and time to draw it. For example while you are in a car and some motorcycle wala comes next to your window pointing a gun and telling you to pull over while keeping your hands on the steering wheel. In such situations you wont get a chance to defend yourself and trying to draw a weapon may prove fatal. I know one person who got shot and died, and he wasn''t even carrying a gun. When the robbers told him to stop the car, while stopping he took his left hand down to pull the hand brake. The robbers thought that he is going to pull a weapon and shot him in chest.\n\nIn HD situations there are more chance of getting an early warning and it is quite possible that you get enough time to draw your weapon and defend your self.\n\nI pray to ALLAH SWT that he should be our protector and we should never face any such dangerous situation.', ''),

(414389, ' [B]AoA Everybody[/B]\r\n\r\nKindly allow me to offer my two cents on the subject:\r\n\r\n[B]Baikal MP446 Viking:[/B]\r\n\r\nfrom metallurgy standpoint, I do not see a reason not to call it a tank. everything about this handgun just oozes ruggedness/robustness. someone mentioned the shape of the guide rod. I''ll say, guides rods are not designed to take enormous amounts of pressure to begin with therefore there is no need for a heavy, solid metal guide rod. on the other hand, Baikal''s guide rod is designed (IMHO) in such a way to reduce the chances of spring buckling under load during cycling, possibly increasing reliability. which is a big time plus in my books.\r\n\r\nmoving on, Baikal''s trigger is the best in its class. no need to discuss it any further.\r\n\r\nmoving on again, Baikal''s chamber clearly speaks that its designed to fire something NASTY. barrel on the other hand is nothing out of the ordinary.\r\n\r\n[B]CZ 999 Scorpion:[/B]\r\n\r\na time proven design that has faced the most critique consumers and lived to tell the tale, The U.S. consumers.\r\n\r\na design that has seen war/conflict. the hardest of any tests. undergone changes afterwards. stating that the product matured or incorporated the lessons learned.\r\n\r\nThe hammer forged barrel of the CZ 999 Scorpion is thicker than Baikal MP446 Viking. after measuring both with a vernier caliper, I welcome anybody to reject my statement. another plus, it is chromed lined from inside and outside whereas Baikal''s barrel is chromed lined from inside only.\r\n\r\nThe rifling on CZ 999 Scorpion is deep and more profound than on Viking. I do not know what that means but I would rather have deep rifling. kinda gives an impression to me that such a barrel would have longer life. but thats only my guestimation. your mileage may vary.\r\n\r\nWhen it comes to handguns, barrel isn''t everything. frames are a big variable as well. Baikal''s frame is polymer reinforced with steel insert. so its steel on steel whereas on CZ 999 Scorpion, it is Steel slide on aluminum frame. not the strongest of setup as Steel on Steel will always be better than Steel on Aluminum. plus Polymer is maintenance free, where Aluminum is high maintenance.\r\n\r\nNow coming to controls, Baikal''s trigger is the best in its class but it ends here. there are other controls too. CZ 999 is supplied with an ambidextrous decocker, slide release and magazine release. this is a big time plus in my opinion. whereas baikal''s controls in my opinion are less than impressive.\r\n\r\n[B]Bottom Line (just my humble opinion, I''m not insisting on anything):[/B]\r\n\r\nIn my humble opinion, Baikal is all about durability whereas CZ 999 scorpion takes into consideration comfort as well. in my opinion, comfort and smoothness matters. I''m not saying that durability doesn''t. all I''m saying when we go to a store to buy a pair of boots, we buy the ones that are strong and comfy. why don''t we all go and buy something made of all metal/steel? strong as hell but would rip out feet to shreds. so why should firearms be any different. \r\n\r\nAny tool that we buy should be strong and comfortable as well. strength isn''t everything. otherwise we would all be wearing pants made of HDPE and boots made of fiber reinforced polymer or carbon steel instead of leather. a firearm is a complete package. you just cannot/should not focus on any two/three variables and forget the rest.\r\n\r\nHowever, your mileage may vary. this is just my personal opinion. if you desire durability to a point that comfort isn''t a necessary trait for you then by all means, Baikal is the way to go. there is no doubt about it. from durability standpoint, it is better than any CZ 999 at any given day. however if you desire a more complete package, CZ 999 offers a lot more than just durability so do look into it.\r\n\r\nin my humble and personal opinion you can do a lot more with CZ 999 than what you can do with Baikal from customization/accessory/repair standpoint.\r\n\r\nyou can make your own guide rods, similarly you can replace all major springs with commonly available spring in the market (slight modification may be necessary). you can also get quality Kydex holsters that fit a CZ 999 whereas with a baikal you are limited to cheap nylon holsters. did I mention that you can easily convert inexpensive beretta/sig magazines to CZ 999 Scorpion compatible magazines?\r\n\r\nRegards.', ''),

However, light weight is the advantage polymer frame offers.

It absorbs extra vibrations as well as lessens wear & tear on the bolt assembly and receiver (receiver peening as it is called). As per my opinion, the Xplor Unico without KO (either in 26" wt 6.6. lbs, or 28" wt 6.8 lbs) is a better buy. Or alternatively Urika2 Gold (Opt) (26" wt 6.8 lbs, or 28" wt 7 lbs).

And which one would be harmful for pistol ?\n\nThanks for your support and guidance in advance. :)\n\n- FMJ 115 grs\n- FMJ 124 grs\n- SP 124 grs\n- JHP 115 grs[/QUOTE]\n\nSOLDIER\nFirst of all no ammunition from any recognised manufacturer can damage your pistol.\nNo two Pistols or rifles will shoot the same type of ammo accurately even when both pistols and ammo are from the same maker. We have to live with this reality, although some times it can happen.\nOne has to try different makes and weights and shapes of bullets to find out which make, shape and weight of bullet gives most accuracy in ones particular pistol.\nShort barrels from compact pistols usually give lesser velocity and this effect is more pronounced when lighter bullets of a given caliber  are used. There fore when using short barrels it is wise to use heavier bullets like 124 gr or 135 or 147 grains in short barrels so the bullets do not lose more velocity and energy. This happens as heavier bullets ensure more efficient combustion of propellant in a shorter barrel.\nGenerally ( as a matter of fact ) heavier bullets fired from pistols tend to strike higher due to a longer barrel time and the lighter bullets strike lower as these take a shorter barrel time.\nACCURACY is some thing you have to determine by trying out different bullets in your pistol. Once you find the most accurate load or make, bullet weight and shape stick to it; if it is also dependable and does not cause stoppages.', ''),

I will never forget the moment when I shot my first bird which happened to be a green finch perched in a bottle brush tree in our house. The other reasons that encouraged me to restore the Diana 27 first include that it was my first air gun, well it was given to my brother but he didn''t use it much so I guess it was mine hehe. \n\nThis particular Diana 27 was given to my elder brother by my chacha who had been shooting it since the early 60s and it belonged to a Taya of mine before that so I am guessing by the serial numbers and the markings that its from the early or mid 50s. The gun has seen its fair share of use and abuse over the years probably most of which was done under my ownership, as I broke the original stock and hid it fearing I would get a scolding other things which happened to it under my ownership would be the loss of the rear sight and the end cap. I got most of the original parts for it from the US this time I came home so If all goes well this and the others will be speedy restorations. Other guns which will undergo restoration include Diana 35, BSA meteor, BSA scorpion pistol and a Gamo Delta. I know this is kind of long and boring but get used to it guys because I am going to add a story to the threads for the rest of the restoration threads as well.', ''),

(414841, ' I''m not sure about "rimless" but as per my limited knowledge, your question pertains to rimfire and center fire. Rimfire refers to a bullet e.g. .22, where the the bullet can be fired by the pin impacting almost anywhere on the rim base of the bullet. The  Center fire, as the name would suggest has a specific area of impact (primer)in the middle of the bullets base.\nAnother difference is that rimfire casing cannot be reused because the primer is built into the bullet and not separate like in center fire bullets.\n+p refers to hi pressure ammo. This ammo tends to create an above normal pressure inside the gun when fired. Not all guns can handle +p ammo and consistent use of this ammo in guns not designed/built to handle it can lead to the gun being damaged. In general, +p is supposed to have better stopping power and is more suitable for SD use.', ''),

I started with a sheet of 150 grit as I had some laying around and it was a bad choice should have gone with some thing a bit more courser for the first sanding, any how going to move to 200 grit tomorrow and so on till I get the wood really smooth.

Firstly it is entirely a  different debate and a debate without any concrete practical statistically proven facts...so can''t say much abt that. I myself am looking for some input on that, whether that REALLY makes any difference in patterning & shot distribution PRACTICALLY ....though in theory to market firearms these things look attractive.

(414901, ' But as I understand (just a guess).. the Light variant does not have KO3 because that feature helps with use of 3.5 '''' magnum cartrgs only. And as Xplor Light or previous ones like AL391  are not 3.5'''' magnum chambered, the company prob has not felt the need to instal KO3. But thats just my guess. We here don''t even use 3'''' mag cartrgs so.... maybe KO3 does not have much practical advantage for us...thats food for thought. But on the side when high powered loads such as Shaheen Super or Excel are excessivelly used or some high volume shooting is done, the receiver gets good battering, and for that KO3 might be a good protection & might absorb those (extra) vibrations after shot is fired.\r\n\r\nAnother pt abt wt....A good bird (upland) gun has wt in range of 5.75 - 7 lbs... 7 lbs is the max one shd go if upland hunting is targeted. We normally are using these guns for both purposes here, so weight is important.

If the shooter doesn''t know the drop, or add wind into the equation, that''s a miss, every time, maybe a single lucky hit in 100.\n\nIf the shooter is printing shots in an 8"group at 7 yards... the maximum effective range for that shooter is likely only 15 yards.\n\nSo the answer is a very clear and definitive... "it depends."[/QUOTE]\nNice Explanation StevenCline Bro..... I go with u........ "It realy depends"', ''),

(415009, ' Bro hsnmz, lighter guns are a disadvantage in duck, geese as well as skeet. But r only good for whole day walked up style upland hunting where gun''s weight is a big issue. Otherwise a weightier gun always shoots better due to smoother and controlled swing. And as you know unless close range brush hunting (some partrg or quail areas for example) or some close range snipe shooting is done, a lighter gun in my opinion is of lesser advantage.  Unless a certain momentum is there due to weight (and balance) of the gun, swing is erratic and nippy. But your experience can vary.\r\nSecond, Beretta semi guns are a much much better buy (quality and resale both) than Browning... just my opinion ... especially if we are talking about Shaheen cartrgs usage.\r\nUnico term wherever is there, a KO3 will be there too, just by default; whereas I know the term ''Unico'' stands for all load recycling. KO is an option in all variants ... whereas KO3 is not an option in all ... it is not a feature in Xplor Light ..I think KO3 is an important feature to protect bolt and receiver.', ''),

Leave alone their exhaustive exercise requirements.\n\nLet me just update here, a couple of changes.\n\n[B][COLOR=#0000ff]I have decided to go for a pedigreed[/COLOR][/B]. Reason being, as one of our dog gurus here, Easy Rider bro, who has a vast experience with dogs, is a breeder himself, and has taken part in international dog shows with winning dogs, was kind enough to give me some time over the phone and a couple of useful suggestions.\n\nThe difference in cost of keeping a pedigreed/non-pedigreed is nil. You feed them the same.\n\nThe difference in care for each is also nil. You take good care of both and make them part of the family.\n\nYou spend equal much of time in socializing them. Training. Training cost, if sent over for such.\n\nIn case of mating even, pedigreed pups will ensure continued good dog blood in the house, and if you offer pups for sale, demand for pedigreed pups is higher than the non-pedigreed.\n\nHence, the only difference is the initial cost. Means, 25-35k''s for the non pedigreed, 50-60K''s for the pedigreed (not show class). \n\nI have decided to invest the bit of extra mileage, deeming it worth it.\n\nThe issue is just that the "Rott itch" keeps coming back over me, lolz!\n\nI find myself in exactly the same dilemma as when loaded with a license and having to select a new handgun.\n\nThe Rott is kind of cal.45, Alsation/GSD a 9''er, more [I]stamina[/I], less "recoil", "easy carry", lolz!\n\nI wonder why on the earth I always land in tough dilemmas, when selecting a handgun, car, dog, etc, lolz!

I myself once suffered a near-traumatic experience when an Armscor JHP round (the fourth round I ever fired!) got stuck in the chamber of my gun (causing the slide to go out of battery). What''s more, the slide had completely frozen up, and no amount of force could move it (so now I couldn''t even rack the slide to eject the bad round). Fortunately, the slide had stopped at the exact spot where it needs to be in order for the gun to be disassembled. So I took the gun apart (after wrestling with the slide for almost 20 minutes before it finally budged) and then had to use a rifle''s cleaning rod to force the stuck round out of the chamber! This whole experience scared me to such an extent that, since then, I''ve never fired a single JHP from my gun! :p', ''),

The riffle used was M24 and cartridge was 7.62x51 Nato with Maximum effective range of 875 yards. Effectiveness of the bullet also depends on wind, spin drift & gravity. There are formulas to account for. The exact aim point and the hitting point are therefore different and the compensation between these two is known as Kentucky windage. To conclude above, it is understandable that the bullet gained enough kinetic energy during the flight to knock the target down even at 500 yards more than its effective range. So with that shot all the record books have to be upgraded for 7.62.', ''),

(415490, ' [QUOTE=Ahnab;253729]Here''s the major difference between JHP''s & FMJ''s:-\n\n[B]JHP''s:-[/B]\n1) Have a lower penetration than an FMJ''s\n2) Mushroom upon impact and slow down almost immediately (due to the sudden drag created by the mushroom head), whereby they transfer total kinetic energy more efficiently and quickly\n3) The mushroom has the added bonus of creating a much bigger entry wound and channel\n4) Due to the mushrooming effect and immediate loss of kinetic energy, a JHP will rarely over-penetrate the target, and will instead tumble inside the target (whereby causing much more internal damage)\n5) As such, a JHP is ideally suited against "soft targets" (e.g. humans, etc.)\n\n[B]FMJ''s:-[/B]\n1) Have higher & greater penetration than JHP''s\n2) Have a relatively poor kinetic energy transfer upon impact, because of which an FMJ will retain a large degree of forward momentum and will usually over-penetrate the target\n3) The entry wound and channel is considerably smaller than that of n JHP\n4) As such, an FMJ is best suited against "hard targets" (walls, doors, etc.)\n\nHope I covered everything and made sense! :)[/QUOTE]\nVery nicely explained.', ''),

(415594, ' @ Chauhdary Bro;\n\n  OK Brother; It was quite simple procedure. As you know I visited the Police Station on Thursday evening and the ASI said that he will call me on Friday but unfortunately there was no call. So I visited again yesterday evening and met him. He said that he could not check my case as he was busy but he was cooperative person and he approached to his officer (Sub Inspector) and tried to explain him my case but that guy said [U]“MUJHAY NAHIN PATA, YEH [B]MUHARRAR[/B] WAGHAIRA JANTAY HAIN, AGUR TUMHAIN NAHIN PATA TO KISI SENIOR MUHARAR SAY PATA KARO”[/U]\n  So the ASI called another [B]MUHARRAR[/B] somewhere in another station (I think at SSP office in ISB) and checked with him and finally asked me to wait outside of his office for a while and he will call me. After waiting for about 10 minutes his assistant came out and said is this your license and then asked me to come inside.   He, the assistant opened a Register No. 17 and started entering my license information and meanwhile asked me about the photocopies of the license and NIC which I gave him. He got stuck when he saw my residence address of Pindi on my NIC, then I explained him again that I changed my residence in XYZ Society in Islamabad and gave him the proof (copy of Society’s property transfer letter with the copies of utility bills). So he entered my new address in his register and fixed the police station stamp on the last page of my license where he wrote:  [CENTER][CENTER][B]“BAMUTABAQ REGISTER NO. 17 SAFFA ALLAF SERIAL NUMBER 25 PUR INDRAJ HOA”.[/B][/CENTER][/CENTER]  [CENTER][CENTER][B]Name of ASI – THANA xyz[/B][/CENTER][/CENTER]  Finally he returned me the stamped License, I asked him about the fee he said [B]“SIR JEE SARKARI FEES TO KOI NAHIN HAY MAGHUR HE HE HEEEE[/B]. So I gave him Rs.200/= for CHAI PANI which he kept in his pocket.

Hence, it''s beyond my logic that only Vikings [I]drop to the ground and break[/I]??!!!Come on, are we talking toys?\n\nThe ballistic recoil pressure is manifold any gravitational force bro, that the gun that breaks down by a simple drop during transportation, can''t get harmed by the use of it, as you mention there may be no QC issues with Baikal Viking??!!\n\nAlright, let''s [I]discuss[/I]. In my opinion, there''s more than just a QC issue Canik bro, there may be serious [I]design flaws[/I] even!\n\nI am of the opinion with respect to Vikings that it''s too "[I]tight[/I]" a gun. Everything is too  "snug" about it. The slide-to-frame fit, the recoil spring, the hammer reversal, the hammer drop even. Just try to drop a hammer on a Viking with controlled force. And just rack it back for loading up. You''ll know instantly what I''m talking about, you need to apply quite some force for this. Alright let''s move on, though these are my personal reflections, you may agree or not, but nevertheless this is what''s called a "discussion".\n\nIn order for a gun not to take up or [I]absorb [/I]too much of the recoiling forces, there needs to be some sort of a "play" in the thing somewhere. This will let the gun "vent out" somewhere, and also transfer more of the recoiling forces to the hand holding it. When everything is too "snug", rest assured, the mechanism and structure of the body take up most of the forces, probably causing the[I] after-use cracks[/I] mentioned.\n\n As for the NIB pre-used ones with cracks, well, that seems to be a QC issue with the materials used by manufacturer, no [I]transportation breakages[/I], as such, it''s not ''fragile glass", hopefully.\n\n Hence, we may have both things in combination about the Viking, design flaws and QC issues as well.\n\nI am of the opinion that the manufacturers are aware of these things, hence the frequent changes with the different models.\n\nI myself would like to see a finally perfect Viking model. So far, I agree with Chief''s blunt remarks, "dump it".\n\n\nRegards.', ''),

OR STILL AN ISSUE...?[/COLOR]\n\n(3)\nBUT HERE A MEMBER DURRANI SAID "[COLOR=#333333]one cracked frame and one busted barrel"\nso it means after using the weapon, the barrel busted and the cracked appears.\n[/COLOR][COLOR=#ff0000]AM I RIGHT................? Mr durrani[/COLOR][COLOR=#333333]\n\nIF YES, then how ...........?\n\n\n[/COLOR][COLOR=#ff0000]Now Mr Durrani is the first who claims it happens after using the weapon[/COLOR][COLOR=#ffa500][B] as Aquarius and bazkhan35 are saying, both saw cracks in NIB guns.[/B][/COLOR][/QUOTE]\n\n[QUOTE=Denovo87;253955]A discussion can always be stretched from earth to moon just for the sake of discussion but its vital to discuss objectively if something has to be established for the common interest/benefit.\n\nNow what''s wrong with Biakal MP-446 Viking''s frame ?  Let me explain here briefly how things are made, inspected & QC''d.\n\nEach individual parts is inspected after being made for tensile strength, sizing, finish, fit etc. There always are different testing/inspecting standards for different parts.\nEach part is again checked, inspected & tested on each stage once product starts getting assembled; mainly for fit n flawless function.\n\nNow plastics (polymers): There always are huge rejections in making plastic products; be it extrusion, molding (injection or pressed) or die casting; [B][COLOR=#b22222]no matter its Glock, Styer, S&W, Caracal, Taurus or who ever is the manufacturer[/COLOR][/B] . So the product is checked, inspected 100% for molding, extrusion or casting faults, to compensate this rate of rejection mostly plastic manufacturing department keep their production run up to 10% more than they are requisite for.\n\nNow crack in Viking''s frame: It without a doubt is an inspector''s overlook; pieces that had to go in rejection got slipped in the passed production. [B]We all know where Biakal is made and how slack is there QC thats the only reason they design their own guns having character of easy to make, lot less prone to manufacturing faults instead of making some [COLOR=#b22222][I]mongrel[/I][/COLOR] guns ;)[/B]\nThere can be lot different reasons of a hairline crack in a specific area but one thing is sure that its easy to spot n eradicate the consistently occurring manufacturing fault than something unusual n inconsistent, so hopefully this crack issue will be solved by manufacturer soon.  I am saying that being a manufacturer of soccer balls of Sig standard myself ;)\n\nAs 12G bro explained earlier, if plastic is not bonded at a specific place it will show from the very beginning giving a 2 eyed customer chance to avoid the rejected product.\n\nMy take on Viking (after cracking issue is high lightened):  a person considering a similar handgun can either;\n\n    [COLOR=#008000][B][I]a)[/I] Do the QC by himself while buying the gun (if he thinks he is capable of) and go home with a pure tank by his belt.[/B]\n[/COLOR]\n    [B][I]b)[/I] Go for something else made with stricter QC by paying extra for the expensive quality inspection job.\n[/B]\n\n[COLOR=#ff0000]I love Viking and be going for it when ever I got a chance [B]but not with my eyes closed[/B][/COLOR] ;)[/QUOTE]\n\n\nHats off to explanation.

It may be more now and the prices may vary depending on your city. My advice is stick to the main semi-auto suggestions most members are recommending because the only main advantage of Zigana F is it''s automatic function thats all, which means it will be illegal on your license.

As Denovo sb stated it goes through a quality check and should be caught/fixed there. A crack in the NIB gun, however small, may not be considered detrimental to the integrity of the frame so it may be passed or it just might be a mistake by the Quality Inspector.

(415728, ' [QUOTE=rajapaki;253924]@ Chauhdary Bro;\r\n\r\n  OK Brother; It was quite simple procedure. As you know I visited the Police Station on Thursday evening and the ASI said that he will call me on Friday but unfortunately there was no call. So I visited again yesterday evening and met him. He said that he could not check my case as he was busy but he was cooperative person and he approached to his officer (Sub Inspector) and tried to explain him my case but that guy said [U]“MUJHAY NAHIN PATA, YEH [B]MUHARRAR[/B] WAGHAIRA JANTAY HAIN, AGUR TUMHAIN NAHIN PATA TO KISI SENIOR MUHARAR SAY PATA KARO”[/U]\r\n  So the ASI called another [B]MUHARRAR[/B] somewhere in another station (I think at SSP office in ISB) and checked with him and finally asked me to wait outside of his office for a while and he will call me. After waiting for about 10 minutes his assistant came out and said is this your license and then asked me to come inside.   He, the assistant opened a Register No. 17 and started entering my license information and meanwhile asked me about the photocopies of the license and NIC which I gave him. He got stuck when he saw my residence address of Pindi on my NIC, then I explained him again that I changed my residence in XYZ Society in Islamabad and gave him the proof (copy of Society’s property transfer letter with the copies of utility bills). So he entered my new address in his register and fixed the police station stamp on the last page of my license where he wrote:  [CENTER][CENTER][B]“BAMUTABAQ REGISTER NO. 17 SAFFA ALLAF SERIAL NUMBER 25 PUR INDRAJ HOA”.[/B][/CENTER][/CENTER]  [CENTER][CENTER][B]Name of ASI – THANA xyz[/B][/CENTER][/CENTER]  Finally he returned me the stamped License, I asked him about the fee he said [B]“SIR JEE SARKARI FEES TO KOI NAHIN HAY MAGHUR HE HE HEEEE[/B]. So I gave him Rs.200/= for CHAI PANI which he kept in his pocket. Then I said thanks to them and left [FONT=Wingdings][FONT=Wingdings]J[/FONT][/FONT]  [FONT=Symbol]·         [/FONT][B]The whole process took me approx. 45 minutes.[/B]  [B][U]They raised the following questions during the whole process:[/U][/B]  1)- Are you staying by yourself at your given location? -  [I]I Said, Yes[/I].  2)- Why you are keeping the gun? - [I]I said, for home defense[/I].\r\n  3)- Where you will keep the Gun: [I]I said, at Home[/I].  4)- Do you know the Guns-SOP of Islamabad? – [I]I Said, Yes[/I].[/QUOTE]\r\n\r\nMubarkaaan....!!!', ''),

Don''t you think that its just a marketing gimik and an exagertation ?[/QUOTE]\r\n\r\nIts not just the barrel bro. a lot of factors come into play when you consider a shotgun for HD purposes.\r\n\r\nconsider this:\r\n\r\n1. a 26 or 28 inch barrel shotgun is too clumsy to lug around in tight and confined spaces such as in a house or a building\r\n\r\n2. a 26 or 28 inch barrel shotgun primary intended for hunting normally comes with bead sights for quick aiming at fast moving targets. however it doesn''t offer accuracy which is required at short distances. upto ten yards, you need a precise sighting system such as rifled or ghost ring sights to accurately engage at targets.\r\n\r\nRegards.', ''),

I''ll say, guides rods are not designed to take enormous amounts of pressure to begin with therefore there is no need for a heavy, solid metal guide rod. on the other hand, Baikal''s guide rod is designed (IMHO) in such a way to reduce the chances of spring buckling under load during cycling, possibly increasing reliability. which is a big time plus in my books.\n\nmoving on, Baikal''s trigger is the best in its class. no need to discuss it any further.\n\nmoving on again, Baikal''s chamber clearly speaks that its designed to fire something NASTY. barrel on the other hand is nothing out of the ordinary.\n\n[B]CZ 999 Scorpion:[/B]\n\na time proven design that has faced the most critique consumers and lived to tell the tale, The U.S. consumers.\n\na design that has seen war/conflict. the hardest of any tests. undergone changes afterwards. stating that the product matured or incorporated the lessons learned.\n\nThe hammer forged barrel of the CZ 999 Scorpion is thicker than Baikal MP446 Viking. after measuring both with a vernier caliper, I welcome anybody to reject my statement. another plus, it is chromed lined from inside and outside whereas Baikal''s barrel is chromed lined from inside only.\n\nThe rifling on CZ 999 Scorpion is deep and more profound than on Viking. I do not know what that means but I would rather have deep rifling. kinda gives an impression to me that such a barrel would have longer life. but thats only my guestimation. your mileage may vary.\n\nWhen it comes to handguns, barrel isn''t everything. frames are a big variable as well. Baikal''s frame is polymer reinforced with steel insert. so its steel on steel whereas on CZ 999 Scorpion, it is Steel slide on aluminum frame. not the strongest of setup as Steel on Steel will always be better than Steel on Aluminum. plus Polymer is maintenance free, where Aluminum is high maintenance.\n\nNow coming to controls, Baikal''s trigger is the best in its class but it ends here. there are other controls too. CZ 999 is supplied with an ambidextrous decocker, slide release and magazine release. this is a big time plus in my opinion. whereas baikal''s controls in my opinion are less than impressive.\n\n[B]Bottom Line (just my humble opinion, I''m not insisting on anything):[/B]\n\nIn my humble opinion, Baikal is all about durability whereas CZ 999 scorpion takes into consideration comfort as well. in my opinion, comfort and smoothness matters. I''m not saying that durability doesn''t. all I''m saying when we go to a store to buy a pair of boots, we buy the ones that are strong and comfy. why don''t we all go and buy something made of all metal/steel? strong as hell but would rip out feet to shreds. so why should firearms be any different. \n\nAny tool that we buy should be strong and comfortable as well. strength isn''t everything. otherwise we would all be wearing pants made of HDPE and boots made of fiber reinforced polymer or carbon steel instead of leather. a firearm is a complete package. you just cannot/should not focus on any two/three variables and forget the rest.\n\nHowever, your mileage may vary. this is just my personal opinion. if you desire durability to a point that comfort isn''t a necessary trait for you then by all means, Baikal is the way to go. there is no doubt about it. from durability standpoint, it is better than any CZ 999 at any given day. however if you desire a more complete package, CZ 999 offers a lot more than just durability so do look into it.\n\nin my humble and personal opinion you can do a lot more with CZ 999 than what you can do with Baikal from customization/accessory/repair standpoint.\n\nyou can make your own guide rods, similarly you can replace all major springs with commonly available spring in the market (slight modification may be necessary). you can also get quality Kydex holsters that fit a CZ 999 whereas with a baikal you are limited to cheap nylon holsters. did I mention that you can easily convert inexpensive beretta/sig magazines to CZ 999 Scorpion compatible magazines?\n\nRegards.[/QUOTE]', ''),

(415884, ' Almost all modern guns are capable of firing +P ammo. That, Sir, is a FACT!\n\nI emailed Canik55 after I bought my Piranha-F and asked a whole slew of questions. Included in them was the life of my barrel, if it was safe to shoot +P ammo, and would it effect my gun in any way. They replied by saying that my gun''s barrel life is 35,000 rounds, yes I can fire +P ammo, and if I''m going to use +P ammo exclusively then my barrel''s life would be reduced to 20,000 rounds. Using +P ammo does have a drastic effect on barrel life, but using such ammo is perfectly safe (as long as the manufacturer confirms it). Here''s another fact: Also, almost all armies across the world exclusively use +P ammo, which means guns like the CF98 (standard sidearm of the Chinese Army) and CZ999 (standard sidearm of the Serbian Army) are manufactured to be capable of firing +P ammo! All Canik guns are based on the CZ75 (which itself is used by almost half a dozen military units across the world) and are capable of firing +P ammo without any worries. Here''s another fact: Chinese Redbox ammo, which is so commonly available & used here in Pakistan, is +P ammo!\n\nJust keep in mind that using +P reduces barrel life, that''s the reason why usage of +P ammo is usually discouraged. But then again, when was the last time you heard of anyone firing more than 15,000 rounds from the same handgun! It all comes down to personal choice; if your gun is capable of shooting +P ammo and you want to try out some, then go right ahead. Heck, if you want to shoot +P ammo exclusively, then no harm done (apart from drastically reducing your barrel life and generally putting your gun through a lot of stress). \n\n\ni doubt seriously regarding above mention fact and figures. One other thing as per my limited knowledge Norinco offer only 3000 rounds barrel guarantee for CF98 pistol.', ''),

I''m asking coz there''s a lot of difference between a CZ 75B/Shadow and Pirhana''s weight.\r\n\r\nAlso, Ahnab Bro, the use of +p ammo does not only increase the wear on the barrel only, it also exerts pressure on the slide and frame(especially on the area which stops the rearward travel of the slide) and also wears out your springs more. Usually if someone tends to shoot +p ammo frequently or exclusively, it is recommended that the factory spring be replaced with one with a higher load rating. You are right in one point though, there are very few people who''d shoot the gun so much that it wears out, and occasional shooting of +p ammo would be ok in a full size handgun like the Pirhana.\r\n\r\nRegards.', ''),

It was sunny and hot at range with no one else to disturb our first date; so things from zeroing to different ammo test was a cool affair.\r\n\r\nI honestly had no intention to buy another .22 (as already have Erma .22lr semi auto) but an unbearable itch started with Avais bro''s new bolt action .22lr Brno acquisition. Requested "The Bond of Nilagumbad" (Naveed bro) to find me a .22mag (preferably a CZ) and he didn''t take more than 2 days to find a CZ 455 Lux ;).\r\nReason for choosing .22 mag simply is to have something between .223 & .22lr ( I know I know its a lame excuse but had create one to treat the itch ;) ).\r\n\r\nCZ 455 is newest rifle in CZ''s rimfire range that they developed as a multi caliber platform; like .22mag can easily be turned into .17hmr by just changing the barrel.

The both addresses (Current & Permanent) on my NIC is showing our Pindi address. You know very well that many people are having properties on rent in Islamabad but residing in other cities, so I think it was an important question from their side to make sure that I am residing by myself on the ISB-Address for which I am giving them the proof of residence.\n\n2)- Why you are keeping the gun? - I said, for home defense.\nWhat if you say Hunting and for HD (God-Forbid)????\nBrother; it is important to act as per the situation. It was a simple question and a simple answer [FONT=Wingdings][FONT=Wingdings]J[/FONT][/FONT], hunting in Islamabad is not allowed and I don’t have the Punjab hunting license yet. So instead of creating the fuss I gave them the short answer [FONT=Wingdings][FONT=Wingdings]J[/FONT][/FONT]\n  3)- Where you will keep the Gun: I said, at Home.\nDoes this mean it will stay at home permanently? What if you say I''ll take it with me hunting?\n  My answer of YES at Home is related to my above explanations. \n  4)- Will it be easy to enter/exit ISB now, or will the checkers still demand the DCO''s entry stamp or would it be more of a hassle than had you been having a DCO''s stamp?\n  Yes now it is easy for me to enter/exit Islamabad and hopefully the checkers will not create fuss. \n  Re to the DCO Entry Stamp, I am also confused.

(416162, ' [QUOTE=Kamranwali;254483]Salam All,\nA question..... is the Pirhana''s frame steel or aluminium alloy? I''m asking coz there''s a lot of difference between a CZ 75B/Shadow and Pirhana''s weight.\n\nAlso, Ahnab Bro, the use of +p ammo does not only increase the wear on the barrel only, it also exerts pressure on the slide and frame(especially on the area which stops the rearward travel of the slide) and also wears out your springs more. Usually if someone tends to shoot +p ammo frequently or exclusively, it is recommended that the factory spring be replaced with one with a higher load rating. You are right in one point though, there are very few people who''d shoot the gun so much that it wears out, and occasional shooting of +p ammo would be ok in a full size handgun like the Pirhana.\n\nRegards.[/QUOTE]\n\nYou''re absolutely right regarding the toll +P ammo takes on a handgun, hence it should be used sparingly (IMHO). I''m no firearms expert, but personally I wouldn''t recommend shooting +P on a regular/exclusive basis (although I guess a few, occasional rounds wouldn''t hurt).\n\nThe Piranha-F has an aluminum alloy slide & body. All Canik55''s, with the probable exception of the Stingray (which has a steel slide & frame) have aluminum alloy construction.', ''),

Can we compare Baikal MP153 with these 3 manufacturers?\n\n3)- What are the technical specs which makes MP153 superior than Hatsun Escort ?\n\nThe price difference between these guns is not very high, I can pay few thousands more and get the MP153. But when we start comparing we should discuss all aspects specially their technical specifications. \n\nThe main important is to have latest technology, durable and reliable weapon.\n\nIf someone at this forum cant satisfied me technically I can consider that this is a MIND SET only for MP153 as it is a Russian Weapon and the people in our country are impressed from long time for Russian Weapons.

(416185, 'Arsenal Double Barrel 1911 The AF2011-A1 Double Barrel Pistol comes actually as the very first industrial double barrel semiautomatic pistol of all times. The original idea came about ten years back to Swiss armourer Vivian Mueller, who at the time experienced cutting and welding together multiple parts of the famous Sig P210: the result was a long slide, double barrel 9mm, highly decorated collector piece, which indeed shot very well.\r\n\r\n[img]http://cdn5.thefirearmsblog.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/af2011_a_1_double_barrel_pi_stol_arsenal_firearms-tm-tfb.jpg[/img]\r\n\r\nOur idea took the challenge further: to commemorate the legendary Colt 1911-A1 in the Centenary by making a true industrial market-ready double barrel .45 caliber pistol. We achieved success in the brief span of 6 months, after intense and round-the-clock 3D designing, stereolithographic modeling and parts machining.\r\n\r\nThe gun can be handled by any shooter able to shoot with a .45 Acp and it is not only very pleasing, but very accurate and great fun. The AF2011-A1 holds amazing and surprising target performance for the shooter: in fact, it will group all the 8 double .45 caliber rounds (16 bullets) held in the duplex, single columns magazines, in a target of the size of an orange at 15 yards and of a water melon at 25.\r\n\r\nThe stopping power of the AF2011-A1 is tremendous: 2 bullets for a total of 460 Grains weight impacting at 1 to 2 inches apart (depending on the distance of the target) will knock down a bull, while the whole 18 bullets, for a payload exceeding 4000 Grains, can be delivered to the target in about 3 seconds.\r\n\r\nThe AF2011-A1 obviously features a number of very special parts, such as the single slide, the single frame, the single spur double hammer, the single grip safety, the single body double mainspring housing and the single double cavity magazine floor plate, the long and double magazine latch, the special barrel bushings and the hold open lever and side lever safety with long shafts: but the most interesting feature of the new pistol which we strived to keep during the development of the project, is the interchangeability of most internal parts, which come as standard 1911 replacement parts. These include the firing pins, the firing pins plates, the sears groups, the triple springs, the inner parts of the mainspring housings, the recoil springs and recoil springs rods, the magazine bodies and inner parts, the sights (including after market adjustable sights) the grips and grips screws and bushings.\r\n\r\nThe AF2011-A1 ("Twenty Eleven" for aficionados) can be ordered either with 2 independent triggers and one sear group (left or right, with user-interchangeability for right or left operations) or with 2 triggers permanently joined and the choice of 1 or 2 sear groups. The AF2011-A1 is available in mirror finish Deep Blue or with a 3400 Vickers surface hardness White Ash Nitrite coating.\r\n\r\nCourtesy: [url]http://www.thefirearmblog.com/blog/2012/03/12/arsenal-double-barrel-1911/[/url]', ''),

We praise stoegar, Canic and Zigana but are reluctant to say good word for Hatsan. For thise who compare baikal with Ak47, please be advised that ak47 though is durable but least accurate beyond 100 meters and malfunctions after extensive session. Because pure steel and alloys have different heating points ( as per my knowledge). \nI have heard that baikal patters not as good as hatsan do even with inserted chokes.\nIf durability is the only concern, then barrel is not the thing which bears the load, its the chamber(correct me if i am wrong). Anf hatsans chamber absorbs 40% of the force to recoil 10% by its shock absorbing pads. If wodden furniture cant withstand extensive firing, then its not a big deal to get them replaced by a good gunsmith. \nAgain coming back to ny point considering my less usuage and purpose, baikal is heavier and hard to find pre 2011 models whereas hatsan is the same for all models.', ''),

Not only people of Pakistan are already suffering immense sense of insecurity but the terrorism is the biggest enemy and threat to the integrity of our country as well.[/FONT][FONT=Georgia !important]\nAs regards, the plea to secure the ruling elite, it may be remembered, that they are already enjoying protection free of charge from the soldiers of Para-military forces, commandoes and police in more than required numbers. On the contrary, what is more important and deserving is the security of the life and properties of ordinary citizens. This is the paramount duty of the State as guaranteed under Article 9 of our Constitution\n\n[/FONT][FONT=Georgia !important]The policy of the Government to encourage and promote private security agencies, are capable of assuming the role and shape of private armies and impinge upon the privacy of the citizens as well. It must be noted that the private armies are clearly forbidden under Article 256 of the Constitution. Despite, this clear constitutional prohibition, we witness huge number of licensed and unlicensed private arm groups under one garb or pretext or the other. By promoting these private security agencies, the governments are implying that they have failed to discharge their basic obligation to protect life and property of ordinary citizens.\n[/FONT][FONT=Georgia !important]\nAnother pertinent question arises as to why should lawyers alone be favoured with a blue passport and licences to possess assault weapons. Why not the same privilege is granted to all other professional bodies. After all their contribution in the society is not less than the lawyers. I would advise all professional bodies to hurriedly invite Mr. Rehman Malik, (before he changes his mind) as their chief guest on any pretext, praise him so much that he is swayed to pronounce the same privileges to the members of the respective bodies.\n[/FONT][/B][FONT=Georgia !important][B]\nAssuming, if all other professional bodies are treated at par with the lawyers community, which will be in accordance with the Constitution and all of them are granted &#8220;Blue Passports&#8221;, then an amusing aspect would emerge that colour of most of the Pakistani passports will change from &#8220;Green&#8221; to &#8220;Blue&#8221;, which is the colour of the ordinary passports of Indians.\n[/B]\n[URL]http://blogs.thenews.com.pk/blogs/2012/03/09/implications-of-blue-passports-and-black-kalashnikovs/[/URL][/FONT][/quote]', ''),

[SIZE=3][FONT=arial][COLOR=#000000]Since I was in kindergarten, our teacher used to make us write essays on topics Quaid-e-azam, Fatima Jinnah, Allama Iqbal, and General Zia-ul-haq. But none of them could be called as my ideal personality. My ideal personality is ‘Shaitaan’. Some call him Iblees, Satin or Devil. It has many names. I know it’s a sin to idealize him. But we all are committing this sin without even realizing it. An ideal personality is the one whose footsteps we follow. Just think about it for once, do we follow the footsteps of Quaid or Allama Iqbal? NO. Do we do what they told us to do? NO. Then why we always lie about it and teach our children to do the same. Satin was God’s most favourite angel but when he refused to obey God’s command he was cursed by GOD and angels. Then he promised God he will misguide all human beings till the end of time and look he is fulfilling his promise look at his determination. And we are puppets in his hands. Whatever he promised to do he is doing it no matter what. That’s what is called determination. We humans always look at the negative side of the picture if we are truly idealizing him and following his footsteps, why don’t we follow his strong will and determination. We just curse him when something bad happens instead of fighting him. If we just accept our faults and perceive everything positively we can change the meaning of life.[/COLOR][/FONT][/SIZE]', ''),

What makes baikal superior than Escort whereas Escort is made on state of the art cnc machines with skilled labor. We praise stoegar, Canic and Zigana but are reluctant to say good word for Hatsan. For thise who compare baikal with Ak47, please be advised that ak47 though is durable but least accurate beyond 100 meters and malfunctions after extensive session. Because pure steel and alloys have different heating points ( as per my knowledge). \nI have heard that baikal patters not as good as hatsan do even with inserted chokes.\nIf durability is the only concern, then barrel is not the thing which bears the load, its the chamber(correct me if i am wrong). Anf hatsans chamber absorbs 40% of the force to recoil 10% by its shock absorbing pads. If wodden furniture cant withstand extensive firing, then its not a big deal to get them replaced by a good gunsmith. \nAgain coming back to ny point considering my less usuage and purpose, baikal is heavier and hard to find pre 2011 models whereas hatsan is the same for all models.[/QUOTE]\n\nGood review brother; that''s the technical point which we need to discuss.', ''),

(416403, ' IMHO (which is way too humble in presence of heavily experienced and well-learned participants here), weapon for SD/HD is a necessity of life these days even more than our cell-phones ...\n\nJust a remark from my mom last night made me post my comments in this thread ... I was ready to go to bring [I]roti [/I]for me from a near-by [I]tandoor [/I](which is just 2 minutes away from my home, walking), I took my wallet and my cell-phone and she said, just take Rs. 20 out of your wallet and do not go outside with your wallet and cell-phone, street crimes are high these days ... \n\nThis fear of my mom was not only bcuz of the on going street crimes but also two incidents happened within family which led us to be more cautious and made me purchase my akdal semi-auto shotgun for HD and stoeger cougar 9mm for HD/SD. one of such incident is related below.\n\nMy younger brother, with his better-half, was going to Lahore from Faisalabad back in Nov-10 and at raiwind road his car was stopped by a blue Liana. Time was around 8.15-30 pm. Some 4-5 people came out of the car, and two of them started walking towards his car. Distance between the cars was around 15-20 feet. One went for passenger door and one went for driving seat. By that time, these two had already withdrew their pistols. My brother tried to push-forward the car but the guy at the right side tapped the bonnet with his gun and he stopped. Meanwhile, the guy on the left side tried to open the door of bhabhi side but it was locked. My brother at once started reversing the car at the full speed. His car was already on the edge of the road, half on road and half on side-way. BGs started firing straight at the car but my bro does not remember if he heard any bullet hitting the car. His plan was to reverse the car to get out of the deadly firing range and then turn the car on wrong side and flee but there was an electric pole behind, which, ofcourse, he could not see and car rammed in it badly. BGs were coming towards the car and he had no other option but to run them over. He asked her wife to sit tight bcuz she was in pain from a sudden jerk she sustained when car hit (she was not wearing seat belt but by brother was). He forwarded the car at the full speed he possibily could and he says that he still remembers the BG on right side aiming and firing at the car but he does not remember any sound of any bullet hitting the car. He says BG might be trying at tyres or whatever. Some of the BGs had to jump to save them from hitting and he fleed. Stopped at the near-by CNG station, called police and all went fine after that. When he came back home (Rwp) tomorrow morning in the same car and we checked the car for bullets we found out that one bullet hit the front grill, went into battery, missing a wire with just one mm, exited making a big hole (kind of bursted), damaging two cells of battery and no trace after that for bullet. No other mark of bullet hit was found. Car didn''t start after that and we had to replace the bettry to get it started. Gave sadqa for the new lives of our brother and sister and thanked God for his grace upon our family. And now, we have a loaded handgun in our easy reach when driving outside. Pictures of the car from back side are attached to analyze the speed in which he was reversing his car. \n\nHe wishes that he had gun at that night so that he could take one or two BGs. And this incident make us feel that gun is the necessity these days than luxury. I didn''t buy a luxurious tip-top mobile just to buy my handgun.\n\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]9128[/ATTACH]\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]9129[/ATTACH]\n\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]9127[/ATTACH]\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]9125[/ATTACH]\n\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]9126[/ATTACH]', ''),

(416472, 'Camera gun would let &quot;harmless hunters&quot; get killer wildlife shots [img]http://images.gizmag.com/hero/killshot.jpg[/img]\r\n\r\nNot too long ago, brothers Randy and Michael Gregg were out on a hunting expedition. It was the day after deer season had ended, yet they spied a handsome animal bedded down in the snow. Not wanting to pass up an opportunity, they silently crept up on their quarry, raised their rifle, lined the deer up in the crosshairs ... and then took a picture through the scope with a mobile phone. That photo provided all the proof they needed that they had successfully stalked their prey, without bringing home an illegally-obtained carcass. It also inspired them to create the Kill Shot photo/video-recording rifle.\r\n\r\nCurrently still in the development phase, the Kill Shot would simply be a replica hunting rifle, that takes pictures instead of firing bullets. Users would sneak up on their quarry and get them in the crosshairs as per usual, but pulling the trigger would cause a digital camera - built into the scope - to grab a time- and date-stamped snapshot. That camera could also zoom, and record video.\r\n\r\nImages would be saved to a memory card, that would mount in the same location as an ammunition magazine on a real rifle. A USB port would allow users to download their photos or footage onto a computer, where they could be shared with other no-kill hunters.\r\n\r\nThe Gregg brothers, along with their other brother, Daniel, see several possible applications for the Kill Shot. For starters, it could simply be used by people who like the idea of tracking down wild animals in nature, but who don''t want to kill them - the Greggs aren''t stuck on the name "Kill Shot," by the way.\r\n\r\nIt could also be used as a means of training novice hunters, without the dangers of using live ammunition. Additionally, they suggest that it could be used by regular hunters for "hunting" animals outside of season - although this could lead to some interesting run-ins with game wardens. As a side note, Randy himself works as a park ranger in Pennsylvania.\r\n\r\nThe three brothers are currently raising funds for prototype and commercial development of the Kill Shot (or whatever it''ll be called) on Kickstarter. A pledge of US$150 will get you one, should they ever see production.\r\n\r\nWhile some people might find the idea of a combination camera and rifle kind of ... well, silly, it is not unprecedented. The 1980s TV series Max Headroom depicted mercenary news videographers wielding RR-7 Gun Cameras, while Russian camera company KMZ used to produce a product known as the Photosniper - a very rifle-like stock and trigger, which an SLR body and lens could be mounted onto.\r\n\r\nCourtesy: [url]http://nomanshah.com/blog/camera-gun-would-let-harmless-hunters-get-killer-wildlife-shots/[/url]', ''),

(416497, '300 Savage Introduced and developed by Savage Arms company for their Model 99 lever-action rifle in 1920, the 300 Savage was later chambered in the Savage Models 20 and 40 bolt actions. The 300 Savage was intended as a cartridge that would work through medium-length actions and deliver ballistics similar to the 30-06. Remington chambered it in their Model 81 autoloader, 760 slide action and 722 bolt action. The cartridge achieved considerable popularity, but has lost out to the superior 308 Winchester.\r\n\r\nThe 300 Savage provided lever-, slide-action and semi-auto fans with performance close enough to the 30-06 to make rifles of this type useful for almost all American big game. It is not fully adequate for moose or brown bear, but it is a fine deer and elk cartridge. It is far better choice than the 30-30 for deer under any conditions. The 308 Winchester fulfillos the same funtion as a short-action cartridge and has somewhat more power, so it has gradually replaced the 300 Savage. However, there are many thousands of 300 Savage rifles in use, and the cartridge will continue to be loaded for quite a few more years. In a bolt-action rifle, it is as accurate as any other 30-caliber and lends itself to small game and varmint shooting, which off course increases its usefulness.', ''),

(416513, '300 Winchester Magnum This cartridge was introduced in 1963 for the Winchester Model 70 bolt-action rifle. Rifles chambered for the 300 Winchester Mgnum have since been introduced by most American and European manufacturers.\n\nThe 300 Winchester Magnum arrived as something of an anti-climax, because everyone even remotely interested in guns had been predicting it from the day the 338 Winchester Magnum was brought out back in 1958. The 30-338 wildcat quickly followed, and both it and the 308 Norma Magnum are practically the same thing. The newer 300 Winchester magnum has a slightly longer body (by about .12-inch) and the shorter neck than any of its predecessors. According to principles of moders cartridge design, this short neck would be considered a poor feature. It means the heavy bullets will have to project back into the powder space quite a bit. Whether Winchester just wanted to be sure their round was different than everyone else''s or made the body longer so owners of 30-338 or 308 Norma rifles could rechamber to the new cartridge is anyone''s guess. Because all are belted cases, it would probably be all right to shoot the shorter rounds in the longer Winchester chamber, naother advantage of the slightly longer body. This would fire form the brass to the new dimensions for subsequent reloading. In any event, the 300 Winchester Magnum is a very fine long-range big game cartridge in the same class as the 300 Weatherby and suitable for any North American species.', ''),

[/B]\nThat''s the price in USA, would be more costly in Pak even if it is available. This model you''re talking about is Gamo Whisper - Silent cat, Gamo Whisper X is locally available though not very much liked.\n\n[B]900fps is good enough with recommended scope[/B]\nThe scope comes with the combo that website is offering, you can''t buy it online from PK. If you buy a gun from here, no such combos exist, so you''ll have to get the scope separately.\n\nSecondly, the 950fps is [B]exaggerated[/B], I repeat again exaggerated. Gamo and almost all other airgun manufacturers have a trend of hiking the velocities of their guns to make a spot in the market. I remeber people on PG bought Chinese under-lever airguns thinking they''re 750fps as claimed, but in reality the velocity hovered around 400-500fps.\nIt clearly says on the top of the page that it''s 950 fps with PBA pellets. Now let me tell you what PBAs are. They''re steel pellets made by Gamo, 5-8X more expensive than the normal lead pellets commonly available. They''re totally in-accurate and not at all suitable for hunting, and accuracy is king in airguns.\nUsing 14gn lead pellets (the most common ones like Gamo, Diana, Crosman domed or pointed or whatever), this airgun achieves 710-715fps the max. On the other hand, the Diana 34 spring is much more durable and longer-lasting than these Gamo springs which break after a couple of thousand shots.\nThe 34 will achieve +-730 fps with the same pellets. This variation is not something to write home about.\n\n[B]Diana 34 classic recommended by Chaudhary, its good but .22 is 750 fps as yours recommended has 950fps in .22[/B]\nAlready answered this in my previous paragraph.\nDiana airguns are durable, tough and reliable. Many users of Gamo Whisper are dis-satisfied with their gun''s performance. \n\n\nGo to the market for recce, check out the prices, see all guns personally and then get the one which you like better.', ''),

Interesting thing was almost all species were there especially in the evening 2 hr session - Mallard, Garganeys, Gadwalls, Pintails, Teals, Wigeons, Shovelers & Pochards (few).  The abundance of shoveler flocks roaming around and arrival of very vocal Garganey flocks indicates that it is almost the last leg of duck spring backmigration...I maybe wrong..hopefully..The waterfowl waves should at least last till 25th-30th Mar this time due to cold waves in Pb/KPK. In the almost full moonlight, the flocks were good in numbers and responding well to decoys surprisingly, and now in the dwindling (waning) moon, reports are already stagnant and I am wondering whether the flocks would go for one final hike in the last spell maybe. But indicators are negative as of now (today)....Any differing views on that?\r\n\r\nSecondly, if you look at the duck (migration) shooting here in Punjab, there is a very very small shooting window (time) available, either during autumn migration (arrival) or spring backmigration (return), and even out of those few weekends, many weekends are lost due to cloudy/overcast and rainy spells. As compared to this, in many areas abroad, a very long mid season is available. This is is due to NO habitat (mainly food sources) available here during Winters, except the reserve areas which are mostly out of bound for ''almost'' all. This gives another complex dimension to duck shooting here, and thats one of the reasons why almost all areas on rivers/marshes etc are flooded with gunners and hides everywhere during that small shooting window.\r\n...One cannot blame hunters like a discussion got started here at some thread in recent past! The habitat and situations are dicey and unstable and many times it takes a lot of luck too to get a decent outing out of the hunt trips.', ''),

My search started again and after having fired a couple of other guns the Norinco NP34 (sig 228 clone) seemed to have the perfect grip. An exhaustive search through lahore, islamabad and peshawar ended up short and I never found one.

(416731, '307 Winchester The development of the rimmed 307 Winchester apparently began in 1980, with the first public announcement in December, 1982. However, the cartridge and the Model 94 XTR Angle Eject carbine chambered for it were not actually on the market and available until early 1983. The Marlin Model 336ER in 307 chambering was introduced at about same time, but is no longer offered. The Angle Eject feature is a design modification of the beefed-up Model 94 XTR that ejects spent cartridge cases to the side rather than straight up, which was the way they excited in all of the earlier Model 94 actions. This was accomplished bu changing the position of the extractor and ejector and lowering the right receiver side wall slightly.\r\nThe 307 caliber designation is simply to avoid confusing this cartridge with some of the other 30 calibers, and it actually uses standard .308-inch bullets. The 307 Winchester is essentially a rimmed 308 Winchester, although there is a difference in the overall cartridge length and case thickness. The original factory loadings had 150-and 180-grain bullets. \r\n\r\nThe popular Model 1894 Winchester lever action has always suffered from three major deficiencies: It was not strong enough to handle modern high-pressure cartridges; the design did not allow proper center mounting of a scope sight; and the tubular magazine required the use of flat-point bullets to prevent one cartridge from setting off others in the maganine under recoil. These combined to relegate the Model 1894 to largely short-range woods and brush use. The new XTR Angle Eject redesign eliminates at least two\r\nof the shortcomings and modernizes an old, but popular action. \r\nThe 307 Winchester will certainly enhance the range and power of both Winchester and Marlin lever-action rifles so chambered. It is, based on factory ballistic figures, more powerful than the 30-30 by some 375 fps increase in muzzle velocity . Although the 307 Winchester has the same general configuration as the rimless 308 Winchester, differing primarily in the addition of a rim, there are certain slight differences that prevent it from achieving the full power of the 308. For one thing, the bullet is seated slightly deeper to maintain an overall length compatible with the length of the Model 1894 action, and the case is made thicker than the 308, all of which reduces the powder capacity by about 6 percent. The result is that in nay given barrel length, with the same bullet weight, the 308 will deliver approximately 60 to 110 fps greater velocity at the muzzel. Also, with its pointed bullet, the 308 will loose velocity at a slower rate than the 307 flat-point and this will give it a greater edge as the range increases.\r\nIt may be possible to chamber and fire 308 cartridges in 307 rifles, but that is a distinctly unsafe practice that could result in damage to the rifle and possible injury to the shooter.\r\nThe 307 has only slightly less velocity at 200 yards than the 30-30 has at 100 yards. If the 30-30 is an adequate 125-yard plus deer cartridge, then the 307 is certainly a 225-yard deer cartridge with the additional possibility of taking larger game at moderate ranges. It is not likely to replace the 30-30 as America''s favourite deer cartridge for many years, if ever, but it is more versatile cartridge and certainly takes the Model 94 carbine out of the woods, bush and short-range class.', ''),

(416733, ' very nice comparison but the main thing is availability and that much more power makes a huge difference.', ''),
(416734, ' In 1887 the Stevens Arms Co. developed the ultimate in .22 rimfire cartridges, the .22 Long Rifle. This used the .22 Long case with a 40 grain RN bullet loaded to higher velocity than the 29 grain Long bullet. It shot flatter and hit harder than any of the previous .22 rimfires except the .22 Extra Long, whose performance it essentially duplicated in a shorter case, and it was more accurate than that cartridge.\nThe .22 Long Rifle caught on, was adapted to both rifles and pistols, and became the most popular sporting and target shooting cartridge in the world. After the advent of smokeless powder a High Velocity version of the .22 LR was introduced, which further extended the .22 LR''s superiority as a small game hunting cartridge.\nModern .22 LR target ammunition is loaded to a MV of about 1085 fps with a 40 grain RN bullet. .22 Long Rifle High Velocity cartridges drive a 40 grain copper-plated bullet at a MV of 1255 fps and ME of 140 ft. lbs. from a rifle barrel. For small game hunters, most manufacturers offer a 36-37 grain copper-plated lead hollow point bullet at about 1280 fps (Remington figures). This load expands nicely and makes for quick kills on small game, given proper bullet placement.\nBecause of its popularity there are many permutations of the .22 LR cartridge. One of the more useless is the .22 LR shot cartridge, which fires a pinch of very fine #12 shot. This load is used, among other things, to collect very small creatures, mice and the like, for museum displays. This is not a hunting load, as it is ineffective for use even on very small birds beyond about 10 feet.\nFar more useful are the Hyper Velocity .22 LR loads pioneered by CCI in the form of the Stinger. These use lightweight hollow point bullets at increased velocity for flatter trajectory and dramatic expansion. Remington followed suit with their famous Yellow Jacket load, and the idea was subsequently picked-up by most other manufacturers. The CCI Stinger drives a 32 grain GLHP bullet at a MV of 1640 fps with 191 ft. lbs. of ME.\nIn 1890 the .22 Winchester Rim Fire (WRF) was introduced. This cartridge is loaded with a 45 grain, flat point, inside lubricated bullet with a full diameter heel, rather than the tapered heel bullet of the .22 LR. The .22 WRF fires a .224" diameter bullet, just like modern centerfire .22s and the later .22 Magnum (WMR). At one time a 40 grain HP bullet was also available, but it has since fallen by the wayside.\nRemington called this cartridge the .22 Remington Special, and loaded it with a 45 grain RN bullet. The .22 Rem. Spec. and .22 WRF are the same cartridge and are interchangeable.\nThe .22 WRF is a good small game cartridge, superior to the .22 LR. CCI loads the ammunition, and Winchester does an occasional run of .22 WRF. Modern CCI ammo is loaded to a MV of 1300 fps and ME of 169 ft. lbs.\nToday the .22 WRF is kept alive primarily as a less destructive small game load for rifles chambered for the .22 WMR cartridge. The .22 Magnum is a lengthened version of the .22 WRF and will chamber in firearms designed for the .22 WMR, much as .38 Special ammunition may be fired from .357 Magnum guns, although it will not function correctly in autoloaders.\nIn the early 20th Century a pair of cartridges about the same size and offering about the same ballistics as the .22 LR were introduced. These were designed for use in autoloading rifles, used smokeless powder and inside lubricated bullets, and in that respect are a more modern design than the .22 LR. However, as soon as the established .22 LR was universally converted to smokeless powder, the .22 Auto cartridges became superfluous.\nThe .22 Winchester Automatic cartridge was designed for their Model 1903 autoloading rifle (discontinued in 1932). Ammo was produced into the 1970''s. Remington''s .22 Automatic appeared in their Model 16 autoloader. That rifle was discontinued in 1928, and the ammunition was not loaded after the Second World War. Although similar, these two cartridges differ dimensionally and are not interchangeable.\nJump to 1959, the year Winchester introduced their very successful .22 Winchester Magnum Rimfire (WMR). This cartridge pushes the limits of pressure possible with a rimfire case given the limits of contemporary metallurgy. The .22 Magnum was initially offered with 40 grain FMJ and JHP bullets at an advertised MV of 2000 fps from a rifle barrel and 1550 fps from a pistol barrel. Due to its high velocity, .22 WMR cartridges are loaded with jacketed bullets.\nThe .22 WMR is based on a lengthened version of the .22 WRF case, like that cartridge uses standard diameter .224" inside lubricated bullets, and remains to this day the most powerful .22 rimfire cartridge ever. It has been adapted to many types and brands of firearms, and .22 WMR ammunition is loaded by all of the major rimfire ammunition manufacturers and is very widely distributed.\nAs good as the .22 WMR is as a rifle cartridge, I feel that it is even better as a revolver cartridge. It offers velocity and trajectory similar to the centerfire magnum pistol cartridges at a fraction of the recoil and cost. Convertible revolvers, supplied with both .22 LR and .22 WMR cylinders, are the ultimate in versatility for plinking, small game hunting, and varmint shooting.\nToday the .22 WMR is available with bullet weights ranging from about 30 to 50 grains, and CCI loads a shot shell version. The standard Winchester 40 grain JHP bullet is now loaded to a rifle MV of 1910 fps with ME of 324 ft. lbs. The various 30-40 grain JHP bullets are best for varmint hunting, but are overly destructive on small game intended for the dinner table. A better choice in that case are the heavier 45-50 grain bullets intended for small game hunting, or the use of .22 WRF ammo when possible.\nThe .22 WMR is the newest, commercially successful, .22 rimfire cartridge (so far). With .22 rimfire cartridges now available from the BB Cap to the WMR, the field seems pretty well covered. Recent rimfire development has concentrated on lighter, smaller caliber bullets that can achieve higher velocity within the existing pressure limits. The .17 HMR, based on a necked-down .22 Magnum case, is the best example.\nRimfire cartridge design is limited by the fact that the brass case rim must be weak enough to be crushed by the blow of the firing pin. This severely limits the permissible maximum pressure and thus the performance of the cartridge. I suspect that the advent of more potent .22 rimfire cartridges will depend on the future development of more advanced case materials.\n\n\n\n25 ( 6.35mm ) Automatic Pistol\n\nIntroduced in the United States in 1908 with the Browning-designed, Colt-manufactured, 25 Vest Pocket Automatic Pistol. It was introduced in Europe a few years earlier in the F.N. Baby Browning, which is practically identical to the Colt. The design of these two pistols has been copied by manufacturers all over the world and literally dozens of different pistols have used this cartridge. The original Browning is still made ( for European consumption ), but Colt did not resume manufature of their model after WWII. Beretta, Galesi, Astra, Star and others also make 25 automatic pistols. The 25 Automatic has fairly high elocity for such a amall cartridge. However, the energy it delivers at any range is quite low, and this, combinedwith the full-metal jacketed bullet, adds up to very poor stopping or killing poweron anything. The 22 Short rimfire with the hollowpoint bullet is a better killer and will infact a more serious wound than the 25 Auto. In fact, small semi-auto pistols chambered for the 22 Short rimfire cut sales of the 25 Auto for a time. The 22 Short is much cheaper, too. The 25 auto is not powerful enough for hunting anything but sparrows or rats, nor is it adequate for serious self defence. However, the 25 semi-auto pistols are popular because of their small size. Their principal usefullness is as a threat, because no one wants to get shot if it can be avoided, even with the little 25. The 25 Auto has one adantage over the 22 Short in that being a rimless case, it feeds and functions more reliably in automatic pistols.', ''),

Interesting thing was almost all species were there especially in the evening 2 hr session - Mallard, Garganeys, Gadwalls, Pintails, Teals, Wigeons, Shovelers & Pochards (few).  The abundance of shoveler flocks roaming around and arrival of very vocal Garganey flocks indicates that it is almost the last leg of duck spring backmigration...I maybe wrong..hopefully..The waterfowl waves should at least last till 25th-30th Mar this time due to cold waves in Pb/KPK. In the almost full moonlight, the flocks were good in numbers and responding well to decoys surprisingly, and now in the dwindling (waning) moon, reports are already stagnant and I am wondering whether the flocks would go for one final hike in the last spell maybe. But indicators are negative as of now (today)....Any differing views on that?\n\nSecondly, if you look at the duck (migration) shooting here in Punjab, there is a very very small shooting window (time) available, either during autumn migration (arrival) or spring backmigration (return), and even out of those few weekends, many weekends are lost due to cloudy/overcast and rainy spells. As compared to this, in many areas abroad, a very long mid season is available. This is is due to NO habitat (mainly food sources) available here during Winters, except the reserve areas which are mostly out of bound for ''almost'' all. This gives another complex dimension to duck shooting here, and thats one of the reasons why almost all areas on rivers/marshes etc are flooded with gunners and hides everywhere during that small shooting window.\n...One cannot blame hunters like a discussion got started here at some thread in recent past! The habitat and situations are dicey and unstable and many times it takes a lot of luck too to get a decent outing out of the hunt trips.[/QUOTE]\n\n\n Wow nice hunt bro. Very nice bag too.

And, thats exactly what I was refering to: That after last Sunday 12th March, due to cold wave (maybe), huge duck waves have suddenly come to stop & scarce pockets are now there, even in Chashma upstream as well as downstream. I am well aware of the position there in that belt as well as South Punjab of DIK and Taunsa as well as Jhelum (Rasul upstr/downstr) and Chenab (Qdbd upstream and surroundings). The reserve areas or sanctuaries are an exception though.\r\nThe Sind hunting parties are having a v gd time these days which shows ducks are still in South of Pakistan in quite a handsome qty still, and hv yet to migrate North. It is our guess too...that ducks will certainly show a second boom...but I saw several flocks of Garganies (you can see Garganies in my recent pic) decoy point blank in our spreads and the Shoveler flocks were really abundant, which probably shows the LAST LEG of migration...isnt it...becoz these 2 bird r the last to migrate?? One fact is: Pintails have not been seen in bulk yet like last year and the pics from Sind are still showing Pintails being hunted. So maybe a second boom is expected...the current situation is not encouraging though. Qs is: Keeping all that in perspective, when will the SECOND DUCK BOOM be witnessed here (approx)... In the next moon...or in the next heat waves (i.e. sudden rise in temperatures)??', ''),

(416930, ' [QUOTE=Trigger_happy78;255177]@ Francolino bro. The issue I have with duck shooting is the amount of lead that you have to give on a bird. The most difficult is the crossing duck which is decoying. I agree with you on the area thing.[/QUOTE]\r\nOhh...the ''crossers'' (left to right and R to L) are the ones bothering you. Is it? Which cartrg and choke are you using. The gun is Urika2 (Opt) I guess. I would suggest IC choke + 6# Shaheen regular cartrg. The spread will be to your advantage and #6 lead shell has enough penetrating power for a duck. So...keeping this cartrg/choke pellet spread in mind, crossers shd not be a problem if you shoot just a 1''-1.5'' ahead of bird with a fluid gun swing keeping the swing maintained after firing. The common problem we all make in such shots is: that we stop the swing and start looking for second bird to take down in a hurry. Actually ducks when decoying give ample time for 3-4 shots and all shd be fired with lot of patience..''sakoon se barrel mila ke'' as they say. I had several multiple 3-4 bird hits (dead drops) in my last 2 shoots which I enjoyed thoroughly. Hurried shots are what cause ducks to go by scot free. Thats my humble observation and suggesion. Mian Mobin (H1) can throw further light on that as he is an avid duck hunter himself.', ''),

I would suggest IC choke + 6# Shaheen regular cartrg. The spread will be to your advantage and #6 lead shell has enough penetrating power for a duck. So...keeping this cartrg/choke pellet spread in mind, crossers shd not be a problem if you shoot just a 1''-1.5'' ahead of bird with a fluid gun swing keeping the swing maintained after firing. The common problem we all make in such shots is: that we stop the swing and start looking for second bird to take down in a hurry. Actually ducks when decoying give ample time for 3-4 shots and all shd be fired with lot of patience..''sakoon se barrel mila ke'' as they say. I had several multiple 3-4 bird hits (dead drops) in my last 2 shoots which I enjoyed thoroughly. Hurried shots are what cause ducks to go by scot free. Thats my humble observation and suggesion. Mian Mobin (H1) can throw further light on that as he is an avid duck hunter himself.[/QUOTE]\n\nYes that''s the problem in having. The crossing ducks esp the R to L. I use M with #6 and IC with #4.

(417089, ' 1-1.5 foot lead at approx distance 25-30 yds.\r\n\r\nNo...#5 I hv not used. But at ducks, IC with regular #6 cartrg is good enough. The optimachoke makes v gd patterns with IC. You don''t need a tighter choke. Mod choke is too tight & not required in my opinion. You''ll feel an advantage with IC and #6 regular cartrg at all crossing shots, provided approx lead of 1''-1.5'' is maintained.\r\nI am using LM (Skeet2, Lt Mod) extended Briley X2 choke (mobil) with #6 regular, and its working perfect for me at ALL ranges with very uniform as well as dense patterns. In last season, I was using Mod with #4 regular cartrg, and in that brief  few weeks, my (hitting : firing) ratio was very poor. Probably that combination was throwing patterns with holes (open patches)in them. Then as soon as I switched cartrg and choke, it made an enormous difference.

Anyways when I bought the clone while I was in Pak I never got a chance to test it due to my busy schedule and it remained new in the box for over a year. Afew days ago my cousin tested it and told me over the phone that it was a complete let down. Disappointingly it kept miss-firing etc. He rang the dealers who we purchased it from. As we are on friendly terms with him he said bring it down to our factory and we will get it sorted out. This morning they took it to their factory in peshawar n they changed the spring and afew other parts and got it sorted out. was told its firing OK now. But here comes the interesting bit. He told me their new production batch that they now make is being sold around in the market as the original ones because they are producing exact identical clones. Not not only that they are even putting computerised numbers on them. Then they sell them to different dealers for anything between 20-25K a piece and the dealers are then selling them in the markets for anything between 30 to 40K. Its not a rumor but confirmed news or info. They told him all that themselves this morning. So just be aware.', ''),

In last season, I was using Mod with #4 regular cartrg, and in that brief  few weeks, my (hitting : firing) ratio was very poor.

(417299, 'Opinions on 9mm 1911''s Salaam & Greetings everyone!\n\nThis is more of a question to satisfy a curiosity of mine. I''ve read online of a few 1911''s appearing chambered in 9mm. Smith & Wesson, Dan Wesson, Kimber, Springfield Armoury and Taurus are some of the names offering the 1911 platform in 9mm. Massad Ayoob reviewed one by Springfield Armoury and said that it performed just like the "puritanical" version of the  1911, except it had a nominal recoil ("bump like a .22", to quote the man) and was, therefore, an excellent gun to run at the range.\n\nNow, I know that a lot of people believe that a 1911 is [B]only[/B] a 1911 if it''s true to John Browning''s vision & design (i.e. chambered in .45ACP). Personally, I think it''s a pretty decent deal; you get an excellent and proven system in the form of the 1911, have comparatively very manageable recoil and can run a buck load of reasonably priced ammo. I wanted to know, if such a 1911 were available, would it be a good buy? Would appreciate your comments and opinions.', ''),

(417511, ' @Mig\nBro, the price of the 9mm version is the same as the .45ACP. Mag capacity is higher of the 9mm (8 .45ACP rounds vs 9 9mm rounds). And yes, 9mm ammo is comparatively much cheaper then .45ACP, so it''s kinda ideal for bulk practice, giving you more range time at a cheaper price. The big bonus, ofcourse, is that the 9mm has a lower recoil than the .45ACP, making target reacquisition quicker, easier on the wrists, and making it a much more manageable platform to run. All in all, it sounds like a pretty decent deal to me.', ''),

(417608, ' [QUOTE=francolino;255250]Ohh...the ''crossers'' (left to right and R to L) are the ones bothering you. Is it? Which cartrg and choke are you using. The gun is Urika2 (Opt) I guess. I would suggest IC choke + 6# Shaheen regular cartrg. The spread will be to your advantage and #6 lead shell has enough penetrating power for a duck. So...keeping this cartrg/choke pellet spread in mind, crossers shd not be a problem if you shoot just a 1''-1.5'' ahead of bird with a fluid gun swing keeping the swing maintained after firing. The common problem we all make in such shots is: that we stop the swing and start looking for second bird to take down in a hurry. Actually ducks when decoying give ample time for 3-4 shots and all shd be fired with lot of patience..''sakoon se barrel mila ke'' as they say. I had several multiple 3-4 bird hits (dead drops) in my last 2 shoots which I enjoyed thoroughly. Hurried shots are what cause ducks to go by scot free. Thats my humble observation and suggesion.

Now if cartridges are being manufactured according to Saami Specs, is it safe to shoot them thru these barrels or my understanding of whole issue is wrong?[/QUOTE]\nFinally i was able to get answer of my above query. Actually, barrel has been hydraucally tested at 65MPa. This means that barrel weakest part ie muzzle end can hold this pressure. This implies that the chamber area can bear pressure much greater than this value as wall thickness is three times the muzzle end wall thickness. Peak pressure happens in the chamber area after 0.5millisecond of triggering while the load exits muzzle after 1.5 millisecond. Upto this time the peak pressure of the order of 9000~8000psi lowers upto 1000psi. So my gun pressure rating is more than safe.', ''),

Interesting thing was almost all species were there especially in the evening 2 hr session - Mallard, Garganeys, Gadwalls, Pintails, Teals, Wigeons, Shovelers & Pochards (few).  The abundance of shoveler flocks roaming around and arrival of very vocal Garganey flocks indicates that it is almost the last leg of duck spring backmigration...I maybe wrong..hopefully..The waterfowl waves should at least last till 25th-30th Mar this time due to cold waves in Pb/KPK. In the almost full moonlight, the flocks were good in numbers and responding well to decoys surprisingly, and now in the dwindling (waning) moon, reports are already stagnant and I am wondering whether the flocks would go for one final hike in the last spell maybe. But indicators are negative as of now (today)....Any differing views on that?\n\nSecondly, if you look at the duck (migration) shooting here in Punjab, there is a very very small shooting window (time) available, either during autumn migration (arrival) or spring backmigration (return), and even out of those few weekends, many weekends are lost due to cloudy/overcast and rainy spells. As compared to this, in many areas abroad, a very long mid season is available. This is is due to NO habitat (mainly food sources) available here during Winters, except the reserve areas which are mostly out of bound for ''almost'' all. This gives another complex dimension to duck shooting here, and thats one of the reasons why almost all areas on rivers/marshes etc are flooded with gunners and hides everywhere during that small shooting window.\n...One cannot blame hunters like a discussion got started here at some thread in recent past! The habitat and situations are dicey and unstable and many times it takes a lot of luck too to get a decent outing out of the hunt trips.[/QUOTE]\n\nNice Hunting And Nice Bag Sir...............', ''),

What''s more, the slide had completely frozen up, and no amount of force could move it (so now I couldn''t even rack the slide to eject the bad round). Fortunately, the slide had stopped at the exact spot where it needs to be in order for the gun to be disassembled. So I took the gun apart (after wrestling with the slide for almost 20 minutes before it finally budged) and then had to use a rifle''s cleaning rod to force the stuck round out of the chamber!

I myself once suffered a near-traumatic experience when an Armscor JHP round (the fourth round I ever fired!) got stuck in the chamber of my gun (causing the slide to go out of battery). What''s more, the slide had completely frozen up, and no amount of force could move it (so now I couldn''t even rack the slide to eject the bad round). Fortunately, the slide had stopped at the exact spot where it needs to be in order for the gun to be disassembled. So I took the gun apart (after wrestling with the slide for almost 20 minutes before it finally budged) and then had to use a rifle''s cleaning rod to force the stuck round out of the chamber! This whole experience scared me to such an extent that, since then, I''ve never fired a single JHP from my gun! :p[/QUOTE]\n\nBro same thing happened to me.

(417811, ' [QUOTE=Denovo87;255518]Perfectly explained by bothers Steve & Skeeter; trigger control is what everyone needs to master. I myself am a living example of bad trigger puller, no matter how much I concentrate on sights my bad trigger squeeze always put my shots low.[/QUOTE]\r\n\r\nDenovo87, please allow me comment so you might rid yourself of the low shots.  \r\n\r\nIt''s not trigger control that''s causing your shots to go low.  Nor is it sighting or stance or grip in the traditional sense that grip is how you hold the gun.\r\n\r\nYou are doing something else.  Something you should should not be doing.  The holes are low because the barrel is pointed there, where the hole is. \r\n\r\nYou pointed the gun there.\r\n\r\nStop pointing the gun there. \r\n\r\nTo stop pointing the gun low you will need to know why you are pointing the gun low.  It might be called "pre-ignition push"  or "flinch" or "anticipatory action;" but no matter the name, just before the shot is fired, you point the gun down.  I don''t know if you are afraid of the recoil/blast or are trying to hold the gun flat, but stop it.\r\n\r\nMaybe these words will help.  Your job is not to make the gun go band.  You don''t direct the shot to happen at any particular moment in time.  Instead, your job is to press the trigger slowly.  Press the trigger with no anticipation or expectation that the shot will happen.  When the shot does happen it should come as a bit of a surprise.  \r\n\r\nAlso, try to pay attention to how the good shots feel.  They feel different than bad shots.  You can feel yourself push the gun down if you are open to it.  You can feel when you don''t push down also.  Try to let/make the shots feel the way they do when you don''t push down.\r\n\r\nAlso, dry fire.  Dry firing trains you to press the trigger with no other actions.  You are doing some other action.  Train yourself to do nothing more than stand there, gripping the gun, sighting and pressing the trigger.\r\n\r\nHope that helps.', ''),

(417816, ' Saw one in the basement shops of Nila Gumbat lately. The guy was asking 90k for it. But I think its a clone.', ''),
(417817, ' In this discussion it may help to expound a bit more on importance and most important and how important.\r\n\r\nIn reviewing the four fudnamental of shooting a handgun we have:\r\n\r\n-Stance\r\n-Grip\r\n-Sighting\r\n-Trigger Manipulation\r\n\r\nAll can be important while not being equal... here''s what I mean:\r\n\r\nIf you are off balance or uncomfortable in your stance, you will likely not shoot well.  However, it is easy to stand comfortable and balanced.  You''ve been doing it for decades, you do it every day.  Don''t make it a big deal.  Just get comfortable and balanced and forget about it.  If your stance is wrong in an extreme (like uncontrolled falling over or causing great pain) then you will never shoot well.  But again, it is easy to stand comfortably.  I can shoot good fast shots standing on one leg, even on one leg while slowly falling over (unbalanced) or in an uncomfortable position if I line up my sights and press my trigger well.\r\n\r\nGrip is simply holding onto the gun.  There is no good science which proves that any one grip is better than another and people have shot and continue to shot well using different grips.  So grip isn''t all that important if you have positive control over and the comforting sense of contol over the gun.  Like stance, you can have an extremely unconventional grip which might cause problems. but most people can find a good enough grip easily that will have little negative impact on their shooting.  So, just stand there and grip the gun.\r\n\r\nSighting is important.  If we allign the sights 5" to the left of the bullseye, that is most likely where the bullet will land.  We quickly and easily (intuitively) allign the sights.  We know very bad sighting and when it looks pretty good.  Most people will unfortunately fuss their sights to the point of frustration and then just slap the trigger to make the shot happen when for a moment the sight picture looks correct.  But, they moved the sights far more with that horrid manipulation of the trigger than their wobbly or shake in their sighting ever did.\r\n\r\nThis leaves us trigger manipulation.  Unlike, seeing and standing and holding the gun which comes rather naturally and can be learned or understood easily; pressing the trigger is not easily intuited.  It has to be practiced the most to be executed well. \r\n\r\nThat is why I opine that trigger manipulation is most important to accuract shooting.  \r\n\r\nThe next time you shoot, reflect on this.  Note how natural it is to stand, and how easy it is to look at the sights and allign them.  The ergonomics of the gun largely forces your hands into a way of holding the gun and it will work just fine... then comes that ackward press of the trigger.  Holding something is natural and intuitive.  Seeing is natural and intuitive.  Standing is natural and intuitive.\r\n\r\nBut that vexing trigger press... not so natural and intuitive of an act.\r\n\r\nImprove your trigger manipulation and you improve your shooting.', ''),

It’s a primal right of manhood, up there with NFL football, beer and buffalo wings. Yet, picking out a pocket knife is harder than all three of these fundamental man-skills.\r\n\r\n[b]Why is picking out a pocket knife so tough?[/b]\r\nBecause the pocket-knife market is filled with thousands of different models in a dizzying array of shapes, sizes, blades and brands. There are clip-point blades, tanto blades and drop-point blades, stainless-steel blades and carbonsteel blades, serrated blades and non-serrated blades, not to mention Swiss Army knives with enough tools and attachments to aid your escape from a maximum security prison.\r\n\r\n[b]What’s a knife lover to do?[/b]\r\nWell, aside from buying every knife you see (not a bad idea if you have the dough), the best approach to finding the right pocket knife is to know A TON about them. Since you don’t have time to do that research, here is the guide !\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[b][size=+2] CHAPTER 2: WHATS YOUR PLEASURE ?[/size][/b]\r\n\r\n\r\nDo you spend most of your time playing bridge and drinking virgin daiquiris? That’s great; don’t buy a pocket knife, buy a lap dog.\r\nBut, if you’re a hunter, fisherman, hiker, carpenter or jack of all trades, you’ll need a pocket knife.\r\n\r\nThe only question is which one. Take a second to look at the following activities and check off the ones you do on a consistent basis. If it’s five or more, you’re in need of a pocket knife.\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i914.photobucket.com/albums/ac350/mig_gunner/1.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\n\r\n[b][size=+2]  CHAPTER 3: HOW MANY BLADES ?[/size] [/b]\r\n\r\nWhen it comes to pocket knives, less is more, except for sometimes when more is more and other times when it totally doesn’t matter. Now that you’re thoroughly confused, let’s break down the differences between single-blade and multi-blade options.\r\n\r\n[u][b][size=+1] SINGLE BLADE POCKET KNIVES[/size][/u][/b]\r\n\r\nSingle-blade pocket knives come in many shapes and sizes, but their best quality is their simplicity and their size. Unlike multi-blade pocket knives, single blades usually come with a spring-loaded opening mechanism, allowing them to pop open at a second’s notice.\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i914.photobucket.com/albums/ac350/mig_gunner/SingleBladeKnife.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\nEven those with conventional opening mechanisms are free from the hassle of prying open numerous knives and attachments.\r\n\r\nOf course, the disadvantage of a single blade is it lacks variety. These knives are perfect for all-purpose tasks, but if you’re in need of, for example, a serrated blade and a non-serrated blade, you’re out of luck.\r\n\r\n\r\n[b][u][size=+1]MULTI BLADE POCKET KNIVES[/b][/u][/size]\r\n\r\nVariety. It’s what gives life spice and what enables you to have one\r\npocket knife that can do the job of two or three.\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i914.photobucket.com/albums/ac350/mig_gunner/MultiBladeKNife.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\nMulti-blade pocket knives generally have either two, three or four blades. Two-blade models tend to feature a combination of either a sprey, sheepsfoot, pen or drop point blade.\r\n\r\nHowever, three or four-blade models not only include a variety of knife blades, but also come with additional features, like a saw, bottle opener, pick, screwdriver and more.\r\n\r\n\r\n[b][size=+2]CHAPTER 4: SWISS ARMY KNIVES AND MULTI TOOL[/b][/size]\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i914.photobucket.com/albums/ac350/mig_gunner/swiss_army_knife1.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\nBlades, saws, toothpicks, tweezers, can openers, nail files, scissors, corkscrews and magnifying glasses are all common features of Swiss Army knives and other multi-tools, which are the most multi-dimensional pocket knives on the market.\r\n\r\nThe Swiss Army knife, which was invented by Swiss manufacturer Karl Elsener in the late 19th century, gained much of its popularity after the war, when returning soldiers purchased the knife in high numbers.\r\n\r\nToday, these knives come in a huge variety of shapes and sizes, ranging from three attachments on basic models to the 87-tool “Giant,” which was created in 2006.\r\n\r\nOther multi-tools—such as Leathermans—pack the same sort of punch, though they’re usually a bit heftier to carry.\r\n\r\n\r\n[b][size=+2]CHAPTER 5: MODELS OF POCKET KNIVES[/b][/size]\r\n\r\nThrough the years, different pocket knives have been graced with all sorts of names. If you’re in the market for a new pocket knife, it’s essential you’re up on the lingo. Here’s a breakdown of some the top models out there.\r\n\r\n[b][u][size=+1]BARLOW KNIFE[/b][/u][/size]\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i914.photobucket.com/albums/ac350/mig_gunner/Case_Barlow.jpg[/IMG]\r\nThe Barlow knife was especially popular with farmers in the early 20th century; it was also the favorite blade of author Mark Twain. A Barlow knife typically has two blades and a long bolster. The handle is long and slender and can be made with a variety of materials; expensive Barlow knives often have handles made of\r\nelaborately carved ivory.\r\n\r\n[b][u][size=+1]CONGRESS KNIFE[/b][/u][/size]\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i914.photobucket.com/albums/ac350/mig_gunner/congress-knife-3.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\nThe congress knife has a convex front with either a straight or concave back and usually four blades. The blade combinations vary from knife to knife, but one common combination in congress knives is a spear point, coping, sheepsfoot and pen blade.\r\n\r\n[b][u][size=+1]CANOE KNIFE[/b][/u][/size]\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i914.photobucket.com/albums/ac350/mig_gunner/canoeknife.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\nCanoe knives get their names, predictably, from the fact that they resemble canoes that were used by Native Americans. A canoe knife is equipped with either two spear-point blades or one spear-point blade and one pen blade.\r\n\r\n[b][u][size=+1]ELEPHANT''S FOOT KNIFE[/b][/u][/size]\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i914.photobucket.com/albums/ac350/mig_gunner/elephants-foot-knife.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\nAn elephant’s foot knife is one of the biggest pocket knives on the market, often measuring between four and five inches. The elephant’s foot knife usually contains two exceptionally wide blades, often a spear and pen blade.\r\n\r\n[b][u][size=+1]STOCKMAN KNIFE[/b][/u][/size]\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i914.photobucket.com/albums/ac350/mig_gunner/StockmanKnife.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\nThe stockman knife is a stellar blade for carrying for everyday use, as it is lightweight and has three different blades, typically clip, spey and sheepsfoot blades. The body of a stockman’s knife is usually straight, although occasionally it may come in either a serpentine or sowbelly shape.\r\n\r\n\r\n[b][size=+2]CHAPTER 6: POCKET KNIFE BLADE SHAPES[/b][/size]\r\n\r\nAll blades are not created equal, especially when it comes to pocket knives. Whether you’re purchasing a single-blade pocket knife or a multi-blade model, it’s important that you know the blade types in your knife. Here’s a quick and easy cheat sheet.\r\n\r\n[b][u][size=+1]CLIP POINT[/b][/u][/size]\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i914.photobucket.com/albums/ac350/mig_gunner/clip-point-serrated-gator-knife.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\nThe clip point is one of the most popular blades in circulation today. The back (unsharpened) edge of a clip point has a concave shape, designed to make the tip sharper. This creates a “cut out” area that can be straight or curved..\r\n\r\nClip-point blades are great for everyday needs, but can also be used for hunting. Their sharp, narrow tip is especially good for cutting narrow spaces.\r\n\r\n[b][u][size=+1]DROP POINT[/b][/u][/size]\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i914.photobucket.com/albums/ac350/mig_gunner/DropPoint.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\nDrop-point blades are usually found on hunting or survival knives, but they can also be found on some larger models of Swiss Army knives.\r\n\r\nThough not quite as sharp as the clip point, the drop point is another great all-purpose blade. The dull section of the drop-point blade runs straight from the handle, eventually sloping down gently to meet the sharpened edge and forming the point.\r\n\r\nDrop points aren’t as sharp as clip-point knives, but they’re ideal for skinning, because they have a large belly and a controllable point that makes it easier to avoid nicking internal organs.\r\n\r\n[b][u][size=+1]SPEAR POINT[/b][/u][/size]\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i914.photobucket.com/albums/ac350/mig_gunner/SpearPoint.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\nOn a spear-point blade, both edges rise and fall equally to create a point that lines up perfectly with the center of the blade. Spear-point blades have an extremely sharp point that is good for piercing, though only if both edges are sharpened.\r\n\r\nSpear-point blades can be single or double-edged. They do have a small belly, but aren’t nearly as well suited for slicing as drop-point or clip-point blades.\r\n\r\n[b][u][size=+1]SHEEPSFOOT BLADE[/b][/u][/size]\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i914.photobucket.com/albums/ac350/mig_gunner/SheepsfootBladeKnife.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\nIf you’re clumsy with a knife, do yourself a favor and get a sheepsfoot blade. Though ideal for cutting and slicing because of its flat cutting edge, a sheepsfoot blade has a dull point that makes it difficult—though not impossible—to injure yourself.\r\n\r\nSheepsfoot knives are popular among emergency responders, as they allow them to slice away at seatbelts and other restraints without stabbing the victim by accident.\r\n\r\n[b][u][size=+1]PEN BLADE[/b][/u][/size]\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i914.photobucket.com/albums/ac350/mig_gunner/PenBladeKnife.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\nThis tiny blade is often found on Swiss Army knives and is best suited for small tasks. The dull and sharp sides of the blade slope at the same degree, making it appear similar to a spear point.\r\n\r\nThese knives were previously used for sharpening a quill in order to\r\nmake writing instruments. Though not exceptionally sharp, a pen\r\nblade is a great tool to have in your pocket.\r\n\r\n\r\n[b][size=+2]CHAPTER 7: POCKET KNIFE LOCKS[/b][/size]\r\n\r\nWhat’s a pocket-knife lock? It’s the mechanism that assists your pocket knife during opening and prevents it from snapping down onto your arm accidentally. Pocket knives rely on four primary lock\r\ntypes. Without further ado, here they are:\r\n\r\n[b][u][size=+1]LINER LOCK[/b][/u][/size]\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i914.photobucket.com/albums/ac350/mig_gunner/LinerLock.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\nThe liner lock is the peanut butter and jelly of the pocket-knife world. There’s nothing spectacular about it, but it gets the job done.\r\n\r\nThe liner lock works with one section of the liner angled toward the inside of knife. From here, the liner is only able to go back to its old position with manual force, thereby locking it into place.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, the tail of the liner lock is cut to engage the bottom of the blade under the pivot. If the user wants to disengage the lock, he has to manually move the liner to the side away from the blade bottom.\r\n\r\n[b][u][size=+1]FRAME LOCK[/b][/u][/size]\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i914.photobucket.com/albums/ac350/mig_gunner/FrameLock.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\nA frame lock works by utilizing the handle to assist in folding the knife. The frame lock is positioned with the liner inward and the tip engaging the bottom of the blade. It’s released by applying pressure to the frame; when opened, the pressure on the lock forces it to snap open across the blade.\r\n\r\n[b][u][size=+1]BACK LOCK OR LOCK BACK[/b][/u][/size]\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i914.photobucket.com/albums/ac350/mig_gunner/BackLock.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\nThe back lock is one of the most basic and earliest used pocket-knife locks. It works when a locking arm, which sits along the handle spine, is molded with a hook that fits into a notch on the back of the blade behind the pivot.\r\n\r\nThe hook is dragged by tension from the back spring into the notch, locking the knife with a snap.\r\n\r\n[b][u][size=+1]MID LOCKS[/b][/u][/size]\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i914.photobucket.com/albums/ac350/mig_gunner/MidLock.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\nIn exhibitions by the knife company Cold Steel, mid locks have refused to buckle under hundreds of pounds of pressure, impressing many knife owners. Mid locks resemble back locks, except for the fact that the release mechanism is in the middle of the handle spine as opposed to near the butt end of the knife.\r\n\r\n[b][u][size=+1]RING LOCKS, TWIST LOCKS[/b][/u][/size]\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i914.photobucket.com/albums/ac350/mig_gunner/RingLock.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\nRing locks are cheap, long lasting and easy to use. These locks work when the owner turns a ring wrapped around the pivot of the knife to a position where a break in the ring allows the blade to open. After the blade is open, the ring must be turned again, so that the space through which the blade was opened is blocked.\r\n\r\n[b][u][size=+1]LEVER LOCKS[/b][/u][/size]\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i914.photobucket.com/albums/ac350/mig_gunner/LiverLock.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\nA lever lock is locked by a pin near the pivot bolster, which is inserted into a hole drilled in the base of the blade. When the pin is through the hole, the blade is locked either open or closed. Lever locks are often used on automatic knives, such as switchblades.\r\n\r\n[b][size=+2]CHAPTER 8: BLADE MATERIALS[/b][/size]\r\n\r\nPocket knives are primarily made of two blade materials: stainless steel and carbon steel. Knives with 12.5% chromium or more are generally considered stainless steel, while those with lower chromium levels are considered carbon steel.\r\n\r\nThe advantages and disadvantages of each steel could be debated for hours, but here are a few of their distinctive traits.\r\n\r\n[b][u] ADVANTAGES OF CARBON STEEL[/b][/u]\r\n\r\n-- well suited for hunting\r\n-- harder than stainless steel\r\n-- stays sharper longer\r\n-- more durable in abusive conditions\r\n\r\n[b][u] ADVANTAGES OF STAINLESS STEEL[/b][/u]\r\n\r\n-- ideal for survival situations\r\n-- easier to sharpen\r\n-- more resistant to rust\r\n-- better in wet conditions (especially saltwater)\r\n\r\n[b][size=+1]ADDITIONAL BLADE MATERIALS[/b][/size]\r\n\r\n[b]High Carbon Stainless Steel:[/b] A fusion of stainless steel and carbon steel, this combination metal has the best attributes of both steels, making it a durable and stain-resistant metal.\r\n\r\n[b]Damascus Steel:[/b] Named after the city of Damascus in Syria, damascus steel is known for its exotic beauty. Damascus steel likely originated in India or Sri Lanka. The Japanese used damascus steel for their Samurai swords and the Germans used it during World War II.\r\n\r\nDamascus steel was introduced into the knife-making community in the early 70s and since then has steadily grown in popularity. Damascus steel’s cutting strength is on par with stainless steel, but its fascinating beauty has made it a favorite of knife collectors.\r\n\r\n[b][size=+2]CHAPTER 9: BLADE HANDLES[/b][/size]\r\n\r\nA high-quality blade handle is important to ensure that your grip stays tight on your pocket knife. Here are a few popular blade handles.\r\n\r\n[b][u]ALUMINUM:[/b][/u] Lightweight and often coated with a protective film, aluminum is frequently used in newer knives. It provides excellent grip and is especially suitable for knives that will be used in harsh weather conditions.\r\n\r\n[b][u]CELLULOID:[/b][/u] This synthetic plastic is made from cellulose nitrate and is known for its ability to morph into any color of rainbow. Celluloid can also be fabricated to resemble most natural materials, such as: ivory, horn, stag, pearl, amber, agate, tortoise shell and wood.\r\n\r\n[b][u]BONE:[/b][/u] Another popular type of pocket knife handle, bone comes in a number of varieties, such as: giraffe bone, jigged bone (often called stag), scored bone and smooth white bone.\r\n\r\n[b][u]WOOD:[/b][/u] Wood handles come in numerous forms. Stabilized woods are soft woods, like buckeye and burl, which must go through a stabilization process to make them hard enough to function as knife handles. Other woods that are commonly used for knife handles are: blackwood, box, elder, bubinga, curly maple, koa, rosewood, snakewood and thuyas.\r\n\r\n[b][u]G10:[/b][/u] An extremely durable material, G10 is made of fiberglass, which is soaked in resin and compressed before being baked. G10 is strong, but also lightweight. It is water-resistant and handles well in inclement weather. For this reason, G10 is often used for tactical and survival knives. It is most commonly black, but can have other shades as well.\r\n\r\n[b][u]MICARTA:[/b][/u] Micarta is also known for its toughness, though it is not quite as hard as G10. A composite constructed from cloth or paper and phenolic resin, Micarta is especially popular in the plastic industry. Canvas micarta is frequently used in knife handles. It comes in either yellow or tan, though after it ages it will turn to a red/brown.\r\n\r\n[b][size=+2]CHAPTER 10: NOW YOU ARE OFFICIALLY READY TO BUY A POCKET KNIFE[/b][/size]\r\n\r\nIf you’ve made it this far, you’ve learned virtually everything—if not more—that you need to know to purchase a top-quality pocket knife.\r\n\r\nSo, what are you waiting for?\r\n\r\nGet out there and find your perfect pocket knife, whether it’s a 147-attachment multi-tool or a drop-point burly enough to skin a bear.\r\n\r\n\r\n[b]REGARDS[/b]', 'Pocket knife Buying Guide'),

(418034, ' I think I was born with the love for the Guns. Always loved guns since my childhood. If saw one with any one in a wedding or generally I simply couldnt get my eyes off them and would stare at them non stop. Then at the age of 13 fired a pistol (a .22) for the first time in my uncle''s wedding, The excitement and the buzz of that was next level. But my dad heard the gunshots, came outside and griped me with the pistol and got so mad that he smashed the pistol against the wall 5 or 6 times untill it was basically ruined. After wards I secretly took it to a gunsmith and got it fixed.  For the following 3yrs after that I regularly swipered that gun from the bedroom cupbaord in our house and carried it discretely. When turned 16, bought my first .30 Pistol (local made) for Rs, 1100 (brand new) and had it till I left Pak. Unfortunately the year I moved to the UK, the same year all Handguns were banned in the UK, and those who had them their licenses and guns were revoked after the Dunblane Primary School Massacre by some old Psyco Man who shot school kids and then himself and messed things up for innocent law abiding gun enthusiasts like myself.\n\nEven though the main purpose is Self and Home Defence but I wouldnt be wrong if I was to call myself abit of a collector aswell.', ''),

(418064, ' [QUOTE=shahvonder;252548]AoA.... has anyone tried S&W SW9VE any comments suggestions.???[/QUOTE]\n\nS&W SW9VE is from sigma family and is a nice gun in its class. Remember, guns are like machines with multiple interacting parts and reliability/durability depends on design, material used and tolerance among moving parts. If Bursa & Charter Arms or local made is 2 or 3 on scale of 1 to 10 and Browning & Glocks are 10, then you can put 9VE easily at 6 or 7.\n\nI consider it as a good design and reliable gun as long as you don''t intend to put 500 rounds through it every weekend. It fits well into medium to small hands. Trigger is little long but one can get used to it.\n\nIt is not the best of the best but it is not junk either. I would not hesitate to carry one on me at any time. I am not sure about the comment of Afgan Army buying it in bulk. In my experience, no matter how poor a nation is, when it comes to ordering through someone else pocket, always a high end weapon is bought regardless how much it costs.

(418070, 'Florida Law. &quot;Stand your ground&quot; [B](CNN)[/B] -- Trayvon Martin went out to buy some  Skittles -- and was shot dead before he made it home. The case is  horrifying, maddening, grotesque. And -- perhaps worst of all -- there  may be nothing Florida law enforcement can do about it.\n As the world now knows,  the 17-year-old Martin walked to a store in Orlando to buy some snacks  on the night of February 26. George Zimmerman, a volunteer Neighborhood  Watch captain, thought the boy looked suspicious and called 911. The 911  operator told Zimmerman to keep his distance -- police would be sent --  but there was a confrontation between Zimmerman and Martin. Martin was  killed with a single shot to the chest. Florida authorities have not  arrested Zimmerman, and federal authorities recently joined the  investigation.\n\n\n [B]The legal question at the  heart of the case involves Florida''s so-called "stand your ground" law,  which the legislature passed, at the behest of the National Rifle  Association, in 2005. Before that time, Florida law resembled that of  most other states; during confrontations, individuals had a duty to  retreat rather than to respond to provocations. Under the new law, a  person is allowed to use deadly force if he is in a place he has a right  to be and feels reasonably threatened with serious harm.[/B]\n\n\n In this case, then, the  question is whether Zimmerman was in such a place and felt reasonably  threatened. The 911 operator told Zimmerman to keep his distance from  Martin, but Zimmerman had a right to be on the street. That''s where  neighborhood watch volunteers work.\n  \nClearly, the question at  the heart of the case is whether Zimmerman reasonably felt threatened.  On this issue, the evidence currently seems murky. There appears to have  been some sort of confrontation between Zimmerman and Martin. Police  found Zimmerman with an injury to his head. Most important -- and most  tragic -- the police will hear only one side of the story about this  confrontation. Trayvon is not around to tell his story. The continuing  investigation will surely focus on finding other witnesses.\n\n\n The facts of this case  show why the "stand your ground" law is so important. The law focuses on  the subjective understanding of the shooter. Was his understanding of  the situation "reasonable"? Ultimately, that would be a question for the  jury to decide, but it still gives a lot of deference to the  perpetrator of a violent act.\n\n [B]The new law even allows a disproportionate  response; if someone comes at you with a fist, you can reply with a  gun.\n[/B]\n[B]In light of the shift in  the law, it''s not surprising that since the law went into effect,  reports of justifiable homicides have tripled, according to the Florida  Department of Law Enforcement.\n\n[/B]\n\n Another case under  litigation in Florida highlights the effect of the law. In September  2010, David James was playing basketball with his 8-year-old daughter on  an outdoor court in Valrico. A boy was skateboarding on the court at  the same time, and Trevor Dooley, a man who lived in the area, told the  boy he shouldn''t be skateboarding there. James stood up for the boy, and  he and Dooley had a confrontation.\n Dooley was carrying a gun  and wound up shooting James dead. Dooley asserted that he felt  threatened by James, and has asked that the case be dismissed before  trial under the "stand your ground" law. (The judge will soon make a  ruling.)\n In both of these cases  -- in the deaths of both James and Martin -- the legal defense for the  shooters appears to rely almost completely on the "stand your ground"  law. In the death of David James, prosecutors are doing their best  against tough odds. In the death of Trayvon Martin, it''s prosecutors who  are taking the heat for failing, thus far, to bring any charges against  George Zimmerman.\n But this outrage,  understandable though it is, might be directed somewhere else as well.  The Florida legislators who voted for the "stand your ground" law -- and  Gov. Jeb Bush, who signed it -- have something to answer for as well.\n\n[url]http://edition.cnn.com/2012/03/20/opinion/toobin-trayvon-martin/index.html?eref=igoogledmn_topstories[/url]\n\n\nI am guessing this law will be under review in the coming years. Some thoughts on both the pro''s and con''s of this law implemented come to mind.', ''),

Thing which you should be aware of the quality of one piece lock down mounts. I have a leapers gun with RWS mount, and it has exactly same size as of the dovetail rail on DIANA airguns. Recently a friend of mine bought a single piece lockdown mount for his 350 Magnum, and guess what, the mount had two problems:\r\n\r\n1. It was atleast 1"smaller than the dovetail rail, but still fitted perfectly\r\n2. There was no frontal elevation in the mount, which is a very important.\r\n\r\nIf you get a one piece mount, prefer using RWS or DIANA, which should match the length of dovetail rail & should have an "arrow marking" on the front side, indicating direction of elevation. \r\n\r\n\r\nP.S. Do note that the low quality mount was purchased from DIANA''s authorized dealer in Dubai :(\r\n\r\nBelow are pictures for your comparison.', ''),

And yes, 9mm ammo is comparatively much cheaper then .45ACP, so it''s kinda ideal for bulk practice, giving you more range time at a cheaper price. The big bonus, ofcourse, is that the 9mm has a lower recoil than the .45ACP, making target reacquisition quicker, easier on the wrists, and making it a much more manageable platform to run.

(418545, ' @Kamranwali\nI actually love the 1911 platform, both aesthetically and in terms functionality. It''s just that I feel, being a century old design, it could do with a bit of a face life. :)\n\nWell, this is just a personal opinion, but I think some of the following 1911 features need a bit of an update:-\n1) Replace the trigger bow with the newer, more stable trigger bar\n2) Replace the old 2-piece hinged extractor with the modern single piece extractor (make it an external extractor, while you''re at it)\n3) The feed ramp should be a standard feature\n4) Get rid of the linked system and make it link-less\n\nNow I''m not saying that these features are bad, I''m just saying that some of these features were updated in John Browning''s next masterpiece, the Hi-Power, so it''s only logical that a 100-year old design should also "evolve" with the times. The irony is that, if you ask a 100 people about the 1911''s reliability, 50 will swear that it''s the best handgun ever made, and the other 50 will say that''s it''s an utter piece of crap. I doubt there''s any other gun in the world that sparks a heated debate like a 1911! :)', ''),

If you would give me your contact details and would let me know from which city you would like to buy the gun from I will let you know the dealer who is carrying Caracal in the area and I would really like to know if he is trying to sell for more than 900 USD. As per comparison goes Caracal is a premier gun and sells in duty free areas at the cost between 500 to 600 USD. I am sure your knowledge of Guns also tells you that apart from other import/ custom complications  the duty structure on the guns is near 90 percent so you cannot compare the price of duty free country with the highest duty paid country with hundreds of complications. One example is that the Glock in USA sells for 499 USD and in pakistan it sells for Approx 2500 USD.

But despite that, personally, I''d shell out the extra money and go for the Taurus because of the following reasons:-\n\n1) The Taurus is lighter and (being a single stacker) thinner, making it [B]much[/B] more carry-friendly\n2) The Taurus has a [B]much[/B] better & refined finish, so visually it''s better eye candy :)\n3) The Taurus comes with a whole battery of customisations which one usually finds only in high-end 1911''s (like Les Bauer, Kimber, etc.)\n\nPractically the only thing the Norinco has going for it is the higher magazine capacity. But overall, given the construction quality, the customisations and the product finish, the Taurus is the one I''d go for. I haven''t actually shot either of the guns, but I think the Norinco would have lesser recoil than the Taurus (the Norinco is made of rail-grade steel, while the Taurus is made of aluminium alloy). I have, however, held both guns and they both fit my hands quite well (I have large hands). The Taurus'' grip, being thinner, actually made the gun a bit easier to manipulate, while the thicker Norinco grip (plus the extra weight of the gun) made you feel like you''re holding a howitzer (which makes you feel like a [B]god of war![/B]). They both have [B]excellent[/B] grips (atleast for me), but beyond that, they''re both worlds apart; [B]the Norinco is a workhorse while the Taurus (comparatively) is a thoroughbred.[/B]\n\nNo contest: [B]The Taurus rules the day! :)[/B]', ''),

(418584, ' I guess i found my own answer as to the availability of the gun.\n\n\n\nThe Caracal SC has been introduced at the IDEX 2009 exhibition on 22 February 2009. The SC model has a reduced length, height and width and is technically somewhat different compared to the other Caracal pistols. The manufacturer markets the SC model as a primary weapon for government professionals who must conceal a handgun for job related situations, or as a secondary back up pistol.[1] According to Caracal''s managing director Hamad Khalifa Al Neyadiof, the new SC sub-compact model has fewer cross pins giving a smooth surface, allowing for a more efficient assembly and a better quality build. The SC model can also use the larger detachable box magazines of the C and F models, giving a magazine capacity of up to 18 rounds of 9*mm ammunition.[18] According to Jane''s the SC model has a separate safety switch located beneath the trigger guard, rather than on the trigger itself. A special grip adapter that has been developed for the Caracal SC has to be used for using the larger magazines from other 9*mm Caracal weapons. The SC model also has a solid synthetic striker, resulting in reduced manufacturing costs and a very smooth action. The synthetic unit will be introduced to the F and C series later in 2009.[19] The SC magazines are offered with a standard flat bottom or a slightly developed magazine with a finger rest for extra grip.[1] The Caracal SC will be available to commercial users by fall 2012.', ''),

(418625, ' Gentlemen, if I may chime in, as one living in an American state with a "Stand your ground law", I believe the Florida shooting to in fact be homicide and an abuse of the law.  The principle is that if one is in a location that they have a legal right to be in, and has a valid legal reason to engage in justifiable homicide, then the shooting is legal.  For example, if I am in a park, and I am set upon by an armed thug, I do not have to retreat, even if I am able, and I am legally justified in shooting my attacker.  \n\nThe legal principle is two fold.  One must have a legal right to be where they are, and one must have the legal right to use lethal force.  As a general rule, one may use lethal force to protect one''s life, or that of another, or to prevent grave bodily harm, or to prevent a felony.  In this case, I do not believe any of the conditions were met, and a young man has lost his life, and a noble law is now being abused.  \n\nSadly in the United States, this has become a case of racial anger, and also of misdirected rage towards gun laws, and gun ownership.', ''),

(418666, ' [QUOTE=kf7mjf;256940]Gentlemen, if I may chime in, as one living in an American state with a "Stand your ground law", I believe the Florida shooting to in fact be homicide and an abuse of the law.  The principle is that if one is in a location that they have a legal right to be in, and has a valid legal reason to engage in justifiable homicide, then the shooting is legal.  For example, if I am in a park, and I am set upon by an armed thug, I do not have to retreat, even if I am able, and I am legally justified in shooting my attacker.  \n\nThe legal principle is two fold.  One must have a legal right to be where they are, and one must have the legal right to use lethal force.  As a general rule, one may use lethal force to protect one''s life, or that of another, or to prevent grave bodily harm, or to prevent a felony.  In this case, I do not believe any of the conditions were met, and a young man has lost his life, and a noble law is now being abused.  \n\nSadly in the United States, this has become a case of racial anger, and also of misdirected rage towards gun laws, and gun ownership.[/QUOTE]\n\nThis is definitely going to get worse. Especially for the minorities. More states are going to be introducing gun ownership laws in the next 5-10 years. The intolerance is growing to a point of discomfort. I am sure you guys watch TV and see how 50% of Americans really feel about the minorities. I don''t actually disagree with them, the "country of immigrants" rationale dosnt convince me to actually say that my grandparents did anything for their country. The best decision I made was to move back. My discomforts here being broke easily trumped the freedom I actually gained.', ''),

Sharing a funny incident :)\nIt was a nice outing just 1min away from my residence ;)\nSat down near a tree, suddenly a dove comes and sits on a tree (in the beginning of the woods nearby). I stalk all the way just beneath it and the vertical distance remains only (about 15 yards). Try to find a comfortable position and after a 5 minute struggle settle down with the gun resting on a branch of a small tree with the dove still as it is since the beginning.\nI aim for it''s upper chest zoomed in at 4X, having a clear view of it and there''s a branch just in the middle of the dove (through the scope). Shoot, it goes down... tries to recover a little and falls down 5-8 meters ahead.\nI keep my gun aside and run into the woods to retrieve it, and am sad not to find the dove...\nWell suddenly I hear the dove trying to recover and running away: can''t fly. Behind it was coming a cat colored brownish (seemed like a lion, the way it was chasing the dove). It came quite authoritatively as if it was his/her kill and got hold of the dove quite easily. Now the dove''s head is in the cat''s mouth and it''s wound is visible front-wards. The cat''s coming where I am and I ask her to give the dove to me ;) \nIt doesn''t listen to me... so I pick a pebble just to scare her to see whether she gives the dove (still flapping it''s feathers for some seconds until it eventually finishes).

So in my humble and limited experience I would go to a good dealer and see what gun fits you well before deciding. What''s good for one man may not be good for another.\n\nWhen you put a tighter Choke on the gun it will give a higher velocity, but this is a minimal difference. The example I was taught about chokes was is when you use a hose pipe and turn the tap on when u tighten or press the hose at the end the water comes out at different rate. The harder u press the more further the water goes. This is a bit similar to chokes and what they do.\n\nHope this lecture has helped, lol', ''),

Just contract overruns. For example if the production is contracted to be a hundred thousand rounds, they might make 110,000 rounds to allow for any flaws, or errors in production or what have you. Anything left over that is to spec gets sold. I usually see 12 gauge shotgun shells, 5.56 NATO, and some 7.62 NATO that way. I haven''t seen much 9mm NATO ammo sold in the US that way.

Even if only a handful VIPs are obliged specially, and majority of other hunters are restricted, conservation automatically takes place, whether you agree with it or not. FAIR or NOR FAIR ... is another debate. Many other things are UNFAIR as well here, in most walks of life. Their argument as we hv heard, is: If they open it for ALL public, then there is a chaos of illegal uncontrolable hunting like we witnessed for just a month last year or few years back from now after which there was a total ban for 3-4 years...I would avoid to go into specifics here though all minute details are known to us hunters in general.', ''),

(419057, 'Stoeger Cougar 8000F field tests me :p [b]Background of decision[/b]\n \nFollowing was a detailed discussion on suitability of a handgun as my first buy …\n \n[URL]http://www.pakguns.com/showthread.php?7986-Taurus-PT92-99-OR-PT809-OR-Stoeger-OR-BAIKAL-OR-WHAT[/URL]\n \nMain contest was between PT92, Baikal and Stoeger (CZ999 was not available in Rwp). Based on the discussion above, reviews and the best grip which fits my hand etc, finally, I got myself a Stoeger Cougar 8000F for Rs. 58K from Shamsuddin, Rawalpindi. Bought a saddler’s holster too for Rs. 1,400. This gun does not need any introduction or review (unlike my Akdal MKA 1919), however my little experience with this gun is being shared here.\n \n[b]Beretta or no Beretta[/b]\n \nI have gone thru the debate over its Beretta or no Beretta in this forum. Some say that its essentially the Beretta Cougar with [b]only[/b] the new name i.e. Stoeger Cougar and as Stoeger Industries is subsidiary of Beretta so it shud enjoy somewhat same status as that of Beretta. And some say that if this is the case then why hasn’t it been given the name “Beretta Cougar”?\n \nWell, I am quite indifferent bcuz when it does the job well then no matter if its beretta or no beretta but if it doesn’t do the job then its being beretta is useless to me. Even if it had not got the “tag” of Beretta with it, I would have preferred it over PT92 and Baikal for my purchase.\n \n[b]Cherry popping ceremony[/b]\n \nI have “de-flowered” it firing 80 rounds, Chinese. No problem of any kind so far except one spent brass was tossed back on my face. Strange that 1 out of 80 extracted back-asswards, must have been any lapse from my side but I do recall that somebody also complained about backward extraction (in shirt’s pocket) in this forum.  \n \n[b]The science of rotating barrel[/b]\n \nI have been reading much about rotating barrel of Stoeger Cougar which helps reducing recoil. Well, I didn’t find this ‘science’ that good. The jerk while firing is quite much (than expected by me) and I wonder if other compact 9mms have any gr8r recoil. Bcuz if other compact ones have more recoil than stoeger then it must have been compromising on accuracy. I have not tried anyother compact, but do guess that recoil would be same and there would not be any [b]significant[/b] difference in recoil due to rotating barrel. And I feel that if the recoil is “almost” the same then this rotating barrel science does only seem to be a marketing tool.\n \n[b]Loading magz[/b]\n \nFirst time loading was a hell pain in the neck. I was wondering what I have purchased which can’t be easily loaded. After first time, I kept the magz loaded for some weeks and now its quite smooth than the first time. Hopefully it gets better day by day.\n \n[b]Performance (mine, not the gun’s)[/b]\n \nMy performance with the gun was not that bad at 10 meters but kinda hopeless at 20 meters. See the results:\n \nFired 15 shots from 10 meters and 14 were on the chart, at least, one was never found :p Some shots were really encouraging and motivating for the other trip …\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]9432[/ATTACH]\n \nFired around 30 shots from 20 meters and it was all messed-up. I only managed to find 3 shots in the black area and all others were flyers.

For example, one type of Kalashnikov that is widely sold in the US comes in only able to take 10 round magazines, and then is opened up to take hi capacity mags, and rebuilt with enough US made parts to no longer be considered "imported".  It is something designed just to make it harder to import cool (that is to say) "scary" guns.  Pure madness. So when I see a stock VEPR 12 with all the cool stuff on it, readily imported elsewhere it makes me sad and angry.', ''),

The person from DCO office LHE even said lics are not being issued from Lhe distt. currently, and the photo for lics is taken at the DCO office (the dealer takes passport sized photos from clients),\nSources in the DCO office said that my name''s file was nowhere in the DCO office, and the lic numbers on the fake lics given to me by the dealer were the numbers belonging to 2 other persons.\nSo the dealer made his fake copies, stamped them falsely and wrote some other guy''s lic no''s on them. \nThough I still cannot understand why the dealer took over 1 month to return my lics.\nHe is charging 10k-13k per license, I paid 22k for 2.\nThe moment I entered, he also said he can get me MOIs for 20k each, and I knew 100% that they''re fake, as MOIs aren''t being issued since long, and don''t foresee them opening anytime soon.\nI called the dealer and asked for a refund or to give me real ones, and he was talking as if I''m an infant, totally illogical, and even said that the guys at the DCO office or DCO himself are ill-knowledgeable of this.\nHe asked me to purchase guns on the lics, then there will be registry and that I can go then, and check that they''re original.\nI talked to my uncle, he confirmed they''re fake, and that buying weapons on these lics will only end up you being behind the bars, and the dealer will run away.\nI had my doubts as soon as I saw the shop, hardly an area of 5m(2), stocked nothing but very few Darra guns, and he wasn''t a "reliable/renowned/well known" or whatever dealer, by any definition of the words.\nNow I''m going to see what to do... my uncle called him and threatened to call the police at his shop, and he was blank and just hung up the phone.\n\nAll I''d like to say is to avoid getting licenses from ANY dealer in ISB/Pindi or nearby... not from any in Lhe or infact don''t get a lic from any PAKISTANI dealer except only a few handful well-known/old/reliable dealers I think Baksh Ellahee is considered one of them.', ''),

These days, licences are closed, as the DC is changed, till the new appointment, we have to wait, I also have 2 licences in queue.\n\nThe original licences from Lahore have these details, as per my knowledge:\n 1.

Along GT Road, as well as inside the main  cities. That would serve some purpose and easy [I]GPS''ing[/I] around.\n\nLet me start by voting some of my favorite venues:\n\n [B]GT Road, Punjab: [/B] "[B][COLOR=#ff0000]Mukhtar King Fish - Wazeerabad Morr[/COLOR][/B]". Best Barbeque. Best quality food and taste.\n\n[B]Lahore:[/B] "[B][COLOR=#ff0000] Village[/COLOR][/B]" - Best Buffet. And [COLOR=#ff0000][B]Bundhu Khan[/B][/COLOR], Mall Road.\n\n[B]Wah Cantt[/B]: [COLOR=#ff0000][B]Green Lagoon[/B][/COLOR] - G.T Road. Best Taste in everything.\n\n[B]Peshawar[COLOR=#ff0000]: Baba Wali [/COLOR][/B](The genuine one). And course, Namak Mandi. Here I prefer the one just before Nisar Charsi, the venue at the corner.\n\n[B]Rawalpindi:[/B] (Never found the right spot)\n\n[B]Abottabad:[/B] (Never found the right spot)\n\n[B]Muree:[/B] [COLOR=#ff0000][B]"Lintott''s[/B][/COLOR]"\n\n[B]Nathiagali/Sikandarabad[/B]: "[B][COLOR=#ff0000]Elites[/COLOR][/B]" and "[COLOR=#ff0000][B]Fogland[/B][/COLOR]". The former is VIP, the latter serves the best Balti Chicken.\n\n[B]Mansehra:[/B] "[COLOR=#ff0000][B]Food Hut[/B][/COLOR]", just before Mansehra town.\n\nStill missing the spots in Abottabad and Rawalpindi, where I usually just stop by some franchise, whichever. \n\nAnd finally, of franchises, well, what can I say, I''m of the opinion that Mcdonalds offer the best value for money deals, Pizza Hut is frequently visited by me, but is a rip off. KFC, well, just occasionally.\n\nSorry to hijack the topic a bit, but this is what I feel would serve anything useful, the mentioning of food-stuff and the venues where served as well. Awaiting some suggestions for other cities.\n\n\nRegards.', ''),

Let me clear you that i have repeatedly told PG members about this. I have been deceived myself. Thank God that i got my money back. Its been months now and im asking every single person to get me a license. I have found a way myself.(Back Dated but with record in DCO office and Post office). Its a humble request to All my PG brothers, Do not trust a dealer for license even if he is your Brother. Always make a fair deal, 1 or 2k advance and rest after the verification of license. If license prove to be fake that advance will be returned. \n[QUOTE=Chauhdary;257556]I have written about it in quite detail in a new thread, \nno record of my lics in DCO office LHE (issuing authority),\nand DCO Office''s sources said that the numbers written on the licenses are originally some other persons'' lic numbers, and he told the names of the guys.\nHe said the dealer wrote those numbers on his fake booklets... but I don''t understand why he took a long 1 month for this.\n\nBut he ringed me again after my uncle''s call (my uncle said he''d call the police in), and he''s still denying the fact that the lics are fake, and is constantly asking me to buy weapons first... my uncle strictly disallowed me from buying lics, as this would end up in me going to jail and the dealer would run away, as he''s a Pathan dealer and every here n there we read about such cases in newspapers.\nI will somehow go to LHE or post the original lics to sources in DCO office Lhe and get it confirmed...as the dealer is saying no no no it''s not fake, and it''s 100% confirmed fake from the issuing authority.[/QUOTE]', ''),

Clays guns are heavier by design. A target gun is heavier to  help reduce the felt recoil of shooting a couple of hundred rounds or  more in a day. Field guns are lighter so they can be carried all day  long and not wear you down. Odds are you will not be shooting a couple  of hunderd rounds hunting in a day. \nThe thing to do is find a good gun that fits your needs and budget. I  have hunted with my Browning GTI before but it does get heavy at the  end of the day. The benifit is that I have shot it thousands of times  low gun during clays, so shooting live birds hunting makes it seem  almost second nature. I found myself having to wait so I did not shoot  the bird too close.  \n\nFind a quality gun that offers the features you need and try it for a  season. You may find you want a second gun for hunting or a clays only  gun. And everyone here knows you can never own too many shotguns!

I also read reviews about MP155, and it seems it is too early to decide which one is more dependable of the two - MP153 or MP155. The balance of the 26" barrel MP153 wooden was indeed  good - for both upland and duck. Now he is looking for a good extended aftermarket choke for his MP153 in either of IC,LM,M constrictions....but we have not found any in market yet. Also, searching for a Bradley styled white bead or a compsight/Tricomp Hiviz sight .... but haven''t found them as yet too. Is the thread size of the front bead in MP153 known by chance to anyone??[/QUOTE]\r\n\r\n[URL="http://www.pakguns.com/showthread.php?5859-Getting-The-Most-Out-Of-Your-Baikal-O-U-Shotgun-Part-1"]http://www.pakguns.com/showthread.php?5859-Getting-The-Most-Out-Of-Your-Baikal-O-U-Shotgun-Part-1[/URL]\r\n\r\nScroll down and see details.\r\n\r\nRegards', ''),

U said that for both sporting and hunting [B]Baikal MP-27-EM-1C "Sporting" is best choice. I am confused that a gun given name or adjective"Hunting" is less fit for hunting than a gun suffixed as "Sporting". obviously sporting will better perform for sporting and "hunting" will be better for hunting due to its lesser weight and comparitively short barrel length. you also mentioned that with only slight difficulty we can make sporting gun good in hunting as well. what we have to do ? is there any method by which we can remove drawbacks in "hunting GUN" and make it more suited to hunting than it is? plz elaborate bcz i am planning to buy a Russian o/u just for hunting......... your opinion will add much more to my selection of shotgun ...............so plz help .......... thanx [/B][/QUOTE]\r\n\r\nBro, I merely suggested that if you intended to do both (skeet and hunting) then its probably wiser and better to get the sporting model. the slight difficulty that you might incur during hunting with a sporting shotgun will more than pay for itself (or balance out) by the comfort that you will experience while shooting skeet. however if you have no intention of doing any sports shooting with it then I don''t see a reason why you should go for sports model.\r\n\r\nRegards.', ''),

Also MashAllah our forum has grown and is growing quite a bit with about a 1000 new posts every 3 days. \n\nOur mods are doing such a great job that I don''t have to step in at all but I have noticed one issue that I must address.\n\nIt is a matter of personal pride to me that PakGuns is said to be one of the most polite & friendly gun forums online. Our brotherly culture is so important to us that we''ve mentioned it repeatedly in our rules and at the sign up page. \n\nSome new friends and a few older ones at times forget this. I have instructed the mods to be extremely strict on rude behavior at our forum.\n\nTo avoid any inconvenience Please [U][B]DO NOT DO THE FOLLOWING[/B][/U]: \n\n1). [B]Being rude to fellow members[/B], [B][U]specially the mods[/U][/B] as they take time out from their busy lives to help run this forum. Being rude to them will not be tolerated and I will personally ban anyone who does not understand this.\n\n2). [B]Not respecting others opinions[/B]. Everyone has a right to offer their opinion regardless of how smart / foolish it is. Making fun of them is foolish as everyone''s knowledge is limited and we all learn as we go along.\n\n3). [B]Constant complaining[/B]. We have some "Shikati Tatu''s" at our forum who apparently have nothing better to do with their lives than sending emails to mods/admin complaining about other members all day. Please grow up, this is not kinder garden, it is a forum for mature individuals. If you can''t get along with everyone then perhaps this is not the the place for you.\n\n4). [B]Ganging up on Members[/B]. We have noticed that some friends try to make a group and gang up on otjers. The standard way is one member makes a post and regardless of how good/bad it is and his chum goes "Wah Wah Sir, Kaya Baat hai" or "+10" or "Tusi paida hokay saday teh isaan kitay" etc. These guys then gang up and ridicule anyone that offers a different opinion. \n\nIt''s amusing as we have seen it all before in the past. People like these are eventually kicked out of our forum. \n\nAlthough these things are not wide spread and just a few individuals, I am posting this thread to nip this in the bud. InshAllah, PakGuns will always be an open and friendly forum for everyone and all have the right to ask any relevant question or offer a suggestion regardless of how basic/complicated it is.\n\nRegards,[/QUOTE]\n\n Very well, Abbas brother, I would say that you have raised the issue as a very impartial verdict by a reputable Judge / Justice. It is really very nice to know that Mods are performing and discharging their duties as impartial and neutral ones, regardless of being pressurized or inspired by number of posts and time of affiliation.', ''),

Baikal IZH-27 "Sporting":\r\n\r\nmechanically similar to IZH-27 "hunting" therefore all good traits of the hunting model are also present in this shotgun. as a bonus, with sporting shotgun one gets some other enhancements which are very useful in sports shooting. now these benefits have an associated cost which must be paid the user/ower in terms of weight. ofcourse, "sporting" model is heavier compared to "hunting" model and does not come with sling attachments that aid during long walks in hunting. however one must understand that this disadvantage pays for itself in the terms of the comfort and advantage that one gets in sports shooting.\r\n\r\nif you are not interested in sports shooting then I really do not see a reason why you should go for a sporting model shotgun. simple!\r\n\r\n3.

I am really not implying anything, just asking a simple question. :)\r\n\r\nnow, coming to Hatsan. its built on Beretta action. very good and highly refined action which is  not only difficult to manufacture but also depends on many parts that are hand fitted and require a greater degree of fine tuning such as inertia trigger system. this is where the dichotomy lies. some say a budget O/U shotgun manufacturer can do a similar level of fine tuning and attention to detail as a high end shotgun manufacturer whereas other say that a budget shotgun O/U manufacturer can never invest the huge amount of resources involved in fine tuning a shotgun to such degree. they also say that a budget O/U manufacturer cannot afford to put that much attention to detail otherwise the huge cost jump would simply push their product out of the "budget" bracket and into the high end O/U shotgun bracket where nothing is ignored. in this bracket, they have to compete with the big dogs. where manufacturing flaws are not forgiven as honest mistakes but penalized for not doing the right job.\r\n\r\nthink about it? which school of thought do you belong to?\r\n\r\nRegards.\r\n\r\nnow thats history. whereas Hatsan which', ''),

The domicile and PRC is right of every citizen even if he/she is minor  but in case these documents are being issued to an minor  , the minor would draw his/her domicile from parents , means  the papers of that minor would not be processed till they are accompanied with domicile of father ( or mother in case father is dead and so on ) . Now if the age of 18 is bestowing upon each and every legal privilege upon a person than why not a child of 18 , 19 , or 20 years is required by law to have his/her domicile independently . why is he / she required under the citizen ship act to submit the  domicile of his/ her parents at the time of submission of domicile request if he prefers it before attaining the age of 21 years . simply because law permits to hold a CNIC at the age of 18 , but if the same person submits his / her papers of a domicile on or  after attaining the age of 21 years , he is not asked to submit the domicile of parents . so the age  of 18 and acquisition of CNIC does not enable a person to exploit each every easement granted by the law.

(419894, ' [QUOTE=shahid khan rarasham;258105]@ all ,............ thanx for ur precious comments,...\r\n@francolino... bro my main confusion lies in the fact that i need a gun merely for Hunting, U suggested izh 27 sporting rather than izh 27 hunting.....ok....now why is this so that a gun given name "sporting" simply dominates a gun named "izh 27 hunting" in the field or in hunting ??? moreover from an other site i got information regarding same topic which is:\r\n    "I think the big differnce between clays guns and field guns is going to  be weight. Clays guns are heavier by design. A target gun is heavier to  help reduce the felt recoil of shooting a couple of hundred rounds or  more in a day. Field guns are lighter so they can be carried all day  long and not wear you down. Odds are you will not be shooting a couple  of hunderd rounds hunting in a day. \r\nThe thing to do is find a good gun that fits your needs and budget. I  have hunted with my Browning GTI before but it does get heavy at the  end of the day. The benifit is that I have shot it thousands of times  low gun during clays, so shooting live birds hunting makes it seem  almost second nature. I found myself having to wait so I did not shoot  the bird too close.  \r\n\r\nFind a quality gun that offers the features you need and try it for a  season. You may find you want a second gun for hunting or a clays only  gun. And everyone here knows you can never own too many shotguns!    "\r\nthese i copied from there,  are actual words of some suggestor.......and show that sporting gun being heavier will be uneasy to be carried in hands while hunting in the field,,.........\r\nsuggestions needed.[/QUOTE]\r\n\r\nBrother WEIGHT issue is not that important for ME as much as the balance and handling and of course gun-fit of the gun is. If the gun is badly balanced and not according to an individual&#8217;s personal preferences/physique, lesser weight will rather create more problems in field. I am pretty fond of upland hunting myself and my first passion is partridge (always) though I have done some decent duck and geese shooting too&#8230;&#8230;Qs is: Will a 7.6-7.75 lbs gun (hunting model above) Versus 7.9 lbs gun (sporting model above) make hell of a difference in field (upland in specific) ? Is this difference tooo much to matter? As per feedback from hunters, the Sporting model of Baikal O/U is heard to be real good at partridges &#8230; and I am forwarding that feedbk from some die-hard partridge hunters from Pindi and Attock region whom I know. I held both the guns myself, and Sporting model was my 1st choice. The extra features were a plus too.\r\n\r\nSo&#8230;..it is not that complex a Qs. Solution is simply holding BOTH guns in market, and handling them yourself to find  which is more comfortable to swing, well balanced AND comes right-on! \r\n\r\nI again repeat: 7.6 - 7.75 lbs Versus 7.9 lbs is no big issue to matter in upland. Handling and gunfit etc are more important aspects that will knock more birds down. I would also suggest to buy any two (IC,LM,M) after market (preferably extended type) chokes to make better even patterns with Baikal & a good quality front bead (pref ivory color 0.125&#8221;-0.156&#8221; dia). These things matter a lot too. \r\n\r\nI have used following  guns extensively: the real heavy Remington 1100, the ideal weight Beretta A303 field, slightly heavy Beretta A303 Sporting and the ideal weight Beretta AL91 Teknys Stncoat mobil&#8230;..(by ideal weight I mean 7 lbs i.e. my preferred ideal weight for shotguns), and I can vouch for the fact that weight does not matter as much as the gun&#8217;s HANDLING & more importantly GUN-FIT. If these are spot-on according to your physique and preferences, you can literally &#8216;smoke&#8217; birds in field with some decent practice.', ''),

(419935, ' [QUOTE=12GAUGE;258131]Bro, kindly allow me to offer my two cents on the subject:\n\n1. Baikal IZH-27 "hunting":\n\nTried and tested. built tough and ready to withstand field abuse. long standing history of reliability and durability. very good choice for a budget field shotgun. good balance and handling.\n\n2. Baikal IZH-27 "Sporting":\n\nmechanically similar to IZH-27 "hunting" therefore all good traits of the hunting model are also present in this shotgun. as a bonus, with sporting shotgun one gets some other enhancements which are very useful in sports shooting. now these benefits have an associated cost which must be paid the user/ower in terms of weight. ofcourse, "sporting" model is heavier compared to "hunting" model and does not come with sling attachments that aid during long walks in hunting. however one must understand that this disadvantage pays for itself in the terms of the comfort and advantage that one gets in sports shooting.\n\nif you are not interested in sports shooting then I really do not see a reason why you should go for a sporting model shotgun. simple!\n\n3. Hatsan Optime O/U shotgun:\n\nwell....looks like a quality shotgun. however one cannot say anything conclusive about this shotgun as there is not much of a history behind it.\n\n4. interesting point to wonder and kill a few million brain cells over:\n\nBaikal IZH-27 is being manufactured and marketed since 1973. it is essentially built on a design that dates back to 1931 in the form of Browning Superposed which was designed to be a first mass produced over and under shotgun. if you compare the two shotgun you will find that Baikal is basically a modified (or improved) form of the Superposed shotgun. certain parts were modified to make them easier to produce or simpler in function and we all know that "the simplest solution is often the best the solution".\n\nhas anyone noticed why Browning resorted to mechanical trigger system in their latest Superposed based offering Browning 725? did I mention that Baikal also has mechanical trigger. I am really not implying anything, just asking a simple question. :)\n\nnow, coming to Hatsan. its built on Beretta action. very good and highly refined action which is  not only difficult to manufacture but also depends on many parts that are hand fitted and require a greater degree of fine tuning such as inertia trigger system. this is where the dichotomy lies. some say a budget O/U shotgun manufacturer can do a similar level of fine tuning and attention to detail as a high end shotgun manufacturer whereas other say that a budget shotgun O/U manufacturer can never invest the huge amount of resources involved in fine tuning a shotgun to such degree. they also say that a budget O/U manufacturer cannot afford to put that much attention to detail otherwise the huge cost jump would simply push their product out of the "budget" bracket and into the high end O/U shotgun bracket where nothing is ignored. in this bracket, they have to compete with the big dogs. where manufacturing flaws are not forgiven as honest mistakes but penalized for not doing the right job.\n\nthink about it? which school of thought do you belong to?\n\nRegards.\n\nnow thats history. whereas Hatsan which[/QUOTE]\n\nTHANX bro , did not understand the last sentence :smile: "now thats history. whereas Hatsan which"\nkindly  add a brief conclusion as well ..................... thanx\n                          regards...........', ''),

(420014, ' What you need is a "snap cap."  A snap cap is a dummy shell with an insert that absorbs the strike of the firing pin. Fancy commercial snap caps sometimes use spring-loaded brass buttons in place of the primer, but you can make your own by drilling or punching out the primer cup in some fired shells and filling the cup with rubber, plastic, etc.  A trimmed-down piece of pencil eraser would work. My first rifles were Enfields and older "cock on closing" Mausers, where you can hold the trigger back while closing the bolt and the bolt will close without compressing the firing pin spring.  When I got other rifles that cocked on opening I had to make snap caps so I could store them uncocked.', ''),

(420017, ' I''m not sure how old the combination gun idea is, but it was popular in Germany in the 1800s, often as an arrangement called a "drilling", which had two rifled bores and one smooth bore in the same barrel. In the USA, the Savage company has made over/under combination guns since... a long time, anyway.  They range from .22LR/.410 to .308/12guage.  Savage sold them under their own name, and to department stores or other gun companies, which often had their own names put on them, so you''ll see the same gun marked different ways. The guns were designed for hunting, the idea being you could use either the rifle or shotgun part as needed depending on the game you found.', ''),

Later, when the Tsar''s armorers had their new Mosin-Nagant rifles and ammunition produced in the USA, they also required their cases be reloadable.  The Tsar also bought a lot of Winchester lever-action rifles chambered in 7.62x54R for his cavalry.

(420022, ' Originally "bore" was a British term, specifying the number of round lead balls that would fit in the barrel to make a pound.  If it took twelve balls to make a pound, the firearm was a "12 bore."  It wasn''t a very precise system, but it was simple (by British standards, anyway) and adequate for the time. Later, after rifled barrels became popular, manufacturers started referring to the diameter in decimal inches.  This was originally the "lands", or high spots in the rifling, and was easily measured.  Later, they began using the diameter across the bottom of the rifling, called the "grooves."  But since rifling varied in depth depending on the type of the rifling and who was doing the work, the modern method is to ignore the barrel and refer to the bullet diameter.  That''s why a .303 British bullet is now a .311" diameter... even though it''s still the same size. The European method of referring to cartridges is by diameter, length, and rim type.  A 7x57 is a rimless 7mm Mauser, a 7x57R is a rimmed 7mm Mauser, for example.  This is a very imprecise system, since there can be many different cartridges of the same diameter and length that do not interchange, by case taper, shoulder configuration, or pressure rating.  The usual method in the British Commonwealth and USA is to give each cartridge a unique name to specifically identify the cartridge.  This sometimes results in things like the .460 Rowland, which has the same bullet diameter as the .45 ACP, which is actually .451, not .45... well, if it was easy anyone could do it. It''s also not unusual for a cartridge to have more than one name.  A European might refer to a "7.62x63mm" cartridge.  He would have a very hard time finding any in the USA, where the manufacturer calls it ".30-06".  The US government used to refer to it as the ".30 Army", but now refers to it as "M2", since they have a new .30 caliber cartridge, which they refer to as 7.62x51 to differentiate it from both the .30-06 and the previous .30 Army, now referred to as .30-40 Krag...

But a Magazine and a year''s limited warranty is missing from the initially proposed 100K package, both of which would amount to min 20-25K''s combined, magazine alone worth some 7-10K''s. Hence, it''s almost status quo, just a different impression, or at the max a 10-15K''s drop, if measured rightly. But then, anything new always has it''s "novelty tag" attached and is slightly up in the beginning.\n\nStoeger Cougar initially was purchased by many at 80K''s, even more. That its standing at 55-60k''s today does not mean the handgun is inferior or anything, it'' s just more common, demand/ supply at equilibrium.\n\nAs far as the CZ 999 is concerned, it''s a nice handgun, but would drop dead if they increased the prices just a tad more, coz the average man doesn''t know anything about it''s traits, 15 mtrs groupings, precision shooting qualities, etc, nor cares, yet certainly does care about the general impression that you get, means, bulk/ rugged looking piece of hardware/poor finish, Serb origin, etc, which nobody would like to pay anything in excess of 55- 60K''s for.\n\nI am humbly of the opinion that CZ 999 should not have been priced anything more than a Chinese NP 22, HP77B, etc, means 35-40K''s, since they''re Sig Clones as well, and speak[I] almost[/I] same manufacture quality. I feel at 60K''s, it''s one [B]rip off.[/B]\n\n [COLOR=#ff0000]The common man doesn''t even know much about true CZ''s, leave alone a Serbian CZ 999. Just ask some of our most senior members here, inclusive of myself, if we knew anything much about the popular CZ-75 platform in the pre-PakGuns days. \n[/COLOR]\nBut I know, you''ll never agree to these perimeters of measuring things up - [I]and willfully[/I], lolz!\n\n\nRegards.', ''),

Hopefully by next\r\nweek we will be able to take our earlier address\r\nplate here, and that our address will remain same\r\ntoo.\r\nThis place is really nice. It even has a washing\r\nmachine, situated right above the toilet I''m not\r\nsure it works too well. Last week I put in 3 shirts,\r\npulled the chain and haven''t seen them since.\r\nThe weather here isn''t too bad. It rained only\r\ntwice last week. The first time it rained for 3 days\r\nand second time for 4 days.\r\nThe coat you wanted me to send you, your Aunt\r\nsaid it would be a little too heavy to send in the\r\nmail with all the metal buttons, so we cut them\r\noff and put them in the pocket.\r\nYour father has another job. He has 500 men\r\nunder him. He is cutting the grass at the\r\ncemetery.\r\nBy the way I took Bahu to our club''s poolside. The\r\nmanager is Badmash. He told her that two piece\r\nswimming suit is not allowed in his club. We were\r\nconfused as to which piece should we remove?\r\nYour sister had a baby this morning. I haven''t\r\nfound out whether it is a girl or a boy, so I don''t\r\nknow whether you are an Aunt or Uncle.\r\nYour uncle, Jetinder fell in the nearby well. Some\r\nmen tried to pull him out, but he fought them off\r\nbravely and drowned. We cremated him and he\r\nburned for three days.\r\nThere isn''t much more news this time.

(420273, 'Stoeger Cougar 8000F Just bought Stoeger Cougar 8000F on 31 Mar 2012 from Ibrahim Jee and Sons, Adamjee Road Saddar Rawalpindi for Rs 63000/- . Before that i had a Beretta 92F local which stuck during firing of initial 5 rounds. So i went for Stoeger then. I fired almost 30 rounds at a distance of 20m. Following are my observations regarding this handgun: -\n[LIST]\n[*][B][U]Appearance & Size [/U]. [/B]Well it looks good. Very graceful infact. Due to shorter size than Beretta, u can easily carry and the most best thing is that it best fits in a medium sized hand due to its fine grips. I must say a very well balanced gun that u can aim at the target with ease.\n[*][B][U]Accuracy[/U].[/B] The man behind the gun matters a lot even u take the highest degree of accurate weapon. As i have just fired 30 rounds that too from the distance of 20m, and to me the 3 dots were new and initially i could not align perfectly. What i noticed that u have to keep the front sight dot half the way down to two rear sight dots to fire exactly where u wanted to fire. No doubt about the accuracy of this gun. I ill soon upload other pics next week Inshallah with better results.\n[*][B][U]Security and Ruggedness[/U].[/B] No doubt about the firing pin locking mechanism. The barrel rather the whole gun with Matt finish is rugged enough for long life. It is a good choice for those who want to keep the hand gun for life time. Just with good care, i can bet on its longer life than other handguns. The sliding and the other mechanism is made more secure to prevent any accidental firing or any injury due to malfunctioning.\n[*][B][U]Firing Experience[/U]. [/B]The Handgun behaved very well during firing. It went so smooth that one would love to fire with this handgun. As far as i am concerned, i love this gun and recommend others to go for that as their first choice.\n[/LIST]\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]9526[/ATTACH][ATTACH=CONFIG]9527[/ATTACH][ATTACH=CONFIG]9528[/ATTACH][ATTACH=CONFIG]9529[/ATTACH][ATTACH=CONFIG]9530[/ATTACH][ATTACH=CONFIG]9531[/ATTACH]', ''),

(420626, '.17 Mach IV vs .17 HMR Brothers check this\r\nThe .17 Mach IV is a wildcat centerfire rifle cartridge, based on the .221 Remington Fireball case, necked down to fire a .172 bullet. The cartridge was introduced in 1962 by Vern O’Brien[2] it offered an easy case conversion and good ballistics but could not compete against the .17 Remington. The name Mach IV comes from the claim that bullets can reach 4000 ft/s,(wow) despite this being only about Mach 3.5. Due to the relatively small case capacity, even small variations in powder of 0.5 gr (0.032 g) can lead to the difference between a safe and dangerously over pressure load. The .17 Mach IV became very popular with varmint hunters,   CHECK THE VELOCITY MAN\r\n\r\nThe .17 Remington Fireball was created in 2007 by Remington Arms Company as a response to the popular wildcat round, the .17 Mach IV. Factory loads drive a 20 grain (1.3 g) bullet around 4,000 ft/s (1,219 m/s). Velocity is close to the .17 Remington but with significantly less powder, and therefore less heat and fouling. Both are important issues to high-volume shooters such as varmint hunters.\r\n\r\n\r\n.17 Hornady Magnum Rimfire, commonly known as the .17 HMR, is a rimfire rifle cartridge developed by the ammunition company Hornady in 2002. It descended from the .22 Magnum by necking down the .22 Magnum case to take a .17 caliber (4.5 mm) bullet, and it is more costly to shoot than traditional .22 caliber rimfire cartridges. Commonly loaded with a 17 grain (1.1 g) bullet, it can deliver muzzle velocities in excess of 2550 ft/s (775 m/s).\r\n\r\n[url]http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrb56yCCqnY[/url]', ''),

Hat''s off sir!!\n\nI have some passion for the game as well and have a question here though for which I am sure you''ll help me out...In some of your pictures, I''ve noticed that your decoy tactics differ from others and you prefer to put them in a straight symmetry/line with one immediately followed by the other and it goes likewise..Can you shed some light on the technical parameters and reasoning for that as mostly people tend to put them in flocks/groups while leaving one or multiple landing zones in between... I myself tried this tactic once but it didn''t worked as those decoying started to land on the other side of my decoys despite of the fact that there was a landing zone left and eventually the shots were not on as they should have been..Looking at your pictures, I assume that this is rigorously followed in case you are hunting in real shallow waters/marshes or in case of rivers where you have several branches of water around with "Baraitas" in abundance... I may be wrong though, as it is just an assumption on the basis of what I saw and you''ll remain as the best person to answer this...\n\nCheers!!!', ''),

(421204, ' thanks for sharing, i also find some useful info while surfing on net.\n\nThere are five essentials to learn in order to properly and accurately shoot a handgun:\n\n[LIST]\n[*]Position\n[*]Grip\n[*]Breath Control\n[*]Sight Alignment\n[*]Trigger Squeeze\n[*]Follow Through\n[/LIST]\n[COLOR=#0000ff][I][B]Position:[/B][/I][/COLOR] Proper alignment of your body and handgun with the target.\n\n[COLOR=#0000ff][I][B]Grip:[/B][/I][/COLOR]  Keep the handgun pointed in a safe direction and shake hands with the grip of the handgun, fitting the "V'' formed by the thumb and index finger of the shooting hand as high as possible on the backstrap ( back of the grip). Remember to keep your finger off the trigger (start getting in the habit now to keep your trigger finger along the frame just above the trigger/ trigger guard. Next you will use your weak hand to grip finish your grip. I won''t take the time to explain this part - Our instructors will explain and demonstrate the grip to each student and make adjustments as you shoot.\n\n[COLOR=#0000ff][I][B]Breath Control:[/B][/I][/COLOR] Breath control is required to  minimize body movement which in turn reduces handgun movement. For target shooting it is recommended that you take a breath between shots - let out enough air to be comfortable and then shoot. Now for self-defense or tactical situations you will later need to learn to control your breathing while performing tactical movement and shooting. Ninja Stuff, Cool! That comes in later classes.\n\n[I][B][COLOR=#0000ff]Sight Alignment:[/COLOR][/B][/I] Proper sight alignment is the relationship of the front and rear sights. To properly align the two sights the top of the front sight is even with the top of the rear sight - the front sight must be centered in the notch of the rear sight (see illustration). Proper sight alignment is key to accurate shooting. Any misalignment of the front sight with the rear sight will cause inaccuracies of your shot placement. Our instructors will work with you during the range time to further discuss and demonstrate proper sight alignment. You will aim with your dominant eye when shooting a handgun. Just because you are right handed it does not mean that you are right eyed dominant. Our instructors will show you a easy test to determine your dominant eye. \n\n[I][B][COLOR=#0000ff]Trigger Squeeze:[/COLOR][/B][/I] Trigger squeeze is exactly that, you squeeze the trigger back in order to shoot the handgun - you do not pull or jerk the trigger back. The trigger must be squeezed straight back in a smooth continuous motion. \n\n[I][COLOR=#0000ff][B]Follow Through:[/B][/COLOR][/I] Continuing to apply all of the shooting fundamentals throughout the delivery of the shot.\n\n[QUOTE][B]Trigger Squeeze and sight alignment are considered to be the two most important factors in accurate shooting The other four fundamentals all combine to assist in achieving proper sight alignment and trigger squeeze. All the fundamentals must be properly performed every time in order to shoot the pistol accurately.[/B][/QUOTE]', ''),

(421235, ' Overall, one can say 30-06 Springfield is better than 7mm Mauser (7x57) BUT.....in practicality, 7x57 is a very effective bullet within 250 yards, almost equal to 30-06 effectiveness. Diferences crop up (minor to moderate) after that distance only. But... long range >250 yards shooting anyways  is best with 130 grains bullet (270 Win) OR 150-165 grains bullets of 7mm Mag, not 30-06. \r\n\r\nRegarding .300 Win Mag, it is tooo big a calibre for Pak hunting ...its a calibre for Elk,Moose,Bighorn etc in USA and abroad, but no doubt the best there is for long range VERY BIG game hunting, not the usually hunted species here: Chink, Hog deer, Urial, Ibex, Nilgai, Boar.\r\n\r\nWithin, 250 yards, I would say both are an equal bet ...except the fact that 7x57 is available in 140 grains and 175 grains only, and 30-06 Springfield has a lot more range - 50 grains accelerator bullet to 225 grains bullet if I am not wrong. Seldom do we see that range is available in market here. At the same time, one big advantage of 7x57 is price of bullet in market and availablilty, with the three bullets: 139 grains S&B Chzek bullet (Sellior & Bellot), 145 grains Winchester Power Point, 140 grains federal PSP ... all great bullets in 7x57 and readily available too, Federal being the best and slightly short in market always. \r\n\r\nSo...calibre and bullet ... both are critical....depends which bullet with a certain calibre a shooter is using or intending to use.', ''),

(421267, ' High altitude pulmonary edema \r\n\r\nHigh altitude pulmonary edema (HAPE) is a life-threatening form of non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema (fluid accumulation in the lungs) that occurs in otherwise healthy mountaineers at altitudes typically above 2,500 meters (8,200 ft).[1] Some cases, however, have been reported also at lower altitudes (between 1,500–2,500 metres or 4,900–8,200 feet in highly vulnerable subjects), although what makes some people susceptible to HAPE is not currently known. HAPE remains the major cause of death related to high-altitude exposure with a high mortality in absence of adequate emergency treatment\r\n\r\nSymptomsPhysiological and symptomatic changes often vary according to the altitude involved.[2]\r\n\r\nThe Lake Louise Consensus Definition for High Altitude Pulmonary Edema has set widely-used criteria for defining HAPE symptoms: [3][4]\r\n\r\nSymptoms: at least two of:\r\n\r\nDifficulty in breathing (dyspnea) at rest \r\nCough \r\nWeakness or decreased exercise performance \r\nChest tightness or congestion \r\nSigns: at least two of:\r\n\r\nCrackles or wheezing (while breathing) in at least one lung field \r\nCentral cyanosis (blue skin color) \r\nTachypnea (rapid shallow breathing) \r\nTachycardia (rapid heartrate) \r\nIntermediate Altitudes (1500-2500 m or 4900-8200 feet) \r\nClinical symptoms are unlikely. Blood oxygen levels remain >90%.\r\n\r\nHigh Altitude (2500-3500 m or 8200-11500 feet) \r\nClinical symptoms are common and may develop after 2-3 days. Blood oxygen levels may drop below 90% or lower during exercise. Prior acclimation will decrease the severity of the symptoms.\r\n\r\nExtreme Altitude (>5800 m or 19000 feet) \r\nBlood oxygen levels are <90%, even at rest. Progressive deterioration may occur despite acclimation.\r\n\r\n[edit] CausesThe initial cause of HAPE is a shortage of oxygen which is caused by the lower air pressure at high altitudes.[1][5] The mechanisms by which this shortage of oxygen causes HAPE are poorly understood, but two processes are believed to be important:\r\n\r\nIncreased pulmonary arterial and capillary pressures (pulmonary hypertension) secondary to hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction.[6] \r\nAn idiopathic non-inflammatory increase in the permeability of the vascular endothelium.[7] \r\nAlthough higher pulmonary arterial pressures are associated with the development of HAPE, the presence of pulmonary hypertension may not in itself be sufficient to explain the development of edema: severe pulmonary hypertension can exist in the absence of clinical HAPE in subjects at high altitude.[8]\r\n\r\nIncidenceThe incidence of clinical HAPE in unacclimatized travelers exposed to high altitude (~4,000 m or 13,000 ft) appears to be less than 1%.[citation needed] The U.S. Army Pike''s Peak Research Laboratory has exposed sea-level-resident volunteers rapidly and directly to high altitude; during 30 years of research involving about 300 volunteers (and over 100 staff members), only three have been evacuated with suspected HAPE.\r\n\r\nPredisposing factorsIndividual susceptibility to HAPE is difficult to predict. The most reliable risk factor is previous susceptibility to HAPE, and there is likely to be a genetic basis to this condition, perhaps involving the gene for angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE).[citation needed] Recently, scientists have found the similarities between low amounts of 2,3-BPG (also known as 2,3-DPG) with the occurrence of HAPE at high altitudes.\r\n\r\n[edit] ResearchIn order to help understand the factors that make some individuals susceptible to HAPE, the International HAPE Database was set up in 2004.[9] Individuals who have previously suffered from HAPE can register with this confidential database in order to help researchers study the condition.\r\n\r\n[edit] TreatmentThe standard and most important treatment is to descend to lower altitude as quickly as possible, preferably by at least 1000 metres.[1][10] Oxygen should also be given if possible. Symptoms tend to quickly improve with descent, but less severe symptoms may continue for several days. The standard drug treatments for which there is strong clinical evidence are dexamethasone.[11] and nifedipine[12] Phosphodiesterase inhibitors such as tadalafil are also effective[11] but may worsen the headache of mountain sickness.', ''),

The most reliable risk factor is previous susceptibility to HAPE, and there is likely to be a genetic basis to this condition, perhaps involving the gene for angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE).[citation needed] Recently, scientists have found the similarities between low amounts of 2,3-BPG (also known as 2,3-DPG) with the occurrence of HAPE at high altitudes.\n\n[edit] ResearchIn order to help understand the factors that make some individuals susceptible to HAPE, the International HAPE Database was set up in 2004.[9] Individuals who have previously suffered from HAPE can register with this confidential database in order to help researchers study the condition.\n\n[edit] TreatmentThe standard and most important treatment is to descend to lower altitude as quickly as possible, preferably by at least 1000 metres.[1][10] Oxygen should also be given if possible. Symptoms tend to quickly improve with descent, but less severe symptoms may continue for several days. The standard drug treatments for which there is strong clinical evidence are dexamethasone.[11] and nifedipine[12] Phosphodiesterase inhibitors such as tadalafil are also effective[11] but may worsen the headache of mountain sickness.[/QUOTE]\nSorry Bro, but I don''t see the relevance here.

Probably influenced by the writings of Hermann Helmholtz, it was invented by American ophthalmologist Adelbert Ames, Jr. in 1934, and constructed in the following year.\r\n\r\nAn Ames room is constructed so that from the front it appears to be an ordinary cubic-shaped room, with a back wall and two side walls parallel to each other and perpendicular to the horizontally level floor and ceiling. However, this is a trick of perspective and the true shape of the room is trapezoidal: the walls are slanted and the ceiling and floor are at an incline, and the right corner is much closer to the front-positioned observer than the left corner (or vice versa). (See overhead view diagram to the right)\r\n\r\nAs a result of the optical illusion, a person standing in one corner appears to the observer to be a giant, while a person standing in the other corner appears to be a dwarf. The illusion is so convincing that a person walking back and forth from the left corner to the right corner appears to grow or shrink.\r\n\r\nStudies have shown that the illusion can be created without using walls and a ceiling; it is sufficient to create an apparent horizon (which in reality will not be horizontal) against an appropriate background, and the eye relies on the apparent relative height of an object above that horizon.', ''),

Some time ago, one of his buddies videotaped him throwing a golf ball in the air, then keeping it in the air with a .22 pistol until the magazine was empty! \n\n\nThe tape was sent to Bennelli (Beretta''s parent company)for review. Bradley now has his own TV show, and tours with Tom Knapp exhibition shooting. His first 5 years contract was inked a year ago for an undisclosed amount. \n\n\nHe is considered the best shot in history, and the contract with Beretta is believed to be well over a million dollars a year. \n\n\nAs you watch the attached video, notice the number of times he fires the shotgun "one-handed." We are talking with the new design no recoil......WOW! \n\n\nLast but not least: 12 on-target shots in 1.73 seconds? Well, seeing is believing!

(421759, 'Partial market Survey - Lucky Star Brief survey\r\n\r\nAfter I got my pistol licence from mega arms (after a 6 week wait)  I decided to conduct a survey of the different dealers in the market. \r\n\r\nFirst port of call\r\n\r\nMega arms:\r\n\r\nThe Proprietor Mr. Danish is an amiable fellow. So amiable in fact that in trying to convince me to buy a Taurus PT 709 local clone. He even pressed the gun to my shoulder and pressed the trigger.\r\n\r\nAs regards the clone, it was quite simply the best one I have ever seen. No exaggeration. The packaging : Original cardboard box and thick light blue plastic wrap were pureTaurus. The weapon itself was quite unlike any other clone/knock off I ever handled\r\n\r\nHe even offered to open her up an let me take a sneak peak in her innards. But I was more excited by his offer to let me try her out at his shooting range above his show room.  I bought a few rounds and popped them off.  She recoiled like a she doggy in heat. But since I have never fired an original 709 I cant compare. Besides that the decocker/manual safety were both far easier on the hand then even a CF 98. \r\nI was impressed. Even more so by the prize tag. Rs. 30,000/- Danish sat me down and told me in as sincere a tone as any dealer can get. \r\n\r\n“This is the weapon I use for SD myself.. Look, a showroom full of imported weaponry  and I stil use this only. Buy it because I am telling you to do so.. U will never go wrong with it. “Trust me brother and you don’t even need to do the rounds of the market.  Just buy it!\r\n\r\nOstensibly, it was manufactured by Danish arms company (No relation) However since DAC did not use their brand name but rather preferred the legend “Made in Brazil” I was not impressed.  He said “In weddings I have fired hundreds of rounds from this weapon” (No he was not interested in Newton’s Law of Universal Gravitation) \r\n\r\nHe charged me Rs. 17k per licence. I only wanted one for a pistol, but got saddled with a shotgun one as well.  He had promised a discount on the second licence. But kind of decided it won’t be worth his while to give me one. Since he claimed that now licences are worth Rs. 20K each.  Since I am on the verge of losing my job I have no inclination of getting a shotgun which I don’t need anyway. So the licence is lying in his showroom. He did save me a trip to the national bank though and got both the licences stamped. \r\n\r\nDid I have a good experience? Compared to other dealers definitely! \r\n\r\nVerdict: My shoulder is intact and I got to fire a weapon that I won’t normally touch (Local clones sporting foreign brands are not exactly at the top of my priority list) \r\n\r\nMy next port of call was TNT arms next to Baluchistan traders, Lucky star area. \r\nThis fine gentle man when I walked into his shop with my brand new licence looked me up and down and asked me if I am just going to look or am I going to buy. He said he is not going to bother opening cartons of his wares until and unless I make a commitment to buy beforehand! \r\n\r\nVerdict: Maybe he was having a bad hair day… \r\n\r\nAfter that it was Moon star arms. \r\nThe individual showed me a few local TTs ranging from 7 to 9.5k. When I asked him the reason behind the price range (They all looked the same to me) he said ‘Quality’.  When I persisted he was slightly irritated “Brother, if one is more expensive than the other its obvious its higher quality” (sigh) I really felt silly for trying to argue with such unassailable logic…  I told him about Pak guns and he was like business is difficult enough in the real world now you people have to start opening up a new front in the computer world…. \r\nI really wanted to see his famous moon star  9mm berretta clones. But he showed me just about everything but those. They were woth 20k btw.. No discount possible\r\nVerdict: I am sure he likes me too as long as I don’t talk bout computers and his famous 9mm berretta clone. (Or ask for nasty things like discounts and differences in quality, Since it’s a factory outlet the “D” word does not apply even when other dealers in the market are offering his products at the same price)\r\nA word of advice: Don’t EVER tell him other dealers are offering at prices lower than him. He really won’t like you if you do so. \r\n\r\nThen I visited his brother’s shot in the same lane. Haji something or other. \r\nI have already purchased from him before. The man showed me his wares, all local clones. 9mms and .30 bores. But when I told him my purpose is serious SD. He looked me in the eye and told me quietly that I should not buy a local clone if I am buying for SD. Only for fun \r\n\r\nVerdict: Great place to buy, if one were to buy for ‘fun’ (Once I figure out whatever that means) \r\n\r\nOn to jawed Armoury: \r\nHe had been watching me plodding all over the street so I decided to grace him with a visit. \r\nWhile I was going through his wares a man walks in with the look of a constipated kid. “Please do-you-have-allama.32 pistol” When the shop keeper said no he literally scratched his head “look I am going crazy looking for it can you at least tell me the price. Once again the monosyllabic no. and the poor ‘llama hunter’ went out still muttering bout how he is going crazy looking for his beloved ‘llama’  (No pun intended) The shop keeper gave me his best  I-get-all-kinds-look and told me to stay away from local guns. He did have some really, really neat local shotguns with drum mags. However I had been admonished from buying those so I left. \r\n\r\nVerdict: A ''No'' nonsense individual who believes in monosyllables when confronted by heartbroken gun lovers. If you have a deep craving for a .32 Llama he is definitely not your man!\r\n\r\nThen on to Saddar armoury. \r\nHe repeated the ‘Say no to (local) guns mantra. He told me that only Cougher has a rotating barrel mechanism. And anyone who says that the CF 98 has one is just plain wrong.

(421970, '22LR - Curious Now Interested This web site is for people that are interested in firearms and hunting. Some land here out of curiosity. At times, some of those become interested in this hobby. If you are out of the curiosity-woods and into the land of the interested - this post is addressed to you. You are now thinking of acquiring a firearm and are in need of some guidance.\n \nMost in this hobby got a taste of guns and hunting by tagging along with a family member or a friend into the filed. Or, our initial experience was with firing a firearm of a family member or one belonging to a friend. You, like many others that got into this hobby, are concerned about the gun recoil. This is a valid concern for most beginners.\n \nIf a member your family or a friend owns a weapon, let them know of your newly acquired interest. Be prepared for a long listening period as they will tell stories about their gun(s) and how they themselves first got interested in this hobby.\n \nMost beginner get into this hobby with shooting paper targets. From here, many go into hunting and still others branch out into competition shooting. For most, expense of getting into the hobby is a key factor. If you follow the wise guidance of the experts on this site, you will save money and acquire a firearm that will in all likelihood become an investment. A decade later you may be able to sell it for the same price you paid initially to acquire it. In the interim you will have had the free use of it!\n \nNow - what to acquire. My advice is to get a 22LR. This cartridge is world-known. It is the cheapest brass cartridge available, bar none. It has hardly any recoil to think of. It is ideal for paper target and small game. Even after you acquire large caliber guns, the 22LR will remain you favorite firearm. Life is too short; go out any enjoy - get a 22LR.', ''),

(422129, 'Range report PPS 43 So I finally had a chance to take the PPS to a local gravel pit and try it out.\r\n\r\nI was somewhat concerned as my initial research online showed that some of these guns have had mechanical design problems, ranging from easily broken hammers, to suddenly running off in full auto, constant jamming, failure to run on certain ammo types, or the hammer not resetting after cycling, or the magazines not all working with the gun.\r\n\r\nFortunately, I had none of these problems! \r\n\r\nFirst off, I fired the gun from a single point sling, and aimed from my chest. Point shooting seems the best way to work this beast as it doesn''t have a stock, and the sights are not optimal for a handgun.  I found firing a round, and correcting based on impact allowed me to readily and accurately concentrate fire with it. I was engaging targets up to about 30 yards away. Next time I''ll try it out to about 100 yards which is the limits of the pit I was shooting out.\r\n\r\nEnd results? This is a perfectly accurate "bullet hose" and as my shooting skills improve, it should only get better. The downside is that it is incredibly easy to burn up 140 rounds of .30 Tokarev when running from 35 round mags.  I''m going to tinker with it and put better close range sights on it, and experiment with using it as a handgun.', ''),

I have found it to give me good results from 15 yards to 40 yards, hence I didnt find any need to switch over to Mod choke. Since you do a lot of duck hunting, what are your views on cartrg & choke for river duck shooting here?

Take away everything related to guns for a second.\r\n\r\nA moving object has kinetic energy... when an object contacts another object and slows down it transfers that energy into the other object(basic theory of physics energy cannot be created or destroyed) \r\nSo now... You take a water jug, place a pencil standing up, touching it, and flick the other end... the energy of your flick is transfered into the jug, into the water, out of the jug, and knocks the pencil over... Hydrostatic shock, the water is not moving(static) but transfers the energy in a form of a shockwave into the pencil.\r\n\r\nNow apply it to guns, hit a watermelon with a rifle...it blows out the sides in addition to a exit hole... the shockwave of the bullet suddenly hitting a liquid medium(watermelon internals) transfers energy through it until it blows the skin out on the watermelon, releasing all the energy which intern throws the flesh out of the watermelon.... hydrostatic shock.\r\n\r\nAnd.. on another point which I typically hear, pistol bullets don''t create hydrostatic shock..

(422669, ' A friend of mine bought a 92fs clone thinking he had gotten the real beretta slightly used for a good price, looked just like the stainless steel version of the 92fs, he showed it to me a few days later and at first glance it looked like the real thing, the finish seemed pretty good, however when I checked the magazine it didn''t feel like a genuine US made mag, very rough finish, didn''t fit too well either, we thought maybe its been more than slightly used perhaps, took it to the range and test fired it afterwards, after only 20 rds it started to jam evry 6 or 7 rds, FTF, FTE as well. I decided we should disassemble and check it, after disassembly we could not put it back together easily, considerable fiddling was required which should not happen with an original 92fs as its very easy to field strip and re-assemble. Afterwards, the ambidextrous safety catch also stopped functioning and one side of it got chipped off for no apparent reason. All this after firing hardly 20-23 rounds! and the ammo wasn''t an issue since we were using S&Bs. Thats how we found out that its a local copy. Hence I wouldn''t advise buying a clone.

(see link below)  These are quality build Koren manufactured and having/increasing very good reputation in all international markets. \r\n\r\n[url]http://www.evanix.com/viewall.html[/url]\r\n\r\nThey have number of different models but as per your budget limit $1K the recommended model is "Evanix Rainstrom" (follow link below) You can get this particular PCP along with all accessories including 3 stage stirrup pump with in your budget. \r\n\r\n[url]http://www.pyramydair.com/s/m/Evanix_Rainstorm_PCP_air_rifle/2059;jsessionid=488E593E40CEF25DD96EF8DA9C1CBB6A.app01[/url] \r\n\r\nYou can easily find/buy these evanix air rifles from USA but unfortunately these are not so common in UK.  \r\n\r\nBefore knowing about these Evanix PCPs I use to think about Benjamin Marauder just like you are having in your mind this time but as per my findings and with the help of one PCP professional I consider this "Rainstrom" is much better option than Benjamin Marauder.    \r\n\r\nThis is my opinion as per my own findings but you can explore it by yourself.

(422760, 'kindly give the adress and phone# from where i can purchase sdass [QUOTE=Abbas;71]Salams,\n\nI would like to post a mini review and share my experiences with the FabArm SDASS compact. I''d like to start by explaining what SDASS stands for, it''s short for Special Defense And Security Shotgun. Which is an appropriate description of this shotgun. \n\nIt is a 7 + 1 pump action shotgun. The finish is excellent and the compact model comes with a fixed pistol grip as well as a folding stock. It''s lightweight and fits in your hands and shoulder nicely. The pump action is a little rough but solid. A plus point of buying a FABARM shotgun is that they usually come with their patented Tri-Bore barrel. At first I thought that was mostly a gimmic to sell their weapons but FABARM really have something going with that technology and it has become a unique selling point for them. Instead of long explanations of the tech, the Tri Bore translates into lesser/softer recoil, tighter shot patterns/ closer groupings and deeper shot penetration. At about 50 feet the shot was grouped in an area about twice the diameter of a CD/DVD / smaller than a football. \n\nThe barrel tech seems good as I rapid fired 7 rounds and the barrel was hot to touch but still could be held by hand.   \n\nThe recoil is excellent, the Tribore design helps and the rubber padded folding stock really acts as a shock absorber. Infact \nthe recoil was noticeably lesser even when compared to a Winchester Defender 1300 which was being fired side by side and is one of the best shotguns of all time. \n      \nI bought my SDASS a year ago for Rs. 70,000 from Lahore which is a very fair price for an Italian made shotgun in Pakistan.\n\nAnother thing I would like to mention is that it looks simply breathtaking while being fired at night. The sound is great as well, deep and very .12 gauge but just seeing the gun fire in darkness is a treat in itself. \n\nI liked it so much that my brother bought one for himself as well. Highly Recommended for under 80 K!\n\n\n\nHere are some pictures of SDASS and some weblinks.\n\n[IMG]http://i262.photobucket.com/albums/ii99/AbbasMalik/Fabarm1.jpg[/IMG]\n\n[IMG]http://i262.photobucket.com/albums/ii99/AbbasMalik/Fabarm2.jpg[/IMG]\n\n[IMG]http://i262.photobucket.com/albums/ii99/AbbasMalik/Fabarm3.jpg[/IMG]\n\n[IMG]http://i262.photobucket.com/albums/ii99/AbbasMalik/Fabarm4.jpg[/IMG]\n\n[IMG]http://i262.photobucket.com/albums/ii99/AbbasMalik/Fabarm5.jpg[/IMG]\n\n\n[URL]http://www.fabarm.com/products-sdass-compact.htm[/URL]\n\n\nOh and here''s Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie using it in Mr and Mrs Smith ;) (House shoot out scene) \n\n[IMG]http://www.imfdb.org/images/d/dd/Mr_and_Mrs_Smith_29-1-.jpg[/IMG]salam \n              kindly give the adress and phone# from where i can purchase sdass', ''),

The fit and finish of the SAM is sloppy. The "race gun" parts the Blue Thunder comes with are not high quality parts as Wilson or Nowlin after market parts would be. As an all around shooter, the SAM is a good pistol, but if I were going to use it for compition, I would opt for the used Springfield.The Twin Pines model is a simple, old-style 1911 pistol. The markings on the slide made no reference to the model name, but the slide did display a bold insigne featuring a large cannon and the words Rock Island Armory. I was impressed by its clean edges and evenly applied finish. The heavy wood grips were very tasteful. They were smooth rather than checkered, clearly displaying the attractive wood pattern. The sights were a low-mount design, as found on the original Browning. When sighting on a target, I found them easily. Cocking serrations appeared on the rear of the slide, and vertical lines were cut into the flat mainspring housing. A beavertail grip safety was included, but it was narrow at the tang. The Twin Pines also lacks other niceties found on modern pistols, including a skeletonized hammer and trigger, both of which decrease lock time and, as a result, cycling speed. I''m also considering to check out Metro Arms too, but for now i really deeply interested with this ZIG 1911''s, so tomorrow my and my friend will got to the fire range to test those bad boys.', ''),
