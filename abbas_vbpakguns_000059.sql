A good value for money.\nhere is some details and information which might be helpful.\n\n[B]Pressure & bar:[/B]\nIts Cylinder can hold upto 350 bar pressure max. and from 300 to 140 bars, it can shot with same FPS of and range because of seperate chamber. where the pressure is remained. 100 shots in total.\n\nsecondly, CNG means ( compressed natural gas) which is high inflamable (never use it, its gona burn you and ur gun alive ), CNG Bar pressure is between 180 to 240 max. whereas, its PCP Cylinder can hold pressure upto 350 Bars. Recommended pressure is 300 Bars-140 bars underwhich you can have accurate and long range shot.\nNote: Never use oxygen, Co2 or any other gas, always use flitered dry atmospheric gas to get PCP cylinders filled. Otheriwse you will destory ur weapon. for Co2, there are seperate carteriges or cylinders as recomended by its company.\n\nthirdly, Lahore Shooting Club does have PCP filling facility but for members and it costs 25k membership fee, and they refill it with 200 bars max. \n\nfourthly, hand pump isnt a good idea at all, it needs 400 pumps to get to almost 200 bars and as bars increase effort to pump increases ( very intensive labor required to fill) implies on all PCPs\n\n[B]Accuracy and Range:[/B]\nNow come to real world senairo. You have 8 shots in its round. with the range of 25-60 meters you can shoot 8 birds, never gona miss any. so with 100 shots means 100 birds. its plenty for a day. Isnt it?\n[I]why i assumed above senario ? please read below[/I]\nIts meant for long range thats why the Scope its 8-32 x, which means one can target something which is 8 times far from you. Normally the scopes used for .22 caliber air guns are 3-9x. It has good powerful telescope, its range is 320 Meters, which is again 300 yards plus, this means it can accurately shoot till there. \n[B]\nPoweR & Quality:[/B]\nas mentioned above, it starts from 300 Bars and ends at 140bars (recomended for .22 caliber to refill) for 40 Joules pressure . its one most powerful air gun, as compered with discovery, it can be compered with bejimen rifles only.\nIts cylinder have life expentancy of 10 years. after that it needs a service and replacement of its cylinders.\nYeah one more thing, one cannt hear a thing (gun fire sound) who is 10 meters fars. So, GAME/PLIKING wont hear a thing when you shoot and wont fly becuz you are far from them. 1250 has a compensator cum silencer which increases its velocity and decreases its sound. \n\nit has zero recoil and very low sound.  \n[B]\nPricing:[/B]\nBuying a good airgun is not everyday job, its kinda once in a lifetime thing for me when one grows up or leaves the teenage ( teenagers should go for .177 (4.5mm) and should buy pump rifles of daisy or crossman for target practicing)\nDiana (break Barrel) or any other with side lever are old tech guns, one should go for the latest and approved technology air guns. PCPs are new and are better than Co2 even, because its easier to maintain and with almost no maintaince except oiling once a week or once in a month.\nthus, for Murgabi, pigions etc even wildboar & jackals(head shots) can be killed with ease. so, for having 100% results paying some extra bucks /Rupees isnt an issue. \n\nIt Costs around 100k ( one Lakh) rupees while discovery with pump is about 80 K. \n\n\nThus, thats what i come across, after reading reviews on differenct country blogs and some market OOGLING in Lahore, I personally find it best and It made me think ZILLION Times before going and making a purchase of WALTHER 1250 Dominator FT for 1 Lakh Rupees, Today, Alhumdolillah \n\nlast, about refilling the PCP Cylinder at 300 Bars exact, i m looking a proper way. IF any PCP owner Knows how to get it done cheaply in Lahore please do inform me, else i  m gona post it inshallah as well.\nAnyone can contact me for more details at 0321 8787333. I searched almost 90% of websites, read reviews internationally regarding PCP rifles and their performances. and i personally think its a good value for Money. thats all.[/QUOTE]\n\n\n\n\ndear salman, i have dominator its very nice gun, you should go for manual pump, it is easy, u just need less then 50 pumps to fill 250 bar which is more enought, because there is no cheap way other then hand pump other wise you will spend 8 lack to buy a good high presure electrict pump, i have one i imported it from uk and it cost me 8 lak rupees. but still i am using hand pump 250 bas 60 nice shots enought for me.', 1, 0, '182.185.61.225', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

I had the required letter issued by National Rifles Association of Pakistan (NRAP) stating I was going to play in the championship,&#8221; he said while talking to &#8216;The News&#8217;. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nHe further said it is usual for skeet shooters going abroad for tournaments to only have NRAP&#8217;s letter, but this demand from the Customs annoyed me because any letter from the interior ministry was not required. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n&#8220;The customs officials showed me their rules book in which it was written that a letter from the Ministry of Interior is required for carrying weapons. But I know that for shooters the NRAP&#8217;s letter suffices,&#8221; he said, adding that it was understood that a shooter carried his weapon for any event he was taking part in. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nUsman said it was very disappointing for him as he had been training hard for the last three months and had spent more than Rs500,000. &#8220;I am at a loss; who is going to compensate me, the customs or NRAP,&#8221; he questioned. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nHe further said that he tried hard to convince the customs officials at Lahore airport but they refused to listen. &#8220;I came back home dejected when the time of my flight lapsed. I was denied a bright chance of representing Pakistan at the championship despite my hard training for months,&#8221; he added. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nSecretary NRAP Javed Lodhi said this was the first time in three years that customs did not allow a shooter to carry his weapon despite seeing their letter. &#8220;I have been here for the last three years as the secretary. Every year we send a number of shooters to international competitions but this never happened before,&#8221; he said. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nHe further said that this demand by the customs department to have a clearance letter from the Ministry of Interior was shocking. &#8220;The practice is that we issue a letter to those shooters who go abroad for competitions stating that this person is carrying a weapon so he or she should not be held by customs. This is a common practice and never has any incident of denial of boarding happened to any shooter,&#8221; he added. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nTherefore, he added, stopping Usman was very disappointing. &#8220;We will write a letter to the customs department that this was a bad thing to happen to a very talented player,&#8221; he added. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nBut it appears that there is a conflict regarding this issue. A skeet shooter based in Karachi was asked by this scribe about the practice of clearance of weapons. &#8220;NRAP issues letter to both the customs department and the Ministry of Interior, requesting them to allow weapons for shooters going abroad for competitions. Then the interior ministry issues clearance letter and shooters have to show that to the customs department before leaving,&#8221; he added. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nUsman was to represent Pakistan for the first time at any international event and had been aiming at the gold medal. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nHe was supposed to leave on December 1 to show his skills at the championship in which 117 players of 12 countries are contesting. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nUsman, who won all gold medals in the categories of trap, double trap, and skeet at Punjab Games this year, said after this incident he would consider playing for Army or Navy. &#8220;I didn&#8217;t want to leave Punjab, but now I don&#8217;t feel like playing for Punjab as nobody supported me.

As far as Kinetic energy is concerned.. the .45 has more kinetic energy than 9mm.. It is a better round than 9mm.

[/QUOTE]\r\n\r\nBro, kindly stay with the topic. we are discussing which one is more potent. lets not indulge ourselves in useless examples when simple mathematics is approachable and quiet at hand and more than enough to prove a point. i am sure you must have guessed by now that maths is my favorite subject.\r\n\r\n[QUOTE=atiq;325550]however with the development of the newer ammos such as 10 mm which TOPS the list.. many of the federal agencies in US are opting for it. next is .44 magnum and same is case it is rated just below the 10mm in ballistics.  [/QUOTE]\r\n\r\nBro, what are you talking about. kindly revisit ballistics table.\r\n\r\n[QUOTE=atiq;325550]As far as Kinetic energy is concerned.. the .45 has more kinetic energy than 9mm.. It is a better round than 9mm. [/QUOTE]\r\n\r\nwhere? when? how? lets c\r\n\r\n[QUOTE=atiq;325550]Simply put as an example it would be the same as throwing a smaller hammer which will go farther.. but when you throw a larger hammer it will travel less far but have more kinetic energy.[/QUOTE]\r\n\r\nbro, if you trying to demonstrate KE through this example then I am afraid this example is irrelevant. remember smaller hammers do not go further. reason: law of physics..... heavier hammers do not travel less... reason: law of physics. what happens.......umm.... this is going to take a while. :)\r\n\r\nif you are going to give a correct example then how about: what happens when a 1 kilo bird strikes an airplane as opposed to what happens when a 10 kilo hammer strikes a static object?\r\n\r\n[QUOTE=atiq;325550]I feel that i have stepped on your toes or tail.. ;).. [/QUOTE]\r\n\r\nlols! bro, my tail (and toe) hurts along with alot of other guys who know a thing a two about this particular subject.\r\n\r\n[QUOTE=atiq;325550]Brother the flesh and the gelatin tests have prooved it that the vacuum that is produced behind the bullets is the main cause of hemorrhage and damage to tissue. I hope you have seen some of the photographs where they have done extensive testing.[/QUOTE]\r\n\r\nirrelevant as we are discussing kinetic energies only. lets talk numbers only  for simplicity''s sake. and no.. vacuum is not produced behind an object moving in known space. unless the object is moving in vaccum in the first place. how? well...........do I really have to say that again: ITS LAW OF PHYSICS. :)\r\n\r\n[QUOTE=atiq;325550]The ballistics of .45 are one of the tops just behind 10mm and .44 magnum cartridges." if my statement is confusing let me explain.. [B].45 is just behind 10mm[/B] and .44 magnum cartridges in ballistics if seen from the top towards descending order. [/QUOTE]\r\n\r\nBro, read that list again and this time a little more carefully. in terms of ballistics, .45acp is not just behind 10mm. kindly quote a link to the list where you are getting this information from. on any ballistics chart/table, you''ll find many calibers listed between 10mm and 45acp. you know what that means?\r\n\r\n[QUOTE=atiq;325550]Brother if i seriously need to look at my calculations then you should start reading more.. if recoil doesnt depend on the amount of propellant then 7x57 should give the same kick as 7mm rem mag; which will stand true your scientific theory.[/QUOTE]\r\n\r\nwow! is that the best you could come up with? why should they recoil the same...hmmmm....? does 7RM and 7M have same weights? do they have similar bullet profiles? do they have similar ogive? or one is a secant and other an ogive? do they have similar velocities? what is the burn rate of the propellants in the two? is it similar? are their case capacities similar? HINT (H2o) do they have similar pressure curves?\r\n\r\nbefore well.... by the time you''ll be able to answer all those questions.... I am sure you''ll learn that they cannot have similar recoils and brother..... its not a question of more propellant.\r\n\r\na little example for you: NC11/11 weighs more... takes up more space....to offer similar power as compare to CSB-4. reason: burn rate and pressure curve.\r\n\r\njust an example. if you need more. do let me know. ;)\r\n\r\n[QUOTE=atiq;325550]I hope you have fired a .45 cal for testing on something and seen the damage YOURSELF.[/QUOTE]\r\n\r\nBro... been there done that. :)\r\n\r\nRegards.', 1, 1, '39.47.180.113', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

Our GM Administration was referred to a security agency where every official''s title was nothing less than Major (R) or Captain (R), who claimed that most of their personnel are ex-SSG.\r\n\r\nAfter a couple of days we saw a person dressed in camouflage at our office entrance, holding the weight of a rifle with box magazine and folding stock. His tummy size was bigger than my 38 inches. The GM Administration during the morning tea tried to praise his efficiency by saying that ex-SSG person armed with ‘Kilashin’ has been appointed for staff security. I was unable to control my laugh but kept quite despite questions.\r\n\r\nLater went to GM’s office and asked him to call the guard. Tried to explain that this is a good-for-nothing AK-47 look alike semi-automatic desi rifle chambered for 8mm bullet. The guard was unable to answer simple questions like number of bullets inside the magazine, difference between semi and automatic rifle, effective range of rifle he was carrying, etc. The poor guy told us that he used to work at a car service station and lost the job. After remaining jobless for about three months he has found this job where he will get some Rs. 2,900 per month for a full-week / 12-hour duty. He never fired a single bullet from any weapon.\r\n\r\nI checked the rifle, which contained ten bullets in the magazine. The bolt jammed when I pull it—though it was returned manually. I removed the magazine and pulled the bolt again to remove the bullet. Guess what? The bullet was caught in the chamber, while the bolt came back and jammed again. I tried to convince the GM Administration that our Pakhtoon watchman who has been hired to stay at the office during night maybe more reliable with a 30 Caliber TT Pistol --- but the GM considered this as my interference in his department’s activities.\r\n\r\nAfter some days during a day-off, the same Pakhtoon watchman (on my secret instruction) stripped the rifle and the guard nearly fainted. The poor guy recovered only when the watchman brought it back to its shape after applying emery paper to some parts, properly cleaning and lubricating it.\r\n\r\nI am thankful to Allah that no such situation came up when the ‘armed-guard’ has to be utilized.

Our management advised our security company to replace them with "Jawans" (young men) as the old guys are slow. The security company did not agree but somehow replaced half of the guards with Jawans. One day I was standing outside my office and new "Jawan" guard was racking his pump action (DSA) again and again, when I inquired that what is going on, he showed me the gun and pulled the trigger without ensuring that its muzzle is in safe direction or not. The gun did not fire, then he asked me, see, it is not working even it is not loading cartridge in the chamber. Meanwhile, the "Old" guard came and told me that he has just pushed magazine cut-off. After that I interviewed the Jawan guard and to my surprise, he was peon at some office before this new job and he has fired only 5 cartridges in life and that too during orientation conducted by security company.

Despite a plethora of guns of all shapes and sizes bearing his name, John Browning will perhaps forever be remembered for his classic masterpiece, the [B]M1911[/B]; the fact that the M1911 is the world''s most replicated, cloned and copied handgun stands as a testament to this.\n\nThe [B]Shooters Arms Manufacturing "Desert Storm"[/B] is a Philippine-made Government-model, all-steel 1911 available in both the traditional .45ACP and the 9mm Parabellum. This particular 1911 model (chambered in 9mm) comes with all the bells & whistles one would expect from a high-end competition handgun; in fact, on a budget, this beast just might be the ideal range weapon. Let''s take a detailed look at it.\n\n\n[B]Initial Impression:[/B]\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]15298[/ATTACH]\n\nThe Desert Storm comes in a simple, almost flimsy, and bland plastic case. Upon opening it, you find the gun and 2 9-round MecGar magazines (the mags, by the way, are Italian, [B]not[/B] Turkish-made). That''s it. Nothing more. No cleaning tools, no manual, no documentation of any kind, nothing. To say that it''s a bit disappointing to see the gun without any "accessories" is an understatement. On the other hand, this being a "budget high-end competition pistol", I guess the manufacturer had to cut certain expenses.\n\nHowever, all disappointment (and curses sent the manufacturer''s way) suddenly vaporise as soon as you lay your eyes on the gun itself. To put it simply, the Desert Storm is absolutely [B]beautiful![/B] There''s literally no other word in the human vocabulary to describe the gun; it''s like the "Monica Bellucci meets Sasha Grey" of handguns, sheer elegance & super sexiness all rolled into one. Every inch of the gun compels you to pick it up and caress every corner of it''s being.\n\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]15299[/ATTACH]\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]15304[/ATTACH]\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]15305[/ATTACH]\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]15306[/ATTACH]\n\n\n[B]Ergonomics & Features:[/B]\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]15307[/ATTACH]\nAs soon as you pick up the Desert Storm, three things immediately burst into your mind:\n[LIST]\n[*]First, the gun feels simple amazing! The extended bevertail, the grip angle, the placement of the safety, everything is sheer perfection.\n[*]Second, the gun fits your hand like a glove and feels like a natural extension of your arm.\n[*]Third, the gun is [B]bloody heavy![/B] At over a kilo (empty), the Desert Storm is definitely [B]NOT[/B] carry-friendly and can cause quite an arm-sore at the shooting range if you''re solely used to polymer toy guns! :p\n[/LIST]\n\nAs mentioned earlier, the Desert Storm comes with quite a handful of premium features like an extended safety (although the safety is not ambidextrous), extended beavertail, heavy & aggressive chequering on both the front and backstrap, walnut wood grips, a bevelled magazine well (Taurus could learn a thing or two from the Desert Storm about bevelled magazine wells!), full-length guide rod, wide & prominent slide serrations, etc. All in all, it''s quite a sweet package!\n\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]15303[/ATTACH]\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]15313[/ATTACH]\n\ncontinued...', 1, 1, '110.36.195.23', 0, 1, 10, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

Very sorry to say that this is our nation wide dilemma that we don&#8217;t bother to understand or get the Islamic teachings I saw many people saying that &#8216;falan molvi sb is wrong&#8217; and  &#8216;falan molvi sb ka qul or fail main tazad ha&#8217; but we don&#8217;t ever think about us who we are and what are we doing these are the people who don&#8217;t know the faraiz and wajibat of  namaz I can say with full confidence that more then 90% of people in this forum don&#8217;t know and never bothered to know the  faraiz and wajibat of namaz as many of us pray 5 time daily and do sajda e sahw when do mistake in namaz ,as this is not a part of my discussion but I grief and grief  lot on whats going on with muslims and what we are doing, I just tell you one thing and then just move on to my topic ,I say that you people do sajda e sahaw every time but very less of you know when to do sajda e sahaw  mean on which mistake we do sajda e sahaw and on which mistake the salah is not completed by just sajda e sahaw,I can say with full confidence that 90% of people praying don&#8217;t know this they just do it on every mistake (If any one want to know this he could contact his imam masjid if he is alim or can contact me on my email [EMAIL="kahatab@gmail.com"]kahatab@gmail.com[/EMAIL]),by discussing this I just want to bring you people on one point and the point is &#8220;We must learn before we do&#8217;.Now I come to my original topic.\n \n[B]Which  bird is halal and which is haram:[/B]\nI just give you a simple rule follow this and got your ans,\n \n&#8216;Tamam parinda halal hain kisi ko haram kahna ke koi wajha nai siwai un parindon ka jo shikar kar ka kahata hain ya un ki ghiza faqat gandagi ha&#8217;\n \nSome say that the birds who eats by getting help from there claws are haram there is no difference between the two but the rule which I discussed is original and more comprehensive because the ellat of hurmat is shikar and the birds who do shikar definitely get help from there claws, and the second thing is the bird who always eat dirt are haram these birds are normally found in the area near garbage dumps and sewerage canals in the city areas normally these birds are not found but some hens get addicted of eating dirt  so one must take care.\nHere I want to tell you an interesting thing which very less of you know the thing is there is an exception of this rule one bird which eats while getting help from its claws but still it is halal !!! and that is PARROT .Parrot is halal its another thing that it is not eaten any where but still it is halal some people say that it is makruh it is not even makruh fully halal .Thats why I said that the rule I had discussed is more more comprehensive then the later one.\nOne or two days before I am reading a thread here some one had posted a pic of a bird  the bird had a long legs and he asked to the people that is this bird halal or haram the other said that you must see that is it got help with its claws while eating or not if it get then haram and if not then halal he must know that the first one is going on shikar not for the research on birds so let me tell you one more easy rule to get a quick reply of a bird being halal or haram but keep in mind the original rule is the first ,these are just a signs the thing is you must see its beak if its beak has a sharp bend and had a pointed sharp end then this must be haram bird nearly all of the halal birds don&#8217;t have one or both.\n[IMG]https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcQburdazk-LywHegAesCB20cyAySE4coCMGLVEHdHqml29a-azy[/IMG]\nSome people are very strange they just say and say and don&#8217;t  think what they are saying in pg I read one thread some one is saying maina is halal other said that yes maina is halal but red beaked maina is not halal .I am just amazed with his jahalat I can ask whats the diff between the two is the second one had one eye or had a eye aver its back so that it is haram just amazing  both the maina&#8217;s are halal no dalil of saying any one of them as haram the color never makes any thing haram.The thing is the same which I said above we had a time for every thing we had a time for watching tv, playing games, eating food ,doing gup shup with friends even two or three hours but we don&#8217;t have any time for our religion if we spent only half an hour for reading religious books after an year we will be a scholar but sorry to say we don&#8217;t have time this is because we don&#8217;t have belief on akrat and life after death .See what your prophet says:\nProphet PBUH said:\n \n''Tum kisifasiq (gunhgar) par kisi namat ke wajha sa rask mat karna kun ka tumhain maloom nain ka akrat main us ka sath kaya paish ana wala ha akhrat main allah ka han us ka lia aik aisa qatil ah jis ko kabhi mot nai&#8217;.\n\nIf we want jannah and evade naar we must have to learn islam and follow its rules with full devotion other wise the wrong path leads to the wrong destiny.\n \n[B]About Zibha :[/B]\n I had saw many pics of hunted birds and animals like rabbits in this forum but I saw a strange thing that  people don&#8217;t slaughter the bird or animal\nafter shooting it \n[IMG]http://www.pakguns.com/attachment.php?attachmentid=8207&stc=1&d=1328554031[/IMG]\n [IMG]http://www.pakguns.com/attachment.php?attachmentid=8204&stc=1&d=1328554019[/IMG]\nIt seems to me from this pics that the man who shoots it don&#8217;t slaughter and i saw many other pics too  man it will be haram if you don&#8217;t slaughter it after shooting a pallet  .\nThe masala is ,the bullet or an airgun pallet if it is pointed heaving a very sharp point I think like the point of a  lmg &#8216;s bullet\n[IMG]https://encrypted-tbn2.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcQC1PIWJPC9reOrULQI800QlzFf8l7Z5UCDUa7yChM8ZVNcCb4fVjvODjos[/IMG]\nif you shoot with this kind of a bullet or any throwing wapon and say before throwing bismillah he allah o akbar and shoots on the bird or animal and the bird died before you reached it to slaughter it will be halal but if you shoot with the pallets like gamo promagnum or gamo machdiablo or any other pallet that don&#8217;t have the sharp pointed end then you must have to slaughter the bird before it dye and if it die before you slaughter it will be haram.Keep in mind and place you shoot accordingly .', 1, 0, '175.110.147.198', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

You do not shoot at 100 or 200 yards; so the .45 has retained itself in US for taking down BG in the LEA arena.. however with the development of the newer ammos such as 10 mm which TOPS the list.. many of the federal agencies in US are opting for it. next is .44 magnum and same is case it is rated just below the 10mm in ballistics. As far as Kinetic energy is concerned.. the .45 has more kinetic energy than 9mm.. It is a better round than 9mm. Simply put as an example it would be the same as throwing a smaller hammer which will go farther.. but when you throw a larger hammer it will travel less far but have more kinetic energy.\n\n\nI feel that i have stepped on your toes or tail.. ;).. Brother the flesh and the gelatin tests have prooved it that the vacuum that is produced behind the bullets is the main cause of hemorrhage and damage to tissue. I hope you have seen some of the photographs where they have done extensive testing.\n\n\n\n\nI have never said that .45 is better than any of the magnums. Magnums are far superior due to their ballistics due to more propellant behind them thus asking for more metal around the chamber area. I think you should read and re-read my words.. I said was "The ballistics of .45 are one of the tops just behind 10mm and .44 magnum cartridges." if my statement is confusing let me explain.. .45 is just behind 10mm and .44 magnum cartridges in ballistics if seen from the top towards descending order. There are many other calibers also available.. which are intermittently placed in between.\n\n\n\n\nBrother if i seriously need to look at my calculations then you should start reading more.. if recoil doesnt depend on the amount of propellant then 7x57 should give the same kick as 7mm rem mag; which will stand true your scientific theory.\n\n[B]In damage the amount of HOLE that goes into a person and the damage the trailing vacuum does; shows the stopping power of an ammo..

HD/SD encounters are not determined by a single projectile vs a single projectile. so why should we compare the two when one is almost half the weight of the other? 115 vs 230 grains.\r\n\r\nwhat we found out that if 45ACP gives you a deadly uppercut, a 9mm hits you with a jab followed by a cross. what we saw on a bright sunny Sunday of testing is that a combo (jab+cross) inflicts far more damage than a single strike (uppercut).\r\n\r\nin other words, a 9mm is a more potent round when you consider the ability to fire more rounds at your intended target due to less recoil, more controllability, higher magazine capacity, [B]only slightly less expansion[/B], [B]only slightly less projectile holes[/B] (entry and exit) and [B]negligible difference in kinetic energies[/B] of both rounds.\r\n\r\nso... I''ve said it before and I''ll say it again: 9mm might not be a better man-stopper than a 45ACP but it is definitely a more efficient man-stopper than a 45ACP. it draws its efficiency by an overly simplified fact that it competes against a heavyweight (230 grains) while only being a middleweight (115 or 124 grains) and competes well.\r\n\r\nRegards.', 1, 1, '39.47.22.162', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

Pak guns is great and have been amazing in helping me in deciding my 1st 9mm. However, most reviews regarding 9mm are mostly positive that makes it hard to distinguish the better gun!!!\n\nI have visited tactical arms at bahaduarabd as well as national arms on Ma jinnah and I came across the Viking mp446 - solid, rugged, strong and a through gun.. the only downside is it''s look/finish but thats not the most important thing. I also saw the Caniks, CZs, Chinese as well as the Caracal.\n\nThe caracal is a compacter gun (the grip therefore is better) and there are very very good reviews regarding it on PG. Its downside (in my opinion is the "no safety" option) \n\nGuys pls help me figure out what to go for. I know both guns are good and are very different from eachother but I would love it if I can find a comparative suggestion on this.

Than i tried to remove the mud from the windage knob and cleaned it gently too .i left  the thin and fine layer of mud on the knob to get dry.

This is often incorrectly believed to be prohibited in the Geneva Conventions, but it significantly predates those conventions, and is in fact a continuance of the St. Petersburg Declaration of 1868, which banned exploding projectiles of less than 400 grams, as well as weapons designed to aggravate injured soldiers or make their death inevitable. NATO members do not use small arms ammunition that is prohibited by the Hague Convention.\r\n\r\nDespite the ban on military use, hollow-point bullets are one of the most common types of civilian and police ammunition, due largely to the reduced risk of bystanders being hit by over-penetrating or ricocheted bullets, and the increased speed of incapacitation.\r\n\r\nIn many jurisdictions, even ones such as the United Kingdom, where expanding ammunition is generally prohibited, it is illegal to hunt certain types of game with ammunition that does not expand.

(326315, 10511, 0, 'sharpshooter2010', 3856, 'Glossary of firearms terms', 1355222663, 'A\r\n•	accurize, accurizing: The process of altering a stock firearm to improve its accuracy.\r\n•	action: The physical mechanism that manipulates cartridges and/or seals the breech. The term refers to the method in which cartridges are loaded, locked, and extracted from the mechanism. Actions are generally categorized by the type of mechanism used. A firearm action is technically not present on muzzleloaders as all loading is done by hand. The mechanism that fires a muzzle-loader is called the lock.\r\n•	ammunition or ammo: Gunpowder and artillery. Since the design of the cartridge, the meaning has been transferred to the assembly of a projectile and its propellant in a single package.\r\n\r\n B\r\n•	back bore, backbored barrel: A shotgun barrel whose internal diameter is greater than nominal for the gauge, but less than the SAAMI maximum. Done in an attempt to reduce felt recoil, improve patterning, or change the balance of the shotgun.\r\n•	bandolier or bandoleer: A pocketed belt for holding ammunition and cartridges. It was usually slung over the chest. Bandoliers are now rare because most military arms use magazines which are not well-suited to being stored in such a manner. They are, however, still commonly used with shotguns, as individual 12 gauge shells can easily be stored in traditionally designed bandoliers.\r\n•	barrel: A tube, usually metal, through which a controlled explosion or rapid expansion of gases are released in order to propel a projectile out of the end at a high velocity.\r\n•	ballistic coefficient or BC: a measure of projectiles ability to overcome air resistance in flight. It is inversely proportional to the deceleration—a high number indicates a low deceleration. BC is a function of mass, diameter, and drag coefficient. In bullets it refers to the amount that drop over distance and wind drift will affect the bullet.\r\n•	bayonet lug: An attachment point for a bayonet.\r\n•	belt: ammunition belt is a device used to retain and feed cartridges into a firearm.\r\n•	belted magnum or belt: Any caliber cartridge, generally rifles, using a shell casing with a pronounced "belt" around its base that continues 2-4mm past the extractor groove.1 This design originated with the British gunmaker Holland & Holland for the purpose of headspace certain of their more powerful cartridges. Especially the non-shouldered (non-"bottlenecked") magnum rifle cartridges could be pushed too far into the chamber and thus cause catastrophic failure of the gun when fired with excessive headspace; the addition of the belt to the casing prevented this over-insertion.\r\n•	bipod: A support device that is similar to a tripod or monopod, but with two legs. On firearms, bipods are commonly used on rifles to provide a forward rest and reduce motion. The bipod permits the operator to rest the weapon on the ground, a low wall, or other object, reducing operator fatigue and permitting increased accuracy.\r\n•	black powder also called gunpowder: a mixture of sulfur, charcoal, and potassium nitrate. It burns rapidly, producing a volume of hot gas made up of carbon dioxide, water, and nitrogen, and a solid residue of potassium sulfide.2 Because of its burning properties and the amount of heat and gas volume that it generates, gunpowder has been widely used as a propellant in firearms and as a pyrotechnic composition in fireworks. Modern firearms do not use the traditional black powder described here, but instead use smokeless powder.\r\n•	black powder substitute: A firearm propellant that is designed to reproduce the burning rate and propellant properties of black powder (making it safe for use in black powder firearms), while providing advantages in one or more areas such as reduced smoke, reduced corrosion, reduced cost, or decreased sensitivity to unintentional ignition.\r\n•	blank: A type of cartridge for a firearm that contains gunpowder but no bullet or shot. When fired, the blank makes a flash and an explosive sound (report). Blanks are often used for simulation (such as in historical reenactments, theatre and movie special effects), training, and for signaling (see starting pistol). Blank cartridges differ from dummy cartridges, which are used for training or function testing firearms; these contain no primer or gunpowder, and are inert.\r\n•	blowback: A system of operation for self-loading firearms that obtains power from the motion of the cartridge case as it is pushed to the rear by expanding gases created by the ignition of the powder charge.3\r\n•	bluing or blueing: A passivation process in which steel is partially protected against rust, and is named after the blue-black appearance of the resulting protective finish. True gun bluing is an electrochemical conversion coating resulting from an oxidizing chemical reaction with iron on the surface selectively forming magnetite (Fe3O4), the black oxide of iron, which occupies the same volume as metallic iron. Bluing is most commonly used by gun manufacturers, gunsmiths and gun owners to improve the cosmetic appearance of, and provide a measure of corrosion resistance to, their firearms.\r\n•	bolt action: A type of firearm action in which the weapon''s bolt is operated manually by the opening and closing of the breech (barrel) with a small handle. As the handle is operated, the bolt is unlocked, the breech is opened, the spent shell casing is withdrawn and ejected, the firing pin is cocked, and finally a new round/shell (if available) is placed into the breech and the bolt closed.\r\n•	bolt thrust or breech pressure: The amount of rearward force exerted by the propellant gases on the bolt or breech of a firearm action or breech when a projectile is fired. The applied force has both magnitude and direction, making it a vector quantity.\r\n•	bore snake: A tool used to clean the barrel of a gun.\r\n•	boresight: Crude adjustments made to an optical firearm sight, or iron sights, to align the firearm barrel and sights. This method is usually used to pre-align the sights, which makes zeroing (zero drop at XX distance) much faster.\r\n•	brass: The empty cartridge case.\r\n•	break-action: A firearm whose barrels are hinged, and rotate perpendicular to the bore axis to expose the breech and allow loading and unloading of ammunition.\r\n•	breech pressure or Bolt thrust: The amount of rearward force exerted by the propellant gases on the bolt or breech of a firearm action or breech when a projectile is fired. The applied force has both magnitude and direction, making it a vector quantity.\r\n•	bullpup: a firearm configurations in which both the action and magazine are located behind the trigger.\r\n•	burst mode: a firing mode enabling the shooter to fire a predetermined number of rounds with a single pull of the trigger.\r\n•	button rifling: Rifling that is formed by pulling a die made with reverse image of the rifling (the ''button'') down the pre-drilled bore of a firearm barrel. See also cut rifling and hammer forging.\r\n\r\n C\r\n•	caliber/calibre: 1. In small arms, the internal diameter of a firearm''s barrel or a cartridge''s bullet, usually expressed in millimeters or hundredths of an inch; in measuring rifled barrels this may be measured across the lands (such as .303 British) or grooves (such as .308 Winchester). 2. A specific cartridge for which a firearm is chambered, such as .44 Magnum. 3. In artillery, the length of the barrel expressed in terms of the internal diameter; for example, a 3 inch, 30 caliber gun would have a barrel 3 inches in internal diameter and 90 (30 times 3) inches in length.\r\n•	carbine: 1. A shortened version of a service rifle, often chambered in a less potent cartridge. The M4 Carbine is an example which uses the same cartridge but a shorter barrel, whereas the M1 Carbine is an example using a different cartridge. 2. A shortened version of the infantryman''s musket or rifle suited for use by cavalry.\r\n•	cartridge: The assembly consisting of a bullet, gunpowder, shell casing, and primer. When counting, it is referred to as a round.\r\n•	caseless ammunition: a type of small arms ammunition that eliminates the cartridge case that typically holds the primer, propellant, and projectile together as a unit.\r\n•	Casket magazine: a quad stack box magazine.\r\n•	centerfire: A cartridge in which the primer is located in the center of the cartridge case head. Unlike rimfire cartridges, the primer is a separate and replaceable component. The centerfire cartridge has replaced the rimfire in all but the smallest cartridge sizes. Except for low-powered .22 and .17 caliber cartridges, and a handful of antiques, all modern pistol, rifle, and shotgun ammunition are centerfire.\r\n•	chain gun: type of machine gun or autocannon that uses an external source of power to cycle the weapon.\r\n•	chamber: The portion of the barrel or firing cylinder in which the cartridge is inserted prior to being fired. Rifles and pistols generally have a single chamber in their barrels, while revolvers have multiple chambers in their cylinders and no chamber in their barrel.\r\n•	chambering: Inserting a round into the chamber, either manually or through the action of the weapon (e.g., pump-action, lever-action, bolt-action, or automatic-action.).\r\n•	charger: A speedloader that holds several cartridges together in a single unit for easier loading of a firearm''s magazine. A stripper clip is used only for loading the magazine and is not necessary for the firearm to function.\r\n•	charging handle: device on a firearm which, when operated, results in the hammer or striker being cocked or moved to the ready position.\r\n•	clip: A device that is used to store multiple rounds of ammunition together as a unit, ready for insertion into the magazine of a repeating firearm. This speeds up the process of loading and reloading the firearm as several rounds can be loaded at once, rather than one round being loaded at a time. The term clip commonly refers to a firearm magazine, though this usage is incorrect. In the correct usage, a clip is used to feed a magazine or revolving cylinder, while a magazine or a belt is used to load cartridges into the chamber of a firearm.4\r\n•	collateral damage: Damage that is unintended or incidental to the intended outcome.5 The term originated in the United States military, but it has since expanded into broader use.\r\n•	collimator sight: A type of optical "blind" sight that allows the user looking into it to see an illuminated aiming point aligned with the device the sight is attached to regardless of eye position (parallax free).6 The user can not see through the sight so it is used with both eyes open while one looks into the sight, with one eye open and moving the head to alternately see the sight and then at the target, or using one eye to partially see the sight and target at the same time.7 (variant names/types: collimating sight, 8occluded eye gunsight (OEG).9)\r\n•	combination gun: A shoulder-held firearm that has two barrels; one rifle barrel and one shotgun barrel. Most combination guns are of an over/under design (abbreviated as O/U), in which the two barrels are stacked vertically on top of each other, but some combination guns are of a side-by-side design (abbreviated as SxS), in which the two barrels sit beside each other.\r\n•	cordite: A family of smokeless propellants developed and produced in the United Kingdom from 1889 to replace gunpowder as a military propellant. Like gunpowder, cordite is classified as a low explosive because of its slow burning rates and consequently low brisance. The hot gases produced by burning gunpowder or cordite generate sufficient pressure to propel a bullet or shell to its target, but not enough to destroy the barrel of the firearm, or gun.\r\n•	CQB: Close quarters combat (CQC) or close quarters battle (CQB) is a type of fighting in which small units engage the enemy with personal weapons at very short range, potentially to the point of hand-to-hand combat or fighting with hand weapons such as swords or knives.\r\n•	cylindro-conoidal bullet: A hollow base bullet, shaped so that, when fired, the bullet will expand and seal the bore. It was invented by Captain John Norton of the British 34th Regiment in 1832, after he examined the blow pipe arrows used by the natives in India and found that their base was formed of elastic locus pith, which by its expansion against the inner surface of the blow pipe prevented the escape of air past it.10\r\n\r\n D\r\n\r\n \r\nA view of the break-action of a side-by-side double-barrelled shotgun.\r\n•	damascus barrel or damascus twist: An obsolete method of manufacturing a firearm barrel made by twisting strips of metal around a mandrel and forge welding it into shape. See also Damascus steel.\r\n•	direct impingement: A type of gas operation for a firearm that directs gas from a fired cartridge directly to the bolt carrier or slide assembly to cycle the action.\r\n•	doglock: The lock that preceded the ''true'' flintlock in both rifles and pistols in the 17th century. Commonly used throughout Europe in the 1600s, it gained popular favor in the British and Dutch military. A doglock carbine was the principal weapon of the harquebusier, the most numerous type of cavalry in the armies of Thirty Years War and the English Civil War era.\r\n•	double-barreled shotgun: A shotgun with two barrels, usually of the same gauge or bore. The two types of double-barreled shotguns are over/under (abbreviated as O/U), in which the two barrels are stacked on top of each other, and side-by-side (abbreviated as SxS), in which the two barrels sit beside each other. See photo at right for example of side-by-side double-barreled shotgun. For double-barreled guns that use one shotgun barrel and one rifle barrel, see combination gun.\r\n•	double rifle: A rifle that has two barrels, usually of the same caliber. The two types of double rifles are over/under (abbreviated as O/U), in which the two barrels are stacked on top of each other, and side-by-side (abbreviated as SxS), in which the two barrels sit beside each other. The photo at right is of a side-by-side shotgun, but a side-by-side rifle is very similar. For double-barreled guns that use one shotgun barrel and one rifle barrel, see combination gun.\r\n•	drilling: a firearm with three barrels (from the German word drei for three). Typically it has two barrels side by side on the top, with a third rifle barrel underneath. This provides a very versatile firearm capable of taking winged animals as well as big game. It also is useful in jurisdictions where a person is only allowed to own a single firearm.\r\n•	drum magazine: a type of firearms magazine that is cylindrical in shape, similar to a drum.\r\n•	dry fire: the practice of "firing" a firearm without ammunition. That is, to pull the trigger and allow the hammer or striker to drop on an empty chamber.\r\n•	dum-dum: A bullet designed to expand on impact, increasing in diameter to limit penetration and/or produce a larger diameter wound. The two typical designs are the hollow point bullet and the soft point bullet.\r\n•	dummy: A round of ammunition that is completely inert, i.e., contains no primer, propellant, or explosive charge. It is used to check weapon function, and for crew training.11 Unlike a blank it contains no charge at all.\r\n\r\n E\r\n•	electronic firing: The use of an electric current to fire a cartridge, instead of a percussion cap. In an electronic-fired firearm an electric current is used instead to ignite the propellant, which fires the cartridge as soon as the trigger is pulled.\r\n•	eye relief: For optics such as binoculars or a rifle scope, eye relief is the distance from the eyepiece to the viewers eye which matches the eyepiece exit pupil to the eye''s entrance pupil. Short eye relief requires the observer to press his or her eye close to the eyepiece in order to see an unvignetted image. For a shooter, eye relief is an important safety consideration. An optic with too short an eye relief can cause a skin cut at the contact point between the optic and the eyebrow of the shooter due to recoil.\r\n•	expanding bullet: An expanding bullet is a bullet designed to expand on impact, increasing in diameter to limit penetration and/or produce a larger diameter wound. The two typical designs are the hollow point bullet and the soft point bullet.\r\n•	extractor: A part in a firearm that serves to remove brass cases of fired ammunition after the ammunition has been fired. When the gun''s action cycles, the extractor lifts or removes the spent brass casing from the firing chamber.\r\n\r\n F\r\n•	falling block action (also known as a sliding-block action) is a single-shot firearm action in which a solid metal breechblock slides vertically in grooves cut into the breech of the rifle and actuated by a lever. When in the top position, it is locked and resists the force of recoil while sealing the chamber. In the lower position, it leaves the chamber open to be loaded by a cartridge from the rear.\r\n•	Ferritic nitrocarburizing: A case hardening processes that diffuse nitrogen and carbon into ferrous metals at sub-critical temperatures to improve scuffing resistance, fatigue properties and corrosion resistance of metal surfaces. Also called nitriding.\r\n•	fire forming: the process of reshaping a metallic cartridge case to fit a new chamber by firing it within that chamber.12\r\n•	forcing cone: The tapered section at the rear of the barrel of a revolver that eases the entry of the bullet into the bore.13\r\n•	fouling shot: A fouling shot is a shot fired through a clean bore, intended to leave some residue of firing and prepare the bore for more consistent performance in subsequent shots. The first shot through a clean bore will behave differently than subsequent shots through a bore with traces of powder residue, resulting in a different point of impact. Also, the Fouling Shot Journal, a publication of the Cast Bullet Association14\r\n•	forward assist: A button, found commonly on M16 and AR-15 styled rifles, usually located near the bolt closure, that when hit will push the bolt carrier forward, ensuring that the bolt is locked.\r\n•	fouling: The accumulation of unwanted material on solid surfaces. The fouling material can consist of either powder, lubrication residue, or bullet material such as lead or copper.\r\n•	frangible: A bullet that is designed to disintegrate into tiny particles upon impact to minimize their penetration for reasons of range safety, to limit environmental impact, or to limit the danger behind the intended target. Examples are the Glaser Safety Slug and the breaching round.1516\r\n•	frizzen: an "L" shaped piece of steel hinged at the rear used in flintlock firearms. The flint scraping the steel causes a shower of sparks to be thrown into the flash pan.\r\n\r\n G\r\n•	gas check is a device used in some types of firearms ammunition when non-jacketed bullets are used in high pressure cartridges, to prevent the buildup of lead in the barrel and aid in accuracy.17\r\n•	gas-operated reloading: a system of operation used to provide energy to operate autoloading firearms.\r\n•	gauge: The gauge of a firearm is a unit of measurement used to express the diameter of the barrel.\r\n•	general purpose machine gun: a machine gun intended to fill the role of either a light machine gun or medium machine gun, while at the same time being man-portable.\r\n•	grain is a unit of measurement of mass that is based upon the mass of a single seed of a typical cereal. Used in firearms to denote the amount of powder in a cartridge or the weight of a bullet. Traditionally it was based on the weight of a grain of wheat or barley, but since 1958, the grain (gr) measure has been redefined using the International System of Units as precisely 64.79891 mg.1819 There are 7,000 grains per avoirdupois pound in the Imperial and U.S. customary units.\r\n•	grip safety: A safety mechanism, usually a lever on the rear of a pistol grip, that automatically unlocks the trigger mechanism of a firearm as pressure is applied by the shooter''s hand.13\r\n•	gunpowder, also called black powder, is a mixture of sulfur, charcoal, and potassium nitrate. It burns rapidly, producing a volume of hot gas made up of carbon dioxide, water, and nitrogen, and a solid residue of potassium sulfide.2 Because of its burning properties and the amount of heat and gas volume that it generates, gunpowder has been widely used as a propellant in firearms and as a pyrotechnic composition in fireworks. The term gunpowder also refers broadly to any propellant powder. Modern firearms do not use the traditional gunpowder (black powder) described here, but instead use smokeless powder.\r\n\r\n H\r\n•	hammer bite: The action of an external hammer pinching or poking the web of the operator''s shooting hand between the thumb and fore-finger when the gun is fired. Some handguns prone to this are the M1911 pistol and the Browning Hi-Power.20\r\n•	hang fire: An unexpected delay between the triggering of a firearm and the ignition of the propellant. This failure was common in firearm actions that relied on open primer pans, due to the poor or inconsistent quality of the powder. Modern weapons are susceptible, particularly if the ammunition has been stored in an environment outside of the design specifications.\r\n•	half-cock: The position of the hammer where the hammer is partially but not completely cocked. Many firearms, particularly older firearms, had a notch cut into the hammer allowing half-cock, as this position would neither allow the gun to fire nor permit the hammer-mounted firing pin to rest on a live percussion cap or cartridge. The purpose of the half-cock position has variously been used both for loading a firearm, and as a safety-mechanism.\r\n\r\n \r\nrevolver hammer\r\n•	hammer: The function of the hammer is to strike the firing pin in a firearm, which in turn detonates the impact-sensitive cartridge primer. The hammer of a firearm was given its name for both resemblance and functional similarity to the common tool.\r\n•	headspace: The distance measured from the part of the chamber that stops forward motion of the cartridge (the datum reference) to the face of the bolt. Used as a verb, headspace refers to the interference created between this part of the chamber and the feature of the cartridge that achieves the correct positioning.21\r\n•	headstamp: A headstamp is the markings on the bottom of a cartridge case designed for a firearm. It usually tells who manufactured the case. If it is a civilian case it often also tells the caliber, if it is military, the year of manufacture is often added.\r\n•	heavy machine gun: a larger class of machine gun.\r\n•	high brass: A shotgun shell for more powerful loads with the brass extended up further along the sides of the shell, while light loads will use "low brass" shells. The brass does not actually provide a significant amount of strength, but the difference in appearance provides shooters with a way to quickly differentiate between high and low powered ammunition.\r\n•	Holographic weapon sight: a non-magnifying gun sight that allows the user to look through a glass optical window and see a cross hair reticle image superimposed at a distance on the field of view.22 The hologram of the reticle is built into the window and is illuminated by a laser diode.', 1, 1, '86.96.160.46', 3, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

Frequently the neck length and shoulder position are altered as well. The caliber is NOT changed in the process.\r\n&#8226;	IMR powder or Improved Military Rifle: A series of tubular nitrocellulose smokeless powders evolved from World War I through World War II for loading military and commercial ammunition and sold to private citizens for reloading rifle ammunition for hunting and target shooting.\r\n&#8226;	improvised firearm: a firearm manufactured by someone who is not a regular maker of firearms.\r\n&#8226;	internal ballistics: A subfield of ballistics, that is the study of a projectile''s behavior from the time its propellant''s igniter is initiated until it exits the gun barrel. The study of internal ballistics is important to designers and users of firearms of all types, from small-bore Olympic rifles and pistols, to high-tech artillery.\r\n&#8226;	iron sights are a system of aligned markers used to assist in the aiming of a device such as a firearm, crossbow, or telescope, and exclude the use of optics as in a scope. Iron sights are typically composed of two component sights, formed by metal blades: a rear sight mounted perpendicular to the line of sight and consisting of some form of notch (open sight) or aperture (closed sight); and a front sight that is a post, bead, or ring.\r\n\r\n J\r\n\r\n \r\njacketed bullets\r\n&#8226;	jacket: A metal, usually copper, wrapped around a lead core to form a bullet.\r\n&#8226;	jeweling: a cosmetic process to enhance the looks of firearm parts, such as the bolt. The look is created with an abrasive brush and compound that roughs the surface of the metal in a circular pattern.\r\n\r\n K\r\n&#8226;	keyhole or keyholing: Refers to the shape of the hole left in a paper target by a bullet fired down a gun barrel which has a diameter larger than the bullet or who fails to properly stabilize the bullet. A bullet fired in this manner tends to wobble or tumble as it moves through the air and leaves a "keyhole" shaped hole in a paper target instead of a round one.\r\n&#8226;	Khyber Pass copy: a firearm manufactured by cottage gunsmiths in the Khyber Pass region between Pakistan and Afghanistan.\r\n&#8226;	kick: The backward momentum of a gun when it is discharged. In technical terms, the recoil caused by the gun exactly balances the forward momentum of the projectile, according to Newton''s third law. (often called kickback or simply recoil)\r\n\r\n L\r\n&#8226;	length of pull: The distance between the trigger and the butt end of the stock of a rifle or shotgun.\r\n&#8226;	lever-action is a type of firearm action which uses a lever located around the trigger guard area, (often including the trigger guard itself) to load fresh cartridges into the chamber of the barrel when the lever is worked.\r\n&#8226;	light machine gun: machine gun designed to be employed by an individual soldier.\r\n&#8226;	live fire exercise or LFX: Any exercise in which a realistic scenario for the use of specific equipment is simulated. In the popular lexicon this is applied primarily to tests of weapons or weapon systems that are associated with the various branches of a nation''s armed forces, although the term can be applied to the civilian arena as well.\r\n&#8226;	lug: any piece that projects from a firearm for the purpose of attaching something to it. For example barrel lugs are used to attach a break-action shotgun barrel to the action itself. If the firearm is a revolver, the term may also refer to a protrusion under the barrel that adds weight, thereby stabilizing the gun during aiming, mitigating recoil, and reducing muzzle flip. A full lug extends all the way to the muzzle, while a half lug extends only partially down the barrel. On a swing-out-cylinder revolver, the lug is slotted to accommodate the ejector rod.13\r\n M\r\n&#8226;	machine gun: a fully automatic mounted or portable firearm.\r\n&#8226;	machine pistol: a handgun-style fully automatic or burst-mode firearm.\r\n&#8226;	machine revolver: a revolver that uses the energy of firing for cocking the hammer and revolving the cylinder, rather than using manual operations to perform these actions (more correctly, a semi-automatic revolver).\r\n&#8226;	magazine: A magazine is an ammunition storage and feeding device within or attached to a repeating firearm. Magazines may be integral to the firearm (fixed) or removable (detachable). The magazine functions by moving the cartridges stored in the magazine into a position where they may be loaded into the chamber by the action of the firearm.\r\n&#8226;	match grade: Firearm parts and ammunition that are suitable for a competitive match. This refers to parts that are designed and manufactured such that they have a relatively tight-tolerances and high level of accuracy.\r\n&#8226;	muzzle: The part of a firearm at the end of the barrel from which the projectile will exit.\r\n&#8226;	muzzle brakes and recoil compensators: devices that are fitted to the muzzle of a firearm to redirect propellant gases with the effect of countering both recoil of the gun and unwanted rising of the barrel during rapid fire.\r\n&#8226;	muzzle energy is the kinetic energy of a bullet as it is expelled from the muzzle of a firearm. It is often used as a rough indication of the destructive potential of a given firearm or load. The heavier the bullet and the faster it moves, the higher its muzzle energy and the more damage it will do.\r\n&#8226;	muzzle velocity is the speed at which a projectile leaves the muzzle of the gun. Muzzle velocities range from approximately 800 ft/s (240 m/s) for some pistols and older cartridges to more than 4,000 ft/s (1,200 m/s) in modern cartridges such as the .220 Swift and .204 Ruger. In conventional guns, muzzle velocity is determined by the quality (burn speed, expansion) and quantity of the propellant, the mass of the projectile, and the length of the barrel.\r\n\r\n N\r\n&#8226;	necking down or necking up refers to shrinking or expanding the neck of an existing cartridge to make it use a bullet of a different caliber. A typical process used in the creation of wildcat cartridges.\r\n&#8226;	NRA or National Rifle Association of America is an American organization which lists as its goals the protection of the Second Amendment of the United States Bill of Rights and the promotion of firearm ownership rights as well as marksmanship, firearm safety, and the protection of hunting and self-defense in the United States. The NRA is also the sanctioning body for most marksmanship competition in the U.S.A., from the local to the Olympic level (particularly bullseye style events).\r\n\r\n O\r\n&#8226;	out-of-battery: The status of a weapon before the action has returned to the normal firing position. The term originates from artillery, referring to a gun that fires before it has been pulled back into its firing position in a gun battery. In firearms where there is an automatic loading mechanism, a condition in which a live round is at least partially in the firing chamber and capable of being fired, but is not properly secured by the usual mechanism of that particular weapon can occur.\r\n&#8226;	over-bore: Small caliber bullets being used in very large cases.23 It is the relationship between the volume of powder that can fit in a case and the diameter of the inside of the barrel or bore.24\r\n&#8226;	obturate: Obturation is the process of a bullet expanding under pressure to fit the bore of the firearm, or a cartridge case expanding under pressure to seal the chamber. See also swage.\r\n P\r\n&#8226;	parkerizing: A method of protecting a steel surface from corrosion and increasing its resistance to wear through the application of an electrochemical phosphate conversion coating. Also called phosphating and phosphatizing.\r\n&#8226;	percussion cap: a small cylinder of copper or brass that was the crucial invention that enabled muzzle-loading firearms to fire reliably in any weather. The cap has one closed end. Inside the closed end is a small amount of a shock-sensitive explosive material such as fulminate of mercury. The percussion cap is placed over a hollow metal "nipple" at the rear end of the gun barrel. Pulling the trigger releases a hammer which strikes the percussion cap and ignites the explosive primer. The flame travels through the hollow nipple to ignite the main powder charge.\r\n&#8226;	Picatinny rail: a bracket used on some firearms in order to provide a standardized mounting platform.\r\n&#8226;	pinfire: an obsolete type of brass cartridge in which the priming compound is ignited by striking a small pin which protrudes radially from just above the base of the cartridge.\r\n&#8226;	plinking: Informal target shooting done at non-traditional targets such as tin cans, glass bottles, and balloons filled with water.25\r\n&#8226;	powerhead or bang stick: a specialized firearm used underwater that is fired when in direct contact with the target.\r\n&#8226;	pump-action: A rifle or shotgun in which the handgrip can be pumped back and forth in order to eject a spent round of ammunition and to chamber a fresh one. It is much faster than a bolt-action and somewhat faster than a lever-action, as it does not require the trigger hand to be removed from the trigger whilst reloading. When used in rifles, this action is also commonly called a slide action.\r\n\r\n Q\r\n&#8226;	quad-barrelled: A gun, typically artillery, with four barrels, such as the ZPU.\r\n R\r\n&#8226;	ramrod: a device used with early firearms to push the projectile up against the propellant (mainly gunpowder).\r\n&#8226;	rate of fire: the frequency at which a firearm can fire its projectiles.\r\n&#8226;	recoil: The backward momentum of a gun when it is discharged. In technical terms, the recoil caused by the gun exactly balances the forward momentum of the projectile, according to Newton''s third law. (often called kickback or simply kick)\r\n&#8226;	recoil operation: Recoil operation is an operating mechanism used in locked-breech, autoloading firearms. As the name implies, these actions use the force of recoil to provide energy to cycle the action.\r\n&#8226;	Red dot sight a type of reflector (reflex) sight for firearms that gives the uses a red light-emitting diode as a reticle to create an aimpoint.\r\n&#8226;	Reflector (reflex) sight: A generally non-magnifying optical device that has an optically collimated reticle, allowing the user to look through a partially reflecting glass element and see a parallax free cross hair or other projected aiming point superimposed on the field of view.26 Invented in 1900 but not generally used on firearms until reliably illuminated versions were invented in the late 1970s (usually referred to by the abbreviation &#8220;reflex sight&#8221;).\r\n&#8226;	revolver: a repeating firearm that has a cylinder containing multiple chambers and at least one barrel for firing.\r\n&#8226;	ricochet: (  /&#712;r&#618;k&#601;&#643;e&#618;/ RIK-&#601;-shay) is a rebound, bounce or skip off a surface, particularly in the case of a projectile.\r\n&#8226;	rifle bedding: a process of filling gaps between the action and the stock of a rifle with an epoxy based material.\r\n&#8226;	rifling: Helical grooves in the barrel of a gun or firearm, which imparts a spin to a projectile around its long axis. This spin serves to gyroscopically stabilize the projectile, improving its aerodynamic stability and accuracy.\r\n&#8226;	rimfire: A type of firearm cartridge that used a firing pin which strikes the base''s rim, instead of striking the primer cap at the center of the base of the cartridge to ignite it (as in a centerfire cartridge). The rim of the rimfire cartridge is essentially an extended and widened percussion cap which contains the priming compound, while the cartridge case itself contains the propellant powder and the projectile (bullet).\r\n&#8226;	rolling block: A form of firearm action where the sealing of the breech is done with a circular shaped breechblock able to rotate on a pin. The breechblock is locked into place by the hammer, thus preventing the cartridge from moving backwards at the moment of firing. By cocking the hammer, the breechblock can be rotated freely to reload the weapon.\r\n&#8226;	round: a single cartridge.\r\n\r\n S\r\n&#8226;	sabot : a device used in a firearm to fire a projectile, such as a bullet, that is smaller than the bore diameter.\r\n&#8226;	safety: A mechanism used to help prevent the accidental discharge of a firearm, helping to ensure safer handling. Safeties can generally be divided into subtypes such as internal safeties (which typically do not receive input from the user) and external safeties (which typically allow the user to give input, for example, toggling a lever from "on" to "off" or something similar). Sometimes these are called "passive" and "active" safeties (or "automatic" and "manual"), respectively.\r\n&#8226;	sawed-off shotgun/short-barreled shotgun (SBS): a type of shotgun with a shorter gun barrel and often a shorter or deleted stock.\r\n&#8226;	selective fire: A firearm that fires semi&#8211;automatically and at least one automatic mode by means of a selector depending on the weapon''s design. Some selective fire weapons utilize burst fire mechanisms to limit the maximum or total number of shots fired automatically in this mode. The most common limits are two or three rounds per pull of the trigger.\r\n&#8226;	semi-wadcutter or SWC: A type of all-purpose bullet commonly used in revolvers which combines features of the wadcutter target bullet and traditional round nosed revolver bullets, and is used in both revolver and pistol cartridges for hunting, target shooting, and plinking. The basic SWC design consists of a roughly conical nose, truncated with a flat point, sitting on a cylinder. The flat nose punches a clean hole in the target, rather than tearing it like a round nose bullet would, and the sharp shoulder enlarges the hole neatly, allowing easy and accurate scoring of the target. The SWC design offers better external ballistics than the wadcutter, as its conical nose produces less drag than the flat cylinder.\r\n&#8226;	shooting range: a specialized facility designed for firearms practice.\r\n&#8226;	shooting sticks: are portable weapon mounts.\r\n&#8226;	short-barreled rifle (SBR): a legal designation in the United States, referring to a shoulder-fired, rifled firearm with a barrel length of less than 16" (40.6 cm) or overall length of less than 26" (66.0 cm).\r\n&#8226;	single-action: Usually referring to a pistol or revolver, single-action is when the hammer is pulled back manually by the shooter (cocking it), after which the trigger is operated to fire the shot. See also double-action.\r\n&#8226;	single-shot: A firearm that holds only a single round of ammunition, and must be reloaded after each shot.\r\n&#8226;	slamfire: a premature, unintended discharge of a firearm that occurs as a round is being loaded into the chamber.\r\n&#8226;	sleeving: A method of using new tubes to replace a worn-out gun barrel.27\r\n&#8226;	slide bite: A phenomenon which is often grouped with hammer bite. In this case the web of the shooting hand is cut or abraded by the rearward motion of the semi-automatic pistol''s slide, not by the gun''s hammer. This most often occurs with small pistols like the Walther PPK and Walther TPH that have an abbreviated grip tang. This problem is exacerbated by the sharp machining found on many firearms.\r\n&#8226;	sling: is a type of strap or harness designed to allow an operator carry a firearm (usually a long gun such as a rifle, carbine, shotgun, or submachine gun) on his/her person and/or aid in greater hit probability with that firearm.\r\n&#8226;	snubnosed revolver: a revolver with a short barrel length.\r\n&#8226;	speedloader: A device used for loading a firearm or firearm magazine with loose ammunition very quickly. Generally, speedloaders are used for loading all chambers of a revolver simultaneously, although speedloaders of different designs are also used for the loading of fixed tubular magazines of shotguns and rifles, or the loading of box or drum magazines. Revolver speedloaders are used for revolvers having either swing-out cylinders or top-break cylinders.\r\n&#8226;	spitzer bullet: an aerodynamic bullet design.\r\n&#8226;	sporterising, sporterisation, or sporterization: The practice of modifying military-type firearms either to make them suitable for civilian sporting use or to make them legal under the law.\r\n&#8226;	squib load, also known as squib round, pop and no kick, or just squib: A firearms malfunction in which a fired projectile does not have enough force behind it to exit the barrel, and thus becomes stuck.\r\n&#8226;	stock: The part of a rifle or other firearm, to which the barrel and firing mechanism are attached, that is held against one''s shoulder when firing the gun. The stock provides a means for the shooter to firmly support the device and easily aim it.\r\n&#8226;	stopping power: The ability of a firearm or other weapon to cause a penetrating ballistic injury to a target, human or animal, sufficient to incapacitate the target where it stands.\r\n&#8226;	stripper clip: A speedloader that holds several cartridges together in a single unit for easier loading of a firearm''s magazine. A stripper clip is used only for loading the magazine and is not necessary for the firearm to function.\r\n&#8226;	suppressor, sound suppressor, sound moderator, "hush puppy",or silencer: A device attached to or part of the barrel of a firearm to reduce the amount of noise and flash generated by firing the weapon.\r\n&#8226;	silencer, suppressor, sound suppressor, sound moderator, or "hush puppy": A device attached to or part of the barrel of a firearm to reduce the amount of noise and flash generated by firing the weapon.\r\n&#8226;	swage: To reduce an item in size by forcing through a die. In internal ballistics, swaging refers to the process where bullets are swaged into the rifling of the barrel by the force of the expanding powder gases.\r\n&#8226;	swaged bullet: A bullet that is formed by forcing the bullet into a die to assume its final form.\r\n&#8226;	swaged choke: A constriction or choke in a shotgun barrel formed by a swaging process that compresses the outside of the barrel.\r\n&#8226;	swaged rifling: Rifling in a firearm barrel formed by a swaging process, such as button rifling.', 1, 1, '86.96.162.13', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

Telescoping stocks are useful for storing a rifle or weapon in a space that it would not normally fit in.\r\n&#8226;	terminal ballistics: A sub-field of ballistics, is the study of the behavior of a projectile when it hits its target.28\r\n&#8226;	trigger: A mechanism that actuates the firing sequence of a firearm. Triggers almost universally consist of levers or buttons actuated by the index finger.\r\n&#8226;	trunnion: a cylindrical protrusion used as a mounting and/or pivoting point. On firearms, the barrel is sometimes mounted in a trunnion, which in turn is mounted to the receiver.\r\n\r\n U\r\n&#8226;	upset forging: A process that increases the diameter of a workpiece by compressing its length.\r\n&#8226;	underlug: 1. The locking lugs on a break-action firearm that extend from the bottom of the barrels under the chamber(s) and connect into the receiver bottom.29 2. The metal shroud underneath the barrel of a revolver that surrounds and protects the extractor rod. The two types of underlugs include half-lug, meaning the shroud doesn''t run the entire length of the barrel but instead is only as long as the extractor rod, and full-lug, meaning the shroud runs the full length of the barrel.\r\n&#8226;	underwater firearm: a firearm specially designed for use underwater.\r\n\r\n V\r\n\r\n \r\nvarmint rifle\r\n&#8226;	varmint rifle: A small-caliber firearm or high-powered air gun primarily used for varmint hunting &#8212; killing non-native or non-game animals such as rats, house sparrows, starling, crows, ground squirrels, gophers, jackrabbits, marmots, groundhogs, porcupine, opossum, coyote, skunks, weasels,30 or feral cats, dogs, goats, pigs and other animals considered to be nuisance vermin destructive to native or domestic plants and animals.31\r\n\r\n W\r\n&#8226;	wadcutter: A special-purpose bullet specially designed for shooting paper targets, usually at close range and at subsonic velocities typically under 800 ft/s (240 m/s). They are often used in handgun and airgun competitions. A wadcutter has a flat or nearly flat front that cuts a very clean hole through the paper target, making it easier to score and ideally reducing errors in scoring the target to the favor of the shooter.\r\n&#8226;	WCF: An acronym for a family of cartridges designed by Winchester Repeating Arms Company, called Winchester Center Fire, as in the .30-30 WCF or .32 WCF.32\r\n&#8226;	wheellock: an obsolete mechanism for firing a firearm.\r\n&#8226;	wildcat cartridge or wildcat: A custom cartridge for which ammunition and firearms are not mass produced.

Secondly the Arms Ordinance does NOT specify that whether a gun has to go loaded or unloaded.

When the law allows you to do something and specifies the method of doing something you do it that way.. take example of Driving license; You need to have one to drive, it is THAT simple.. similarly to possess a gun you have to go through all the paperwork and the police verification as well as through the purchase and subsequent re-entry of the weapon on the register of arms.. THEN you are legally carrying a weapon with all the formalities complete. So saying that following the law and getting a license is stupid and unlawful.. then my friend david.. i cant say anything.. loss of words. \n\nCarrying cheap weapon is surely dangerous but you cannot say anything unless you are in the shoes of the person. Just DONT be judgmental.. OR the JUDGE is going to say YOU are MENTAL.\n\nThirdly you cannot be far from reality when you think carrying a gun is more dangerous that any one can think. Brother when you live in a rife city like karachi where anything can happen anytime and that too on top when you VALUE you life more than anything.. that is then when you realise that ALL the money and ALL the things you have earned.. medals, degrees, house, cars, clothes, expensive mobile phone and what not is all pieces of crap when you didnt even prepare to save your self from a worthless bandit. IF you want to live.. for your self and are prepared to save the life of your family then you should be prepared.. preparation comes firstly from buying a weapon (with legal formalities) and then training with it.. and then lastly carrying it according to law. SIMPLE... when you have 2 seconds to decide as you see a bandit coming what will you do..?? call police and ask the bandit to wait till police arrives??? OR just shoot that bastard down?? just choose quickly and wisely .. that is all i can ask from you for your family''s sake.\n\nLastly it does take a man to shoot another man.. think makes me think.. are you a woman or a transvestite?? and NOT ready to defend yourself and your family?? if that is so.. then please refrain from posting such derogatory remarks about men who arm them selves to defend their liberty, honor and life for the sake of their future.. \n\n[QUOTE=davidglory;326191]"Those who would give up essential liberty to purchase a little temporary safety, deserve neither liberty nor safety".[/QUOTE]\nAbsolutely true.. it is the freedom to carry a weapon for personal safety that keeps the bad guys away.. those who choose NOT to go armed are always the ones to be robbed and shot. It is a fundamental right in all the constitutions of the world that every person has the right to be safe and live with liberty to his own choosing.. IF the people choose to keep arms available then it is their choice to make such laws in the country... and follow them accordingly.. make rules for those who choose NOT to follow the law. IF you give up your gun to have temporary safety from the BG or the crooked politician.. rest assured that there is a massacre coming up in near future, thence true that you deserve neither liberty nor safety.\n\n"Keeping a weapon of your choice is what is included in the word LIBERTY; YOU are at LIBERTY to CHOOSE how to spend YOUR life."', 1, 0, '42.83.85.45', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

If they want to loan you money, tell them you just filed for bankruptcy and you could sure use some money.\n\n2. If they start out with, "How are you today?" say, "I''m so glad you asked, because no one these days seems to care, and I have all these problems. My arthritis is acting up, my eyelashes are sore, my dog just died . . . "\n\n3. If they say they''re John Doe from XYZ Company, ask them to spell their name. Then ask them to spell the company name. Then ask them where it is located, how long it has been in business, how many people work there, how they got into this line of work if they are married, how many kids they have, etc. Continue asking them personal questions or questions about their company for as long as necessary.\n\n4. (This works great if you are male) Telemarketer: "Hi, my name is Judy and I''m with XYZ Company. " You: Wait for a second and with a real husky voice ask, "What are you wearing?"\n\n5. Cry out in surprise, "Judy? Is that you? Oh my God! Judy, how have you been?" Hopefully, this will give Judy a few brief moments of terror as she tries to figure out where she could know you from.\n\n6. Say "No" over and over. Be sure to vary the sound of each one, and keep a rhythmic tempo, even as they are trying to speak. This is most fun if you can do it until they hang up.\n\n7. If MCI calls trying to get you to sign up for the Family and Friends Plan, reply, in as sinister a voice as you can, "I don''t have any friends, would you be my friend?"\n\n8. If the company cleans rugs, respond: "Can you get out blood? Can you get out goat blood? How about human blood?"\n\n9. After the Telemarketer gives his or her spiel, ask him or her to marry you. When they get all flustered, tell them that you can''t just give your credit card number to a complete stranger.\n\n10. If the Telemarketer is selling raffle tickets, tell him or her that you work for the same company, and that employees cannot participate.\n\n11. Answer the phone. As soon as you realize it is a Telemarketer, set the receiver down, scream, "OH MY GOD!" and then hang up.\n\n12. Tell the Telemarketer you are busy at the moment and ask if he/she will give you their home phone number so you can call him/her back. When the Telemarketer explains that telemarketers cannot give out their home numbers say, "I guess you don''t want anyone bothering you at home, right?" The Telemarketer will agree and you say, "Me either!" and proceed to hang up.\n\n13. Ask them to repeat everything they say, several times.\n\n14. Tell them it is dinner time, but ask if they would please hold. Put them on your speaker phone while you continue to eat at your leisure. Smack your food loudly and continue with your dinner conversation. For added effect, clanging of cutlery and dishes is recommended.\n\n15. Tell the Telemarketer you are on "home incarceration" and ask if they could bring you some beer.\n\n16. Ask them to fax the information to you, and make up a number.\n\n17. Tell the Telemarketer, "Okay, I''ll listen to you. But I should probably tell you, I''m not wearing any clothes."\n\n18. Insist that the caller is really your buddy Leon, playing a joke. "Come on, Leon, cut it out! Seriously, Leon, how''s your momma?"\n\n19. Tell them you are hard of hearing and that they need to speak up... louder... louder!\n\n20.

There were others who predated Vieille, but all modern smokeless powders are descended from Vieille, who managed to come up with a process that was both safe and suitable for mass production.\n\n Interestingly, Vieille''s smokeless powder patent was the first big test of international patent law. The British simply ignored the patent and began producing powder by the Vieille process without payment.  The Vieille sued, with the backing of the French government, and relations between the two countries became *very tense* for a few years.\n\n The main reason was that the Vieille patent gave France a huge military advantage over other nations.  Not for small arms, but for the French army and navy, which were always short of powder for their artillery, same as any other country.  The bottleneck was over potassium nitrate, the chemical that provided the oxidizer component of black powder.  At the time there was no practical way to synthesize potassion nitrate in quantity; it was mostly obtained from bird guano.  England''s tax men dug out the ground under public toilets; the French put in public "pissoirs" to collect and recover potassium nitrate from human urine.  Vieille''s process broke the nitrate bottleneck; smokeless powder wasn''t only cheaper, but could be made in essentially unlimited quantities.\n\n In the end it didn''t make any major historical difference; by World War 1 all combatants had completed the changeover to smokeless powders.

In my humble opinion, the reason is that CZ999 is considered to be a better pistol than NP22/34... I never had the opportunity to shoot with CZ999, but have used NP22, currently using NP34 and REALLY like it... According to many senior members/ users of NP22/34 & CZ999, CZ999 is FAR better than NP22/34... AND... if its better than NP22/34, then it MUST be a "HELL OF A GUN"... I don''t know about the political scenario, but the only reason of CZ999 being cheap rather "economical" is that in Pakistan, unfortunately, Serbian guns don''t have that much of demand, compared to Turkish guns... Unfortunately most of the people in Pakistan, go for the looks rather than functionality...

So it finally happened on Sunday 9-12-12 after weeks n weeks of deliberation. \n  It was beautiful sunny day at Sialkot range with the company of dearest friends AK47 & 12Gauge making it more beautiful. \n  Had 3 different shotguns to select one from to pit against DSA ZARS ( detailed review can be read here;  [url]http://www.pakguns.com/showthread.php?10081-Review-DSA-Zombie-Apocalypse-Response-Shotgun-P-A[/url] );\n   \n  1) Mossberg Rolling Thunder - (PA owned by AK47)\n  2) Mossberg 835 Ultimag - (PA owned by Denovo87)\n  3) Hatsan Escort Magnum - (SA owned by Denovo87)\n   \n  Main objective was to gauge consistent accuracy of DSA vs other similar shotguns; so decided first to do it at 50 meters using Pakguns special slugs. But after 1st round of 3 shots each from DSA and Mossberg 835 it was decided to pull the Mossberg 835 off from competition having rifled barrel (Mossberg Rolling Thunder was already out having only pistol).  So we left with only one shotgun to through in the match against DSA that was Hatsan Escort.\n  Also was decided to reduce shooting range to 25meters.\n   \n  It also was agreed (between me and 12Gauge bro) that none of us will give any comment on which among DSA n Hatsan proved more accurate; we will let viewers decide after seeing targets. By the way there wasn''t any sort of stoppage or malfunction experienced in any of the shotguns used that day.\n   \n   \n  Below are the photos of range, shooter n equipment;\n   \n  AK47 & Denovo87 posing before starting smoking shotguns:\n   \n  [IMG]http://i577.photobucket.com/albums/ss220/denovo87/Range%20n%20Targets/9-12-12%20Shotguns%20Tested/AKnDenovo.jpg[/IMG]\n   \n  AK47:\n   \n  [IMG]http://i577.photobucket.com/albums/ss220/denovo87/Range%20n%20Targets/9-12-12%20Shotguns%20Tested/AKposing.jpg[/IMG]\n   \n  1-2-3...GO: \n   \n  [IMG]http://i577.photobucket.com/albums/ss220/denovo87/Range%20n%20Targets/9-12-12%20Shotguns%20Tested/GettingreadyforAction.jpg[/IMG]\n   \n   \n  [IMG]http://i577.photobucket.com/albums/ss220/denovo87/Range%20n%20Targets/9-12-12%20Shotguns%20Tested/MossbergSmokingslug.jpg[/IMG]\n   \n  Now lets targets do the talking:\n   \n  Target shot with Mossberg 835:\n  [IMG]http://i577.photobucket.com/albums/ss220/denovo87/Range%20n%20Targets/9-12-12%20Shotguns%20Tested/Mossbergnslugs.jpg[/IMG]\n   \n   \n  Target shot with DSA ZARS and Hatsan Escort Magnum:\n   \n  [IMG]http://i577.photobucket.com/albums/ss220/denovo87/Range%20n%20Targets/9-12-12%20Shotguns%20Tested/DSAvsHatsan.jpg[/IMG]\n   \n   \n  And here a non-ending argument starts as always ;)\n\n   \n  [IMG]http://i577.photobucket.com/albums/ss220/denovo87/Range%20n%20Targets/9-12-12%20Shotguns%20Tested/HatsanwiningDSA.jpg[/IMG]\n   \n   \n  Good news for all Escort Magnum Combo owners is that small barrel has been tested now with slugs and we declared it safe & very accurate to shoot slugs.', 1, 1, '39.45.114.26', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

Start recording on laptop placing it midway between gun and target (away from line of fire), and fire the gun. Two sound spikes are recorded, which are computed by the software and it gives you pellet speed and energy if you give pellet mass too in input. Works better if there is minimal background noise, like wind etc. Read software manual before trying for quick and accurate results. It is quite simple in fact.

Its lighter due to its polymer frame and is more concealable. Oh and the trigger of the Caracal is much much better. The only advantage that Cz999 has over Caracal is the in the reliability and accuracy department. I''m not saying that Caracal isn''t accurate, but Cz999 might be more.

(socks, lemons, rolled foil, plastersine rolls, custom paint balls, etc)\n\nThe purpose of these cannons is to have some fun when heading outdoors to a beach or farm, great for some target practice & projectile launch distance tournaments amongts friends.\n\nSome new pictures embedded, feedback will be appreciated -\n\n[IMG]http://i1118.photobucket.com/albums/k601/chipzolic/14.jpg[/IMG]\n\n[IMG]http://i1118.photobucket.com/albums/k601/chipzolic/13.jpg[/IMG]\n\n[IMG]http://i1118.photobucket.com/albums/k601/chipzolic/13.jpg[/IMG]\n\n[IMG]http://i1118.photobucket.com/albums/k601/chipzolic/2.jpg[/IMG]\n\n[IMG]http://i1118.photobucket.com/albums/k601/chipzolic/2.jpg[/IMG]\n\n[IMG]http://i1118.photobucket.com/albums/k601/chipzolic/3.jpg[/IMG]\n\n[IMG]http://i1118.photobucket.com/albums/k601/chipzolic/HBNew.jpg[/IMG]\n\n[IMG]http://i1118.photobucket.com/albums/k601/chipzolic/cc.jpg[/IMG]\n\n[IMG]http://i1118.photobucket.com/albums/k601/chipzolic/A27.jpg[/IMG]\n\n[IMG]http://i1118.photobucket.com/albums/k601/chipzolic/FILE010489.jpg[/IMG]\n\n\n[B]Here''s a customer who recently got one custom built for himself, his name is Ahmed Saeed, he wanted one in matt black & orange, primarily built to fire squash balls. :)[/B]\n\n\n[IMG]http://i1118.photobucket.com/albums/k601/chipzolic/1.jpg[/IMG]\n\n[COLOR=#888888]\n[/COLOR][/quote]', 1, 0, '94.205.80.193', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

I know people who have been severely burned using gas as a cleaning solvent when something unexpected went wrong and started a fire.  I have made my living fixing cars for nearly forty years and have too much respect for the danger in gasoline to even consider it.\n\nAfter removing the plastic grips and detail stripping the pistol I used mineral spirits to clean the cosmoline, soaking the hammer assembly as a unit and working into the corners with an old toothbrush.  There was a single rust spot on the slide that cleaned up nicely with 0000 steel wool and oil.  After blowing out everything with air and letting it dry overnight, I followed up with a generous oiling.  The M57 turned out better than I expected.  It took me a long time to get the firing pin and retainer plate back in, but I finally did it by standing the slide up vertically and using the retainer plate to push the firing pin assembly down into place.  I probably spent an hour and a half looking for the firing pin washer after everything went flying in one of my early attempts at reassembly, but "all''s well that ends well".\n\nAnyway I hope it ends well.  I have not yet fired the M57 because it took about a week to find some 7.62x25mm Tokarev ammunition locally.  I will report back after shooting the pistol and try to post some pictures of my new ''friend''.  It feels real good in the hand and the bottleneck cartridges look like they should have some real pop.\n\nThank you all again for the help.

I wanted a Gamo 1000 as i knew it was for 18k but i couldnt find one, so i asked the shopkeeper "u have Hatsan sniper 125?" he said no, infact he have another Hatsan which just came new. plain 125 model with wooden stock and for 20k. as soon as i saw this gun, i decided to go for it, cause i knew from Pak guns that hatsan 125 sniper is going extremely good these days so this would also be good. I noticed the gun being heavy infact much like bolt action 7mil. but it was solid and because of weight it was very balanced.

The language of firearms has evolved with few rules, and as a result there is a lot of confusion. This won’t solve everything, but here are some things I’ve learned, when I was looking up other things.\r\n\r\nTip 1: Caliber vs. Gauge.\r\n\r\nGauge is a measure of the inside diameter of a shotgun barrel, while caliber generally refers to the diameter of rifle and handgun bullets. However, a .410 is the caliber of a small shotgun, which is never called a 67½-gauge. Gauge was developed hundreds of years ago, before accurate devices allowed for precise measurement.\r\n\r\n\r\nTip 2: Caliber.\r\n\r\nCaliber refers to the diameter of a bullet, and can be expressed in either metric (7mm) or English (.284) measurements, depending on where it was developed (Europe or the U.S.), or the whims of the marketing department of the company that first designed the bullet.\r\n\r\nTip 3: Numbers Aren’t Always Exact.\r\n\r\nThe .38 Special and .357 Magnum are both 38-caliber, but the bullet is actually 357-thousandths of an inch in diameter. The .30-30, .30-06, .300 Winchester Magnum, and .308 are all different, non-interchangeable rounds that are all 30-caliber. However, 30-caliber bullets are .308-inches in diameter. I once saw a customer go ballistic (pun intended) because he wanted to handload his .30-30, and the clerk gave him bullets that were .308-inch in size. The clerk was right.\r\n\r\nTip 4: Those Other Numbers.\r\n\r\nSo if a .30-30 and a .30-06 are both 30-caliber rounds, that are .308-inch in diameter, why do they have those extra numbers? In the case of the .30-30, it meant that there was originally 30-grains of smokeless powder inside the case. However, for the .30-06, the -06 has nothing to do with powder—that was the year, 1906, that the round was adopted by the U.S. Army. There are other cartridges, such as the .30-378 Weatherby Magnum that is 30-caliber (.308), but it used a necked-down .378 case. And then there are rounds like the 7.62×39 and the 7.62×51, where the 39 and 51 refer to the length of the case.\r\n\r\nTip 5: Never Assume.\r\n\r\nA .22 LR (long rifle) is much different from a .220 Swift, a .22-250, or a .22 Hornet. A .300 Winchester Magnum will not work in a .300 Weatherby Magnum, and you can’t buy a spacer to make a .300 Super Short Magnum work in a .300 Short Magnum. I was once ridiculed by a friend when I wanted to buy a .44 Magnum rifle, because everyone knew that the .44 Magnum was a handgun cartridge. The joke was on him, as there are a number of rifles chambered to shoot handgun rounds, and a few handguns that shoot some rifle cartridges.\r\n\r\nTip 6: Other Language Problems.\r\n\r\nLanguage is constantly changing, and the rules can change as popular usage changes. It drives me nuts when a gun’s magazine is called a “clip.” However, I often use the word “bullet” to indicate an individual round or cartridge, even though the bullet is actually just one component of that cartridge.\r\n\r\nTip 7: Why So Many?\r\n\r\nLooking through a reloading manual, I found bullets with actual diameters of .257, .264 (6.5mm), .277, and .284 (7mm). Do we really need bullets in so many diameters that are so similar? Well, I don’t need them, but someone does. Bullet diameter is only one variable in the performance of a particular round. The case size and shape, as well as the kind of powder and primer, all have an effect on the downrange performance. To each his own.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nby Whitetails Unlimited on October 10, 2011', 1, 1, '182.188.231.142', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

By the way there wasn''t any sort of stoppage or malfunction experienced in any of the shotguns used that day.\n   \n   \n  Below are the photos of range, shooter n equipment;\n   \n  AK47 & Denovo87 posing before starting smoking shotguns:\n   \n  [IMG]http://i577.photobucket.com/albums/ss220/denovo87/Range n Targets/9-12-12 Shotguns Tested/AKnDenovo.jpg[/IMG]\n   \n  AK47:\n   \n  [IMG]http://i577.photobucket.com/albums/ss220/denovo87/Range n Targets/9-12-12 Shotguns Tested/AKposing.jpg[/IMG]\n   \n  1-2-3...GO: \n   \n  [IMG]http://i577.photobucket.com/albums/ss220/denovo87/Range n Targets/9-12-12 Shotguns Tested/GettingreadyforAction.jpg[/IMG]\n   \n   \n  [IMG]http://i577.photobucket.com/albums/ss220/denovo87/Range n Targets/9-12-12 Shotguns Tested/MossbergSmokingslug.jpg[/IMG]\n   \n  Now lets targets do the talking:\n   \n  Target shot with Mossberg 835:\n  [IMG]http://i577.photobucket.com/albums/ss220/denovo87/Range n Targets/9-12-12 Shotguns Tested/Mossbergnslugs.jpg[/IMG]\n   \n   \n  Target shot with DSA ZARS and Hatsan Escort Magnum:\n   \n  [IMG]http://i577.photobucket.com/albums/ss220/denovo87/Range n Targets/9-12-12 Shotguns Tested/DSAvsHatsan.jpg[/IMG]\n   \n   \n  And here a non-ending argument starts as always ;)\n\n   \n  [IMG]http://i577.photobucket.com/albums/ss220/denovo87/Range n Targets/9-12-12 Shotguns Tested/HatsanwiningDSA.jpg[/IMG]\n   \n   \n  Good news for all Escort Magnum Combo owners is that small barrel has been tested now with slugs and we declared it safe & very accurate to shoot slugs.[/QUOTE]\n\nNice shooting Sir G "sanoo vee sollah maar landay" that was the best chance to check my Winchester defender 1300 with slugs.', 1, 1, '175.110.67.91', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

When I say bullet, I mean the actual projectile that leaves then gun and strikes the target. The bullets of most American and English cartridges are measured in inches: .22 caliber (.224"), .25 caliber (.257"), .30 caliber (.308") etc., etc.\n\nMost European calibers are metric: 7mm (.284"), 8mm (.323"), 9mm (.355")\n\nCartridge names (like 30-06, .45-70, etc.) are a whole different matter altogether.\n \n\n[LIST]\n[*]Caliber is the measurement of the diameter of the bore/muzzle of a gun described in either milometers (mm) or inches.\n[/LIST]\n \n\n[LIST]\n[*]The caliber of a cartridge refers to the approximate diameter of the projectile, whether expressed as inches or millimeters. The cartridge manufacturer designates the caliber based on the weapon it''s designed for, to distinguish it from other cartridges of similar size. In the North American system, a bullet''s caliber is expressed in inches. A .357-caliber bullet is roughly 357 hundredths of an inch in diameter. The European system designates the bullet''s diameter in millimeters. Converting from the American system to the European method of measuring a bullet doesn''t yield the exact measurement in millimeters, but it offers a close comparison.\n[/LIST]\n \n[B][U]1 [/U][/B]\nPlace a decimal point in front of the bullet''s caliber if it''s written without one. A 32-caliber bullet is roughly .32 inches in diameter.\n[B][U]2 [/U][/B]\nUse the decimal designation of the bullet in inches and ignore any numbers that follow it. For instance, a .30-06 and a .30-03 should both be considered .30 inches in diameter.\n[B][U]3 [/U][/B]\nDisregard words and abbreviations that follow the decimal size. Consider a .38 ACP and a .38 Special to both be .38 inches.\n[B][U]4 [/U][/B]\nMultiply the diameter in inches by 25.4---the number of millimeters in an inch---to convert the size to millimeters. For example, .30 inches x 25.4 mm/inch = 7.62 mm.\n[B][U]5 [/U][/B]\nKeep in mind that the size comparison is only approximate because the caliber is based on factors other than size. For instance, a .380-caliber actually measures .355 inches and a .38-caliber measures .357 inches.

However, he said that various forge and foundries are  beginning to meet the demand including specialised steels for the  barrels and the required ones for springs.\n The officials attribute the improvements in standards to the higher price the users are beginning to pay to the smelters.\n &#8220;This is mainly because the sports, hunting and personal weapons  makers are getting significant orders from abroad, which also brings  better profit margins,&#8221; said Shahnawaz Burney, CEO Pakistan Hunting  & Sporting Arms Development Company (PHSADC) and the organisers of  TOSS.\n &#8220;The western countries, which have a strong tradition of gun making  and cutlery industry, are getting away from the labour intensive jobs  leaving space for country like Pakistan. Luckily, we have a strong base  for gun making &#8211; hardly matched in any developing country of the world &#8211;  besides the daggers and knife makers of Wazirabad have excellent  expertise in the field,&#8221; Burney said.\n He went to add that the important issue that needs serious attention  is the conversion of majority of these cottage and informal sector into a  standardised industry.\n Many internationally recognised brands, including Beretta 9mm and TT  pistol, have stopped making certain models of arms including pistols and  have lifted the patents restrictions too. This in turn has helped the  Pakistani manufactures to market these well known varieties in Europe  and the US as well as earning a local fan base of these cloned guns.\n Recently, the Peshawar Arms Company has received a huge order to  produce parts of 30 bore pistol, as a result the company has started to  modernise its manufacturing units to meet the international standards.\n The authorities expect that within 12-14 months the local  manufacturers would be able to reach the barrel making capacity of  international standards, due to increase in business flow.\n &#8220;Soon the production of barrels to match the international standards  starts &#8211; we are going to ask the government to include the local  manufacturers in the bidding process for the purchase of weapons  including 9 mm pistols for various agencies including\nthe FIA, police and other security forces,&#8221; Burney said.', 1, 1, '125.209.116.158', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

It was very reasonably priced at just Rs 40k and I didn''t hesitate in getting this beauty.\n\nThe gun is very balanced, and although it''s weight is 8lbs as compared to the normal rws350 magnum''s weight of 8.20lbs, it feels very much lighter than the latter. The gun is very well balanced and feels like half the weight of the normal 350magnum.M.A I got a good piece and the recoil is almost half than that of the 350 magnum I had and it''s much more accurate due to this fact. Although I have just shot 3 pellets through it, really amused by this slim and fun-to-use airgun. It''s stock does not have a raised cheek-piece and that is what I like the most about it. With the other 350mag, I couldn''t aim properly as the stock would hit my jaws due to raised cheeck-piece and high recoil. It''s very comfortable to use and what I liked the MOST are the well-made fiber optic''s which simply outshine the normal 350 mag''s useless, cheap iron sights, and not to miss the TO-6 trigger.\nAt that shop, they had Gamo Shadow 1000 for Rs 21k, Gamo Whisper for 22.5k, rws 34 classic for 32k, rws 34 premium for 37, rws 34 professional for 35k, got mine the 350 Feuerkraft for 40k and they had the 460 magnum for 45k.....ALL NIB.\nHere are the pics:\n[IMG]http://i1203.photobucket.com/albums/bb399/B77W/rws350classic016.jpg[/IMG]\n[IMG]http://i1203.photobucket.com/albums/bb399/B77W/rws350classic017.jpg[/IMG]\n[IMG]http://i1203.photobucket.com/albums/bb399/B77W/rws350classic019.jpg[/IMG]\n[IMG]http://i1203.photobucket.com/albums/bb399/B77W/rws350classic018.jpg[/IMG]\n[IMG]http://i1203.photobucket.com/albums/bb399/B77W/rws350classic020.jpg[/IMG]\n[IMG]http://i1203.photobucket.com/albums/bb399/B77W/rws350classic021.jpg[/IMG]\n[IMG]http://i1203.photobucket.com/albums/bb399/B77W/rws350classic023.jpg[/IMG]\n[IMG]http://i1203.photobucket.com/albums/bb399/B77W/rws350classic022.jpg[/IMG]\n[IMG]http://i1203.photobucket.com/albums/bb399/B77W/rws350classic025.jpg[/IMG]\nthis pattern is just oiling\n[IMG]http://i1203.photobucket.com/albums/bb399/B77W/rws350classic024.jpg[/IMG][/QUOTE]\n\nYo[COLOR=#3E3E3E]u have to b[/COLOR][COLOR=#3E3E3E]uy a heavy scope like Dia[/COLOR][COLOR=#3E3E3E]na 4-16X42 AO[/COLOR]', 1, 0, '82.233.250.224', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

I could see that this forum is active since a couple of years. Now I regret why I couldn''t find about it earlier. People here are very knowledgeable and sincere to their hobby. I could have get lot of useful information and saved myself from a lot of hassle as well that too just reading through the posts.\n\nI want to ask a question regarding which I couldnt find much information in the forum posts. But forgive me if my querry has been already replied somewhere since I couldn''t go through everything.\n\nI have a Browning fusion evolve semi auto shotgun. Due to my other commitments I cant use this often and it is kept stored in its original box most of the time. For storing in the original box the gun has to be dismantled and the barrel separted from the receiver. The owners manual recommends to remove the barrel while the bolt is in locked position rearward. After removing the barrel, I slowly release the bolt in order to avoid its hitting forward since barrel is removed. But this keeps the hammer in cocked position. I am afraid of releasing the hammer in this position by just pulling the trigger and damaging something. The owners manual mentions nothing about the position in which hammer should be while the gun is stored in this way. In my case the hammer always remained cocked. It would have been easier had the gun stored in assembled position since in that case I could use an empty shell or a snap cap and pull the trigger to release the hammer.\n\nCan anybody help me in this regard. Since my gun is most of the time not used and I dont want to ruin it without ever getting a chance to use it whenever I have enough time.\n\nThanks in advance for the help from all experienced seniors,', 1, 0, '58.27.193.214', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

In my shotgun i didn''t like the finish of the stock and forend and the finish of the receiver, which was brushed. So i decided to change it by polishing the receiver and refinishing the stock with Birchwoodcasey''s Tru-oil. Honestly i got the idea while watching youtube. Luckily the Tru-oil was available in the market when i was in Lahore. Got to work as soon as i came back. When i started working on it i found out that it''s lengthy process and requires lot of patience and dedication. It took me almost 10 days to get it done. Here is the video that i followed and the instructions can also be found on the Birchwood casey''s website. There are many useful videos on youtube for this process and everybody has there own way of doing it. I liked the finish of this guy so decided to follow it. \n[url]http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOhnr9AENLU[/url]\nThe birchwoodcasey guys did things little differently. Which could be found here\n[url]http://sport.birchwoodcasey.com/files/Literature/BC%20Refinishing%20Guide.pdf[/url]\n\nFirst thing to do is to separate the receiver from the stock. So you got to remove the recoil pad. Then the trigger guard and then remove the big screw in the butt stock. Then comes the hard part of removing the receiver from the stock. As i''m a new to this kind of stuff and we have the shotgun guru here, so i kept in-touch with 12guage bro every step of the way. Continuously calling him and discussing what to do next over the phone. So thanks 12Guage bro for helping me out and taking time to guide me through the process. So first step is to disassemble the stock completely. \n[IMG]http://i1113.photobucket.com/albums/k512/bilal_qureshi1/IMAG0382_zps58d6e426.jpg[/IMG]\n\nThen you separate the receiver from the stock :frusty:\n[IMG]http://i1113.photobucket.com/albums/k512/bilal_qureshi1/IMAG0386_zps9d8adc9c.jpg[/IMG]\n\nNext step is to remove the original finish of the stock of your gun. I didn''t do this step and now wondering if i had done it, it would have looked even better. If you do want to remove it then follow the steps in the video or in the link above with appropriate sand paper. Next you stain the wood to your liking. I liked the way mine looked so i skipped this step too and went straight for true oiling step. Then i sanded my stock with the 320 grit sand paper and applied thin layer of Tru-oil to the whole stock. The pros recommend to let it dry for 15-20 min, but i would recommend to let it dry for an hour atleast. Then apply another thin coat of Tru-oil and let it dry for overnight. Remember to apply thin layers as thicker layers are hard to sand and there will be lots unwanted build-up and runs. Next step is to Wet sand the whole stock with the appropriate sand paper. I used 1000 grid sand paper recommended by our Guru 12Guage. This is the most important step in this process. The more you wet sand the stock the better its gonna turn out. After you have wet-sanded the stock allow it to dry for overnight. It''s gonna look something like this. \n[IMG]http://i1113.photobucket.com/albums/k512/bilal_qureshi1/IMAG0389_zps6d626608.jpg[/IMG]\n\nBe sure to mask the stapling of the gun with the masking tape or paper tape. Once the stock is dry check for rough spots, runs or streaks and knock them down with wet sand paper again. Apply little bit of Tru-Oil in the dry spots and after drying for 15-20 min wet sand it again. I applied 5 coats of Tru-Oil and then wet-sanded the whole thing. Yeah! not easy. Between each coat of Tru-Oil and wet sanding, i allowed it to dry for 24-48 hours depending how quickly it dries. Here is how i dried my stock and how it looked after these coats. \n[IMG]http://i1113.photobucket.com/albums/k512/bilal_qureshi1/IMAG0399_zps93f38f5d.jpg[/IMG]\n[IMG]http://i1113.photobucket.com/albums/k512/bilal_qureshi1/IMAG0400_zps0c408352.jpg[/IMG]', 1, 0, '182.189.86.89', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

Then i applied the last coat of tru-oil and it turned into rich glossy finish or as Mr Boyds says Satin finish. If you want a high Sheen finish then there are two things you can do. Either get Birchwoodcasey''s Tru-oil in aerosol spray or polish the final coat with the Birchwoodcasey''s ''Stock and Sheen conditioner''. But it liked the glossy or Satin finish. So i just polished it with Turtle wax car polish. Which removed any remaining rough spots and imperfections in the finish and made it bit less shiny.

Always treat every firearm as if it were loaded. No ifs, ands, or buts. Even if you know the gun is unloaded.\n\n2. Always keep the firearm pointed in a safe direction, a direction where a negligent discharge would cause minimum damage and zero physical injury. \n\n3. Always keep your trigger finger off the trigger and outside the trigger guard until you have made a conscious decision to shoot.\n\n4. Always be sure of your target. You want to be aware of what&#8217;s in your line of fire. \n\n[B]Grip\n[/B]\nThe Two-handed grip is a must! Sorry but gangsta style won''t do you any good!\n\n1. The gun hand (your dominant hand) should grip the gun high on the back strap .  This gives you more leverage against the weapon which will help you control recoil when you fire the gun.\n\n2. Place your support hand (your non-dominant hand) so that it is pressed firmly against the exposed portion of the grip not covered by the gun hand. All four fingers of your support hand should be under the trigger guard with the index finger pressed hard underneath it. \nYou should place your support hand as high as possible on the grip with the thumb pointing forward, roughly below where the slide meets the frame. \n\n[B]Stance\n[/B]\nStand with your feet and hips shoulder width apart. Take your reaction leg and put it slightly forward not extremely forward so that there is no wasted movement. Avoid hyper-extension. It allows you to fire the weapon with stability and mobility. Raise the weapon toward your target. \n[B]\nSight Alignment and Sight Picture[/B]\n\nUse your dominant eye. \n\nAlign your sights.  Aim at your target and align the top of the front sight so that it lines up with the top of the rear sight. There should also be equal amounts of empty space on both sides of the front sight.\n\nSet your sight picture. The sight picture is the pattern of your gun&#8217;s sights in relation to your target. When you&#8217;re aiming a gun, you&#8217;re looking at three objects: the front sight, the rear sight, and your target. However, it&#8217;s not possible to focus simultaneously on all three objects. One of the objects will inevitably be blurry when you&#8217;re aiming. When you have a correct sight picture, your front and rear sight appears sharp and clear and your target appears to be a bit blurry.\n \nRemember that further away your target is, the greater the need for a clear focus on the front sight.\n\n[B]Trigger Management\n[/B]\nMost missed shots are trigger related so trigger control is extremely important.\n\nTo fire a gun properly, you don&#8217;t actually want to pull the trigger, but rather press it in a controlled fashion so you don&#8217;t disrupt your sights. \nThings to remember:\n\n1. Press, don&#8217;t pull. Instead of pulling the trigger, press the trigger straight to the rear. Apply constant, increasing reward pressure on the trigger until the weapon fires. Ensure that you&#8217;re only applying pressure to the front of the trigger and not the sides.\n\n2. Take the slack out of the trigger. Squeeze the trigger to the point you start feeling resistance.\n\n3. Surprise yourself. Keep pressing the trigger straight to the rear until the gun fires. Don&#8217;t anticipate when the gun will fire. You sort of want to surprise yourself as to when the gun actually discharges. \n\n[B]Breath Control\n[/B]\nTry to break the shot on your natural respiratory pause. I was taught to use the B.R.A.S.S technique: \n[B]\nB[/B]reathe. [B]R[/B]elease halfway and hold. [B]A[/B]im. [B]S[/B]queeze. [B]S[/B]hoot.\n\n[B]Follow Through[/B]\n\nIt is actually the end of the cycle.  It is at this point, after you have fired a round, that the everything begins all over again. Resetting the trigger, obtain a proper sight alignment and sight picture, and then you need to begin asking yourself do I need to take another shot? and If I do, will I hit my target?\n\nContinuing to do everything that was being done at the time the shot was fired. Follow through prevents any unnecessary movement before the bullet exits the barrel.\n\nThese are the firearm safety and fundamentals explained briefly.', 1, 0, '115.186.165.52', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

Always treat every firearm as if it were loaded. No ifs, ands, or buts. Even if you know the gun is unloaded.\r\n\r\n2. Always keep the firearm pointed in a safe direction, a direction where a negligent discharge would cause minimum damage and zero physical injury. \r\n\r\n3. Always keep your trigger finger off the trigger and outside the trigger guard until you have made a conscious decision to shoot.\r\n\r\n4. Always be sure of your target. You want to be aware of what’s in your line of fire. \r\n\r\n[B]Grip\r\n[/B]\r\nThe Two-handed grip is a must! Sorry but gangsta style won''t do you any good!\r\n\r\n1. The gun hand (your dominant hand) should grip the gun high on the back strap .  This gives you more leverage against the weapon which will help you control recoil when you fire the gun.\r\n\r\n2. Place your support hand (your non-dominant hand) so that it is pressed firmly against the exposed portion of the grip not covered by the gun hand. All four fingers of your support hand should be under the trigger guard with the index finger pressed hard underneath it. \r\nYou should place your support hand as high as possible on the grip with the thumb pointing forward, roughly below where the slide meets the frame. \r\n\r\n[B]Stance\r\n[/B]\r\nStand with your feet and hips shoulder width apart. Take your reaction leg and put it slightly forward not extremely forward so that there is no wasted movement. Avoid hyper-extension. It allows you to fire the weapon with stability and mobility. Raise the weapon toward your target. \r\n[B]\r\nSight Alignment and Sight Picture[/B]\r\n\r\nUse your dominant eye. \r\n\r\nAlign your sights.  Aim at your target and align the top of the front sight so that it lines up with the top of the rear sight. There should also be equal amounts of empty space on both sides of the front sight.\r\n\r\nSet your sight picture. The sight picture is the pattern of your gun’s sights in relation to your target. When you’re aiming a gun, you’re looking at three objects: the front sight, the rear sight, and your target. However, it’s not possible to focus simultaneously on all three objects. One of the objects will inevitably be blurry when you’re aiming. When you have a correct sight picture, your front and rear sight appears sharp and clear and your target appears to be a bit blurry.\r\n \r\nRemember that further away your target is, the greater the need for a clear focus on the front sight.\r\n\r\n[B]Trigger Management\r\n[/B]\r\nMost missed shots are trigger related so trigger control is extremely important.\r\n\r\nTo fire a gun properly, you don’t actually want to pull the trigger, but rather press it in a controlled fashion so you don’t disrupt your sights. \r\nThings to remember:\r\n\r\n1. Press, don’t pull. Instead of pulling the trigger, press the trigger straight to the rear. Apply constant, increasing reward pressure on the trigger until the weapon fires. Ensure that you’re only applying pressure to the front of the trigger and not the sides.\r\n\r\n2. Take the slack out of the trigger. Squeeze the trigger to the point you start feeling resistance.\r\n\r\n3. Surprise yourself. Keep pressing the trigger straight to the rear until the gun fires. Don’t anticipate when the gun will fire. You sort of want to surprise yourself as to when the gun actually discharges. \r\n\r\n[B]Breath Control\r\n[/B]\r\nTry to break the shot on your natural respiratory pause. I was taught to use the B.R.A.S.S technique: \r\n[B]\r\nB[/B]reathe. [B]R[/B]elease halfway and hold. [B]A[/B]im. [B]S[/B]queeze. [B]S[/B]hoot.\r\n\r\n[B]Follow Through[/B]\r\n\r\nIt is actually the end of the cycle.  It is at this point, after you have fired a round, that the everything begins all over again. Resetting the trigger, obtain a proper sight alignment and sight picture, and then you need to begin asking yourself do I need to take another shot? and If I do, will I hit my target?\r\n\r\nContinuing to do everything that was being done at the time the shot was fired. Follow through prevents any unnecessary movement before the bullet exits the barrel.\r\n\r\nThese are the firearm safety and fundamentals explained briefly.[/QUOTE]\r\n\r\nVery well explained, will benefit to all of us brothers of the PG  family.

It could weaken then hammer spring/coil. What most semi auto user do is that simply press the trigger and relieve the tension of the hammer spring. Hammer strikes the firing pin thats it. You are not dry firing it where the hammer strikes the firing pin multiple times in a row. Dont worry you wont damage anything.\n\nRegards.[/QUOTE]\n\nThank you very much @12GAUGE sir. I am also worried that by storing the hammer in cocked position will weaken the spring. There is also no problem in "dry firing" when the gun is assembled. But when the barrel is dis-assembled from the reciever, there is following caution in that case. [B]"If the bolt is released forward with the barrel removed, the cartridge stop will hit the front of the receiver and cause damage." [/B]Although I can work around this caution and by grabbing the bolt handle and slowly releasing it so that it doesn''t hit the front of the receiver. This releases the tension on the recoil spring but hammer still remains cocked. Now at this point I am worried to release the hammer by just pressing the trigger since bolt is already not at its place and is loose. Please help me in this regard. otherwise I am planning to buy another case and store the gun assembled.\n\nThanks,', 1, 0, '58.27.193.214', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

In 1893, Spain adopted a new model Mauser in this same caliber. This rifle has been called the Spanish Mauser ever since, although it was also adopted by Mexico and a number of South American countries. Remington chambered their rolling block and Lee rifles for the 7mm about 1897, and later the Model 30. The Winchester Model 54 and 70 also chambered it. Currently, the Ruger Model 77 and Winchester Featherweight bolt action, plus the Ruger Number One single shot offer the 7mm as standard among American-made rifles. However, most British-and European-made bolt-action rifles and combination guns chamber the 7mm Mauser, as do many custom-made rifles each year.\r\n\r\n    Although originally a military cartridge, the 7x57mm Mauser has proven itself as one of the best all-around sporting rounds ever developed. It is particularly useful in lightweight rifles because it delivers good killing power with moderate recoil. It has been used successfully on every species of big game on earth, including elephant. However, it is no elephant cartridge in the true sense of the term and its success is due largely to the hunting conditions and ability of the hunters who have used it. Ballistically, it is only less powerful than 270 Winchester or the 280 Remington. It is adequate for most American big game, but is perhaps on the light side for Kodiak bear or moose unless used by an experienced hunter. The 7mm Mauser was discontinued in American-made rifles about 1940 due to lack of popularity.

The 243 was quickly adopted by Savage for their Model99 lever- and Model 110 bolt-action rifles. All or the British and European manufacturers began chambering bolt-action rifles for this round, including BSA, FN, Sako, Husqvarna, Mannlicher-Schoenauer and others. In fact, even Remington, who developed their own 6mm, had to recognize the popularity of the 243 and start chambering their rifles for it. The 243 (6mm) Winchester is nothing more than the 308 Winchester case necked-down. Original development and publicity was due largely to the efforts of gun writer, the late Warren Page, who along with other wildcatters worked out a similar version before Winchester. The 243 is probably chambered in more different rifles than any other cartridge, except possibly the 308 Winchester.\r\n    The 243 Winchester represents a successful effort to develop a varmint-to-deer class rifle that could hold its own with the various high-velocity 22s for extremely long-range use on small targets and still be adequate for the larger animals. The 243 does this job so well that it has taken a lot of play away from the 222 Remington and all the rest of the 22 cartridges. It eliminates the need to own two different rifles for anything from small game and pests right up to and including deer, antelope or black bear. The 80-grain bullet is intended primarily for varmint and medium-sized game and the 100-grain bullet for deer -size animals. The 257 Roberts and the 250-3000 Savage are supposed to cover the same range and certainly do. However, the 25-caliber bullets don''t have quite the sectional density for long-range varmint shooting until bullet weights gets up around 120-grains, and then the velocity falls off badly. All in all, the 6mm does a better job in covering the intended range of game and shooting conditions.', 1, 0, '203.81.211.40', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

Thus it takes 12 lead spheres the size of a 12 gauge shotgun bore to weigh one pound, or another way to say it is that a [SUP][SIZE=2]1[/SIZE][/SUP]&#8260;[SUB][SIZE=2]12[/SIZE][/SUB]th pound ball fits a 12 gauge bore. It follows that there are ten 10 gauge or twenty 20 gauge balls per pound. \n\nThe term is related to the measurement of cannon, which were also measured by the weight of their iron round shot.

Well i had these two weapons which were special to me, and i believe classics as they aint common here in pakistan. the weapons were 9mm Walther P5 and V. Bernardelli Over and under 12 gauge. Both of these performance wise are excellent weapons. Now before i upload the pictures, for walther i learned from pak guns that bluing is a process in which gun metal is fixed. its a difficult process.. i believe a proper gunsmith can do it only... so yeah for a moment i was dishearten on the fact that nothing could be done. then i thought to giving the parts to polish to a proper painter and polisher, but it had the risk of destroying the cause i cant risk these. Finally i thought why not try brasso. yap... so i went on and purchased a bottle worth 340rs. on it, it was stated that it could be used on steel, chrome , brass and few other metals, Now i took and old vest and applied it smoothly on metal parts... and after i rubbed it well, blackish layer was coming off... i spent 2 hours ( yap it is tiring and u need to spend time on it) but the results were pretty good. \r\n\r\nNow my shotgun is pretty good, as i wanted it to be shinny and clean. (Just want to add from better front sights). Please advice where can i get them from pindi/islamabad.\r\n\r\nfor the pistol, little bit back ground it is give to my father by pakistan army. and he carries it regularly as he really likes it, along with Pb. The metal on gun has scratches on it.... i polished it. but u will notice it still not up to the mark. further more, i am thinking to add ruber grip, please advice where i can get that...

Sometimes the army or police go their own way, as do some provinces and cities.  It''s also a time when cultural, racial, religious, or language groups become more of an issue.\n\nIt''s not unusual to have half a dozen different police, armies, and governments proclaiming themselves the One True Authority and promising retribution to anyone who doesn''t agree.

The 30-06 is actually a slightly-modified version of the original 1903 cartridge, which was loadedwitha 220-grain round-nosed bullet at a muzzle velocity of 2300 fps. Because of cartridge developments in Europe, it was considered advisable to change to a 150-grain bullet at an increased velocity of 2700 fps, and at the same time the case neck was shortened by 0.7-inch. This improved round was designated the " Ball Cartridge, caliber 30, Model of 1906" but in practice, nomenclature was shortened to 30-06. The 30-06 version can be chambered and fired in any rifle made for the original 1903 round, but the reverse is not always true because of the difference in case length. For many years both the 1903 and 1906 loadings and case configurations were loaded by sporting ammunition manufacturers. Shooting the ''06 in the ''03 chamber reportedly gave poor accuracy. Old catalogs list both rounds, and occasionally the 1903 version is called the 30-45 because the original loading used 45 grains of smokeless powder.\r\nAgain, because of military developments in Europe, the Army switched to a 172-grain bullet with a 9-degree boat-tail in 1926, the new round being designated the "Ball, caliber 30, M1." Muzzle velocity, originally the same as the 150-grain load of 2700 fps, was later reduced to 2640 because of difficulty maintaining pressure specifications at the higher velocity. In 1940, the 150-grain flat-base bullet was re-adopted as the "Cartridge Ball, caliber 30, M2". The return to the lighter bullet came about, at least in part, because of difficulties adopting the then-new Garand semi-auto rifle to handle 172-grain loading.\r\nThe rimless 30-03 and the later 30-06 replaced the older rimmed 30-40 Krag as the official U.S. military round. The 30-06 has, in its turn, been superseded by the 7.62mm M59, also known as the 7.62 NATO or, in its commercial version 308 Winchester. As a sporting cartridge, the 30-06 is one of the most popular and widely-used big game numbers ever developed.  In Europe it is known as 7.62x63mm. Every manufacturer of standard length bolt-action sporting rifles in the western world chambers the 30-06.\r\nThe Winchester Model 1895 lever-action appears to have been the first sporting rfle chambered for the new 30-03. The cartridge was added to the line of available calibers in 1904-1905, the modified 1906 round in 1908. The Remington bolt-action Model 30, introduced in 1921, and the Winchester bolt-action Model 54 brought out in 1925 both offered the 30-06, among other calibers. The savage bolt-action Model 40 and 45 Super-Sporter rifles were also chambered when introduced in 1928. At present, in addition to the many bolt-action rifles, the Remington Model Six slide action and Four semi-auto, as well as the Browning and Heckler & Koch semi-auto, include the 30-06 as standard calibers. The Ruger Number One single shot rifle is also offered in 30-06.\r\n\r\nThe 30-06 is undoubtedly the most flexible, all-round big game cartridge available to hunter. For many years it has been the standard by whch all other big game cartridges have been measured. To say that a cartridge is in the 30-06 class means it is suitable for any game in North America. The secret of success when using this cartridge is to be sure and select the right bullet for the game and hunting conditions at hand. The lighter bullets of 100 to 130 grains be used only for varmint hunting. While these bullets can be driven at impressive velocities, starting out at over 3000 fps, they  are made to expand rapidly on small animals and will not penetrate properly on large game. For deer, antelope, goat, sheep, black or brown bear, under most hunting conditions, the 150- or 165-grain bullet is proper. For heavier game such as elk, moose or the big brown bear, the 180-,200- or 220-grain bullet is the best choice. These are also considered best for woods or brush hunting, regardless of the quarry. Many experienced hunters consider the 180-grain bullet the most satisfactory all-round loading for the 30-06 because it can be used effectively on anything from deer-sized animals to the heaviest varieties under almost any hunting conditions. When hand-loaded with the 250-grain bullet, the 30-06 practically duplicates the performance of the British 318 Rimless-Nitro, popular in many parts of Africa for shooting plains game. As a matter of fact, the 30-06 will give a good account on all but the heaviest or most dangerous African or Asiatic species under average hunting conditions. The 220-grain bullet is generally recommended for African game although the 180-grain also has a good reputation there. With the proper bullet, this cartridge can be adapted to any game or hunting situation in North or South America, whether in the mountains, plains, woods or jungles.', 1, 0, '203.81.211.206', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

The Remington-Lee Bolt-action, Remington rolling block, Winchester Model 95 lever action and high-wall single shot chmbered the 30-40 Krag. No commercial rifles used the cartridge from about 1936 to 1973. The Winchester high-wall single shot was the firdt commercial rifle in the U.S. produced for a small-bore, smokeless powder cartridge. This happened when the 30-40 Krag was added to the available calibers during 1893. The first smokeless sporting cartridge ( 30-30 ) didn''t arrive until 2 years later. From 1973 until 1977 Ruger No. 3 single shot was chambered for the 30-40 Krag, thus stimulating a renewed interest in the cartridge.\r\n\r\nThe 30-40 Krag has retained a degree of popularity because the Krag military rifles and carbine fairly widely distributed. Some very fine sporting rifles have been built up by altering and restocking the old Krag. It has one of the smoothest working actions of any bolt-action rifle ever made. Although not as powerful as the 30-06 or even the 308 Winchester, the 30-40 has nevertheless been used successfully on all species of North American big game animal. It is an accurate cartridge and easy to reload, but pressure must be kept down to the 40,000 psi level. On big game, best results are usually with the 180- or 220-grain bullet.

I did fire a couple shots on the ground just to feel where pellets lands and everything felt quiet alright to me. although I admit that shooting on the ground is not the safest and surest of ways to determine pattern performance.\r\n\r\nRegards.', 1, 1, '39.47.21.131', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

(329917, 10594, 0, '12GAUGE', 608, 'Review: Fleece Shooting Jacket', 1356468171, '[B]AoA Everybody[/B]\r\n\r\nWaterfowl hunting has always been a chilly affair for me. To some, this type of hunting means bringing a tasty game bird to dinner table but to me it has always been associated with flu, fever, body aches and severe chest infection. \r\n\r\nFor some, waterfowl hunting brings the early morning thrill, elevated adrenaline levels, heightened sense of achievement and finally the tingling of the taste buds. Unfortunately for me, after every trip, I only dreadfully looked forward to the lack of erection that follows a healthy dose of Panadol (Cold n Flu).\r\n\r\nSo, why its such a horrible experience for me? Well&#8230;. stuff that I use to protect my fragile existence against the elements is either too thin to offer any protection to begin with or it ends up being too thick, borderline impractical as far as free body movement is concerned. plus thick winter jackets also mess up your gun fit.\r\n\r\nFor me it was always the decision that commanded such a high price. The decision to go thin for a rapid gun mount and free body movement but at the cost severe repercussions or to go thick at the cost of significantly restricted body movement that always seemed to attract bad mounting like a magnet.\r\n\r\nNot anymore gentlemen as I have finally found what I was looking for in a winter shooting jacket. I wanted something warm, light weight and of reasonable thickness at the same time which doesn''t effect gun fit. I wanted something that offers enough room for free body movement, aiding in a proper gun mount. Anyways, without excessive foreplay, kindly allow me to introduce my newly acquired Winter Shooting Jacket. \r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i998.photobucket.com/albums/af103/12gauge-pakguns/Winter%20Shooting%20Jacket/Pic01.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\nIt has everything that I have been longing for in terms of a proper shooting jacket for hunting in the morning full of wintery chill.\r\n\r\nDetails:\r\n\r\nIts made out of Water Repelling Bonded Fleece which is both light weight and offers superb protection against cold by being remarkably insulating. It is also soft which everyone likes (unless you like to wear a black leather outfit and have a huge collection of shiny handcuffs). I got this piece for a mere sum of PKR3,500 from a reputable Sialkot based [URL="https://www.metasco.com/"](Metasco International)[/URL] manufacturer and exporter of Hunting and Sport Shooting apparel and accessories.\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i998.photobucket.com/albums/af103/12gauge-pakguns/Winter%20Shooting%20Jacket/Pic02.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\nEverything about this jacket speaks high quality, both in terms of materials and construction. All panels are double stitched with over-locked edges. The zipper too seems of a higher quality. I guess the manufacturer must have considered heavy yanking/pulling by frozen hands when designing this thing. The ambidextrous shooting jacket sports full length suede panels on both sides to aid a proper gun mount for both right and left handed shooters.\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i998.photobucket.com/albums/af103/12gauge-pakguns/Winter%20Shooting%20Jacket/Pic03.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\nThe bellowed front pockets are fairly wide and easily accommodate a standard box of cartridges. The top covers of the pockets can be permanently opened by using the attached Velcro patches. \r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i998.photobucket.com/albums/af103/12gauge-pakguns/Winter%20Shooting%20Jacket/Pic04.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\nThe two side pockets are also there to warm icy hands incase they feel too cold and too stiff for comfort. \r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i998.photobucket.com/albums/af103/12gauge-pakguns/Winter%20Shooting%20Jacket/Pic05.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\nAll high wearing spots have been reinforced with high strength and water proof material. I am guessing that it is some kind of parachute type stuff.\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i998.photobucket.com/albums/af103/12gauge-pakguns/Winter%20Shooting%20Jacket/Pic06.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\nThe collar closes fully to retain the body heat from getting out. the collar itself is a surprise. It has a hidden pocket in it that houses a full size parachute hood to cover one''s head, a simple and ingenious solution.\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i998.photobucket.com/albums/af103/12gauge-pakguns/Winter%20Shooting%20Jacket/Pic07.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\nBoth cuffs have Velcro straps that are used to close down the cuffs. Another useful feature if insulation and retention of body heat is a primary concern.\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i998.photobucket.com/albums/af103/12gauge-pakguns/Winter%20Shooting%20Jacket/Pic09.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\nThe back has an elastic strap/belt to give the jacket shape and to keep it close to the body. Good feature for a shooting jacket.\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i998.photobucket.com/albums/af103/12gauge-pakguns/Winter%20Shooting%20Jacket/Pic08.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\nTo me this jacket is surprisingly comfortable to wear. It is super light and I hardly notice that I am wearing something extra. On top of that it is super warm and the ease it offers in shouldering a gun serves as icing on the cake. so... from waterfowl to upland, this is now my new favorite hunting companion.\r\n\r\n[B]Regards.[/B]', 1, 1, '39.47.168.40', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

According to the tradition/custom, in vogue, while estimating about the barrel of a firearm, as to how much has it been previously used, they inserted the projectile of the cartridge by holding it from the base/ primer side of the cartridge into the muzzle. A new, less or moderately used firearm''s barrel/muzzle would not let the projectile, completely sink into it.\n\nWhether less credible a criterion to gauge the barrel usage or not, I did the same to my newly acquired PT 1911, not a single cartridge shot from it yet, and to my surprise the .45 projectile fully sunk into its muzzle. \n\nI request the worthy 1911 owners in .45 and seniors to first do the same with the muzzles of their handguns, and please shed some light on the matter! Whether it happens with all 1911s in .45 or not? If yes, why?\n\n[B]Secondly[/B], what do we mean exactly by the barrel to slide fitting? Yes, it should be tight, especially in match grade barrels, yet what about an out of the box, standard PT 1911? Should the barrel locking lugs and the semi circular recesses on the upper side of the slide interlock, really tightly, that means not allowing even the slightest of movement [B]or[/B] there may be a slight play, most probably for better locking/unlocking, every time a fire is shot and the slide has to cycle for the extraction and ejection of the empty case and reloading of a fresh cartridge in the chamber? \n\nI have observed that upon locking the slide back, there is a slight ([I]to and fro[/I]) movement of the barrel. If so, is it normal and a natural feature of the barrel locking lugs / Browning mechanism or that the barrel should not have a play, even slight, at all? \n\nRegards!', 1, 1, '202.147.162.5', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

The Western Cartridge Co. the first American company to load this round commercially, offered it  here about the latter part of 1925. No American-made commercial rifles were chmabered for the 300 H&H until  some 12 years after its introduction. However, Griffin & Howe and othe rcustom rifle makers turned out rifles for it almost as soon as the British. In 1935, Ben Comfort won the 1000-yard Wimbledon Cup Match with this cartridge and overnight it became the new sensation. The Model 70 Winchester was chambered for the 300 H&H in 1937, and the Model 721 and succeeding Model 700 Remingtons were also available in this caliber. Most Euoropean bolt-action rifles chambered it as standard.\r\n\r\nSince about 1935, the 300 H&H has enjoyed a limited, but increasing popularity in the U.S. Many American hunter & other shooters insist it is not enough better than 30-06 to be worth bothering with. Regardless of which side one favours, this is quite an accurate cartridge and is certainly adequate for any North American big game. Its most useful range is from elk on up, but it is also a very fine long-range cartridge for antelope, sheep or goat. It is very popular in Africa as an all-round caliber for plains game. Its popularity has suffered considerably from competition with the 300 Weatherby and Winchester Magnums plus a host of 30-caliber wildcats, most of them based on some variation of the 300 H&H case.', 1, 0, '115.186.115.139', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

Several European manufacturers chamber the round as standard or on order, and Kodiak ( now out of business ) offered their M158 in this caliber.\r\n\r\nThe 308 Norma Magnum is practically identical in shape to the wildcat 03-308, which is the 338 Winchester Magnum necked-down to 30-caliber (or the 264 Winchester necked up). However, the two cases are not inter-changeable due to a difference in body length. Almost any standard- length 30-06 or 308 Winchester rifle can be re-chambered to take the 308 Norma cartridge. This cartridge is also similar to a number of 30-caliber wildcat magnums based on the blown-out and shortened 300 H&H case, and known collectively as the 300 short magnum group. The 30 Luft, 300 Apes and Ackley short 30 Magnum are representative of this class. Needles to say, the 308 Norma Magnum is adequate for any North American big game and should also do very well on African plains game.

It was developed in 1944 and was actually the last of the necked-down or improved Weatherby developments based on the 300 H&H case.  Commercial ammunition has been available since about 1948, under the Weatherby label. The Weatherbys were the only U.S. rifles chambered for this round on a commercial basis, but it is a popular among custom rifle makers, and in 1989 Remington offered their 700 Classic in 300 Weatherby.

It may not be any better than some of its wildcat cousins, but it is certainly every bit as good as the best of them and has the advantage of being available in factory loads or empty commercial brass. It is one of the most powerful 30-caliber commercial cartridges available today. It has been used successfully on every species of big game found in North America, Africa or Asia.It probably comes closer to being adequate and adaptable for anything, from gophers to elephants, than any other commercial cartridge. If you hand-load it, you can duplicate the performance of any 30-caliber made. However, these large magnum cases are not well-suited to very light loads and the 300 WM should be considered as primarily a big game cartridge.

We cannot say what the minimum RKA value is for every animal and distance at which we hunt because it can never be predicted before.

Jinnah but I also went to lucky star today and after asking 3-4 dealers i think DSA products are not available :( Maybe I havnt searched properly...\n\nIf anyone of you guys can shed some light on DSA product availability in Karachi that will be awesome or if I can buy directly from DSA itself (is that possible considering they are Peshawar based)?? Senior members pls share for valauble insight.\n\n@12guage> if you are reading this I think you can answer this best. I loved your review and the product with all the accessories it came with. would love to own the same set as yours. I hope I am not too nosy...\n\nThanks guys this will be a great help.

I played against Wapda (Skeeter60) and HEC by playing for FRA.  It was my first time competing at this level against the experienced crowd and for most events I only got in one day (30 rounds) practice for most of the events.  I played in 5 events: Free Pistol (50 meter shooting), 10 meter AirPistol, Rapid Fire Pistol, Standard Pistol, Center Fire Pistol.  Managed three bronze and three silvers.  I LOVED this event and am definitely looking forward to the next one... with a lot more practice.  Anyways, here are some pictures I managed to scrounge up.  I am sure Skeeter60 has more to load as well.  Medals were distributed twice throughout the games so noone was walking around with all the medals except two or three people.\nBTW, my Ruger Single Six kicked some serious rear end over there in the Center Fire Event. \n\n[IMG]http://i1109.photobucket.com/albums/h427/pyramids99/_MG_9252.jpg[/IMG]\n[IMG]http://i1109.photobucket.com/albums/h427/pyramids99/MoeenSolo.jpg[/IMG]\n[IMG]http://i1109.photobucket.com/albums/h427/pyramids99/_MG_9262.jpg[/IMG]\n[IMG]http://i1109.photobucket.com/albums/h427/pyramids99/_MG_9258.jpg[/IMG]\n[IMG]http://i1109.photobucket.com/albums/h427/pyramids99/_MG_9241.jpg[/IMG]\n[IMG]http://i1109.photobucket.com/albums/h427/pyramids99/_MG_9238.jpg[/IMG]\n[IMG]http://i1109.photobucket.com/albums/h427/pyramids99/_MG_9237.jpg[/IMG]\n[IMG]http://i1109.photobucket.com/albums/h427/pyramids99/_MG_9228.jpg[/IMG]\n[IMG]http://i1109.photobucket.com/albums/h427/pyramids99/_MG_9229.jpg[/IMG]\n\nPHOTOS COURTESY OF ASIF ARBAB - CEO MONTAGE PRODUCTIONS.', 1, 1, '115.186.153.192', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

From camp fire to liquid fire. we were wondering which qualities those fortunate persons had which we lacked and were not given such facilities. we asked some servants as to who these dignitries were and we come to know that some of them were sardars and nawabs of other tribes, some were MNAs and MPAs , some were AIGs, DIGs and SPs and some were commissioners, deputy commissioners and assistant commissioners. we returned to uur kind hosts who kept us comfortable more than themselves and with them we saw the fireworks . we had breakfast with our nobel hosts and went to competition but this treatment from the admin made us so disappointed that i dindt fire and left,  as the first phase of the competition ended and our hosts see off us. we than came to know through media that a son od peer of bharchoondi (MNA) won the event', 1, 0, '182.179.99.66', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

Another feature that many like is the tangent sight that is available on some variants of the CZ 452 - just move the slider of the tangent sight to desired distance and shoot. Initially you have to zero the rifle by adjusting the front sight. After the initial zero calibration, you are set to go for any distance that is marked on the tangent sight.\n \nI have a CZ 452-2E ZKM. The tangent sight of this model is calibrated in 25-meter increments from 25 to 200 meters. How do I skip the 25-meter leaps and move the tangent sight in smaller increments?\n \nWith a metric ruler I measured the length of the markings between &#8220;25&#8221; and &#8220;200&#8221; on the tangent sight. This distance is 35 millimeters. The number of 25-meter segments between &#8220;25&#8221; and &#8220;200&#8221; is seven (25 to 50, 50 to 75, etc). Each 50-meter distance mark on the tangent sight (25 to 75, 100 to 150 etc.) is 10 millimeters in length. This means that the tangent sight distances can be resolved down to 5-meter intervals (50/10=5) with each millimeter movement of the tangent sight.\n \nThe tangent sight distance markings of CZ 452 start from the rear of the rifle (25 meters) and run towards the muzzle end (200 meters) in 25-meter intervals. As the slider is moved forward (towards the muzzle to increase the distance) the lower end of the scale falls under the slider and thus becomes hidden. If you want to resolve (for example) a distance of 40 meters, you need to move the slider up by 3 millimeters from the 25-meter marking (3*5=15M; 25+15=40M). As the slider is moved upward, the 25-meter mark gets hidden under the slider. What is the solution? There is an answer.\n \nWorking from the next visible tangent marking above the slider (50 meters) I moved the slider 2 millimeters down from this mark (50-40=10M; 10/5=2mm). This gave me the same result as moving the slider 3-millimter upward from the 25-meter mark.\n \nWith four small (1, 2, 3, and 5 millimeter) metric thickness gauges, I am able to set the tangent rear sight of the CZ 452 to any 5-meter increment from 25 meters to 200 meters. Let us say I want to set tangent sight to a distance of 130 meters. The nearest distance marking above the slider is 150 meters. I need to go down 20 meters (150-130=20M) from this mark to reach the intended distance of 130 meters. Since each millimeter on tangent sight scale represents 5 meters, I need move the slider down 4 millimeters (20/5=4mm) from the 150-meter mark on the tangent scale. By using combination of 3 and 1 millimeter thickness gauges (1+3=4mm; 4*5=20M; 150-20=130M) I am able to accurately arrived at my intended distance of 130 meters on the tangent rear sight of the CZ 452. I could have a used a mini 0-10-millimer ruler (less than 0.4 inch in length) to do this measurement.\n \nCZ 452 is a marvel of craftsmanship. This model is no longer in production. At my end some dealers still have it in stock. Market for used CZ 452 is almost dried up as people that do have it, do not want to part from their treasure.', 1, 1, '71.83.91.21', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

Since, I am spending this weekend in Rawalpindi and had nothing to do, I went to Badaruddin today. First I tried Marocchi and then Beretta Xplor Unico.

When I asked if the price is negotiable, he smiled and said when you will come to buy this, we will discuss.\r\n\r\nThen I tried Xplor. No doubt it is very well balanced and light.

In Europe, the 8mm Mauser and several other 8mm cartridges are available in both sizes. The larger size is always designated as S or JS bore. Beside Germany, a great many other European and some South American countries used the 8mm Mauser as a military round.

However, no factory loadings are made in this caliber and it is strictly  a hand-loading proposition. a large variety of good .323-inch bullets is now available for the individual hand-loader, and this has increased the use fullness of the 8mm Mauser for the American shooter.', 1, 0, '203.81.206.203', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

So the westerners and canadian gun nuts who fire thousands of round yearly should be , theoritically , in a better position to assess the shortcomings of gun but i have red countless forums and didnt found any thing showing their displeasure on such changes . but we here in Pakistan hardly cross hundreds and are restless about such changes . beside i have never seen any frame crack issue in viking mp 446 poly in  any country other than pakistan . may be a bad lot came in Pakistan but i think the cracked frame pistols to be the clones and every one know that we are making just original like clones of turkish , chinese and brazillian pistols so why cant we make russian pistols clones', 1, 0, '182.179.108.92', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

The 8mm Magnum is something of a departure from the usual belted, short magnum configuration favored by Remington in the past, a design which will work through the standard-length bolt-action. The 8mm Magnum is based on the full-lengthv375 H&H case blown out, thus requiring a .375-inch longer bolt travel than the standard 30-06 length action. At present, only the Remington 700 Safari grade and the A-square Caesar and Hannibal rifles are available in 8mm Magnum caliber, the extra-long bolt throw required probably inhibiting other companies from adopting it.\nAgain, this is not an entirely original design since it was preceded by similar developments in years past. The 8x68mm (S) Magnum, for example, originated in Germany around 1940 or earlier, and a number of 8mm wildcat magnums such as the 8mm Ernst, 8x62 Durham, 323 Hollis, 8mm PMM, etc., date back to the late 1950s and early 1960s. However, this is the first commercial 8mm magnum cartridge introduced by as American company. Remington offers two loadings: a 185-grain bullet at a muzzle velocity of 3080 fps and a 220-grain at 2830 fps. There is a good selection of 8mm (.323-inch diameter) bullets available for hand-loading, something that increases the flexibility of this cartridge, although those bullets have been intended for the 8x57mm, which might lead to over-expansion at magnum velocities. Bullet makers have, however, supplied proper magnum bullets. This is an example of a fine cartridge that failed to catch on.\n\nThe 8mm, one of the popular and standard calibers in Europe, has never been widely accepted in the U.S. The reason si due probably to our enchantment or preoccupation with the 30-caliber. Remington did not have a 30-caliber magnum in their cartridge lineup, and anything they produced would simply be a duplicate of the 300 Weatherby or Winchester Magnums. It made good sense, therefore, to opt for the 8mm, which offers something a little different. Also, the 220-grain .323-inch diameter bullet starting out at 2830 fps sustains its velocity beyond the 200-yard range better better than the 220-grain bullet from the 300 Winchester Magnum (about 100 fps at 500 yards.) This is not really a tremendous advantage, and there would not be a great deal of difference in killing power between the 8mm Remington Magnum and the various 30-caliber Magnums. The 8mm Magnum would be adequate for any North American big game and probably most African species, too. It should be considered as primarily a big game cartridge rather than something also suitable for varmint hunting. Certainly the 8mm Magnum is an excellent choice for the hunter whose primary interest is big game hunting and who wants sustained killing power out to the maximum practical range. For African hunting, a 250-grain bullet would make sense and Remington should consider this.', 1, 0, '203.81.206.203', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

Now I describe how a small metric 35-millimeter ruler can be used to achieve the same goal. In addition, I have prepared a conversion table for myself and for those interested in dealing with yards instead of meters.\n \nHere is how I use the metric ruler and the conversion table. Measurements are taken between the front of the slider and the 200-meter mark. Move the slider to the 25-meter mark. Place the 35millimter edge of the ruler against the front edge of the slider of the tangent sight. Consult the table and move the slider to achieve the desired distance.

Most 357 Magnum rifles put together by gunsmiths were based on either the Model 1892 Winchester lever-action repeater or some single shot action. With the advent of WWII, interest in such rifles waned, but after the war, numbers of the small Greener Martini-action Australian cadet rifles were imported and many were re-bored and chambered for the 357 Magnum. Interest in rifles of this caliber was revived, particularly as a companion or matched-caliber arm for 357 Magnum revolvers. The first commercial rifle to chamber the 357 was the Marlin Model 62 Lever-matic in 1963. A four-shot, box magazine, lever-action repeater, it was discontinued after only a few years. Universal offered a 357 Ferret semi-auto carbine. Currently, several rifles are offered in 357 Magnum chambering. The Rossi Lever-action and Uberti Rolling Block Baby Carbine were introduced several years ago, and in 1978 the Marlin Model 24-V combination gun in 1979. Obviously, the 357 Magnum must be treated as both a rifle and hand gun cartridge. Any 357 handgun load can be used in rifles, but some rifle loads are much hot to be used in a revolver. When fire in rifle barrels of 18 inches and longer, the 357 develops initial velocities of 1800 to over 2000 fps, depending on bullet weight and load.\r\n\r\nAs a rifle cartridge, the 357 Magnum is a fine, economical, general purpose small game and varmint cartridge, and in a pinch will even do for deer at short ranges. The author has taken wild goat, feral pigs and even mule deer with 357 rifles and found them quite effective if the range is not over 100 to 125 yards. This is not to recommend the 357 as a deer cartridge, but rather to point out that it is quite capable of humane kills on deer if one uses the right bullet and load and ir the range is short. As a matter of fact, the 357 Magnum revolver was for many years after its introduction considered a perfectly adequate deer and bear gun, and a number of such animals have been taken with it by good stalkers. The revolver, of course, develops much less velocity and energy than the same cartridge fired from a rifle, some 600 fps less muzzle velocity, in fact. In a rifle, the 357 Magnum can be loaded with bullets from 110-grains up to 200-grains. The 357 is in general more useful rifle cartridge than the 44 Magnum, although certainly the 44 is much more effective on deer-size animals.', 1, 0, '203.81.206.203', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

Development of both cartridges began in 1980, public announcement was made in December, 1982, and guns and ammunition were available on the market early in 1983. Marlin introduced their lever-action Model 336ER in 356-caliber at about the same time as the Winchester hit the market, but do not catalog it now. The Winchester Model 94 TXR is a beefed-up version of the original Model 94 lever action to allow the use of higher pressure cartridges, and the angle-eject feature is an additional modification to eject spent cartridge cases out to the side instead of straight up. This feature allows the proper center mounting of a scope sight, something not possible with the original 1894 action. This was accomplished by repositioning the extractor and ejector and lowering the right side wall of the receiver slightly.\r\nThe 356-caliber designation is to avoid confusion with the similar rimless 358 Winchester. In fact, the 356 is little more than a rimmed 358 and uses the same diameter bullets. the 356 and the 358 are not absolutely identical since the 356 not only has a rim, but also the bullet is seated deeper to reduce the overall length and the case is made heavier. It''s impossible to chamber 358 cartridges in 356 rifles, but firing them is an unsafe practice that could lead to damage to the gun and possible injury to the shooter.\r\n\r\nThe ballistics of the 356 are slightly below the older rimless 358 because the heavier case combined with the deeper bullet seating reduces the case capacity by about 6 to 7 percent. However, the 356 delivers performance superior to the old and popular 35 Remington by a significant margin. Factory-published ballistics data show that the 35 Remington 200-grain bullet has a muzzle velocity of 2210 fps, whereas the 356 Winchester delivers 2460 fps with the same bullet weight, both from a 24-inch barrel.\r\nWhile 35 Remington is largely a short-range woods or brush cartridge for deer or black bear, the 356 Winchester would be adequate for larger game up to elk and at longer ranges. One should consider though that both the Winchester and Marlin lever-action carbines with their short 20-inch barrels are intended primarily as light, handy guns for use heavy brush or timber and they have achieved their great popularity for that purpose. A hunter armed with one of the 356 carbines could probably take on just about anything likely to be countered in the continental U.S. at short to moderate ranges. The 358 Winchester has never achieved great popularity, and it will be interesting to see how well the 356 is received over the next decade or so.', 1, 0, '203.81.206.203', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

It is known in Europe as the 8.8x51mm, and many European rifle makers chamber the round. In the U.S. only the Browning BLR lever action is currently chambered for this cartridge.\r\n\r\nThe 358 Winchester is easily one of the best commercial (non-magnum) 35-caliber cartridges turned out by any American manufacturer. It is a big improvement over the 35 Remington , slightly more powerful than the old 35 Winchester, and certainly more useful than the 348 Winchester, which it more or less parallels. As the 308 Winchester is a shortened and scaled-down 35 Whelen. With its spitzer pointed bullets, the 358 should be a good medium-to long range cartridge with capabilities out to 225 or possibly even 350 yards on big game. Although a good woods number, it is definitely out of the short-range, deer-only class. In fact, the 358 is adequate for any North American big game, and, with the 250-grain bullet, might be a little better than the 30-06 on the heaviest types in thick cover. The 358 in a bolt-action rifle with a good scope sight is about as accurate as any hunting cartridge available.

By the same token, I doubt very much that you are brave enough to take on the challenge.\n \nThe 22LR was not designed to kill elephants and lions but it has. Let us be candid. The 22LR is a small game animal that is ideal for rabbits, birds and the like. It is perfect for learning and teaching the art of marksmanship. Newcomers enjoy the 22LR as it does not knock them off their feet when they pull the trigger.\n \nBullet weight and bullet velocity are the two elements that determine the bullet energy. Doubling the weight of a bullet with given velocity, doubles the bullet energy. Keeping the bullet weight the same but doubling the velocity results in quadrupling of bullet energy. If the target is at a distance from the muzzle, shape of the bullet will determine the drag and thus the velocity and the energy of the bullet at time of impact.\n \nHere are some links that demonstrate the penetration and destructive power of the 22LR cartridge at various ranges and at various objects. Conclusion of the all these tests clearly shows that the 22LR is not a plaything - it is lethal. We need to pay due respect to this diminutive marvel; an inventions of Joshua Stevens - from way back in 1887. \n\nBallistic Gel at muzzle: [URL]https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MMpCXpztAg[/URL]\nChicken & water bottles at muzzle: [URL]https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WoU99SpCFQY[/URL]\nGreen avocado at 225 yards: [URL]https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43ZeycTo7iI[/URL]\nMeat at 300 yards: [URL]http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAkOzr6cDx0[/URL]\nPinewood at 440 yards: [URL]https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUM1r_444CY[/URL]\nPlywood at muzzle: [URL]https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbEKKXU4bLo[/URL]\nWater bottles at 370 yards: [URL]https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UUg6v2bCOrE[/URL]', 1, 1, '71.83.91.21', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

According to the tradition/custom, in vogue, while estimating about the barrel of a firearm, as to how much has it been previously used, they inserted the projectile of the cartridge by holding it from the base/ primer side of the cartridge into the muzzle. A new, less or moderately used firearm''s barrel/muzzle would not let the projectile, completely sink into it.\n \nWhether less credible a criterion to gauge the barrel usage or not, I did the same to my newly acquired PT 1911, not a single cartridge shot from it yet, and to my surprise the .45 projectile fully sunk into its muzzle. \n\nI request the worthy 1911 owners in .45 and seniors to first do the same with the muzzles of their handguns, and please shed some light on the matter! Whether it happens with all 1911s in .45 or not? If yes, why?\n \nSecondly, what do we mean exactly by the barrel to slide fitting? Yes, it should be tight, especially in match grade barrels, yet what about an out of the box, standard PT 1911? Should the barrel locking lugs and the semi circular recesses on the upper side of the slide interlock, really tightly, that means not allowing even the slightest of movement or there may be a slight play, most probably for better locking/unlocking, every time a fire is shot and the slide has to cycle for the extraction and ejection of the empty case and reloading of a fresh cartridge in the chamber? \n\nI have observed that upon locking the slide back, there is a slight (to and fro) movement of the barrel. If so, is it normal and a natural feature of the barrel locking lugs / Browning mechanism or that the barrel should not have a play, even slight, at all? \n\nRegards!', 1, 1, '202.147.162.5', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

However, information on the rifle and cartridge had been aired in various gun magazines a year earlier. The original carbine had an 18-inch barrel and in 1968 this was lengthened to 20 inches as the Model 660 Magnum carbine. By 1971, the Model 600 and 660 Magnum carbines had been discontinued, but the 350 Magnum was continued as a standard chambering for the Ruger Model 77 bolt-action rifle until 1974. For a short time, the Ruger Model 77 bolt-action rifle was available in 350 Magnum. At the present time, no factory rifles are regularly chambered for this cartridge, but ammunition is still loaded and probably will be for a good many years. The cartridge is unique in having a somewhat short, fat-belted case with the same capacity as the 30-06. This allows for its use in short-action rifles that can be made a bit lighter and handier than those based on the standard-length bolt action.\r\n\r\nIn order for the 350 Magnum cartridge to feed and function properly through the short Model 600 and 660 actions, the bullet must be seated rather deeply. The reason for this is so the overall length will not exceed a maximum of 2.8 inches. This deep seating requirement reduces the powder capacity and reduces the performance somewhat. The Remington Model 700 and the Ruger Model 77 bolt actions have longer magazines and will permit the hand-loader to seat bullets farther out of the case and use slightly increased powder charges within the farther limitation of the chamber throat. The 350 Magnum will duplicate the ballistics of the popular 35 Whelen wildcat in similar barrel lengths and is adequate for any North American big game at short to medium ranges.', 1, 0, '203.81.206.203', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

Townsend Whelen. The cartridge is based on the standard 30-06 case-necked up to 35-caliber without any other change. There is also an improved version made by necking-up the Ackley 30-06 Improved case. In 1987, Remington Arms adopted the 35 Whelen and introduced it as a standardized commercial cartridge chambered in their Model 700 Classic bolt-action rifle, and also their Model 7600 slide-action rifle. In the past, the cartridge has always been chambered in bolt-actions and many shot-out 30-06 barrels were re-bored to 35 Whelen. It was originally developed to provide a medium-bore cartridge that would work through the standard-length bolt action.\r\n\r\nRemington has been very astute in adding popular wildcats to their line of commercial cartridges, and the 35 Whelen should be another winner. The hunters has had considerable past experience with the 35 Whelen, and it is an excellent cartridge for any North American big game and most African species as well. A slide-action rifle of this caliber increases the potential of this type of rifle for those who favor medium bores for North American big game. There is a large variety of 35-caliber bullets available to the hand-loader, ranging from 110 to 300-grains in weight, and 30-06 brass is still easy to come by as a more economical way to load your own. Practically all of the reloading tool manufacturers furnish a 35-caliber neck expanding die, and cases are easy to make. The popularity of the 35 Whelen has waxed and waned over the years, reaching a peak during the 1920s and again shortly after WWII.

However, the Schultz & Larsen Model 65 and the Husqvarna Mauser-type bolt action were made available in this caliber early in 1960. No American manufacturer chambers the cartridge. Like the 308 Norma Magnum, it is something of a proprietary cartridge and perhaps should be listed under European cartridges. However, it was designed for the American market and, as a compromise, it is there.\n\nThe 358 Norma Magnum is a short, magnum-type cartridge intended to work through standard-length actions. It is also nearly identical to the wildcat 35 Ackley belted, short magnum that it can be fired in most rifles so chambered. It is also nearly identical to the wildcat 35-338, which is the 338 Winchester necked-up to 35-caliber, the difference in this instance being mainly in the slightly greater body length of the 358 Norma Magnum (about .51-inch).\nThe 358 Norma Magnum delivers the same performance as the slightly larger 375 H&H Magnum and would be suitable for the same range of game. It is somewhat overpowered for most North American big game, but would be good life insurance against the big Kodiak bears.

I''m not allowed to disclose its name or caliber yet, but it''s scheduled to storm the market in 2013, beginning as soon as early or mid-March. Its performance exceeds current cartridges in its class by a wider margin than the 300 Win. Mag. over the .30-06.\n\nI don''t say this based merely on rumor or manufacturer hype. I''ve shot the new round. It does everything Winchester says it will. The bullets fly from the muzzle 500 fps faster than any other rimfire cartridge I''m aware of. At 250 yards, they retain nearly double the energy of the next-best round in their class. During my testing off sand bags from a portable bench, five bullets clustered just over 1 inch at 100 yards in light but variable winds. A single four-shot group went into a .39-inch spread, and one 300-yard four-shot group fell inside of 2.5 inches. All this was accomplished with a prototype bolt-action rifle so unrefined that cartridges had to be hand fed and extracted from the chamber with a knife blade. \n\nBallistic coefficient and velocity of the bullets are so high that this new round should hold a Maximum Point Blank Range of 250 yards on an 8-inch target. This means you aim at the center of the 8-inch target and hit it at any and all distances out to 250 yards. Last but not least, the new rounds should cost within 10 percent of currently available rimfire rounds in their class, or about a third less than some centerfire rounds with similar ballistic performance.\n\nBecause dimensions of the round are significantly different from any others currently made, at least one gun maker is reportedly building newly designed bolt-action rifles to fire it. Two more are reportedly working on additional models. Whether those are bolt actions, break actions, levers, semiautos or something else remains to be revealed.\n\n&#8220;New&#8221; cartridges are a tried and sometimes true method for ramping up sales in the shooting industry, but most of them provide only incremental improvements over existing rounds. This new cartridge from Winchester is more than that. Much more. It should be a game changer.\n\nReference: Blog Entry at North American Hunter Website\n\nLink: [url]http://www.huntingclub.com/blogs/articletype/articleview/articleid/14630/winchester-will-unveil-game-changing-rimfire-cartridge#.UMd-l2d2PTo[/url]', 1, 0, '46.38.168.14', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

There is a certain joy in giving and receiving gifts. In the same spirit, how about exchanging 22LR ammunition? A nutty idea? Hold your horse before passing judgment on this thought.\n \nLet us go on the assumption that you have one or more 22LR rifles. With the 22LR ammo you have, you get perhaps mediocre, good or excellent results. Regardless, you endeavor to improve your accuracy. How can you achieve this goal or try to achieve it without breaking the bank account to buy yet another 22LR rifle?\n \nJust as there are no two fingerprints alike - in the same fashion, there are no two 22LR rifles alike. Yes, two rifles of the same make and model may bear consecutive serial numbers. Due to the tooling and machining tolerances, reaming of the chambers and the rifling, the barrels will bear unique “internal signatures.” Just because your friend’s 22LR rifle and ammo combination gives him exceptional accuracy does not mean that you will get the same results with your rifle and ammo combination.  You and your friend went together to a gun shop and you both bought the same make and model of rifles along with the same type of ammunition. Yet, the accuracy of your gun differs from that of your friend. You can negate “operator error” by having your friend try your rifle-ammo combo and you can try his rifle-ammo combo. Each rifle may require different type of ammo to achieve the optimum results.\n \nInstead of stocking new 22LR ammo that may give you even inferior results, why not exchange some of your ammo with friends who may not have the same types that you do. The more exchanges you make, the better your chances of achieving or trying to achieve the ideal goal. In this ammo exchange idea, you will also be helping your friend achieve his goal for accuracy.\n \nStill think that exchanging 22LR ammo is nutty idea?', 1, 1, '71.83.91.21', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

Its just that Sig guys have put a plant in Exeter, USA and thats why the frame says "Exeter, USA"... German Sig will be difficult to find and even if you do, it won''t be new... If you want a new Sig, then its American... I''ve kept and shot all three sorts of Sigs and trust me, as far as shooting and handling is concerned, I don''t see any difference...

(331716, 5588, 329654, 'masood357', 4098, '375 Winchester', 1357138742, 'Developed by Winchester, the 375 was announced in 1978 as  a new cartridge for their Model 94 Big Bore lever-action carbine. The gun is a reinforced or strengthened version of the standard Model 94 action and can be distinguished by the beefed-up rear quarter of the receiver, as opposed to the flat sides of the regular Model 94. The  cartridge is based on the shortened (about 1/10-inch) 38-55 case, although the 375 Winchester brass is heavier and stronger than that of the 38-55. Two carbines were initially available in this caliber, the Winchester Model 94 Big Bore and the Ruger Number 3 single shot. It is a rimmed case and not well suited to Mauser-type bolt actions. Two bullet weights are offered: a 200-grain at 2200 fps muzzle velocity and a 250-grain at 1900 fps, as advertised by Winchester and very probably chronographed from a 24-inch barrel. The 20-inch barrel of the Model 94 TXR actually delivers from 50 to 100 fps less muzzle velocity than these figures.\r\n\r\nThe 375 Winchester fills a gap in the line of cartridges available for the very popular Winchester Model 1894 lever-action series. Many hunters who live in heavily-wooded areas like a large- or medium-caliber rifle firing relatively heavy bullets as the best combination for their particular hunting environment. Such a combination was not available for the Winchester Model 1894, and the 375 helps to meet the competition offered by lever actions chambered for the 35 Remington and the 444 Marlin. Comparisons will be made between this 375 and the other popular woods or brush cartridges such as the 35 Remington, 44 Magnum, 444 Marlin and the 45-70. Basically, the 444 Marlin with its 240-grain bullet and 2400 fps muzzle velocity has the edge on all the others in the group. However, all of these cartridges have one common failing, and that is that they are used in lever-action rifles with tubular magazines. This, in turn, requires a flat-nose bullet as a safety factor in the magazine so that under recoil, one cartridge won''t set off the one ahead of it. These blunt-point bullets have very poor aerodynamic from and offer high air resistance so that no matter what the initial velocity, they all slow down rapidly. The result is that at around 200 yards or less they all end up with about the same energy, which varies from 1000 foot pounds to a bit over 1100 foot pounds. All of these brush cartridges, then, are at their best ranges of 150 yards or less.\r\nCertainly the 375 Winchester is a fine deer or black bear cartridge and would probably also do well on heavier game such as moose or brown bear, within its range limitations. It would also serve as a good meat-getter on thin-skinned African species. The 375 cartridge can be chambered in 38-55 rifles, but must never be fired in any rifle except those specifically marked for it because it develops much higher pressure than the older 38-55, and to fire it in any of the old black-powder rifles would almost certainly result in a wrecked gun and possible injury to the shooter or bystanders.', 1, 0, '203.81.206.203', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

If you used a steel cleaning and you inserted it in the barrel from the muzzle end without any bore guide, you very likely may have damaged the bore by rubbing the metal rod against the precision cuts that made of lands and groves in the barrel. If you bought the rifle used, damage to the rifling is even more suspect as you lack knowledge how it was cared for by prior owner(s).\n \nIf you are getting poor results on the range, the culprit could be the crown of the barrel. Crown of the barrel refers to the land and groves of the barrel as they come to an end where the bullet leaves the barrel. It is important that the muzzle of the rifle be perpendicular to the bore. There is a very good reason for this essential symmetry. The rear end of the bullet need to exit the barrel such that the gunpowder gases behind it escape evenly from all around the bullet. If gases do not escape evenly, the flight path of the bullet start to depart from the intended direction. This could leads of lack of accuracy.\n \nA quick way to check the barrel crown is to examine it a under magnifying glass. The lands and groves at the muzzle end need to be sharp and crisp. If you find the condition deficient, barrel re-crowning may be in order. Unless the muzzle in real bad shape, putting it back in shape is not a very big deal. Even if you have to cut a bit of the barrel and re-crown it, the task is not too difficult. Here are two links that show you how you can accomplish this.\n\nRe-crown:  [URL]https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OorpZlG28fI[/URL]\nCut barrel & re-crown: [URL]https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b43odFm0mrI[/URL]', 1, 1, '71.83.91.21', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

Its a costly gun and I feel that all should know the negative points of this gun before going into purchase it. \n\nPlease note that I mention these points with complete confidence and surety.\n\n1. Its heavy for some one who wants to shoot it from standing position.\n\n2. Its very accurate but to find all the potential accuracy you would have to scope it. And this is the most difficult thing to do. This gun is hardest on scopes. Even most of the airgun rated scopes do not last long on it. Many Leupolds fail. It is recoil less to the shooter but has the heaviest recoil on scope.\n\n3. The recoil on scope is even greater than Webley Patriot.\n\n4. Even costly scopes fail after a few hundred or few thousand shots.\n\n5. This gun and 48/52/56TH have the shortest spring lives among all Diana airguns. The average spring life is 4000 shots. Some last for just 1000 and some last for 7000 thousand. So when you buy this gun, be ready to acquire an extra spring.\n\n6. The best accuracy with this gun is in bench rest position. When you take a sharp angle, you would have to adjust the power of recoil less system.\n\n7. There is a sleeve of metal on the barrel. This sleeve needs to be kept tight. But some times it becomes loose which creates problem with accuracy.\n\n8. Peep Sight is the only best option for longer range targets. Sadly most of us in Pakistan dont use Peeps.\n\nI hope this much will help. I am always here to give as much information to all as I can.\n\nRegards,[/QUOTE]\n\nGood thoughts, brother. You have rightly pointed out the drawbacks. And these can be generalized to all high power air guns. I have been using air guns since my child hood. It''s been now more than 30 years. And from my personal experience I can second your observations. We should not expect power of a firearm from an air gun. Every technology has a limit. And these higher powered air guns are at upper end of the limit of this technology. To enjoy air gunning one should buy low or medium powered air guns like Diana 28 or 27. I prefer even Diana 24. They are light, easy to shoot, accurate, last longer, good for scope use, easy to maintain, have low noise, and safe. The above advantages of medium/low powered air guns are the very reasons one should opt for air gunning. If you want more energy then go for .22 rimfire rifles. People buy air guns and expect to kill deers or wild boars with them which is not the reality.', 1, 0, '58.27.193.214', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

The present commercial versions was introduced in 1884 as one of the calibers for the Ballard Perfection No. 4, which was originally chambered for the 38-50 Everlasting. According to Satterlee in his CATALOG OF FIREARMS, 2nd ed, DETROIT, 1939,the Union Hill No. 8 and 9 were also chambered for the 38-55 Ballard in 1884. The external dimensions of the 38-55 Everlasting and the 38-55 Winchester & Ballard are nearly identical, but the heavier, thicker Everlasting version was a hand-loading proposition. The implication in Saterlee''s book is that the original Everlasting case was introduced when Marlin Fire Arms Co. took over Ballard in 1881. The 38-55 Everlasting is nothing more than a 1/10-inch longer case than the 38-50 that Ballard introduced in 1876. The Marlin Model 93 and Winchester 94 lever-action repeaters were available in 38-55. Colt new Lightning slide action, Stevens, Remington and Winchester single shot rifles and also the Savage Model 99. No commercial rifles after Winchester dropped the 38-55 from the Model 94 list of calibers about 1940. However, the cartridge has been reintroduced by Winchester in several versions of the Model 94 in recent years. The 375 Winchester is based on the 38-55 case.\r\n\r\nThe 38-55 built up a reputation for fine accuracy at ranges out to 300 yards, it also developed a modest popularity with deer and black bear hunters, mostly in the woods and at moderate ranges. It gave good knockdown on deer-size animals with the 255-grain bullet at velocities of over 1500 fps. At one time, factory-loaded cartridges were available with the 255-grain bullet at a muzzle velocity of about 1700 fps. At these higher velocities, it is actually a better deer cartridge than 30-30. Present factory loading more or less duplicates the old black-powder ballistics and only by hand-loading can the full potential be developed. In the old Ballard and Stevens single shot rifles, it is not safe to use loads developing velocities over about 1500 fps. Discontinued in 1970, the 38-55 is again listed in Winchester ammunition catalogs. Proper bullet diameter for cast bullets is .379-inch.', 1, 0, '203.81.206.203', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

Second medal is give to me by a Col Wilberforce who use to play tennis with me at NDU, he was here for some course. these are the token of remembrance.  \n\nhere is little detail about the stuff which is here. I have a decent collection with me, but in this room i dont exabit any modern weapon like g19 or anything. thats for defence and not a collection item. Same goes with knives, i have huge collection of over 35 knives, but only special ones are on display. The revolver is Armonius .32 cal Made in germany, Then there is engraved makorave in silver. along with two New stainless steel dragon head daggers. (Presented by Marketing manager of the factory Khalid Chadda, very good hunter and person). and the black pair is new addition, the M5A1 US bayonet for M1 :D 1964.  I designed the bullet showcase my self. took the plain glass, polished the ammo with brasso and sticked it with elfy :P Turned pretty good. \n\nin the locked gun rack, there is Safir, Martiny Henery 450 cal 1895, hatsan 125th , Over and under and Hoglow 501 semi auto 12 gauge and 800 12 mix rounds. :)\nThis aint my full collection. i have an other thread with "my little collection" showcasing all my weapons. \n\nRegards, again thankyou everyone for appreciation. and truly an honor that senior members are appreciating the work.', 1, 1, '198.144.116.116', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

It was originally a black-powder cartridge chambered in the Winchester Model 73 lever action. Shortly after it came out, Colt began chambering revolvers for it. It was later offered in the Remington Model 14 1/2 slide action, Winchester 92 and Marlin 94 lever actions, plus a number of single shot rifles. No rifles have been chambered for the 38-40 since about 1937.\r\n\r\nThe 38-40 was at one time a fairly popular medium-power cartridge. Winchester used to load a high-velocity rifle version with a 180-grain bullet at 1775 fps. This was considered a pretty good short-range deer number, but was not intended for black-powder rifles or revolvers, and was discontinued because it caused a lot of trouble for people who never read labels. The present factory loading is strictly for revolvers, and it is necessary to hand-load in order to realize the full potential in a rifle. With proper load and bullets, the 38-40 can be used on small game, varmints, medium-size game or even deer at short range. Rifle loads should not be used in revolvers as they develop pressures beyond safe limits.\r\nThe 38-40 is bit much for most varmint and small game shooting and really not adequate for deer-size animals, and in any event , quite limited in its effective range on whatever you happen to be using it for. This lack of enthusiasm notwithstanding, the 38-40 enjoyed a certain popularity from its inception until about 1920, after which it declined in sales volume and was finally discontinued in 1937, or thereabouts. Actually, there is no great difference in performance between the 38-40 and the 44-40. although some considered the 38-40 a better cartridge for a woman or young boy because it had somewhat less recoil. Honestly, neither one has any great recoil.\r\nThe 38-40 probably made a better revolver cartridge than it did a rifle cartridge. The present factory load with the 180-grain bullet at 1160 fps (Winchester) can not be considered adequate for deer, and only by hand-loading can one achieve acceptable performance for much of anything.', 1, 0, '203.81.206.203', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

He travelled up to Alaska, spotted a small brown bear and shot it. Soon after there was a tap on his shoulder, and he turned around to see a big black bear.\r\n\r\nThe black bear said, ''That was a very bad mistake. That was my cousin. I''m going to give you two choices. Either I maul you to death or let me have my lusty way.'' After considering briefly, Frank decided to accept the latter alternative. So the black bear had his way with Frank. Even though he felt sore for two weeks,\r\n\r\nFrank soon recovered and vowed revenge. He headed out on another trip to Alaska where he found the black bear and shot it dead.\r\n\r\nRight after, there was another tap on his shoulder. This time a huge grizzly bear stood right next to him.\r\nThe grizzly said, ''That was a big mistake, Frank. That was my cousin and you''ve got two choices: Either I maul you to death or let me have my lusty way.''\r\n\r\nAgain, Frank thought it was better to cooperate with the grizzly bear than be mauled to death. So the grizzly had his way with Frank. Although he survived, it took several months before Frank fully recovered.\r\n\r\nNow Frank was completely outraged, so he headed back to Alaska and managed to track down the grizzly bear and shot it. He felt sweet revenge, but then, moments later, there was a tap on his shoulder. He turned around to find a giant polar bear standing there.

It was initially available with either a 400-grain pointed soft-point or a 400-grain solid bullet loaded to a muzzle velocity of 2400 fps and a muzzle energy of 5115 fpe. The company says that the 400-grain solid is exactly that, turned from solid brass, and not a lead core with a heavy jacket. The cartridge is available in the Remington Model 700 Safari bolt-action rifles. It should prove to be a fairly popular cartridge.\r\n\r\nThere has been a persistent call by those who hunt dangerous game for a cartridge to fill the gap between the 375 H&H Magnum and the 458 Winchester. The 416 Rigby accomplished this rather well, but both rifles and ammunition became increasingly difficult to obtain. This problem was then solved to some extent by a number of wildcat cartridges such as the 416 Taylor, 416 Hoffman and the 425 Express. These cartridges all more or less duplicate the performance of the 416 Rigby, and the 416 Remington does pretty much the same thing. However, the Remington version has one great advantage in that is available as a commercial loading in a proven commercial rifle. The combination will be much easier and less expensive to come by than a custom rifle and wildcat or proprietary cartridges.\r\nAlthough the 416 bullet is 100 grains lighter than the 458 Winchester, it starts out with almost 300 fps higher velocity. That combined with better sectional density and a superior aerodynamic shape gives it certain ballistic advantages. It not only has a higher initial velocity, but it also increases its retained velocity over the 458 as the range increases. According to the factory figures, it has an 11 percent advantage in muzzle energy, and this increases to 18 percent at 100 yards and 30 percent at 200 yards. The 416 Remington should be ideal for any dangerous game including Cape buffalo, Elephant, Lion and North American brown bears. It would also do well on moose and elk, although possibly somewhat overpowering for most North American hunting requirements. The 416 Remington has a trajectory very similar to the 375 H&H and is better long-range cartridge than the 458 Winchester for use against soft-skinned game. For the man who has to travel light, the 416 Remington would be a good one-gun cartridge choice for use in Africa.', 1, 0, '203.81.206.203', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

I presume I need to get the registered at the local police station but apart from that is there any other red tape involved?

What is important that you should be a Pakistani national i.e. should have an NIC, than you can have a gun license.\n\nGetting a license through a dealer is advisable as it is easier. But if you have some reliable contact inside the ministry than it can be done directly also. Doing it yourself without an inside contact will be a big hassle as the process is too complicated.\n\nThere are cheater dealers out there but there are reliable dealers also. Whenever you decide to go for your license check the forum, consult senior members & you will be guided to some one who will not cheat you. You see there are big names in gun market of every major city who will not cheat a prospective client as they value their market repo. more. As for the cost, you should ask this question when you finally decide to come, who knows what will be the cost of a license in say 5 or 10 years.\n\nWho told you that MOI licenses does''nt need to be renewed. Every type of license has a specific expiry date and on reaching that date you will have to renew it. What you can do is get them renewed for multiple years, say 3 years or 5 years or whatever period you fancy. This option is available in both MOI & provincial licenses (other than MOI card type license, its renewal is still a big confusion). By the way MOI will cost couple of k''s more than provincial.\n\nAt the moment in 60 k''s you can have different Turkish variants as well as Russian & Chinese. If you increase around 10 to 15 k than you will have Taurus as well as Stoeger option available also. But i would suggest that you should ask that question at the time of your return as who knows where dollar will be in 5 or 10 years & what will be the prices of handguns than.\n\nHave fun', 1, 0, '119.157.206.73', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

There are laws regarding the number of birds one can shoot, but one net (with the tape recorder) can wreak havoc with the local bird population in the immediate area. I think conservationists should focus more on prohibiting such inhumane activity rather than on banning autoloader shotguns and such like policies. After all, how many birds can one take down in a day if you are giving the bird a fair chance to take flying shots.\r\n\r\nAlso, what are your kind opinions on the ETHICAL number of birds hunted? Personally I think one should only shoot enough to cater to the meal of the hunting party and some spare change, and not devastate the entire populace. \r\n\r\nSince we are responsible members, I think we should also undertake efforts to restore the population numbers of the game, else our children will have nothing left at this rate. \r\n\r\nComments/Opinions?', 1, 1, '182.177.196.231', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

(332276, 5797, 302927, 'PakistanFirst', 5092, '', 1357319218, '22LR - Rifle Scope\n \nCustomarily, rifles come from the factory with iron sights. Some makers offer their rifles with no sights for those buyers who do not care to have iron sights but do want to equip them with optical sights.\n \nIron sights offer one key advantage over all other types of rifle sights - wider filed of view. Field of view is the width of the area you see in front of you as you aim the rifle at your target at a given distance. This field of view differs from one person to another. Some shoot with both eyes open but with one eye aiming at the target. A “double-eye” shooter will have a wider view than the same shooter with one eye at the target and the other eye closed.\n \nAn optical sight with magnification (some optical sights offer no magnification) makes the target appear closer as compared to the naked eye. This is a definite advantage to the shooter. Another advantage is that the shooter does not have to align three points in the same plane - the target, front sight and the rear sight. With a scope-equipped rifle, the shooter simply aims the crosshair on the target and shoots. The big handicap of scope is that the magnification takes away the wider field of view that iron sights offer. For a given scope, as you increase the magnification, the filed of view becomes narrower. Most scope manufacturers state the field of view in the number of feet at 100 yards or in the number of meters viewed at 100 meters.\n \nAfter considering the pros and cons of iron an optical sights, you may be in favor of equipping the your rifle with a scope. There are countless makes and models available in the marketplace with differing features. A key consideration is the budget limit. In general as the price goes up, so goes the quality and features of the scope.\n \nBe fully aware that with some scopes as you increase the magnification, you also increase the width of the reticle (crosshair). These scope are called the first focal plane type. A good example in this category is the Bushnell Elite Tactical scope - model ET6245F. With the second focal plane scopes the reticle retains the same thickness regardless of the magnification setting. An example in this category is the Bushnell Elite 6500 - model 654305MD.\n \nMany shooters are attracted to the Mil-Dot style of reticle scopes. Mil-Dot is an angular measurement  - one meter at a distance is 1,000 meters. Not all Mil-Dot scopes are true Mil-Dots. True Mil-Dot scopes have the reticle and the elevation and wind adjustment knobs/turrets calibrated in Mil-Dots. The Bushnell Elite Tactical model ET6245F is a true mil-dot-Mil-Dot scope. Other Mil-Dot scopes offer the reticle calibration in Mil-Dots but the elevation and wind adjustment knobs/turrets are calibrated in MOA - or minute of angle. One example of this type is the Bushnell 6500, model 654305MD. For relative reference, one MOA is about 1.047 inch at 100 yards. One Mil- Dot at 100-yard distance is about 3.6 inches.\n \nA rifle equipped with a scope encourages the shooter to reach out farther than with iron sights. If shooting paper targets, feel free to shoot as far as you like as long you have a safe backdrop. On the other hand if you are hunting with a 22LR, keep in mind what ethics dictate - shoot only at a distance where you are confident to kill the game and not simply injure it. All rifles have limitation and the 22LR is no exception. Keep your hunting distance within reason.', 1, 1, '71.83.91.21', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

The 7mm Nambu pistol is more or less a scaled-down version of the original model Nambu, which was developed about 1904.

The 7mm Nambu cartridge is still largely a collector''s item and the pistols are also scarce.\r\n\r\nBy Western standards, the 7mm Nambu would not be considered an adequate combat or self-defense cartridge.

The 1963 (17th) edition of GUN DIGEST includes an article by Roy D. Strengholt that covers the 7mm Nambu pistol and cartridge in considerable detail. The ammunition can be made by cutting off and reforming 30 M1 Carbine brass.

Its potential as rifle cartridge was recognized almost immediately, and many Model 92 Winchester lever-action rifles and carbines were privately re-barreled and altered to handle 44 Magnum. The first commercial rifle to chamber the round was the Ruger Model 44 semi-auto carbine announced in 1961. Universal created the slide-action Vulcan on an M1 carbine receiver for the 44 Magnum. A few years later, the Marlin Model 336 lever-action was available in 44 Magnum, and in 1967 Remington brought out their Model788 bolt-action in the same caliber. Both of these rifles were discontinued after only a few years due to poor sales records. Winchester briefly offered the Model 94 in 44 Magnum. At the present time, there are only three 44 Magnum rifles available: the Marlin Model 1894S, the Rossi Model 92 SRC, both lever-action repeaters, and the Thompson/Center Contender Carbine. Factory ammunition is loaded to handgun pressure levels, but most companies offer jacketed soft- or hollow-point bullets for use in rifles. When fired from a revolver, the 240-grain 44 Magnum bullet develops a muzzle velocity of 1470 fps (depending on barrel length), but in a rifle it will leave the barrel at around 1800 fps.\r\n\r\nThe 44 Magnum rifle has established a good reputation as deer and black bear cartridge, and many hunters consider it superior to the 30-30 at ranges of 100 yards or less. It is a good brush or timber cartridge, and its popularity is due in part to the short, light, handy carbines that constitute the principal arms that chamber it. A number of daring souls has taken grizzly bear, polar bear, elk, moose, etc. with the 44 Magnum revolver, and anything the revolver is capable of. The rifle will do somewhat better because of increased velocity and energy. Despite this, the 44 Magnum rifle is primarily a short-range deer and black bear cartridge. There is good variety of bullets available for hand-loading, and when loaded with the lighter bullets of around 180 to 200-grains, the 44 Magnum rifle will double as a very effective short-range varmint gun. It is popular for Western coyote or bobcat hunting in which the average range dosen''t exceed 125 to 150 yards. With a scope sight and a good single-shot or bolt-action, the 44 Magnum is capable of excellent accuracy.', 1, 0, '203.81.206.203', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

At present, several American manufacturers list the 375 H&H as standard.\r\n\r\n    Long considered the best all-round African caliber, the 375 H&H is perhaps a bit overpowered for North American big game. However, many Alaskan hunters and guides prefer it for moose and grizzly bear. It isn''t a very flexible cartridge for the American hunter unless he expects to hunt the heaviest species and perhaps spend some time in Africa or Asia. John Taylor, in his very fine AFRICAN RIFLES AND CARTRIDGES, Georgetown, South Carolina, 1948, rates the 375 as the best of the medium bores for African hunting.

However, it has been used successfully for hunting small to medium game and varmints at moderate pistol ranges. If hand-loaded with soft-point or hollow-point hunting  bullets, its performance can be improved a good deal.

However, as is usual in such cases, the rifle and ammunition were not available in sporting goods stores until some months later. the cartridge was designed for the Marlin Model 336 lever-action rifle. Initially, the rifle was manufactured with a 24-inch Micro-Groove barrel, two-thirds magazine and recoil pad. The straight-grip stock has a Monte Carlo cheek-piece. Original ammunition made by Remington and the head is marked "444 Marlin."\nThe 444 Marlin is amazingly similar to the 44 Van Houten Super. The 44 VH was developed by E.B. Van Houten and "Lucky" wade of Phoenix, Arizona. It was made by necking-up 30-4- Krag brass, trimming it to 2 inches and turning down the rim slightly. It was designed for the 336 Marlin or 94 Winchester actions. It predates the Marlin round by at least 3 years. Ballistics of the two rounds are nearly identical.\n\nThe 44 Magnum revolver cartridge achieved a certain popularity as a rifle round. Although it makes a good brush buster, anyone using it discovers quite quickly that it has a rather high trajectory, and its killing power on the heavier game such as elk or moose is not always up to what some writers claim. Consequently, there was need for a somewhat more powerful version. The 444 Marlin will extend both the effective range and killing power inherent in the 44 Magnum. The new round fires the same 240-grain soft-point bullet, but at a reported 2400 fps as compared to 1850 for the average 44 Magnum rifle. The 444 Marlin is substantially more powerful than the old 30-30 or the 35 Remington at short ranges. It develops about the same energy as the 348 Winchester and slightly more than the later 358 Winchester. However, with its larger diameter bullet it should provide better knock-down power. It is a short- to medium-range cartridge and should be effective for any North American big game. It would also be effective on most thin-skinned African game, except dangerous varieties. Its advantage over the above-named cartridges is all at ranges out to about 150 yards. Beyond that, due to better bullet shape and sectional density, they all catch up to and finally surpass the 444 in retained velocity and energy.', 1, 0, '203.81.206.203', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

It was also a popular cartridge for sporting use and many repeating and single shot rifles ere chambered for it-- the Remington rolling block, Remington Keene, Remington-Lee, Marlin Model 81, Winchester Model 86 and Hotchkiss, plus many others. Rifles of this caliber were discontinued in 1930s, but are currently available again. Though the Krag officially replaced the 45-70 in 1892, all volunteer Spanish-American war regiments-- with the reported sole exception being TR''s Rough Riders-- were equipped with the Trapdoor 45-70. Many state militias were armed with the 45-70 Springfield''s well beyond 1900. the Minnesota National Guard is reported to have reported to have disposed of almost 1000 45-70 rifles in or about 1940. American companies dropped the 45-70 a s a rifle caliber in the early 1930''s. However, it has major comeback in popularity, and currently Marlin, Ruger and Browning chamber rifles for the 45-70. Indeed, there are also handguns in 45-70 these days.\r\n\r\n"Old soldiers never die" and apparently neither do old military cartridges. the 45-70 has been with us for over 100 years and is still very much alive. as a short-range woods or brush cartridge for anything from deer to grizzly bear, the 45-70 will still hold its own with most of our more modern developments. Its greatest fault is in the matter of a rather curved trajectory that makes it difficult to place shots beyond about 150 yards with any certainty. Unfortunately, the U.S. Springfield and most of the other Black-powder rifles won''t stand pressures over 25,000 psi or so, and this prevents the use of heavy loads of smokeless powder. In late Model 86 Winchester or other smokeless powder rifles, the 45-70 can be loaded to deliver very impressive knock-down on our heaviest species of big game.', 1, 0, '203.81.206.203', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

The Remington 700 Safari is available in 458 and so are many other American- and European-made rifles such as the A-Square , Dakota76, BRNO and the Ruger 77. The 458 has become a world standard and many factories and individual makers provide hunting arms for it. Ruger also chambers the 548 in their No. 1 single shot rifle.\r\n\r\nWith the increasing number of American sportsmen making the trek to Africa, and with the Weatherby Magnum line of cartridges selling rather well, Winchester decided to get into the act. The result is the fine 458, a load perfectly suitable for any of the most dangerous game in the world. This cartridge has been tested rather thoroughly in Africa and has proven itself adequate for the toughest game found there. It is actually as powerful as most of the over-sized English big-bore elephant cartridges. Although overpowered for North American big game, it has nonetheless found favor with many hunters as a woods and brush cartridge when re-loaded with lighter than standard factory charges. With the 300- 350- or 405-grain bullets, it can be loaded to duplicate the 45-70 at any level, and to cover a wide range of game and hunting conditions. As factory loaded, it is not much good for anything but the biggest and toughest, but then that is what it was intended for.', 1, 0, '203.81.206.203', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

These pistols have been sold in military surplus stores and some dealers also had ammunition.\r\n\r\nThe 1900 and slightly-modified 1901 and 1905 Mannlicher pistols operate on the delayed blow-back system.  The magazine is in the handle or grip and holds eight (1905, 10) rounds. However, they are loaded from the top by means of a special charger, after retracting the slide.

I basically when purchasing a weapon look down the barrel to see if there are any rust pits and to see if there are any lands or grooves chipped or worn away to a point where the bore looks smooth and thats it.  Scratches UNLESS very deep (called gouges) do not matter to me.  Buldges in the barrel though very uncommon because the gun will not really cycle is another thing.  If you can remove the barrel, remove it and check the link area for dents, dings, breaks or cracks or chips - same applies to the locking top lugs.  Nothing else, if the barrel is rusty on the inside and no visible pits I may fire the weapon to get rid of the rust.  There really is no formula in MY book for this; just proper observation and guesstimation.  \nDos and Don''ts...  lolz, another subject which does vary in care of the Taurus over the other old colt style 1911s.  The Taurus 1911s have some disadvantages to them by my standards.

Originally a black-powder cartridge, it has been loaded with smokeless powder exclusively since about 1940. In the U.S., Colt, Harrington & Richardson, Hopkins & Allen, Iver Johnson, Smith & Wesson and others have made various light revolvers for this cartridge. In England, Webley & Scott made revolvers for it and in Europe the Bayard and Pickert revolvers, plus many odd brands, chambered it.\r\n\r\nThe 32 S&W probably ranks along with the 32 ACP in general popularity, and for the same reason. It is rather low powered and adaptable to small, light, cheap, pocket-type handguns. Ballistically it is not quite as good as the 32 ACP, but it is about equally effective because of the lead bullet used. It is very similar to the 32 Short Colt, but the two are not interchangeable due to a difference in bullet and case diameter. Like the 32 ACP, the 32 S&W is about the minimum caliber for serious self defense and is considered inadequate for police work. It is used occasionally for hunting birds and small game at very short ranges, but is too under-powered for consideration as a sporting cartridge.', 1, 0, '203.81.206.203', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

As it was said to be sold i guess for 250k :O... nop man, this is for 150k max. \n\nThe specs are as:\n\nCaliber\n12 Gauge, 3” / 76mm chamber\n\nType\nManually operated, pump action\n\nOverall length\n720 mm\n\nBarrel length\n470 mm\n\nWeight, empty\n2.8 kg\n\nMagazine capacity\n7 + 7 (70mm shells) or 6 + 6 (76mm Magnum shells)\n\nthe gun is now internationally recognized as the designer is from USA, it is much appreciated in US aswell, and 15 12guage shells is massive firepower for home or self defence. I support polymer and carbon firearms from glocks to Czs... this beast is also in fiber and polymer and very high grade material is used to reduce the weight and the balanced gun. \n\nthe best feature i love about this gun is pump action, it smooth and very light, semi auto in my experience jam at some stage or an other esp with local shaheen rounds. it has a built in laser system. one push button. and yes there is leaver on top of the gun, which gives three modes, you can change to which magazine you want to use. e.g u can put 7 buckshots in right and in left you can put 7 slugs. you have the option to choose manually or bring that leaver in center and now the gun with throw mix shells, means combination of buckshots and slugs.... massive POWER!! \n\nthe iron sights are pretty good, but it also have rail for mounting tactical scopes. Also comes with extended barrel which is pretty good for hunting bores and stuff....Also comes with a very nice bag.  and most of all its different in look which is a pretty good change. I found its external hardware and frame solid and balanced. \n\nWhat i dont like about the gun?\n-its still expensive as its a Turkish gun. \n-the designs shows its some AA12 kinda shit, but one gets disappointed when you come to know this is even not semi auto. \n-Mag capacity cant be increased as in Saiga 12 (drum mag)\n- there is no place designed for tactical light. Only laser is built in and scope of any sort could be mounted. \n\nSince its a shotgun there is no put giving a range report lol. and using hotspot watch this review on youtube:(Shows shooting of this gun aswel)\n[URL]http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_o3YsUVAyQ[/URL]', 1, 1, '204.93.60.12', 0, 1, 10, 0, 10666, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

In 1964, it was officially adopted by the U.S. Army as the 5.56mm Ball cartridge Ma93. It is used in the selective-fire M16 rifle, which is based on the original AR-15 design. The cartridge was actually the work of Robert Hutton, who was technical editor of GUNS & AMMO magazine and had a rifle range i n Topanga Canyon, California. One of the requirements for the cartridge was that the projectile have a retained velocity in excess of the speed of sound (about 1080 fps at sea level) at 500 yards, something you couldn''t get with the 222 Remington. Working with Gene Stoner of Armalite, Bob Hutton developed a case slightly longer than the 222 and also had Sierra make a 55-grain boat-tail bullet. This combination met the design requirements. All this was documented in the 1971 issue of the GUNS & AMMO ANNUAL. However, this author was not aware of this and has stated in previous editions that he didn''t believe that this information had ever been published. Originally an alternate military cartridge, the 223 (5.56mm) is now the official U.S. and NATO round, but we should note here that NATO forces, including the U.S., have standardizes a new 5.56mm round with a heavy bullet and the M193 is no longer standard.\r\nShortly after the military adopted the cartridge, Remington brought out the sporting version, which has largely replaced the 222 Remington Magnum in popularity. Practically every manufacturer of bolt-action rifles has at least one model chambered for the 223. In addition, there are a large number of military-type semi-auto rifles available in this caliber and at one time the Remington Model 760 slide-action was available in 223.\r\n\r\nThe 223 is nearly identical to the 222 Remington Magnum, the only difference being that the 223 has a slightly shorter case. The two are not inter-changeable, although the 223 will chamber in a 222 Magnum rifle. The result, though, is to create a gross head space problem, and the 223 case will rupture if fired in the 222 Magnum chamber. The 223 has proven to be an effective military cartridge for fighting in jungle or forested areas and for close-in fire support, and has been improved lately by NATO with heavier bullets fired through fast-twist (1 in 7-inch) barrels. As a sporting round, it is just as accurate as any of the other long-range, center-fire 22s. Military brass cases are usually heavier than commercial cases and maximum loads should be reduced by at least 10 percent and approached cautiously, because the reduced case capacity results in a higher loading density and increased pressure with the same powder charge. The 223 Remington can be classed as an excellent medium-range varmint cartridge at ranges out to around 250 yards.\r\n\r\nEDITORIAL NOTE: In 1979, SAAMI cautioned shooters that 5.56mm military chambers and throats differ from 223 sporting rifle chambers, and therefore military ball ammo may produce high chamber pressures in sporting rifles. At least one manufacturer, Ruger, harumphed that its 223 chambers would handle military 5.56mm with no problems.', 1, 0, '203.81.206.203', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

We really don’t get this kind of deals every day, its your jackpot.\n\nSo, today I went for target shooting with my TT instead of dumping it with the adjustment of a pin behind the trigger.  The problem of stuck trigger is resolved 100%.  Now comes with the 2[SUP]nd[/SUP] and 3[SUP]rd[/SUP] problem of double feed in chamber and stuck round in chamber.  This I also resolved by changing the spring behind the ejector.  I have put a hard spring so this also resolved the problem. The weak spring failed to hold the round so that was causing the problem.\n \nDuring target shooting I again faced a huge problem, during firing 4[SUP]th[/SUP] round I felt something on my face, I didn’t bothered but when I fired 5[SUP]th[/SUP] round I feel that thing again but with more force.  When firing 6[SUP]th[/SUP] round I noticed huge back fire of the primer from the behind the firing pin where hammer strikes.  When closely inspected I found that the firing pin is too long so I have to shorten the firing pin by half millimeter and this also resolve the issue. And after that I fired 6 more rounds and I am satisfied now that every thing is ok.  Still have to test more round.\n \nConcerning to the shaheen round I didn’t feel any doubts when fired 25 rounds.

This need comes about as there is no rifle or cartridge on earth that delivers the bullet with no drop. At a gun range we usually know the distance to the paper target. If not, we ask the rangemaster for this information. In the filed we also need to know the distance to the game. We acquire this information by using a device such as rangefinder, a range-finding riflescope or use some method of estimation.\n \nSome people have riflescopes with reticles (crosshairs) that aid in estimating distance A few have rangefinders that calculate the distance. Even if you do not have a riflescope or range-finding device, no doubt your rifle has a front sight of some sort. Your front sight can also be used to estimate distance. You can determine what the width of the front sight represents on the target at a given distance. For the sake of simplicity, let us say that distance is 50 yards.\n \nOn a white sheet of paper draw a bold straight horizontal line about 6-10 inches in length. Place vertical marks one inch apart on that line. Now place this paper at a distance of 50 yards from the shooting position. From this spot you aim the rifle at that paper. The width of the front sight will cover a certain number of inches on that paper line. Count these inches. This becomes your reference. Let us say that the width of front sight in this case cover six inches. Later you go out in the filed to hunt rabbits. You aim the rifle at a rabbit. You discover that the width of the front sight cover one half the width of the rabbit that is twelve inches in length. From the information you have gained, you know that the rabbit is at a distance of about 50 yards away. If the front sight cover the body of the rabbit more or less, you can make distance-to-target adjustments accordingly.', 1, 1, '71.83.91.21', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

As it was said to be sold i guess for 250k :O... nop man, this is for 150k max. \n\nThe specs are as:\n\nCaliber\n12 Gauge, 3” / 76mm chamber\n\nType\nManually operated, pump action\n\nOverall length\n720 mm\n\nBarrel length\n470 mm\n\nWeight, empty\n2.8 kg\n\nMagazine capacity\n7 + 7 (70mm shells) or 6 + 6 (76mm Magnum shells)\n\nthe gun is now internationally recognized as the designer is from USA, it is much appreciated in US aswell, and 15 12guage shells is massive firepower for home or self defence. I support polymer and carbon firearms from glocks to Czs... this beast is also in fiber and polymer and very high grade material is used to reduce the weight and the balanced gun. \n\nthe best feature i love about this gun is pump action, it smooth and very light, semi auto in my experience jam at some stage or an other esp with local shaheen rounds. it has a built in laser system. one push button. and yes there is leaver on top of the gun, which gives three modes, you can change to which magazine you want to use. e.g u can put 7 buckshots in right and in left you can put 7 slugs. you have the option to choose manually or bring that leaver in center and now the gun with throw mix shells, means combination of buckshots and slugs.... massive POWER!! \n\nthe iron sights are pretty good, but it also have rail for mounting tactical scopes. Also comes with extended barrel which is pretty good for hunting bores and stuff....Also comes with a very nice bag.  and most of all its different in look which is a pretty good change. I found its external hardware and frame solid and balanced. \n\nWhat i dont like about the gun?\n-its still expensive as its a Turkish gun. \n-the designs shows its some AA12 kinda shit, but one gets disappointed when you come to know this is even not semi auto. \n-Mag capacity cant be increased as in Saiga 12 (drum mag)\n- there is no place designed for tactical light. Only laser is built in and scope of any sort could be mounted. \n\nSince its a shotgun there is no put giving a range report lol. and using hotspot watch this review on youtube:(Shows shooting of this gun aswel)\n[URL]http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_o3YsUVAyQ[/URL][/quote]', 1, 0, '182.185.191.214', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

Its not gona come below. that atleast 1 lac cause then the importer would go in loss. and i think 1 lac is decent price for this. \n\nits bit different from other Turkish made stuff, here is a bit of history from world guns:\n The story of the UTS-15 shotgun began in around 2006, when famous American company Smith & Wesson decided to expand its line of shotguns with some new and preferably unorthodox tactical weapon. At that time Smith & Wesson did not manufactured shotguns in house; instead they used OEM process, stamping their name on shotguns made for them in Turkey by a well established manufacturer UTAS Makina, which also made quality shotguns for other famous US brands like Savage-Stevens and Kimber. After some considerations it was decided to start with highly unorthodox design of the South African Neostead shotgun and try to improve it. Following this decision, UTAS obtained patent rights and samples of the Neostead shotgun from its designers. After initial evaluation it was decided to redesign weapon completely, retaining its basic bullpup configuration and dual over-the-barrel magazines but create everything else from the ground up. All development work was carried out at the UTAS facility in Turkey, under the leadership of the noted American small arms expert Ted Hatfield. In around 2008 Smith &Wesson withdrew from this project due to its internal problems, and UTAS continued development of its new weapon under its own name. This shotgun, designated as UTS-15 (which stands for Urban Tactical Shotgun 15-rounds), was first displayed to the public at IDEX 2011, and at the moment of this writing (summer of 2011) it is entering production at two factories belonging to UTAS - one in Turkey (to supply guns to Europe, Asia and Africa) and another in USA (to supply to American markets). It must be noted that UTAS company has plans to expand its product line and to introduce semi-automatic version of their shotgun, followed by some more weapons like rifles and grenade launchers, all based on the same patented platform.\n\n Now i dont get the clone part ? because the video i posted of Hichock 45, who gives one of the best reviews of guns on youtube, tested the same gun given to him by his Turkish friends to test. Please watch that video.  I mean is this weapon copied? :O but from where there aint anyother source. \n\nRegards.', 1, 1, '198.144.116.110', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

I wanted to relish the feel of it myself for sometime and get the hand of the weapon before I started posting reviews on it.\n\nHave taken it through its paces. The gun has seen about 500 - 600 rounds through it, no malfunctions. I clean it after every outing. I am not putting my candy through any stress tests. The Serial number starts from "B" and I would recommend everyone not to buy anything below "BXXXXX". No issues with polymer, magazine drops free. The mag spring is a little too tight but 16 bullets is virtually impossible to fit in the mag. It takes only 15 uptil now, maybe after the springs get lighter.\n\nCoin sized groups at 7 and 10 yards. And decent groups at 15 and 25 yards. The shooting is instinctive, specially at 25 yards when you can barely make out the target beyond your front sight. The shot lands surprising closer than you expected it to. Its like the gun wants to be accurate and you really have to work hard to miss. Its very easy to locate your mistakes, I was shooting low left (no surprises here - amateur shooter) I fixed the problem by isolating the trigger finger and avoided jerking the grip at every shot. And hey presto, accuracy to rival the Navy SEALS :lol:\n\nThe best part is the recoil, next to nil. There was a definite muzzle flip, but not enough to throw you off and just \nperfect so that you barely notice! After sometime, it really gets harder to notice and you catch yourself asking did the gun actually recoil this time or no. Its not magic, the gun has a very low bore axis and a natural grip, the recoil feeds into your palms and you actually feel like managing it.\n\nBought mine from Guns and Accessories for 95K on the first week of December. Bought another one from Abbas (HM Traders) at 97K not three days ago because G&A in their wisdom, decided that the rates of duty changed overnight to 110k and they arent selling for below that at all. I think Abbas has got a couple more and probably might be willing to sell for cheaper because me and my friend dont exactly make for hard bargainers.\n\nOh yeah and thats a custom made holster from Muhammadi Saddlers.', 1, 0, '119.160.11.142', 0, 1, 7, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

So had to choose something lighter, coz unlike your good, leisure-time hunting self, I personally won''t be using the stuff any much myself.\n\n[I]Technically[/I] speaking, your post with a perfect bench rest was a great idea. I somehow regret having put off the heavier options.\n\nAnd[I] technically [/I]speaking, you also proved that these [I]neeli tankies[/I] indeed are TUFF by nature! \n\nInshallah, Junior will soon get to the[I] 5 shots in a hole happiness [/I]! \n\n\nRegards.[/QUOTE]\n\nThank you so much AK47 brother for the joyful & encouraging input as always.\n\nWhile we are on the subject, I take this opportunity to add a few points to it. A while back, I got a Diana 35 or 36 with T06 trigger (looked similar to me as 350 magnum) for him from Dubai to start with but after a few shots from benchrest it was obvious that the recoil & vibration was taking his mind off the actual thing. He seemed more concerned to balance the gun after the shot and expected flinch. \n\nSo I let that rifle go and let him shoot Diana 54. That saves him from worrying about recoil. With apparently less noise its an inherently accurate platform to train a youngman to learn trigger & breath control and other basics of this discipline and not worry about recoil, blast & weight at this stage. Ideally, I would love to get him a PCP. Insha Allah.\n\nShooting the [I]neeli tanky[/I] got me three results; :smile:\nONE - there are some types that sure are strong. Had it been summer, it would have stopped even more pellets. \nTWO - I was disappointed with the power of Shaheen #6 at just 25 meters. May be I am unconsciously comparing it with .22lr even out to 100 meters!!!\nTHREE - I realized why I was unable to drop crows recently from the same distance as before. I forgot to change chokes after last partridge shoot.\n\nAnd for the 5 shots happiness, dearly loved your spot on reference. Amazing eyes wired to an even wonderful memory. :smile: :smile: :smile:\n\n[QUOTE=Cool Hunter;333099]very nice shooting[/QUOTE]\n\nThank you brother.\n\n[QUOTE=Avais;333121]Very nice shooting by junior Tareen (MashAllah) under the guidance of perfect instructor.[/QUOTE]\n\nThank you Avais bhai.

Your caution and apprehension are justified.\n \nYou want to do financial analysis of the proposed 22LR rifle acquisition versus a rifle of any other caliber. Your total investment in this hobby will be money to acquire the rifle and the cost of the ammunition you expend.\n \nWhat is your budget for the rifle?  What kind of rifle can you buy with this amount of money? What about the budget for ammunition? How many 22LR cartridges can you buy with the ammo budget? How about the other caliber - how many cartridges can you buy for the same amount of money?\n \nLet us say that that at the moment you are not sure if you will want to do any hunting with the rifle. If your interest leans in this direction, do you have any idea what you want to hunt? Being new in the hobby, you want to ask around if the game you are interested in hunting can be ethically shot with a 22LR. Is your hunt going be once-a-year affair or more frequent? Will you hunt locally or will it involve greater distances requiring more out-of-pocket expense?\n \nAfter your &#8220;trials&#8221; you conclude that shooting sport in not for you. Now we come to the bottom line. If you are not happy with this sport, how much will you be able to get back by selling your 22LR or rifle or any other caliber. Ask around.

After initial approval, CHAP in collaboration with Punjab Wildlife & Parks Department started working on Content Development and finally the Printing of this new Shooting Licence Booklet.\r\n\r\nOn December 29, 2010, in a small ceremony held at Punjab Wildlife and Parks Department, CHAP President Mr. Azam Hayat Noon handed over the desired number of new booklets to Director PWLD Mr. Abdul Qadeer Mehal. Director PWLD appreciated the efforts of CHAP and expressed hope that this new booklet shall be a guiding tool for hunters and shall result in improvements in conservation of wildlife in the Province of Punjab.\r\n\r\nAfter the delivery of these booklets, PWLD requested CHAP to provide additional copies for future requirements. CHAP fulfilled this requirement and handed over the second batch of Shooting Licence Booklets to Director General Punjab Wildlife & Parks Dept., Dr. Zafar Nasarullah on March 25, 2011.\r\n\r\nThe new Shooting Licence booklet contains Hunting Rules and Regulations from Punjab Wildlife Act 2007, Code of Conduct, Shotgun Safety Instructions, Lists of wildlife species with local names etc and contact information of PWLD officials in all tehsils of Punjab, in both English and Urdu. This booklet shall not only educate Hunters but shall also give a new outlook to PWLD. These new shooting licence booklets are available in all Licence Issuing Offices of PWLD throughout Punjab.\r\n\r\nIt sure is a marvelous start for what CHAP hopes to be something that brings change in the behavior of us shikaris and indeed game management. The booklet should prove to be a great guide for us all and was the need of the hour with game diminishing fast.\r\n\r\nTo view the scanned pages of different sections of the new PWLD Shooting Licence Booklet, see the below Posts,\r\n\r\nCode of Conduct & Safety\r\nRegulations & Wildlife Act\r\nCitizen Watch Program\r\nList of Wildlife 1st, 2nd, 3rd & 4th Schedules\r\nPWLD Officials Contact Info\r\n\r\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]16895[/ATTACH]\r\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]16896[/ATTACH]\r\n[URL="http://www.chap.org.pk/lic_booklet.php"]Link[/URL]', 1, 1, '182.185.227.243', 0, 1, 2, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

Hollowpoint bullets usually expand and stop in the human body and thus the attacker absorbs much more of the bullet''s kinetic energy than if the bullet had merely zipped through him and left two small holes. Hollowpoint ammunition is also safer for all parties concerned.\n\n[/FONT][/COLOR]\n[LIST]\n[*]You are safer because your attacker is more likely to be incapacitated after one or two shots and thus unable to fire back, stab you, or whatever. The decreased likelihood of your attacker dying from hollowpoint bullets saves you the moral and legal complications and expense you will experience from killing a man.\n[*]\n[*]Innocent bystanders are safer because hollowpoint bullets are less likely to exit the attacker''s body and go on to injure anyone else. The ricochet danger is also much lower than that of ball ammunition, and hollowpoint bullets are less likely to penetrate walls or doors and strike uninvolved third parties. Furthermore, if your foe is incapacitated quickly he won''t be spraying wild bullets around, endangering uninvolved third parties.\n[*]\n[*]Lastly, your attacker is safer because he is far less likely to die from one or two hollowpoint bullets than the five or six round-nose slugs you would have had to fire to put him down. Most gunshot deaths occur from shock and loss of blood and ball rounds tend to make entry and exit wounds, whereas hollowpoints go in and stay put. An attacker shot twice with ball ammo will probably have four holes in him rather than two and is thus in far greater danger of death from blood loss. If you can avoid killing your attacker you should, for both moral and legal reasons.\n[*]\n[/LIST][COLOR=#000000][FONT=Arial]There are some exceptions to the "carry only hollowpoints in a handgun" rule. Some older or cheaper automatic pistols will jam with hollowpoint rounds. With these guns, one must use ball rounds (or "full metal jacket" rounds - the terms are synonymous) and I specify some "reliable with ball only" models by caliber. It is crucial for you to test your pistol to make certain it is reliable with specific loads; don''t rely on my advice. My life will never depend on the reliability of your handgun. Your life may.\n\nRegular Bullet Ball is round-nosed, full metal jacketed ammunition. All military pistol and rifle ammunition uses full metal jacket bullets. Synonyms for ball include FMJ ("full metal jacket"), MC ("metal case") and TMJ ("totally metal jacketed," a term used only by the ammunition maker CCI). Ball rounds do not expand and are always the worst choice in a defensive round. The military uses ball because it feeds well (i.e. rarely jams) and penetrates well, but mostly because the military is required to use ball ammo by the Geneva Convention. Fortunately, you are free to choose better ammunition and should use ball for practice only.\n\n\n"Wadcutter" (WC) and "semi-wadcutter" (SWC) are lead, sharp-shouldered revolver bullets with an odd cylindrical or truncated cone appearance. True wadcutters are very low power rounds used for target shooting. Like all lead, bullets, they leave lead in the barrel''s grooves after use. Unless you own a .38 or .357 revolver, forget about these.\n"Jacketed soft-points" (JSP) are jacketed bullets with exposed lead at the tip. These make poor defensive rounds for handguns, but may be effective for rifles, due to the latter''s high velocity. Never use JSP rounds in a handgun for self-defense, unless your only alternative is hard ball.\n\n\n"Jacketed hollowpoints" (JHP) are usually the best choice for handguns and most rifles. JHP rounds have a hollow cavity in the nose and usually expand (and stop) in the body of your attacker, transferring all their kinetic energy for maximum stopping power. They are the safest and best bullets available.\n\n\n"Round-nose lead" (RNL) are generally revolver bullets without any metal jacket around the bullet. These are worthless for self-defense, and I don''t even use them at the range. If you come upon a bargain lot of RNL ammo, feel free to buy it for target practice. You will be scrubbing out your barel until the wee hours, however, as lead bullets scum up barrels something fierce. Use Flitz metal polish to scour out the grimy residue.\n\n[B].22 LR[/B]\nYou should really be using something bigger than a .22 for self-defense, but even a .22 beats nothing. There are some really nice .22 pocket autos and NAA mini-revolvers, and they make sense for women reluctant to tote a bigger gun around. Choose any Federal, Remington, Winchester or CCI copper-plated 37 grain (or lighter) high velocity hollowpoint round. I recommend CCI "Stinger" 32 grain or Remington "Yellow Jacket" 33 grain hollowpoints, as they have been very reliable in my Beretta 21A and Walther TPH pistols and have the highest stopping power ratings.\n\n\nShoot a lot of rounds through your self-defense .22, the ammo is cheap and you want to be sure to pick a reliable round. If high-velocity solids don''t cycle reliably, try standard-velocity. There is little difference in power but it may improve your gun''s reliability (e.g. Jennings J-22 pistols are more reliable with standard-velocity solids). Marksmanship is crucial with such a tiny gun, so practice drawing your .22 and firing it rapidly into a melon at ten feet or so. Also, keep your .22 autoloader meticulously clean; these tiny guns cannot function reliably with gunk in them. If you carry your .22 in a pocket, purse or ankle holster, inspect it daily and brush off any dust or grit with an old toothbrush. Lubricate it properly. This is very important. \n\n\n[B].22 WMR[/B]\nMuch better than the .22 LR and perhaps better than most calibers smaller than .35. 40 grain JHP loads are the traditional choice, with Winchester''s 40 grain JHP load scoring highest in 4" and longer barrels. The recently introduced Speer 40 grain GDHP-SB load was tailored for use in mini revolvers with 2" and shorter barrels.\n\n\n[B].25 ACP (6.35mm)[/B]\nThe best .25 load is the Hornady 35 grain XTP-HP round. If it jams, use any Federal, Remington, or Winchester 50 grain ball round. Winchester has an odd 45 grain "Expanding Point" round that should be okay, if it is reliable in your gun (it seems to work fine in Beretta 950 pistols, for example), but don''t expect any improvement in performance over the 50 grain ball rounds. The excellent Walther TPH .25 should be loaded with ball.\nThe Hornady 35 grain JHP should be used only if it is 100% reliable in your pistol. Fire 200 rounds through your gun to verify. Ed Sanow recommends the MagSafe 22 grain "Defender" and Glaser 40 grain Safety Slugs.\n\n\n[B].32 ACP (7.65 mm Browning, 7.65x17mm)[/B]\nUse the Winchester 60 grain Silvertip Jacketed Hollow Point (X32ASHP),provided it is reliable in your gun. Most of the common .32 autos on the market are only reliable with 71 grain ball: Llama, Walther PP and PPK, Czech CZ-24 and CZ-70, Davis P-32, Mauser HSc, etc.\n\n\n[B].32 Smith & Wesson Long[/B]\nThe best defense load for this obsolescent revolver caliber is the Federal 98 grain lead wadcutter (32LA). Shoot carefully.\n\n\n[B].32 H&R Magnum[/B]\nFederal 85 grain Jacketed Hollow Point (C32HRB).\n\n\n[B].327 Magnum[/B]\nFederal Premium 85 grain Hydra-Shok Jacketed Hollow Point.\n\n\n[B]7.62x25mm (a.k.a. 7.63mm Mauser)[/B]\nIf you''re using this obsolescent communist caliber I can only assume that you have an old CZ-52 or Chinese Tokarev. Only 87 grain ball ammo is available, so leave the cheap Chinese military stuff for practice and carry Fiocchi 7.63 Mauser ball in your gun.\n\n\n[B].380 ACP (9mm Short, 9x17mm, 9mm Kurz)[/B]\nNow we''re getting into some decent stopping power. The three or four best .380 JHP rounds have better stopping power than ANY bullet fired out of 2" barrel .38 Special snub-nose. All of the Big Five make good hollowpoints for this caliber. The Remington 88 grain JHP is the most reliably-feeding hollowpoint, but slightly less effective than the Hydra-shok or Cor-Bon. Reliability is crucial, and thus you must test the rounds before carrying.\n\n\n[/FONT][/COLOR]', 1, 1, '182.177.186.165', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

Although my knowledge about fishing in Pakistan is not elaborate, but i have tried and tested that the river shrimp (Jheenga) preferably fresh Shrimps and a small bait fish called Chilwa in Pakistan would out fish the common earth worm or even Lob-worm on any given day. As for the Carp fishing (Rohu) i have seen anglers trying many methods in Pakistan and this time when i visit pakistan i will add boilie fishing to that list,  plus i will bring some ground bait from here (England). \nIn sha Allah i will keep you brothers posted and informed about my triumphs and failures lol. \n\nFor Brother Shahid khan, take my advice bro, more than a rod and reel advice, you need a person to show you what to do with them, i spent a fortune on fishing gear and it was of no use untill i started reading and learning from the experts. just to give you an idea bro i have fishing gear for all and any kind of fishing lol (Apart from Fly fishing) and As-Taghfar-Ullah i am not bragging or trying to impress anyone just telling you that it was stupid to buy 17 rods and around 12 reels and fishing gear that has cost me nothing less than £10,000, and i use less than half the rods and reels.\nAll this said, for Mahaseer you need a Barbel Rod preferably 3 lbs to 4 lbs and a fixed spool reel that could hold around 400 yards of  10 to 12 lbs line, if you go for mono (nylon) it would hold less and if you go for braid it would hold more because braid has thinner diameter. For rohu and other species found in our freshwaters any 11 to 14 foot ledgering rod will suffice with a fixed spool reel that can accommodate 200 yards of 6 lbs line (unless you are loaded and want to buy carp rods they start from around £100 and go to thousands).  in my opinion the best fun is float fishing and you will need a float fishing rod and a fixed spool reel for that, that will be the best budget start for you around £ 50 to £100 for everything you need. i can not tell you how i wish to be there and show you what and how to do it lol.\nNow i seriously hope no one asks about Sea fishing, cause that''s my passion and i will bore all of you to near death (if i haven''t already done it). \nAll the best and tight lines\n\nRiz', 1, 1, '86.28.141.170', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

The "flyers" can be due to weight variation of the bullet or the amount of powder in the cartridge or both. The design of the 22 rimfire cartridge does not allow us to reload whereby we can control the variation in the bullet weight or the amount of power in the brass case. \n\nI have done lots of centerfire reloading. I was able to control the weight of the bullet and the power to within 0.1 grain (0.065 gram). For 308 Winchester cartridge and bullet weight of 150 grains, the recommended Winchester #748 powder is 48.5 grains. Let us see how a variation of 0.1 grain in bullet weight and in powder weight (in these example an increase of 0.1 grain) converts to percentage variation for this cartridge.\n \nBaseline bullet weight:150 grains\nNew bullet weight: 150.1 grains\nBullet weight difference: 0.1 grain\nPercentage difference 0.1/150X100 = 0.067%\n \nBaseline powder: 48.5 grains\nNew powder weight: 48.6 grains\nPowder weight difference: 0.1 grain\nPercentage difference: 0.206%\n \nNow let us do the same exercise with a 22LR cartridge. Federal Champion 22LR cartridge (#510) has bullet weight of 40 grains. The reported powder weight of this cartridge is 1.3 grains.\n \nBaseline bullet weight: 40 grains\nNew bullet weight: 40.1 grains\nBullet weight variation: 0.1 grain\nPercentage difference: 0.1/40X100 = 0.25%\n \nBaseline powder weight: 1.3 grains\nNew Powder weight: 1.4 grains\nPower Weight Difference: 0.1 grain\nPercentage difference: 7.692%\n \nNow let us compare percentage variation of the 308 and 22LR cartridges\n308 Bullet weight variation = 0.067%\n22LR Bullet weight variation: 0.25%\nA 0.1 grain bullet variation in a 22LR cartridge is 3.731 times greater  (0.25/0.067=3.731) than the same weight variation (0.1 grain) in 308 cartridge.\n \nLet us now compare percentage variation of powder.\n308 Power weight variation = 0.206%\n22LR powder weight variation = 7.692%\n \nA 0.1 grain power variation in a 22LR cartridge is 37.34 times greater (7.692/0.206=37.34) than the same weight variation in a 308 cartridge.\n \nPerhaps now we can comprehend how even a slight (0.1 grain/0.065 gram) variation of bullet, powder or both from one cartridge to another cartridge can have a very large impact on the resulting velocity thus the variation on the impact point - our not friendly “flyer”.\n \nWe can not control the variation of bullet weight, or the amount of power (or both) in a 22LR cartridge. But, we can weight 22LR cartridges and sort them in an attempt to cut chances of “flyers”. I hope that I have shed some light on this subject. Small digital scales (the kind jewelers use) are readily available at a nominal cost. I have done the exercise of weighing about 2,000 22LR cartridges.\n \nIt was reported few years ago that CCI was producing over two million 2LR cartridges in a day. Only very high-speed machines can accomplish this task. It would be no surprise to have a 0.1 grain in powder weight from one cartridge to another cartridge from the same production batch.  \n \nI hope this writing is of some help. \n \n#7 22LR - Sorting Ammo by Weight\n#13 Same 22LR Ammo - You Got Fantastic Results & I Got Crummy Results\n#15 You & Your Friend Have Two Different Rifles\n#16 Muzzle of Your 22LR Rifle May Have Answer to Your Question of Accuracy\n#19 Which 22LR Ammo is The Best\n#27 You Discovered Best 22LR Ammo - Really?\n#42 Naked Look\n#225 22LR - Rifle Suffer From Accuracy Sickness?\n#226 22LR - Cheap Ammo Beat Expensive Brands\n#233 22LR - Minimizing Flyer Shots\n#249 22LR - Cost Nothing but Could Improve Accuracy\n#274 22LR - Ammunition Variability\n#294 22LR - Accuracy Really Elusive?\n#314 22LR - Improve Accuracy\n#362 22LR - Repeatability\n#448  22LR - Exchanging Gifts & 22LR Ammo', 1, 1, '71.83.91.21', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

If you are going to be punching paper targets at a fixed distance with the same ammunition, you simply zero the rifle at that distance and shoot all day long. In reality, for most of us, life is not that simple or clear-cut.\n \nOur interest may take us hunting in the field where distances to target vary. Even in these situations we have to zero the rifle at a fixed distance. Knowing the ballistics of the ammunition being used can be very useful guide in our quest for the hunt. Online trajectory calculators are readily accessible to determine flight path of the bullets.\n \nTo use these tools we need some essential information about the rifle, the ammunition and the intended zero-set distance. We need to know the height of rifle sight above the bore. For the ammunition, we need to know the bullet weight, muzzle velocity and the ballistic coefficient (BC). Ballistic coefficient is numerical measure of the profile of bullet indicating the aerodynamic design property of the bullet. The ammunition information is readily available from the manufacturers’ web sites.\n \nLet us say that we are going use a rifle that is equipped with a telescopic sight that is mounted 1.5-inch above the bore of the rifle. We will consider the Winchester 37-grain hollow point cartridge (X22LRH) with muzzle velocity of 1,280 feet per second and ballistic coefficient of 0.128. Our zero-set distance will be 50 yards. We want to know the flight path of the bullet to a distance of 100 yards. The ballistic calculator gives us the following results:\n \nWith zero-set distance of 50 yards, the bullet will be no higher than ¼ inch and no lower that ¼ inch from a distance of 19.5 yards to 57.2 yards. Past the aim point, the bullet will fall as follows.\n 60 Yards - 0.38” drop\n 70 Yards - 1.01” drop\n 80 Yards - 1.88” drop\n 90 Yards - 2.99” drop\n 100 Yards - 3.47” drop\n \nSince the riflescope is 1.5 inch above the bore, the bullet will be below our ¼ inch limit and will behave as given below.\nMuzzle - 1.5” below line of sight\n10.0 Yards - 1.0” below line of sight\n15.0 Yards - 0.5” below line of sight\n19.5 Yards - 0.25” below line of light \n \nThe above example demonstrates how other ammunition types and other zero-set distances can be evaluated. Once we learn of the bullet drop past zero-set distance, we are better prepared to compensate our aim point for those distances.', 1, 1, '71.83.91.21', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

Treatment is purely supportive therapy and prevention of complications. Prognosis of people who are infected purely depends on the severity of the infection. The [B][U][I]ONLY[/I][/U][/B] cure is prevention. And prevention is by vaccination. \n\nThe Polio Vaccine comes in two forms: injection and oral. In Pakistan, the oral form is used. The oral form of the vaccine contains attenuated polio virus in it (attenuated means that the virus is still alive within the vaccine but its harmful effects have been negated)....once administered, the person''s immune system reacts against the virus to form specific antibodies. These antibodies are what fight the infection and virus in the future if the person ever comes in contact again. Because the immune system had come into contact with the virus initially through the vaccination, there will be antibodies present within the body. So if further down the road, that person ever comes in contact with the virus again, the immune system will be able to fight off and kill the virus. \n\nIn order for a person to fight off an infection, they need to have specific antibodies against the certain infectious agent (bacteria or virus). Previous Exposure to the infectious agent is necessary for there to be antibodies present in the body (Initial exposure leads to antibody production). These antibodies identify part of the infectious agent that is known as the antigen (all bacteria and virus have a specific antigen, therefore a specific antibody is needed to identify it). Once identified by the antibody, the immune system kicks into gear to fight off the infection. Suppose for instance, that a person never received the polio vaccine, therefore has never come into contact with it. This would mean that they have no antibodies in their body, resulting in no way for the body to identify the polio virus if it ever comes into contact with it....and if there''s no way to identify the virus, then the virus will infect the person and wreak havoc.\n\nSo wouldn''t everyone rather be on the safe side and have the vaccine (and all other vaccines for that matter) administered? (I myself have been making sure my newborn son is getting all his vaccinations on time)\n\n@Syed: Don''t listen to what you hear about these vaccinations being harmful. MAKE SURE you''re children receive them and receive them according to schedule. I have seen countless numbers of parents bringing in their child with infections (such as polio) that could have been prevented just by simply administering a small vaccination, but due to ignorance and gullibility they ruin their child''s life.

The "flyers" can be due to weight variation of the bullet or the amount of powder in the cartridge or both. The design of the 22 rimfire cartridge does not allow us to reload whereby we can control the variation in the bullet weight or the amount of power in the brass case. \r\n\r\nI have done lots of centerfire reloading. I was able to control the weight of the bullet and the power to within 0.1 grain (0.065 gram). For 308 Winchester cartridge and bullet weight of 150 grains, the recommended Winchester #748 powder is 48.5 grains. Let us see how a variation of 0.1 grain in bullet weight and in powder weight (in these example an increase of 0.1 grain) converts to percentage variation for this cartridge.\r\n \r\nBaseline bullet weight:150 grains\r\nNew bullet weight: 150.1 grains\r\nBullet weight difference: 0.1 grain\r\nPercentage difference 0.1/150X100 = 0.067%\r\n \r\nBaseline powder: 48.5 grains\r\nNew powder weight: 48.6 grains\r\nPowder weight difference: 0.1 grain\r\nPercentage difference: 0.206%\r\n \r\nNow let us do the same exercise with a 22LR cartridge. Federal Champion 22LR cartridge (#510) has bullet weight of 40 grains. The reported powder weight of this cartridge is 1.3 grains.\r\n \r\nBaseline bullet weight: 40 grains\r\nNew bullet weight: 40.1 grains\r\nBullet weight variation: 0.1 grain\r\nPercentage difference: 0.1/40X100 = 0.25%\r\n \r\nBaseline powder weight: 1.3 grains\r\nNew Powder weight: 1.4 grains\r\nPower Weight Difference: 0.1 grain\r\nPercentage difference: 7.692%\r\n \r\nNow let us compare percentage variation of the 308 and 22LR cartridges\r\n308 Bullet weight variation = 0.067%\r\n22LR Bullet weight variation: 0.25%\r\nA 0.1 grain bullet variation in a 22LR cartridge is 3.731 times greater  (0.25/0.067=3.731) than the same weight variation (0.1 grain) in 308 cartridge.\r\n \r\nLet us now compare percentage variation of powder.\r\n308 Power weight variation = 0.206%\r\n22LR powder weight variation = 7.692%\r\n \r\nA 0.1 grain power variation in a 22LR cartridge is 37.34 times greater (7.692/0.206=37.34) than the same weight variation in a 308 cartridge.\r\n \r\nPerhaps now we can comprehend how even a slight (0.1 grain/0.065 gram) variation of bullet, powder or both from one cartridge to another cartridge can have a very large impact on the resulting velocity thus the variation on the impact point - our not friendly &#8220;flyer&#8221;.\r\n \r\nWe can not control the variation of bullet weight, or the amount of power (or both) in a 22LR cartridge. But, we can weight 22LR cartridges and sort them in an attempt to cut chances of &#8220;flyers&#8221;. I hope that I have shed some light on this subject. Small digital scales (the kind jewelers use) are readily available at a nominal cost. I have done the exercise of weighing about 2,000 22LR cartridges.\r\n \r\nIt was reported few years ago that CCI was producing over two million 2LR cartridges in a day. Only very high-speed machines can accomplish this task. It would be no surprise to have a 0.1 grain in powder weight from one cartridge to another cartridge from the same production batch.  \r\n \r\nI hope this writing is of some help. \r\n \r\n#7 22LR - Sorting Ammo by Weight\r\n#13 Same 22LR Ammo - You Got Fantastic Results & I Got Crummy Results\r\n#15 You & Your Friend Have Two Different Rifles\r\n#16 Muzzle of Your 22LR Rifle May Have Answer to Your Question of Accuracy\r\n#19 Which 22LR Ammo is The Best\r\n#27 You Discovered Best 22LR Ammo - Really?\r\n#42 Naked Look\r\n#225 22LR - Rifle Suffer From Accuracy Sickness?\r\n#226 22LR - Cheap Ammo Beat Expensive Brands\r\n#233 22LR - Minimizing Flyer Shots\r\n#249 22LR - Cost Nothing but Could Improve Accuracy\r\n#274 22LR - Ammunition Variability\r\n#294 22LR - Accuracy Really Elusive?\r\n#314 22LR - Improve Accuracy\r\n#362 22LR - Repeatability\r\n#448  22LR - Exchanging Gifts & 22LR Ammo[/QUOTE]\r\n\r\n\r\nPakistanFirst, thank you very much for eloborating in detail about my accuracy problem with 22 LR.

I got enticed to grab hold of 22WMR when I saw a NIB Savage Model 94 with Accu Trigger and traded in with my BRNO. Later on, I could not resist my longing for having a 22LR and asked the dealer to either arrange my BRNO back and get a new one but sadly NIB Model 2 are not available for a quite long time now.

When i ordered my dog UP after opening the boot of the jeep he refused and ran towards the field on my left , i knew he had picked up a smell .

I am going to give out a few pointers which are basic yet most of us do not realize the importance,  training and drills are the key to being fast in a tense situation. The training of individual movements makes you fast and consistent, and the drills will get you familiar with your own ability and confidence. \r\n\r\n(NOTE TO MODS, PLEASE FEEL FREE TO REMOVE THE THREAD IF YOU THINK ITS NOT APPROPRIATE)\r\n\r\n1st Step:\r\n\r\nCHOOSING YOUR BEST MAN: it may be good to be familiar with a wide variety of sidearms, defensive practice should primarily be done with one or two pistols only, his allows your brain to store operational memory about the weapon''s operation, so God forbids, if you are ever in a dire situation, you are not going to be concerned about how many rounds can you fire, what kind of a stopping power the gun has and the most important, how quickly can you chamber the weapon, if you choose your mate well, it will all come to you naturally like dancing, your hand to eye coordination will be maximum. This will also make sure that you would be able to feel when the handgun is empty and it will make it easier to go for a reload ASAP.\r\n\r\n2nd Step:\r\n\r\nEvery one who carries a gun should master the art of reloading (i can see some smiles & some raised eyebrows). i know this will sound really dumb but You should be able to load your gun quickly 100% of the time — without looking at your pistol, your hands, or your magazines. \r\n\r\n3rd Step:\r\n\r\nMake it a habit, in fact this is religious, that you are not to lower your weapon down away from the target, even if the weapon is empty and the slide is locked, you are about to reload by punching another magazine, you simply do not point the weapon in any other direction. psychologically, lowering your gun gives your intended target an advantage over you and keeps you focused on your gun rather than on your target.\r\n\r\n4th Step:\r\n\r\nEmergency Reloads:\r\n\r\nThe technique is, when the slide locks back, you want to grab another magazine likely from a pouch. As you move the fresh magazine toward the gun, eject the empty magazine letting it hit the ground, Place the rear of the magazine against the rear of the magazine well of the gun, align the two, and with some force , place the magazine using the heel of your palm; then depress the slide release. snap caps are really handy for this drill.\r\n\r\nthis was a very basic tutorial for our members, a few tips that will help you better operate:\r\n\r\nBefore you do a drill, with your firearm securely holstered, do 20 or more push ups. Go until you have a bit of a burn and you are getting out of breath. Jump up and do your drill as soon after as possible. You will find that acute aiming is much more difficult, though general flash sight aiming shouldn''t be too much different; this is why it is so important. designed to get your heart rate up and maybe some adrenaline going which will give you a mild tunnel vision affect.\r\n\r\nThe more you practice the better you will get.\r\n\r\nWhile practicing for tactical readiness or for self defense, most practice should be quick draw and flash sighting rather than slower-paced sight-shooting. Distances should be 15 yards or less \r\n\r\n\r\nAND A FINAL WORD FOR ALL THE ENTHUSIASTS:\r\n\r\nA GUN can inflict serious injury or even death. Be sure to always point the pistol in a safe direction and never point it at something you do not intend to shoot, Only use a pistol or other firearm if you are an experienced shooter or have a very experienced shooter directly supervising you.\r\n\r\nCheers!', 1, 1, '203.135.58.118', 6, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

Just saying &#8220;Federal 40-grain&#8221; is of little meaning as Federal makes at least seven different 40-grain 22LR cartridges.\n \nVelocity (V) is given in feet per second at muzzle/50 yards/100 yards\nEnergy (E) is given in foot-pounds at muzzle/50 yards/100 yards\n\n\nCCI:\n21-gr Short Range Green HP V:1650/1128/912; E:127/59/39 (0952)\n32-gr Stinger HP Plated V:1640/1292/1066; E:191/118/81 (0050)\n32-gr Segmented HP Plated V:1640/1292/1066; E:191/118/81 (0064)\n36-gr Mini-Mag HP Plated V:1260/1104/1003;E:127/97/80 (0031)\n40-gr Velocitor Plated HP V:1435/1230/1084; E:183/134/117 (0047)\n40-gr Mini-Mag HV Plated RN V:1235/1092/998; E:135/106/88 (0030)\n40-gr SGB Lead FN V:1235/1088/992; E: 135/105/87 (0058)\n40-gr AR Tactical Plated RN V:1200/1056/964; E:128/99/82 (0953)\n40-gr Select Lead RN V:1200/1056/964; E:128/99/82 (0045)\n40-gr Standard Velocity Lead RN V:1070/977/908; E:102/85/73 (0032)\n40-gr Green Tag Lead RN V:1070/977/908; E:102/85/73 (0033)\n40-gr Pistol Match Lead RN V:1070/977/908; E:102/85/73 (0051)\n40-gr Subsonic Lead HP V:1050/963/897; E:98/82/72 0056)\n40-gr Segmented HP Plated V:1050/ 963/897; E:92/82/71 (0074)\n40-gr Quiet 22 Lead RN 710/674/640; E:45/40/36 (0960)\n\nFEDERAL:\n31-gr Game Shock HP Plated V:1430/1197/1046; E:141/99/75 (724)\n36-gr Champion Target HP Plated V:1260/1104/1003; E:127/97/80 (745)\n38-gr Game Shock HP Plated V:1260/1110/940; E:134/104/86 ((712)\n38-gr American Eagle HP Plated V:1260/1110/1010; E:134/104/86 (AE22)\n40-gr Game Shock RN Plated V:1240/1103/1011; E:137/108/91 (710)\n40-gr Champion Target RN V:1240/1103/1011; E:137/108/91 (510)\n40-gr American Eagle RN V:1240/1103/1011; E:137/108/91 (AE5022)\n40-gr Gold Medal RN V:1200/1075/991; E:128/103/87 (719)\n40-gr Champion Target RN V:1200/1075/991; E:128/103/87 (AM22)\n40-gr Gold Medal RN V:1080/994/930; E:104/88/77 (711B)\n40-gr Gold Medal RN V:1080/961/880; E:104/82/69 (922A/UM22)\n\nREMINGTON:\n32-gr Game Loads V:1280/1117/1010; E:131/100/82 (21232)\n33-gr Yellow Jacket HP Plated V:1500/1247/1075; E:165/114/85 (21074/21280)\n33-gr Cbee HP V:740/687/638; E:40/35/30 (21009)\n36-gr Viper Truncated Cone Plated V:1410/1198/1056; E:159/115/89 (21080/21288)\n36-gr Golden Bullet Plated V:1280/1117/1010; E:131/100/82 (21008/21278)\n38-gr Cyclone V:1280/1117/1010; E:131/100/82 (21222/21235)\n38-gr Subsonic V:1050/965/901; E:93/79/69(21140/21141)\n40-gr Golden Bullet Plated V:1255/1113/1017; E:140/110/92 (21006/21276)\n40-gr Thunderbolt V:1255/1113/1017; E:140/110/92 (21238/21241)\n \nWINCHESTER:\n26-gr Super Tin RN HP V:1650/1253/1023; E:157/91/60 (X22LRHLF)\n29-gr Super-X Lead RN V:770/723/680; E:38/34/30(X22LRCBMA)\n32-gr Supreme Xpediter HP Plated V:1640/1265/1038; E:191/114/77 (S22LRUHV)\n36-gr 333 Rounds HP Plated V:1280/1059/938; E:131/90/70 (22LR333HP)\n36-gr Xpert Lead HP V:1280/1059/938; E:131/90/70 (XPERT22)\n37-gr Super-X Lead HP V:1280/1120/1038; E:103//85 (X22LRH)\n40-gr Super-X Lead RN Plated V:1300/1144/1037; E:150/116/95 (X22LRSS1)\n40-gr Super X Power RN HP V:1280/1109/1000; E:145/109/89 (X22LRPP)\n40-gr Super-X RN Plated 1255/ 1110/1017; 140/110/91 (X22LR)\n40-gr Wild Cat 22 Lead RN V:1255/1112/1016; E:140/110/92 (WW22LR)\n40-gr Dynapoint RN Plated V:1150/1047/976; E:117/97/85 (WD22LRB)\n40-gr Super-X Lead RN V:1150/1047/975; E:117/97/84 (XT22LR)\n40-gr Super-X Lead HP V:1065/983/922; E:101/86/76 (X22LRSUBA)\n \nFN   = Flat Nose\nHP   = Hollow Point\nHV  = High Velocity\nRN   = Round Nose\n(&#8230;)  = Manufacturer&#8217;s Part Number/Order Number/Reference Number', 1, 1, '71.83.91.21', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

(334831, 10706, 0, 'shahjee', 1900, 'Remington R1 .45 calibre Handsome Beast', 1358272489, 'Some days, it is as if I’ve awakened in a sci-fi movie, one where I’m in an alternate reality. I mean, Remington making a 1911A1? And just to compound that head-spinning situation, Big Green now offers a Commander-size carry gun, loaded with what used to be options. But as a production pistol?\r\n\r\nThe Commander-size format is a combination of a shorter slide and barrel with a regular-size frame, in this case, steel—not aluminum alloy. The combination gives us the easier carry size of the slightly smaller pistol with the recoil-dampening effects of steel. That is, mass. As with all compromises, it depends on how much weight you assign to each of the variables. Yes, a lighter pistol is easier to carry, but more difficult to shoot. A smaller one is easier to carry and conceal, but as you make any pistol smaller, you also make it more difficult to shoot. This steel Commander-size is a good one for ease of carry without being too onerous to shoot. As for the weight, well, a good holster and proper belt go a long way to supporting an all-steel pistol. I know; I’ve packed many through the years.\r\n\r\nThe Sum of Its Parts\r\nThe R1 Carry slide is blued steel, with Novak-like sights front and back. The front is a night sight, with a tritium, insert, courtesy of Trijicon. The rear is a plain steel sight, no dots, lines or inserts—which is the way I like sights, although my test sample had a set of drift-rod marks from where it was assembled. (Check the records, Remington; whoever put the sights on 73A needs to be handed a brass drift pin.)\r\n\r\nThe cocking serrations are thankfully present only at the rear and are six round-bottomed grooves. The rest of the slide? Standard internal extractor properly clocked, proper GI-style recoil spring and guide rod, normal and well-fitted stainless bushing, and match barrel with loaded-chamber inspection slot. If you reload, you’ll be happy to know that the ejection port has been lowered and scalloped at the rear, so your empty brass will have an easier—and less dinged—path to the ground. These are all things we used to pay extra for that now, in the 21st century, expect out of the box. Here, we get them out of the box.\r\n\r\nThe safety is large enough to be useful, but not so large as to be obtrusive. It is ambidextrous and clicks up and down as thumb safeties should. The right-side lever is smaller than the left—a good thing—but were I to hang on to this R1 Carry I’d have to make it a bit smaller still due to the position of my hand in the firing grip. It may not bother you at all—my grip is an odd one—but it’s easy enough to fix.\r\n\r\nThe high-rise grip safety is fit with a bit of play and some gaps—OK on a production gun but cause for complaint on a custom gun. The grip safety is also set a bit “hard” in that it has to be crushed to the halfway point or a bit beyond before the trigger clears it. I prefer my grip safeties a bit more sensitive than that.\r\n\r\nThe speed bump on the grip safety, the mainspring housing and the frontstrap are all checkered, 30 lines to the inch. It is nicely done machine checkering, and the frontstrap has clearance grooves top and bottom to clean up the machine cuts and provide your hand a bit more access to the checkering for a secure grip. If you’re thinking of the R1 Carry as a base gun for some extra custom work, the paneling that sets off the frontstrap checkering at the top will serve you well, allowing your custom 1911 guy (or gal) to lift the frontstrap where it joins the triggerguard.\r\n\r\nThe magazine catch is standard size, height and grooved, and the grips are wood, half-checkered on the diagonal and held on with torx-head screws.\r\n\r\nThe slide and frame have been dehorned, but in an industrial process and not a hand-done dehorning. You know how you clean your brass before reloading? Well, think of a bin the size of a hot tub with ceramic lozenges in it and a bunch of slides or frames added into the mix. They vibrate around, and the ceramics rub the slides or frames, wearing the edges slightly rounded enough to be nonabrasive.\r\n\r\nThis is a fast process, and one in use in just about every firearms manufacturer in the country (and overseas as well), but it doesn’t round just the edges you want rounded. It rounds all the corners that the ceramic chips and lozenges can reach. The signs of this show at the slot for the mainspring housing. I realize it is difficult to see, and even I have to admit it is a minor cosmetic detail. And given the competitive price of the R1 Carry, it’s a detail that is easy to overlook. The magazine well, just ahead of it, is beveled for fast reloads.\r\n\r\nThe trigger is the customary aluminum unit, with an overtravel screw and three lightening holes. They connect, via the sear, to a Commander-style hammer. The trigger pull is very clean and in the four-pound region. In dry-firing it, I could hear the disconnector “ting” as I took the slack up, but most of the time couldn’t feel it. The rest of the trigger pull was uneventful. Once the slack was gone, nothing moved until the hammer fell.\r\n\r\nAfter I had dry-fired it some, then spent a couple of days at the range with it, the “ting” diminished greatly and is now quiet enough that it takes some hard listening to hear it.\r\n\r\nRead more: [url]http://www.gunsandammo.com/reviews/remington-r1-carry-review/#ixzz2I4GU6ndE[/url]\r\n\r\nBear Down on Those Sights\r\nThe slide and barrel are three-quarters of an inch shorter than a Government-size 1911, which leads to an interesting phenomenon. All-steel Commander-size pistols seem easier to shoot quickly and accurately, while leaving you not doing quite as well as you might think. This is not a fault of the pistol, but rather the combination of the slightly shorter sight radius and the mass. At speed, your eye and brain see the sights as being more solid than they’d be on a full-size gun. That is, the sight alignment looks better than it is. The felt recoil, dampened by mass, gives you the impression that you are, indeed, shooting a full-size pistol. But when you look at your targets, there are the occasional fliers.\r\n\r\nWelcome to the in-between world of all-steel mid-size pistols. The solution is simple: Pay attention to your sights, and build a proper follow-through in your shooting practice. The shorter sight radius is an unavoidable result of the easier-to-carry slide and barrel length. If you want an easier-to-shoot pistol, get a full-size R1. But as long as you remember this is not a full-size gun and that it will suitably punish your groups for your inattentiveness, you’ll do fine.\r\n\r\nThe shorter barrel takes a bit of steam out of the velocities that could otherwise be generated, but we all know that the .45 ACP does its work more through bullet mass and frontal diameter than by speed. With a 230-grain bullet, 25 to 50 fps one way or the other isn’t going to matter much. So unless you’re pinning your hopes and aspirations on the efforts of 165-grain bullets screaming along at 1,250 fps, don’t worry about what velocity the R1 Carry generates. (I did check the speeds for those who just have to know).\r\n\r\nOn Paper\r\nWhen it came to accuracy, this particular pistol rewarded earnest efforts in proper technique. In other words, it is a tackdriver. The trigger helps, but the barrel and its fit to the slide and frame are the important part of the equation, and there the Remington builders delivered.\r\n\r\nI tested the R1 Carry with a selection of defensive ammunition, but if I fed it the old IPSC standby—a lead 200-grain semi-wadcutter—my bet is that this particular pistol would shoot like a bullseye gun. This one isn’t dead-on for me, hitting a bit low and left, but once I figured out where it was hitting in relation to the sights, it was easy enough to print a photo-worthy group. Reliability? There were no failures. To be honest, it’s been quite some time since we really had to worry about a factory pistol being reliable, but it never hurts to check.\r\n\r\nBeing an all-steel 35 ounces, the R1 Carry’s recoil was not a big deal, but with the hotter loads you knew you’d touched off a serious round. The grips are just a tad too round for my tastes, but a lot of shooters like a slightly plumper set of grips than I do. I can’t really complain, as the front sight came up in recoil and then dropped right back down into the slot of the rear sight.\r\n\r\nThe thumb safety on this one is a bit too easy to push off and on, but that is another easy fix, albeit not quite as easy as putting on a different set of grips.\r\n\r\nThe R1 Carry comes in a lockable Remington-green case, complete with the owners manual, lock, fired case and—hallelujah—a pair of eight-round magazines. Not everyone expects a pistol to come with a complete set of carry magazines (in the case of the 1911, three magazines), but it gets tiresome to open a firearms box and find one lonely magazine staring up at you.\r\n\r\nI really want to like this pistol, I do. It is easy to carry due to size, but has heft enough to dampen felt recoil. The trigger is nice, and the accuracy on this particular one is more than you’d expect in a carry gun. If you have a concern about holsters, here’s a tip: If a company makes any holsters at all—and they aren’t making them for Cowboy Action shooting—it makes one for a 1911. Your real problem here is too many choices.\r\n\r\nAnd then my eye rests on the grip safety and its fit to the frame. On an otherwise fine pistol, and one that delivers the goods as this one does, it is like a birthmark on a supermodel. And not in an interesting place. Once I saw it, I couldn’t get it out of my mind. There are a lot of 1911 makers in the world, and it has been a long time since 1911 buyers would look at this and shrug with a “What can you do?” attitude. But the accuracy keeps drawing me back to the R1 Carry…\r\n\r\nRead more: [url]http://www.gunsandammo.com/reviews/remington-r1-carry-review/#ixzz2I4GYUDiw[/url]', 1, 0, '182.189.9.8', 6, 1, 8, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),
