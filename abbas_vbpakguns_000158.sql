I have a budget of around Rs. 130-150k and need some advice (with arguments) from you guys on what to get.\n\nI am buying these guns primarily for SD/HD so reliability is a must and aggressive/intimidating looks are a plus. If I do settle for the first choice there is the added advantage that I can take the GSG to Lahore range for some target shooting. I might want to use these for skeet shooting or light hunting in the future but its not a major factor for making the choice.\n\nHere are the options/combinations I have come up with so far based on the threads in this forum.\n\n1) Viper 12 gauge & GSG-5\n2) Viper 12 gauge & FabArm SDASS  \n3) Franchi SPAS12 (and leave the second license unused for now)[/QUOTE]\n\nYou can also consider getting a magazine-fed shotgun, such as Akdal MKA 1919.

During that time, the issues licenses would be considered valid. Just recently I heard that I can now approach NADRA for renewal, but MOI pre-approval is required. My concern is that if I approach NADRA for checking the approval status, there may be a risk that they may ask for the arms to be handed into storage till approval. I do not have any real concerns that my book licenses are fake as they were issued in 2008 / 2009 which I believe is much before the concerns of fake licenses.\n\nShall I visit NADRA with photocopies of my licenses to check about the status?

(526698, ' [QUOTE=Deathrow;364559]Tp9 in a very good handgun indeed. However from the description you are giving of your self, when ever you go Gun Shopping, do look consider Viking and Caracal F.... If you are looking for something which is a bit more concealable yet gives a decent performance at range, you might consider a Stoeger Cougar, that gun has a fairly decent grip as well for big handed people...\n\nYou may consider and conduct further research on all of the above mentioned guns...\n\nMy Personal Preference is Caracal F...Why..? Well below is an analysis\n\n[B]Pros:[/B]\nAn extremely crisp trigger without any creep (4 pound constant trigger as compared to a 5.5 pound Glock trigger). Without any bias, IMHO, this gun has the most crisp trigger as compared to all of the above mentioned\n\nLow Bore Axis: which results in extremely low recoil and excellent for follow up shots. Again amongst all the above mentioned, this gun recoils the least\n\nExtremely Accurate and this is not just a personal observation. Almost all those who have shot with a Caracal F agree upon this.\n\nThis point is probably an extension to the point mentioned above. Caracal Fs come with a 4.1 inch barrel which is longer than most of the regular handguns. However Pt92s come with a 5 inch Barrel.... a longer barrel results in more accuracy and range but any weapon with too long a barrel might become problem to conceal\n\nThe gun is Polymer made and weights only 750 grams as compared to its counter Rival Glock 17 which weights 650 grams.. However all of the above mentioned handguns weigh more than Caracal.\n\nCaracal has extremly slim profile (Even slimmer than Glocks) which again makes them comparatively easier to conceal\n\nThe Full size Caracal F is slightly shorter than the Full size Glock 17 and just slightly longer than the Sub Compact Glock 19 which again supports in its Conceal\n\nCaracal F holds 18 Rounds, None of the above mentioned guns including Glocks hold that much fire power\n\nA Torture test was conducted by Armi on Caracal Fs. They shot 5000 rounds within 92 minutes through this gun without any failures. Further our very own Cheif conducted a torture test on this weapon as well. You can check out the Caracal Club or directly Youtube to find links of both.\n\nThis handgun was designed by Wilhelm Bubits who at one time was part of the Glock team and later joined Steyr to develop models M and S with them and Caracal F is his final design\n\nCaracal F holds 3 extremely tough and stringent certifications which only a few handgun manufactures such as Glock or Sig hold. Again you can check out the details of these on their website\n\n\n\n[B]Cons:\n[/B]This gun is not for you if you don''t handle it like a professional. It comes without any Manual Safety. However it does have the 3 Safeties which are Trigger Safety, Drop safety and firing pin safety. But if you pull the trigger on a cocked gun, it''s gona shoot and ain''t nothing gona stop it..\n\nThere has been an optional recall called on Caracal F''s due to doubt in drop safety functionality. You can read details on their website\n\nThis gun comes with 2 sight Options. Quick sight (QS) and Straight 8 or 2 dot sights. The QS are excellent for short range follow up shots but do not have satisfactory results with slightly increased distances so no fun at the range. Straight 8s or 2 Dot sights are excellent sights but they may require some time getting used to[/QUOTE]\n\nThank you for such a wonderful review. I am obliged to you for your honest effort you put in especially for me which also will benefit all. It took me a month to be able give my opinion on two guns :), not because of any lethargy but busy schedule only. Keeping the progress you guys can imagine how long will it take for me to get to know and digest about above :). BTW Before PG I only know TT and I am of the view its the King of all small arms.\n\nAbout to apply for a license and meanwhile , I am thinking to get started with the research on above guns + my own chosen one as well. \n\nI surely will post my queries here if I have or my opinion for soft critics once I am done.', ''),

(526845, ' [QUOTE=SZBR;363821]Firstly, hats off to the owner, moderators and members of this forum for developing such an amazing online community. When I began my search for a 9mm handgun a month ago the only handguns I knew about were Glocks, Taurus, Walther, Beretta and S&W. Through this community I was introduced to Stoeger, Canikk, Zastava, Sarsilmaz, Baikal, Caracal and most importantly CZs. \n\nAfter much contemplation I ended up buying a CZ 75 SP-01 Shadow and again through this awesome community I found out that there was in fact a problem with the first piece that I got - promptly had it replaced as suggested by some kind members. Also got a good rate on the gun and licence issuance/conversion compared to what I would have paid as an uninformed buyer.\n\nFollowing the PG tradition, I would like to share pictures of the beginning of my new-found fascination with firearms. Please forgive the poor quality of pictures as I am new at this.\n\nThe Shadow\n\nI''ve bought this gun primarily for HD and also for range shooting, which I have not had the chance to do yet due to the turbulent situation in Karachi and mostly due to lack of free mornings.\n\nThe Walther\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]21221[/ATTACH]\n\nThis gun was a gift from someone who had bought it in 1990s; do not know the exact manufacturing year but it has < 100 rounds through it. I plan to make this my EDC once I have fired around 2-300 rounds through it and gotten comfortable with handling a firearm.\n\niA plan on expanding my collection once the means are available, but the first objective is to fire 1000+ rounds at the range to get an idea of what "shooting" entails.\n\nOnce again, thank you all for being an extremely helpful and supportive community.\n\nRegards.[/QUOTE]\n\nCongrats on the Shadow bro.

(628664, ' I have also observed that for all of us who shut one eye while aiming, wing shooting is a bit difficult. though one masters it with experience. As closing one eye means you have blocked almost 40% of your field of view. Like for example I use my right eye to aim while my left eye is shut. Now a bird that is coming from the right will remain visible while i pull ahead for the lead. Whereas a bird coming from the left often goes out of the vision when i pull for the lead. situation even worsens when you need to take more than one shots in the same go. as you need to open the left eye to see the birds and then close again to aim and pull ahead. so IMO one must practice to shoot with both eyes open as most of the best shooters do.', ''),

So basically you would be buying a gun for 100K and instead of adding night sights to it afterwards for another 15K approximately, you''ll be getting them installed already... And that''ll save him from the hassle of searching for the night sights, buying them and then getting them installed through a gunsmith who would also charge some bucks...!!!', ''),

The Glock has it''s own place, the Caracal will always have it''s own, and my actual issue was that the replacement delay was holding 1 license of mine blocked for use when the opportunity of availing the Glock was knocking my door. Probably, with a license more in hands, I wouldn''t have required to dispose it off. (Btw, just found out that I now have a license vacant of the 3 new ones, one being a blank DN!!!

I got one from the US on pyramidair for 81$, around 7500PKR that time, over an year ago.... back then the brand wasn''t available in Pakistan I believe. \nTo date no flaw or defect encountered, used it on a pair of Diana 350s and a BSA pcp. Shooting birds at 100+yds with it is no issue, I do it as much as I want, thanks to the MILDOT scope and SIMMONS RANGEFINDER duo.\nThis is the very reason for me not purchasing ANY scope after this TRUE VALUE FOR MONEY purchase, I feel no need to have another one.

(527330, ' Brother..  Lets do some calculations and sketch out a good weapon out in your options. \nYour revised budget is 150k for shotgun and upto 300k for a rifle. Total = upto 450k and if I am not wrong you can pull it upto 500k.\n\n\nIf you want a good Shotgun and a Good rifle. I would recommend get a combo of 250k each and you will never regret. From hearsay I know that Remington model 700 is around 250k. You should search the market if its available at that range and if yes, you will love it I am sure. :)  Get one in a caliber you like the most,..  if you like target shooting more then hunting then get yourself a .308 for cheap ammo.  But if you want something highly reliable for your very lovely trophies, I love the 7mm Remington Magnum the most and it is this caliber which made the Remington model 700 one of the most popular rifle in the world. But you can go to other options, I think Remmy 700 comes in various calibers including .30-06 , 270, 243 and maybe 308. [b] For shotgun[/b] Get a good beretta Semi Auto. I can suggest Urika 391 or similar as experts can guide you here. It will serve you efficiently in hunting, and make you feel good on on occasional breaking clays !    Also at 250k.     1 option explained with a total cost of around 500k and a lifetime guarantee of happiness with these two :) \n\nSecondly, for rifle Winchester Model 70 also is around 200k, search the market for the updated prices. Combination with the beretta Shotgun. But lemme tell you a semi auto shotgun serve you best in hunting and club sports, but is not a good option for HD often.\n\nThirdly, the CZ rifles are at boom these days. CZ550 comes in various calibers as well from .308 to 7mm Rem Magnum too. But I think the price is on high end. Around 400-500k. I also heard a friend got his at 350k but the prices always fluctuate.  You should plan a market visit preferably at Lahore. Yes you can match up a high end CZ550 rifle with a low price but equally reliable Russian made Baikal Mp153 semi auto shotgun. \n\nHope that I have not confused you more  !', ''),

(527334, ' ok. here i am. an old pakgun member, who made a mistake of just reading than writing, i have used and owned .22lr rifles, and 12 gauge one too. I think i am good at aiming, firing, using, cleaning, and maintaining. But to my believe. I was shocked with the performance of my .22lr types. I read all the comments and posts of this thread. I wondered why anyone didnt try the hollow point of .22lr at a hunting or a sd level? i am a proud user of .22lr hollow point bullets. A guy once jumped into my house, my dog teared him up and then ran away. Thnx to my dog, he"s rottwieler. ( now i live in a farm house in lahore near raiwind road).  I just got up, brushed my teeth, watched out of the window, which i have a habbit of watching and found, 4 guys sitting on the shade of a tree. I was alarmed. I just kept watching them, cos of tinted windows, somehow they couldnt watchme back and i was. However, this kept on carrying on and i kept on watching on their moves, a guy with another bike handed over something to them, wierd situation with a wierd gesture of visitors, i send my gaurd loaded, and asked him to enquire the issue, the guys just said they are just out of petrol and waiting for their friend to refuel them. I was was curious to know. I was all ready to intercept these crooks when something caught my mind. A women with a push chair was walking around on another street near by with a kid on the push chair when the stray dogs started barking at her, i got alarmed and immediately moved my aim, the stray dogs were were mad or i dont know wht, they were determined to attack her, immediately i went down, i ran down to her, ignoring what is happened at my end the basturds were still there, but i ran out and shot the 4 dogs at 15 meter distance max. they were dead as stone. within seconds, those guys who were sitting for something infront of my home, kicked their bikes and ran away. Thats a real life story i experienced.', ''),

(527372, 'cruelty  pays back I went to nearby district nearly 200 kilometers away yesterday. On the  return , I stopped by a improvised set up just besides the road,  where  local cold  drink of &#8220;Thadhal&#8221; was sold . . As I stopped by and was waiting for  my drink to be served , a lame man came to greet me , but I didn&#8217;t  recognized him .\nDon&#8217;t you recognize me , sir , he said \nsorry , i cant . i replied\nSir I am &#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;. He told his name ,  You arrested met years ago at &#8230;. , I used to trap falcons.\nO yes &#8230; now I remember you  ,  What happened to you , you were not lame  than as I remember , do you trap falcons still  , I said.\nNo sir I don&#8217;t now . My both legs were broken in that work ( trapping  falcons) . so I am not able to do that work now, This is my setup , I  use to sell thadhal in summer and do something else in winter . I have  left that cruel work now , perhaps my legs were broken as punishment to  the cruelties I did to those innocent birds . \nI had a chat with him while finishing my drink , forcibly paid him the  amount as was willing to have that drink free  as a sign of goodwill and  proceeded to my destination. \nWhile on the way , I remembered the entire episode how we met  years ago.\nI was waterfowling  with my buddies that time and after finishing the  early morning shoot, we came out of the hide, gathered the kill of each  gun at one place and were resting under nearby trees enjoying the mugs  of coffee from the flasks that we brought . Suddenly I spotted a falcon  having some bird in its claws in sky . I pointed it to my friends who  saw it too. But soon we observed that the flight of the bird was  irregular/abnormal. The bird was losing height and fell at some distance  from us. Out of curiosity , we ran to bird to see what happened . one  of my friend found the bird and call us to see. It was a terrible scene .  The poor bird was in miserable state. Its tiny eyes were gouged out .   The skin and feathers of some bird were wrapped around a little ball of  nylon net and that ball of net was stitched mercilessly  to the claws  and legs of the bird to give the impression that it is having a prey.  The bird was a local species of eagle that is locally called &#8220; Laggar&#8221;  or &#8220; Chukki&#8221;. As we were talking about as what actually was all that,  some people approached us on a jeep . None of them seemed to be local  except one who was driving the vehicle. They asked about the bird and  claimed it to be theirs . I asked about the miserable condition of the  bird and who done that to such an innocent creature . A guy who appeared  to be the   leader told that they have deliberately done that to the as  they were trapping the falcons to be sold in black market . when we  asked what is the connection of the miserable condition of the bird with  their work of trapping the falcons , he replied that they firstly catch  the  little local falcon called &#8220;Laggar&#8221; and take out its eyes by  poking some pointed thing like screwdriver etc  in its eyes and than  stop bleeding by applying ash to the wound of the bird. Afterwards , the  wrap some piece of skin containing feathers of a teal to the ball  shaped nylon net and stitch it in to the legs and claws of the falcon  and throw it in the air \n. The poor blind bird fly directionless  in the air and when it is  spotted by any Saker Falcon or Peregrine Falcon or any other falcon  which these cruel men want to catch, it attacks the little defenseless  blind bird and tries to snatch the prey from its claw , not knowing that  it is a bait. As that Saker Falcon or Peregrine Falcon tries to  snatch the so called prey , its  claws are badly stuck in that ball like net  and it ultimately drops on  the ground and is caught by those poachers who immediately blind fold it  . They also told me that they sell those Saker Falcon and Peregrine  Falcon for hundred of thousands rupees and if they just trap a single  falcon in entire season , their expanses are met with a handsome profit   .\nAnd what about  the poor birds you use to trap the falcon , I asked \nThe &#8220;Barak &#8221; dies , he replied calmly \nBarak is the term they use for the bait bird \nCutting long story short , on the next day , I summoned the  wildlife/game authorities in my office and conducted a raid on those  poachers. They all were arrested and luckily they haven&#8217;t been  successful in trapping any bird they were looking for. The period of my  posting in that particular area became a nightmare for the poachers and  they shifted their activities in the areas out of my jurisdiction \nToday when I saw that person limping, the legs of that little bird badly stitched with the net appeared in my imaginations.\n\n Than I thought what about the eyes of that innocent bird', ''),

(527720, ' I got mine today...the full-size version. Compared the EZ9 compact and full-frame today; not much of a difference in size and weight to be honest. With the full-size I get 2 extra rounds, a longer barrel, and better ergonomics. Plus, I''m a big guy, 6''1" 220 lbs, so concealing this big gun shouldn''t be a problem.\n\nAt first glance, the gun seems well-made and solid, but was lighter than expected. Personally, I think the fit and finish on it is better than my friend''s black Taurus PT-92, the ergonomics seem better too, but that is subjective. Comes with standard, white, 3-dot sights, 2 magazines, a bore brush, a bunch of papers, and...thats it. The packaging is pretty spartan, but that is to be expected from a Serbian gun :-) The trigger is acceptable - DA is a bit long and heavy (the Taurus had a better DA pull), but the SA seems smooth (better than the Taurus in my opinion, but your mileage may vary). Feels better than the Viking, and should be a better shooter if online reviews are anything to go by. Even though the NP-22 is built like the proverbial tank, it doesn''t really compare to the EZ9...the fit and finish is simply miles apart, and this series of pistols has proven itself to be very durable and reliable as well.\n\nI remember a senior member stating that he preferred the "rail-less" look of the CZ999.

(527746, ' Dear Zainulabdeen, \n\nThat is a very interesting story indeed. Since I am a falconer, i.e a person who hunts with falcons, and have been doing so for the last twenty five years, please allow me to shed some light on your post. My 2 cents as some would say. \n\nWhat you witnessed that day was actually a "barak" in progress. This trapping method has been around for centuries. However, its proper application is not as crude as what you saw. The birds usually used for barak are lugger falcons (lugger)and white eyed buzzards (chukki/kooee/teesa/tee''a).\n\nFalcons, like all other birds of prey and predators are very territorial, especially the bigger falcons such as peregrines and sakers. So they do not take kindly to intruders, and less so one who is flying around with a kill in its talons. \n\nSo what the trappers do (here I am describing what the traditional trappers and not what money blinded ignoramuses do),  is they first catch a lugger or a chukki in a net using a desert rat as bait. Next they "seel" they birds eye using fine needle and thread. As cruel as it may sound, seeling, done right is a painless and harmless procedure. The bird is first immobilised in the silken straight jacket, and its head is held by one man while another lifts up the outer eyelid (birds have an inner and an outer eyelid), and passes a fine needle with a silken thread just below the edge of the eyelid where there are no blood vessels or nerves, the needle is then taken over the bird''s head and the other eyelid is also pierced in the same manner, and then both ends of the the silk thread are drawn up, thus pulling up its eyelids and almost closing them. A bird thus treated can see only in one direction, which is up. \n\n(Apart from trapping, seeling is also used by falconers, and nowadays, even by also by experienced avian vets in cases where birds need to be immobilised for treatment. A bird that cannot see, will sit absolutely calm, and therefore it less stressed, and thus less susceptible to hurting itself by crashing around, and due to immuno-suppression caused by stress. Furthermore, seeling when done right, causes no bleeding, not even a single drop of blood, and to unseel a bird, all one needs to do is to spray some cool water on the bird''s eyes, then cut off the top knot with a scissor and slowly pull the thread out). \n\nSo returning to the topic at hand, once the bird''s eyes are seeled, a decoy locally known as a  "khuddu" is tied to the bird''s legs. This khuddu is usually made of a quail or dove''s skins dried and then stitched in the shape of a pouch, into which then  a ball made of cloth scraps is stuff in. Then nooses made of horse hair are stitched into this cloth ball. \n\nWith the "barak" thus prepared, the trapper hides in a blind not too different from our duck shooting blinds. All the time he scans the sky for a peregrine or saker falcon. The moment he spots one, he very quietly casts out the barak from a window in the blind. Now since the barak bird with its partially seeled eyes can only look up, it flies up.  Here on its entirely a matter of luck. If the falcon (the wild one) is not hungry or if he is just passing through, he will ignore the barak. But if that bird is local in that area, they it will at once swoop down to teach the intruder a lesson. Firstly, the barak has invaded the other''falcon''s territory, and secondly, it has killed in that territory, (thats what the khuddu hanging from its legs signifies), and thirdly, and worst of all, it is advertising, to all and sundry that it has ousted the other falcon from its territory, (as that is what flying around with a kill in its talons signifies). \n\nThis territorial behaviour is the undoing of the saker/peregrine as its first swoops down on the barak lugger to drive it out of the area, and then tries to take its kill (the khuddu) from it. The moment it does that, its talons get ensnared in the nooses, and both birds comes spiralling to the ground. \n\nNow if the trapper is traditional one, he will quickly entangle both the birds and inspect his catch, if it is a good young peregrine or saker he will keep it, if it is an adult bird he wuill release it as these are not preffered for falconry. Then  he will turn his attention to the barak bird. First he will untie the ball from its feet, then he will unseel its eyes, and let it rest in the shade for a while. Then in the late afternoon he will feed the bird and release it, for that is the unwritten rule of trapping. The decoy is always released after being fed a full crop. \n\nHowever, in this era of unbridled capitalism and blind pursuit of monetary wealth, most traditional vlues and ehtos have fallen by the wayside. 90% of the falcon trappers nowadays are just in it for the money. They are not even traditional trappers for the most part. Thus hey have no respect for these birds or any birds for that matter. \n\nThe blame for this sad state of affairs lies squarely on our governments right from Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto in the 1970''s to his illustrious son in law till a few months ago. The worst in this regard, however, were Zia-ul-Haq and Musharraf. The former started the business of allotting entire districts to visiting foreign "dignitaries" and barring local hunters from even setting foot in those areas, to the latter(Musharraf) in whose era, the issuance of falconry licences to Pakistani falconers was arbitrarily and indefinitely suspended. Both these rulers violated the fundamental rights of Pakistani citizens as guaranteed in the Constitution of Pakistan. \n\nThese actions have effectively killed falconry in Pakistan. Now only a handful of falconers remain, all them victims of apartheid in their own homeland.', ''),

Those falcons are trained by using most sophisticated technology and  even they are equipped with tiny feather weight GPS devices to prevent  them from being lost . What an appropriate usage of modern technology[/QUOTE]\n\nFalcons training to this day remains the same as it was 5000 years ago. The nature of the beast has not changed. What has changed  is the use of technology to locate falcons.   In the olden days, falconers used bells to locate their birds when they killed out of sight. Incidentally, the best falconry bells in the world were made a few craftsmen originally from Amritsar, but they had migrated to Lahore after partition. Those men are dead now, and with them their art. (I do have a pair of those bells left with me). \n\nThen in the 1970''s radio technology was adapted for use in falconry. This consists of lightweight transmitter being attached to the falcon''s leg or tail feather, and the falconer using a radio receiver and directional antenna to locate the bird. \n\nThe next development was the development of GPS trackers in the 1990''s. But these are not very popular for falconry, as they are very heavy and transmit data to a satellite which then transmits it back to a base station on earth, which then relays the data to the authorised user. This technology is very cumbersome and expensive to use. \n\nIn the late 1990''s GSM based trackers were also developed, but they are limited to area that have GSM coverage, and most deserts and uninhabitated places do not. So this techonology is also not worthwhile. \n\nThus radio telemetry remains the tracking technology of choice in falconry.  Im sure you have all read in the papers and heard on TV about how every winter the Indian Border Security Force sees "Pakistani Spy Falcons"  near the Rajastan border and shoots them. The ignorant fools don''t  know that these are just hunting falcons very radio transmitters affixed to them. Who needs spy falcons when you can see the registration sticker on a car windshield via Google Earth.', ''),

Actually I liked the Hennie night sights (8), the front sight glows a little brighter than the dot on the rear sight , which is very good to get back on your target quickly after you fire the previous round.. fit & finish is also very good as you expect from a 225K gun.. overall the Dan Wesson Valor a high end 1911 no doubt.', ''),

(527982, ' So I took the Zastava EZ9 out for an impromptu firing session at my farm house. I shot close to 50 rounds of assorted ammunition - S&B FMJ, Chinese red box, S&B JHP. No failures.\n\nIn terms of accuracy, I didn''t have any targets on hand, but had little trouble making plastic soda bottles dance at a distance of 15-17 yards :-p \n\nIn the short period that I''ve had this gun, the following things stand out:\n\n1. Fit and finish is definitely better than what I was expecting and compares favourably with the Taurus PT-92, Baikal Viking etc.\n\n2. The alloy frame makes it lighter than expected, but it doesn''t feel flimsy or "weak" at all.\n\n3. It is a big, chunky piece; not for those of you with smaller hands. I on the other hand find it (and the Sig P226) to be ergonomic Nirvana! :-p\n\n4. Feeds hollow-points reliably, but do remember to clean the gun thoroughly before shooting it the first time.\n\n5. The control lever and mag release are very stiff. Maybe they''ll loosen up over time, hopefully.\n\n6. The sights are readable under most circumstances (except under dim light) and target acquisition is pretty good.\n\n7. The DA trigger is pretty heavy, but SA isn''t bad at all in my opinion. \n\nOverall, at this price, I''d prefer it over the more expensive PT-92, Stoeger Cougar, Baikal Viking, and the Canik55 variants available here.

Some like KAC are obvious junk (personal expereince) and some I know of that have had satisfied customers who have been happily shooting em  for years. \n\nFrom what I know the pak industry is struggling to increase its quality. including manufecturing techniques, metallurgy etc. \n\nI have had Punjab arms co''s factory outlet 9Shangai Arms co)  people at lucky star telling me that i am welcome to try as many rounds as possible before I buy and had famous arms also giving me the same offer while RAc too is willing to do the same.\n\nAnd whats more they are willing to give warranties for their products. \n\nyes, their metulargy remains doubt full as yet.

My first gun was a local TT. Don''t know who made it, or when, but it was given to me by an old family friend who had stashed it in a cupboard for more than 15 years. The gun was not grease-packed or anything, just wrapped up in a plastic bag and literally left to rot. \n\nWhen I got the gun, most of the bluing had worn off and the gun was in dire need of some TLC. I cleaned it up, took it to the farm, and loaded up 8 rounds of Chinese ammo from the 70s, which again wasn''t stored properly at all. Till then, I''ve fired approximately 300 rounds from it, without any failure whatsoever. I even fed it some really hot Prvi hollow points (rated at speeds in excess of 1550 fps, I think). \n\nIf it wasn''t so damn inaccurate, I''d actually be comfortable using it for SD. Any gun that can survive in the dirt for close to two decades and then just spit out 40 year old ammo has earned my respect :-).', ''),

(528218, ' Went for a target practice session after a long time. The gun had been lying idle with not much done with it in the past 3-4 weeks except a few shots here n there. Initially it went haywire and I couldn''t produce decent groups [B]@ 25 yards[/B]. For me decent at that range is sub 1 inch groups (and these were all 1.5-2 inch groups) I though maybe the strong winds were the culprit. I decided to take a break after 15 shots or so, and tried to bring down a pigeon in flight :p there was a flock flying at varying distances above my head so I had several attempts and needless to say despite shooting some 30 odd pellets it was an effort in vain ;) hahaha It simply seemed impossible to take them in flight esp with the scope. \n\nAnyways, got back to the paper and to my satisfaction produced some really good results, the best being 1/2 of an inch :D. I guess the gun needed to be warmed up lol. Sadly lost the paper due to gusty winds otherwise I''d post em here :/.\n\nAnother important thing that I want to bring to everyone''s notice:  one needs to be very  careful when playing with trigger adjustments. I decided to further adjust the trigger which already was quite light and after the adjustments I discovered that the safety wasn''t working. The gun would go off even if the safety was in ''safe'' position. This further reinforced the principle that [B]"Always point your gun in a safe direction"[/B].

(528067, ' Dear Khawer,\nI too am new to this forum (so apologies in advance if I am accidentally stepping on someone''s toes).  :D  OK, jokes aside - From what I know, on page# 16 of the Sindh N.P.B (non-prohibited bore) Firearms Licence, you''ll see this:\n\n"[B]4. (2) Description of Arm including Cali-\n          bre and manufacturer''s serial\n          No. and details of authorised\n          dealer from where the weapon\n          is purchased indicating receipt\n          no. date, and value of weapon\n\n\n\nSignature and seal        \nof Authorised Dealer \n[/B]\n\n[B]Signature and seal\n[/B][B]of Licence Authority[/B]"\n\nNow I don''t know who your dealer is, or why did he tell you that "weapon entry is not very important". Because from what I know, if your weapon is not entered in your license (and the purchase receipt also not attached/stapled onto this page# 16), then it is not legal. So the entry is a must (from a legal point of view). Anyone who is telling you anything otherwise, is no doubt playing some sort of a silly game with you... So my advise is to avoid such a dealer.\n\nAlso note, that on page# 20 and 21 - There is also the ENDORSEMENT section of the license, which too needs to be filled. In this section there is the Registration# of the licensing authority, date, seal and signature of the licensing authority, post office registration #/date, post office (location), signature & seal of postmaster, police station registration #/date, police station (location) - And finally, the signature & seal of the SHO (police station house officer). So all these things need to be filled, in order to make the license 100% legal and valid.\n\nNow I am not a lawyer, so I can''t claim to know everything (which is why I am only going by common sense). So you now PLEASE go see your lawyer, and ask for his or her opinion/advice. This is not really a big issue, so a lawyer will not have any problem answering your question. \n\nBest of luck!  :D', ''),

I would like to suugest to add CCTv camera ( day & night vision ) along your boundry walls and 1 security guard sitting infront of the tv cover that whole day and other 2 guard the Door or other exit/entry points . The Guard siiting ionfron the cam can watch the activities all around and also if any suspicious person coming close to your boundry can put a alert to the Guard.\n\nSecondly the most important is the alert of the intruder. Let it suppose that day you havent seen the intruder then what ?? Nowdays there is a very Cheap system in the market which is know by Home Security system which include Door sensors and Motion sensor . You can lock that system with the help of a remote while going to bed or leaving your house and if any Door sensor or Motion sensor ignites it will Buzz the Alarm and will Call you on your Priority number saved un the data base system. This system is like 15 k - 20 k price range .[/QUOTE]\n\nBrother that security system is already installed.\n\nRegards.\nAllah Bless. Luv Ya All.', ''),
(528190, ' Which area or district of Pakistan is this happening in? From what I know, the Deputy Commissioner''s office is the licensing authority in the majority of cases (here in Sindh). So if there is some issue, then let them give you the reason in writing - What I mean is , please don''t believe in any hearsay... Go to the Deputy Commissioner''s office yourself (in person) and ask about the issue directly. No need to hand them your license, just inquire about what the real issue is.\n\nI had heard that because of the general elections, no firearms licenses were being issued in Sindh. And so Karachi was totally out of the question. But after the elections, all that has now cleared (as far as I know).\n\nWhen I was getting my first license made, I too heard many stories from different people - In the end it was all nothing but *fluff*, deliberately created by all these so-called middlemen who supposedly knew better... In short, it was just another way to extract more money out of me.\n\nIt''s actually the same story when you get your passport made. You''ll find many people standing outside the very same passport office, telling you that if you get it made through them, then you''ll experience no difficulty - But guess what, if all your papers are already in order, then even if the person issuing the passport is your life long enemy, there is little he can do to keep you from getting yours...\n\nSo once again, I am advising you to please consult a good lawyer. I am just a guy you met over here on the internet. While a real lawyer will be able to guide you far better. Therefore do only what a lawyer will suggest. A firearms license is not something as insignificant as a driving license. So be very careful before you blindly trust anyone.', ''),

(528285, 'The Nostalgic Pizza Story (with pictures)! [B][SIZE=5][COLOR=#006400]Here it is people - Aik zilaat aur khoovari ki kahanni...[/COLOR][/SIZE][/B]  ;)\n\n\nIt was sometime in the late 1980s, when I (as a kid) became addicted to Pizzas (along with my Dog)... The only place in Karachi where you could find them, was in Agha''s Supermarket at Clifton. At that time only a few knew what an actual Pizza looked and tasted like. Anyway Agha''s Pizzas were really great, so I (and my Dog) became regular customers!\n\nAnd so this happy relationship continued for a few years, but suddenly in the early 1990s - Agha''s Supermarket stopped keeping those Pizzas. When I inquired to know the reason? They told me that those Pizzas were actually made at home by a parsi lady, (kind of like a hobby which would bring in a little extra cash too). But she (I was told) immigrated to Canada with her family. And so that''s how I lost a great tasting Pizza... :''(\n\nNow I had many sleepless nights, and whenever I could sleep, all I could dream about was that great tasting Pizza! But fortunately by 1992, satellite dish antennas had become very common over here, and so everybody was watching Star TV (and thus familiarizing themselves with western trends). So that''s how Pizza parlors started to open up everywhere like mushrooms!\n\nSo one day I got an ad tossed in my letterbox, of a new Pizza parlor which was very close to my house. It was called Mamamia Pizza, situated next to seaview apartments at the beach (where he half built Silver Sands building stands today). Best of all, they would home deliver it at no extra cost!\n\nNow I tried their product, and although it was not as good as the ones sold at Agha''s Supermarket, it still was a fine Pizza in it''s own right! So I (along with my Dog) became their regular customer! And so for over a year it continued like this - Until one day I ordered a Pizza, and discovered that instead of having a base of tomato paste, he this time became cheap and just put crushed tomatoes instead...\n\nSo I went to their shop and asked why they did such a horrible thing? To which the answer they gave me was: "Our costumers demanded that we now only use fresh tomatoes instead of canned paste". Now I wasn''t born yesterday. Therefore I instantly understood the price difference between picking bruised vegetables from the market at a throw away cost, and that of buying an imported can of real tomato paste... So this is how I stopped being their customer.\n\nNow I tried many more Pizza parlors that were opening up daily. But non of them could ever match the taste of the ones I got from Agha''s Supermarket. Until about a year later I heard of a place called Shakey''s Pizza, situated on the first floor of Crystal Court at Clifton Karachi. So I tried their Pizzas, and they sure did taste great!\n\nBut just as I had become their regular customer, Pizza Hut came to Pakistan (it was 1994 now). So I tried their product too - And by God it was horrible I swear... With the first bite their entire Pizza''s cheese would detach from the Pizza''s base and fall into the plate (creating a mess). And on top of this, it didn''t even taste good to me. So I (and my Dog) both said *laanat ho Pizza Hut pay*, and drove back to Shakey''s Pizza.\n\nHowever by now Shakey''s Pizza was facing very stiff competition from Pizza Hut. Shakey''s product was better, but Pizza Hut was backed by it''s huge marketing campaign. And so that''s how Shakey''s Pizza closed down in a few months time. Which sparked off my personal *dushmanee* with Pizza Hut!  :D\n\nAnyway, in my depression I tried may other local Pizzas to, but again, nothing tasted as good as the ones I use to eat at Agha''s Supermarket, and neither could anyone come close to Shakey''s Pizza... The twilight of my teenaged years was already upon me now (in the mid 1990s), So I one day took a chance, and in anger attempted to make my first Pizza at home!\n\nIt wasn''t too great, but it also wasn''t bad either. Nowhere near as good as the ones of Agha''s Supermarket or Shakey''s - But certainly better than what that idiot at Mamamia Pizza used to sell. And this was just my first attempt! best of all, I also realized that when I made Pizzas at home, they would cost me a quarter of what I used to pay! And so I continued to improve my Pizza, until I arrived at the same level of taste, as the ones of Agha''s and Shakey''s!\n\nAnd so I now dedicate these Pizzas of mine to that unknown Parsi lady who used to make Pizzas for Agha''s Supermarket, my beloved Dog and true partner in crime, and the fine people who used to own and operate Shakey''s Pizza at Clifton!  :D\n\n\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]21438[/ATTACH]\n\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]21439[/ATTACH]\n\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]21440[/ATTACH]\n\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]21441[/ATTACH]\n\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]21442[/ATTACH]\n\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]21443[/ATTACH]\n\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]21444[/ATTACH]\n\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]21445[/ATTACH]', ''),
(528286, ' [QUOTE=Turumti;365769]Dear Zainulabdeen, \n\nThat is a very interesting story indeed. Since I am a falconer, i.e a person who hunts with falcons, and have been doing so for the last twenty five years, please allow me to shed some light on your post. My 2 cents as some would say. \n\nWhat you witnessed that day was actually a "barak" in progress. This trapping method has been around for centuries. However, its proper application is not as crude as what you saw. The birds usually used for barak are lugger falcons (lugger)and white eyed buzzards (chukki/kooee/teesa/tee''a).\n\nFalcons, like all other birds of prey and predators are very territorial, especially the bigger falcons such as peregrines and sakers. So they do not take kindly to intruders, and less so one who is flying around with a kill in its talons. \n\nSo what the trappers do (here I am describing what the traditional trappers and not what money blinded ignoramuses do),  is they first catch a lugger or a chukki in a net using a desert rat as bait.[COLOR=#00ff00] [/COLOR][COLOR=#ff0000][B]Next they "seel" they birds eye using fine needle and thread. As cruel as it may sound, seeling, done right is a painless and harmless procedure.[/B][/COLOR][COLOR=#00ff00][/COLOR] The bird is first immobilised in the silken straight jacket, and its head is held by one man[COLOR=#ff0000][B] while another lifts up the outer eyelid (birds have an inner and an outer eyelid), and passes a fine needle with a silken thread just below the edge of the eyelid where there are no blood vessels or nerves, the needle is then taken over the bird''s head and the other eyelid is also pierced in the same manner, and then both ends of the the silk thread are drawn up, thus pulling up its eyelids and almost closing them.[/B] [/COLOR]A bird thus treated can see only in one direction, which is up. \n\n(Apart from trapping, seeling is also used by falconers, and nowadays, even by also by experienced avian vets in cases where birds need to be immobilised for treatment. A bird that cannot see, will sit absolutely calm, and therefore it less stressed, and thus less susceptible to hurting itself by crashing around, and due to immuno-suppression caused by stress.[B] [COLOR=#ff0000]Furthermore, seeling when done right, causes no bleeding, not even a single drop of blood, and to unseel a bird, all one needs to do is to spray some cool water on the bird''s eyes, then cut off the top knot with a scissor and slowly pull the thread out). [/COLOR][/B][COLOR=#ff0000]\n[/COLOR]\nSo returning to the topic at hand, once the bird''s eyes are seeled, a decoy locally known as a  "khuddu" is tied to the bird''s legs. This khuddu is usually made of a quail or dove''s skins dried and then stitched in the shape of a pouch, into which then  a ball made of cloth scraps is stuff in. Then nooses made of horse hair are stitched into this cloth ball. \n\nWith the "barak" thus prepared, the trapper hides in a blind not too different from our duck shooting blinds. All the time he scans the sky for a peregrine or saker falcon. The moment he spots one, he very quietly casts out the barak from a window in the blind. Now since the barak bird with its partially seeled eyes can only look up, it flies up.  Here on its entirely a matter of luck. If the falcon (the wild one) is not hungry or if he is just passing through, he will ignore the barak. But if that bird is local in that area, they it will at once swoop down to teach the intruder a lesson. Firstly, the barak has invaded the other''falcon''s territory, and secondly, it has killed in that territory, (thats what the khuddu hanging from its legs signifies), and thirdly, and worst of all, it is advertising, to all and sundry that it has ousted the other falcon from its territory, (as that is what flying around with a kill in its talons signifies). \n\nThis territorial behaviour is the undoing of the saker/peregrine as its first swoops down on the barak lugger to drive it out of the area, and then tries to take its kill (the khuddu) from it. The moment it does that, its talons get ensnared in the nooses, and both birds comes spiralling to the ground. \n\nNow if the trapper is traditional one, he will quickly entangle both the birds and inspect his catch, if it is a good young peregrine or saker he will keep it, if it is an adult bird he wuill release it as these are not preffered for falconry. Then  he will turn his attention to the barak bird. First he will untie the ball from its feet, then he will unseel its eyes, and let it rest in the shade for a while. Then in the late afternoon he will feed the bird and release it, for that is the unwritten rule of trapping. The decoy is always released after being fed a full crop. \n\nHowever, in this era of unbridled capitalism and blind pursuit of monetary wealth, most traditional vlues and ehtos have fallen by the wayside. 90% of the falcon trappers nowadays are just in it for the money. They are not even traditional trappers for the most part. Thus hey have no respect for these birds or any birds for that matter. \n\nThe blame for this sad state of affairs lies squarely on our governments right from Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto in the 1970''s to his illustrious son in law till a few months ago. The worst in this regard, however, were Zia-ul-Haq and Musharraf. The former started the business of allotting entire districts to visiting foreign "dignitaries" and barring local hunters from even setting foot in those areas, to the latter(Musharraf) in whose era, the issuance of falconry licences to Pakistani falconers was arbitrarily and indefinitely suspended. Both these rulers violated the fundamental rights of Pakistani citizens as guaranteed in the Constitution of Pakistan. \n\nThese actions have effectively killed falconry in Pakistan. Now only a handful of falconers remain, all them victims of apartheid in their own homeland.[/QUOTE]\n\n\nThats great info turmuti saheb. i have many times saw some doctors/ surgeons who even are qualified , can not perform the dressing/ stitching of a wound and today i have come to know that we have such talented persons around that even perform stitching on the very little eyes of a bird perfectly , painlessly and without causing a single drop of bleeding . Great . REally great .\nA humble suggestion , why dont we or any of us take the pain , in the interest of millions of  eye patients in Pakistan to employ these skilled persons in Health deparment to perform , of course after a little training, the eyes surgery on human patients . it is not good that such talented persons are wasting their skill in poaching. Rather they should be doing opereration /surgeries in govt hospitals becuse in this way , they will get handsomely paid jobs and shall leave the evil practice of poaching too', ''),

So a gun''s "cost" and "worth" are two different things. But what''s really important to form an objective and informed opinion, is to specify parameters of comparison.

Great . REally great .\nA humble suggestion , why dont we or any of us take the pain , in the interest of millions of  eye patients in Pakistan to employ these skilled persons in Health deparment to perform , of course after a little training, the eyes surgery on human patients . it is not good that such talented persons are wasting their skill in poaching. Rather they should be doing opereration /surgeries in govt hospitals becuse in this way , they will get handsomely paid jobs and shall leave the evil practice of poaching too[/QUOTE]\n\nCasanova Sahib, \n\nI quite understand your concern, but the fact of the matter is that human''s eyes and bird''s eye are anatomically different. Bleeding, in any animal or bird only occurs when a blood vessel is punctured or severed, and pain only occurs if a nerve relays the signal to the brain. In the absence of a blood vessel being punctured or severed and a nerve not being activated, their will neither be any bleeding no will there be any pain. \n\nTo try this yourself, first prick your finger nail with a needle. Nothing will happen. No bleeding and no pain, because they are no blood vessels and no nerves. Now if you were to turn your finger and try it? The result would be be both bloody and paunful, because your finger, does have blood vessels and nerves in it.

A guy, like a friend of mine once told me his "love" story (...few years ago...) that how he worked at ship breaking yard to raise some money so he could marry an Afghan girl (living near Afghan camp in karachi).[/QUOTE]\n\nThat is correct, shipbreaking pays off very well - From the very top guy, to the next to useless helper assisting the welders. They all make about 1.5 to twice (and in some cases even 3 times) the amount they would make working elsewhere. But the job also carries a great risk of injury.\n\nWhile I was there, I had the preconceived notion that the workers are not provided any safety gear (and thus are generally mistreated). But reality is that their entire store room is full of every type of safety equipment imaginable. From safety harnesses, to eye and breathing protection, to hard hats, thick leather gloves and aprons - Only the workers themselves chose not to use any of it. As the gear is heavy to wear, and so very hard to work with in the sweltering heat...\n\nAnother misconception that I had, was that the beach will be filthy due to all this shipbreaking - But I found seashells on the beach, meaning that the ocean is alive. The workers also catch their own fish from the sea early in the morning. There really was no stink in the air, and neither was there anything left over from the ships which would be sent to some landfill. Literally everything, and I really do mean EVERYTHING from a ship gets recycled. There really is no wastage at all!\n\nGadani ship breaking yards provide over 30% of steel to Pakistan at a very cheap rate. They all together pay almost five billion in tax annually too. But the advantages don''t stop there - As when you recycle metal (as in re-melt it to make something new), you only use about 15 to 20% of the energy than you would if you were making steel from iron ore (like the steel mill). So the nation''s coal reserves are not depleted, and so the impact on the environment is very small.\n\n[URL]https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRJYgNc_TNc[/URL]', ''),

(529399, 'Airgun Tuning Every air-gunner wants more out of his airgun in terms of power, accuracy and overall performance. This is where the term "tuning" comes in. Getting the right method and items for your airgun is the key of tuning. The general purpose of tuning is anyone or all of the following :\n\n--- Increase power\n--- Smooth response \n--- Improve accuracy\n--- Improve longevity\n\nTuning may or may not include modification .. A simple tune-up would be to degrease a new gun and relube to improve vibrations, loading and the sound of spring (when it fires), etc .. Yet this simple tune-up requires an expert hand and quality lubes and then come the different methods to do it.

I mean take a look at Youtube, its filled with such videos, and not just international but our local PakGunners like raja yasir and naveed''s channels that I have visited and watched/enjoyed their videos.\n\nAlso it was opening ceremony of 2 of my new weapons :P so again that video was worth a compilation.', ''),

(528647, ' [QUOTE=S-H;366507]That is correct, shipbreaking pays off very well - From the very top guy, to the next to useless helper assisting the welders. They all make about 1.5 to twice (and in some cases even 3 times) the amount they would make working elsewhere. But the job also carries a great risk of injury.\n\nWhile I was there, I had the preconceived notion that the workers are not provided any safety gear (and thus are generally mistreated). But reality is that their entire store room is full of every type of safety equipment imaginable. From safety harnesses, to eye and breathing protection, to hard hats, thick leather gloves and aprons - Only the workers themselves chose not to use any of it. As the gear is heavy to wear, and so very hard to work with in the sweltering heat...\n\nAnother misconception that I had, was that the beach will be filthy due to all this shipbreaking - But I found seashells on the beach, meaning that the ocean is alive. The workers also catch their own fish from the sea early in the morning. There really was no stink in the air, and neither was there anything left over from the ships which would be sent to some landfill. Literally everything, and I really do mean EVERYTHING from a ship gets recycled. There really is no wastage at all!\n\nGadani ship breaking yards provide over 30% of steel to Pakistan at a very cheap rate. They all together pay almost five billion in tax annually too. But the advantages don''t stop there - As when you recycle metal (as in re-melt it to make something new), you only use about 15 to 20% of the energy than you would if you were making steel from iron ore (like the steel mill). So the nation''s coal reserves are not depleted, and so the impact on the environment is very small.\n\n[URL]https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRJYgNc_TNc[/URL][/QUOTE]\n\nyeah, all that but too bad for my friend who still couldn''t got married cause by the time he came back... she was already wedded to someone else.', ''),

(528678, ' Salaam everybody,\n\nPlease correct me if wrong!\n\nOutside Pakistan, PX-4 gets compared also with Cougar (Stoeger).\n\nDifference, besides ergonomics & switchable grip piece (PX4); is of polymer (PX4) & Metal (alloy - Cougar).\n\nHaving the same rotary barrel, recoil gets further dampened in Cougar due to density.\n\nSo many websites quote that if one prefers metal over polymer, he/she should choose Cougar over PX4. \n\nThe size of thick butt remains on both Cougar / PX4; which is a problem for people with normal to small hands. Indeed this remains common on all barreta models. Barreta tried to overcome this with a specially slim butt profiled gun call VERTEC. But for some reason did not pursue it:\n\n[URL]http://www.sightm1911.com/lib/review/vertec.htm[/URL] \n\nThe switching of grips (PX4) work a little towards it but does not curtail it effectively.\n\nThe latest product development philosphy of barreta is to make an extremely customizable hand gun (PICO); which is currently in compact or sub compact. But more sizes will be offered once it catches on. \n\n[URL]http://dailycaller.com/2013/05/03/beretta-unveils-newest-pistol-the-pico/[/URL]\n\nThe market in West is currently being driven by compacts / subcompact CCW.

U may try and keep visiting the home sec to know if they have received the favourable reports.. Once they do so. U wlil then be asked to give the fees i.e Rs. 4500 and then u will have to submit your data personally i.e photo wil be taken finger prints and personal data such as how much u earn and where etc etc. \nU will then be issued a token and will then need to visit repeatedly to know when your lic wil be ready.

Expect your dealer to call you with in a week, visit HD for photos and data entry.\n7. Provide all accurate data this time, like address and etc... All corrections should be made here.\n8.

But one advice that I have for everyone whenever videoing/filming or photographing, is to always be mindful of ambient light. Now this is not really a big issue when you are photographing an object indoors (as you can control the light''s direction and amount) - But in nature photography, this all of a sudden becomes a huge challenge (as thus a point of great annoyance if you get it wrong).\n\nNow we can learn all about professional photo editing software like Adobe Photoshop, but who nowadays has got the time to practice using such heavy programs. They also don''t come cheap (unless you steal them from the Internet, downloading as a torrent)...\n \nWhich is why I suggest IrfanView - A small and very quick basic photo editor that is also extremely easy to use. Best of all, it is totally for free (created by a Bosnian fellow in the late 1990s)! And so with this anyone can give their photos a professional looking feel, (by adjusting the light levels, tint, sharpness, and a few other things). All the pictures that I have shared over here so far have been processed through IrfanView. And it took just a few seconds on each picture.\n\nHere is the link:\n[URL]http://www.irfanview.com/[/URL]', ''),

So I just want to make clear what I was trying to say... that is, the [B]hierarchy of brands[/B] and their price ratios are what should remain [B]consistent[/B]. For example, in many parts of Asia, the tax on new vehicles is at least 100% so in the best case, price for a new car will be double that in the west. BUT the pricing [B]differences among the brands[/B] remains the [B]same[/B] as in the west... that is, a Honda is still an economy car no matter where you go, whether it starts at 20, 40, or 60k. Mercedes remains a premium brand that will cost 5 times as much, and a Ferrari is still a luxury that costs 10 times as much. Alternatively, [I]in Italy[/I], a Ferrari is STILL a luxury that costs 10 times as much as a Honda, with Mercedes in the middle... the price [B]ratio does not change[/B] much. The brand structure does not get turned upside down, the Honda doesnt become a luxury just because it is now an import and the Ferrari is a domestic product. No matter where you are, economy products are mass produced to a set cost, and luxury products are assembled with care using the best technology and materials... and their price differences should reflect that. When a product''s status changes, with no material difference (as Glock''s brand status and price position should be in line with Taurus, Caracal, Zigana, even Stoeger, but in Pakistan it has been promoted to luxury status, yet they remain physically the same as other Glocks) that is an interesting situation, that I feel is worthy of further insight.[/FONT][/COLOR]', ''),

(528956, ' Mr. fudge packer(interesting choice of name) let me take a crack at this particular economic problem you are trying to tackle with my rudimentary understanding. \nYou mention a perfect market where there is no scarcity or/and all players have equal information but alas there is no such thing. \nFor example I know for a fact(worked as an assembly engineer in York) that Harley Davidsons are less powerful and reliable then a Japanese bike but are consistently more expensive. In Japan 2 times more so but consistent sellers nonetheless. Price is not always indicative of quality. \nAverage buyer in pakistan(just like rest of the world) does not have all information to make the best educated decision. someone tells them Glocks are best or they see them in movies and they buy. Mac computers are another example where a product of equal specs priced much higher then competition consistently sell for more. Their advertising is just that good.\nSecondly the issue of scarcity plays a large role in determining the price of a product. In a completely free market dee beers would not be able to artificially control the production of diamonds. They do; In turn inject artificial scarcity and elevate prices of carbon molecules not much different then coal.\n Glocks are expensive not because they are 5 times better, but because they are 10 times harder to come by. This is bound to increase their value compared to a place where they are readily available. I can find a personal chauffeur for no more the 150 dollars per month because 20 gentleman in my immediate vicinity are without a job and readily available, unlike New York City where one will cost u no less then 3000 dollars a month\nThe market does not behave logically because all things are not equal. If suddenly all tayota Camrys vanish from the world and you are lucky enough to have one. I can assure you, it will sell for more then a Ferrari.', ''),

BTW CZ P01 will digest every Ammo you throw into it.\n\nPS: During your first range trip (breaking in period), start with FMJ of different variety of Ammo instead of JHP.. after firing arround 50 to 60 FMJ, switch to JHP.\n\nRegards.', ''),

It moves quickly to the shoulder and offers smooth swing. the controls too have a refined feel to them. they click in/out exactly as expected with no play or over travel.\r\n\r\n[URL=http://s998.photobucket.com/user/12gauge-pakguns/media/Mistral%203/Image3_zps2766ccbf.jpg.html][IMG]http://i998.photobucket.com/albums/af103/12gauge-pakguns/Mistral%203/Image3_zps2766ccbf.jpg[/IMG][/URL]\r\n\r\nThe gun comes in a hard cardboard type box with each component housed in its designated space. a nicely printed manual is there as well which explains everything from assembling to field stripping and maintenance. I don''t know if the 5-year warranty supplied with this gun is any useful here but it definitely shows the confidence of the manufacturer in their product.\r\n\r\n[URL=http://s998.photobucket.com/user/12gauge-pakguns/media/Mistral%203/Image2_zpsd7890746.jpg.html][IMG]http://i998.photobucket.com/albums/af103/12gauge-pakguns/Mistral%203/Image2_zpsd7890746.jpg[/IMG][/URL]\r\n\r\nThis particular 4+1 capacity shotgun was supplied a with 28inch internally chrome plated barrel and three choke flush fitting choke tubes (C, M, F). The steel shot compatible barrel as stated by the manufacturer has been ultrasonically tested to ensure that is free from manufacturing flaws. the bluing is absolutely deep blue Italian (Read: Impressive).\r\n\r\n[URL=http://s998.photobucket.com/user/12gauge-pakguns/media/Mistral%203/Image27_zps587d8fb9.jpg.html][IMG]http://i998.photobucket.com/albums/af103/12gauge-pakguns/Mistral%203/Image27_zps587d8fb9.jpg[/IMG][/URL]\r\n\r\n[URL=http://s998.photobucket.com/user/12gauge-pakguns/media/Mistral%203/Image26_zpsc34594d7.jpg.html][IMG]http://i998.photobucket.com/albums/af103/12gauge-pakguns/Mistral%203/Image26_zpsc34594d7.jpg[/IMG][/URL]\r\n\r\nThe aircraft grade aluminum alloy receiver is black anodized and the chrome plated bolt goes rather well it. the rotating bolt''s movement is very slick and quiet pleasing in operation.\r\n\r\n[URL=http://s998.photobucket.com/user/12gauge-pakguns/media/Mistral%203/Image5_zpsc7035304.jpg.html][IMG]http://i998.photobucket.com/albums/af103/12gauge-pakguns/Mistral%203/Image5_zpsc7035304.jpg[/IMG][/URL]\r\n\r\n[URL=http://s998.photobucket.com/user/12gauge-pakguns/media/Mistral%203/Image4_zps2744b68c.jpg.html][IMG]http://i998.photobucket.com/albums/af103/12gauge-pakguns/Mistral%203/Image4_zps2744b68c.jpg[/IMG][/URL]\r\n\r\nthe rotating bolt with single extractor is a fairly traditional setup. infact, the whole gun''s internal mechanism feels quiet traditional to me. I for one, strongly favor simple and traditional (read: tried and tested) mechanisms over the new-age and overly complicated contraptions.\r\n\r\n[URL=http://s998.photobucket.com/user/12gauge-pakguns/media/Mistral%203/Image31_zps5cd8c009.jpg.html][IMG]http://i998.photobucket.com/albums/af103/12gauge-pakguns/Mistral%203/Image31_zps5cd8c009.jpg[/IMG][/URL]\r\n\r\nSimple mechanism means lesser chances of part failure, easier repair-ability and higher chances of finding a gunsmith able to perform a decent repair job.\r\n\r\n[URL=http://s998.photobucket.com/user/12gauge-pakguns/media/Mistral%203/Image8_zpsfa98081f.jpg.html][IMG]http://i998.photobucket.com/albums/af103/12gauge-pakguns/Mistral%203/Image8_zpsfa98081f.jpg[/IMG][/URL]\r\n\r\n[URL=http://s998.photobucket.com/user/12gauge-pakguns/media/Mistral%203/Image7_zpsf9e39fd4.jpg.html][IMG]http://i998.photobucket.com/albums/af103/12gauge-pakguns/Mistral%203/Image7_zpsf9e39fd4.jpg[/IMG][/URL]\r\n\r\nwhat I found different on this shotgun was that the action spring was screwed on (at one end). this feels like an effort to prevent the spring from buckling. an ingenious setup indeed.\r\n\r\n[URL=http://s998.photobucket.com/user/12gauge-pakguns/media/Mistral%203/Image12_zpsed1f5016.jpg.html][IMG]http://i998.photobucket.com/albums/af103/12gauge-pakguns/Mistral%203/Image12_zpsed1f5016.jpg[/IMG][/URL]\r\n\r\n[URL=http://s998.photobucket.com/user/12gauge-pakguns/media/Mistral%203/Image11_zps60f995e3.jpg.html][IMG]http://i998.photobucket.com/albums/af103/12gauge-pakguns/Mistral%203/Image11_zps60f995e3.jpg[/IMG][/URL]\r\n\r\nThe laser checkering is clean and noticeably free of flaws. the pattern is new-age for sure. thats the beauty of laser checkering. designers can play with patterns to their heart''s content. \r\n\r\n[URL=http://s998.photobucket.com/user/12gauge-pakguns/media/Mistral%203/Image29_zpsea66f6e7.jpg.html][IMG]http://i998.photobucket.com/albums/af103/12gauge-pakguns/Mistral%203/Image29_zpsea66f6e7.jpg[/IMG][/URL]\r\n\r\nThe lines are well spaced and promote a strong and slip-free grip as well as enhancing the overall look of the shotgun.\r\n\r\n[URL=http://s998.photobucket.com/user/12gauge-pakguns/media/Mistral%203/Image9_zps406b80a8.jpg.html][IMG]http://i998.photobucket.com/albums/af103/12gauge-pakguns/Mistral%203/Image9_zps406b80a8.jpg[/IMG][/URL]\r\n\r\nThe super slim forend highly appealed to me as it promotes a good grip and a controlled swing. it literally feels like you are holding the barrel itself.', ''),

It is suitable for the corrosion protection of electrical contacts in low-voltage engineering. Before spraying on electrical or electronic equipment, switch off the devices. The very high dielectric strength (UD=45KV/cm) also allows the application in connection with very sensitive (high-impedance) circuits. This property is particularly useful with electrical contacts and short circuits can be eliminated and prevented. [/COLOR][/SIZE][/FONT][/COLOR]', ''),

As far the fps increase I can''t say how much it will increase. Maybe a increase of 50 to 60 fps or may be more is possible[/QUOTE]\n\nIn fact the spring which comes with the gun gives maximum fps without spacer washers.  All type of springs wear with time and then spacer washers can be used.\n\nThis ia all the matter of pre compression.  In fact if we over do putting spacers behind the spring, the gun may be cocked but the spring may not expand to the extent where it can release its full energy. \n\nHence putting spacer washers is not the thing which should be done blindly. The best way is to space up the spring gradually and chrony the gun at each stage.  Where the gun gives maximum fps, that is the optimum spacing required.\n\nPlease note this point that over doing of spacer washers may reduce fps as it may not allow the spring to expand to the limit where the spring can release full energy.\n\nNow please come to my Diana 54''s case.

All type of springs wear with time and then spacer washers can be used.\n\nThis ia all the matter of pre compression.  In fact if we over do putting spacers behind the spring, the gun may be cocked but the spring may not expand to the extent where it can release its full energy. \n\nHence putting spacer washers is not the thing which should be done blindly. The best way is to space up the spring gradually and chrony the gun at each stage.  Where the gun gives maximum fps, that is the optimum spacing required.\n\nPlease note this point that over doing of spacer washers may reduce fps as it may not allow the spring to expand to the limit where the spring can release full energy.\n\nNow please come to my Diana 54''s case.

But my question remains same, only if the initials of a weapon starts with "AK" doesn''t make it PB, while (this is the part I want to highlight again): while this AK74 is issued on NPB license by government of sindh (although permission is required for it), and its a semi-automatic gun.\n\nSo bro, when one is out there to buy AK-74 semi-automatic, it will be issued to a manual green book issued by DC or computerized HD book. I just don''t see at what point it becomes a PB.\n\nLike @Zia raza brother has mentioned some calibers like any above .45 in pistols etc... but I am sure its not allowed to discuss here on PakGuns because we can assume the length of barrel of a .50 (for instance) will certainly cross the maximum length of barrel allowed for NPB.\n\n\n\n[QUOTE=SMNAP;367219]The mods should give their verdict about the .222/.223 issue...Hopefully it will resolve all the problems and then we can carry on with a peaceful PG :)\n\nEverybody should relax now...:D[/QUOTE]\n\nHahahah... @SMNAP bro we are all relax. Its just a little confusing, now since we know that these letters are hot in market (while 144 permits business is temporarily closed) we really need to know about status of .222/.223 discussions on forum :) I am sure there will be a lot of buyers of these calibers in coming days.', ''),

(529366, ' [QUOTE=tatur1;367303]Yes of course bro, no offense from my side as well and none was taken from your side of course...  But my question remains same, only if the initials of a weapon starts with "AK" doesn''t make it PB, while (this is the part I want to highlight again): while this AK74 is issued on NPB license by government of sindh (although permission is required for it), and its a semi-automatic gun.\n\nSo bro, when one is out there to buy AK-74 semi-automatic, it will be issued to a manual green book issued by DC or computerized HD book. I just don''t see at what point it becomes a PB.\n\nLike @Zia raza brother has mentioned some calibers like any above .45 in pistols etc... but I am sure its not allowed to discuss here on PakGuns because we can assume the length of barrel of a .50 (for instance) will certainly cross the maximum length of barrel allowed for NPB.\n\n\n\n\n\nHahahah... @SMNAP bro we are all relax. Its just a little confusing, now since we know that these letters are hot in market (while 144 permits business is temporarily closed) we really need to know about status of .222/.223 discussions on forum :) I am sure there will be a lot of buyers of these calibers in coming days.[/QUOTE]\n\nLegally, a military weapon like Aks are banned and PB in pakistan. No one can buy or purchase a miltary "in service" weapon without special permits like PB license. Dealear are just making money by confusing the laws. \nSecondly, it is clearly written in Pakistan arms act that pistol or revolver having caliber higher than .45 are not allowed to keep. \nI always request to my fellows to please dont rely on dealers and section officer type lower staff of arms branch of dco or home dept. They just play with the rules to make money. \nThis whole debate came from that.222/.223 permission letter. I repeat my comment that Semi-automatic was not written anywhere in the letter. That is just permitting .222/.223 NPB rifle which means a bolt-action or single action rifle, simple.\nI hope, this will be taken as a legal academic debate...........', ''),

(529534, ' Traditional pump-action and semi-automatic tactical shotguns share one serious shortcoming: They are slow to reload. Although they possess formidable short-range terminal performance, they hold a limited number of rounds. When those rounds are gone, the magazine takes a considerable amount of time to replenish. This is due to their feeding from a tube magazine.\n\nMagazine capacity is, of course, limited by tube length. Rounds need to be loaded one at a time, and under stress this can be agonizingly slow. In reality, loading a traditional shotgun is no faster than loading a French Mle. 1886 Lebel, and that was obsolete before World War I. Luckily, a tube full of 00 buck is all that&#8217;s required in a typical self-defense scenario. However, if you&#8217;ve ever longed for a tactical shotgun that was a bit more modern, there is one to consider. It&#8217;s the Saiga-12, and it&#8217;s a 12-gauge shotgun variation of the famous AK-47.\n\nSaiga, which means Steppe antelope, is a line of sporting firearms produced by Izhmash OJSC of Izhevsk, Russia. Izhmash OJSC is also a major producer of Russian small arms and the home of both the AK47 and the SVD. Izhevsk is also the adopted home of Mikhail Timofeevich Kalashnikov. The Saiga-12 is a semi-automatic, 12-gauge incarnation of Mikhail Kalashnikov&#8217;s legendary design. Better still, like the AK-47, the Saiga-12 feeds from detachable box magazines. Think about it. A semi-automatic, magazine-fed, 12-gauge AK. Some interesting possibilities for a fighting shotgun come to mind.\n\nThe man behind transforming the Kalashnikov into a shotgun was not Mikhail Kalashnikov, but another famous Russian designer, Gennady Nikolayevich Nikonov. Unlike Kalashnikov, Nikonov was actually born in Izhevsk, which is about 1,500 kilometers east of Moscow. Both his father and mother were employed by Izhmash, so it ran in his blood. His father worked as a mechanic at the huge facility, which employed tens of thousands. At the age of 18, Nikonov graduated from technical school. While there, he became obsessed with underwater rifles. He won his first professional recognition by designing a trigger mechanism for an underwater rifle. To further his education, he took evening classes while working at Izhmash. He graduated from the well-respected Izhevsk Mechanical Institute as a certified firearms engineer in 1975. After graduating, he went on to a post-graduate Ph.D course. He eventually married someone who could understand his work, another firearms designer named Tatiana. They had two sons, Nikolay and Yuri.\n\nNikonov began work at Izhmash in the Department of the Chief Arms Designer. His first position was as a technician. From 1980 to 1985 he worked on various projects for the Soviet Ministry of Defense. Not only the quality of his work, but also the amount he was able to perform helped him to advance up the work ladder. During his 30-plus-year career, Nikonov designed various rifles, air guns and sporting firearms. These ranged from a stylish, yet accurate Izjubr (Buck Deer) hunting carbine to a straight-pull, bolt-action biathlon competition rifle. Without a doubt, though, he is most famous in the West for his AN-94 assault rifle. Adopted in 1994 by the Russian army, this blowback-shifted, pulse-operated rifle is currently fielded by select Spetsnaz units. Of interest to us here, he also led the design team that created the Saiga series of AK-based shotguns. During his time at Izhmash, Nikonov received almost 50 designer&#8217;s certificates and patents. He was also awarded the titles of Best Designer of the Company and Best Designer of the Ministry.\n\nDuring a trip to Izhmash in 2001, I had the opportunity to meet with a member of his design team and discuss this interesting shotgun. Although at first glance the Saiga-12 appears very similar to a standard AK, it took a great deal of work to shoehorn a 12-gauge shotshell into the action. The heart of the piece remains a stamped sheetmetal receiver. However, it has a beefier trunnion. The most significant change in the Saiga is the gas system, which has settings to allow both low brass 2¾-inch shells and three-inch Magnums to be used with equal reliability. The gas piston on the bolt carrier has also been noticeably shortened. In addition, part of it has been machined away to allow shell clearance during ejection. The bolt has also been changed with the addition of a larger face. As expected, the topcover needed to be opened up to allow ejection of the big hulls. In conjunction with this, a simple sheetmetal shutter has been added to the recoil-spring assembly. This closes the rear of the ejection port when the bolt is forward in battery.\n\nProbably the greatest challenge facing the Russian designers was creating a reliable magazine. Reliable magazines for rimmed cartridges are notoriously difficult to design. Add the complication of feeding a flatnose shell and things become even more troublesome. Nikonov&#8217;s team solved the feeding problem by having shells go straight into the chamber. Magazine bodies are produced from a glass-fiber-reinforced polymer. Tough and sturdy with a metal reinforcement in the feed lips, the magazines fieldstrip easily for maintenance. Standard capacity is five rounds, although the Russians also produce an eight-rounder.\n\nAlthough the Russians do build tactical versions of the Saiga-12 with a pistol grip and side-folding stock, they are not legal to import, so Saiga-12s are imported as sporting guns. They have a sporting-type butt with no separate pistol grip, and the trigger mechanism is moved farther to the rear of the receiver. The butt and fore-end are made from a tough black polymer and fitted with narrow, 7/8-inch European-pattern sling swivels. Barrel lengths commonly seen are 19, 22 and 24 inches. Most of these have a fixed choke, usually full, although improved cylinder has also been offered. Some models were also available with external screw-on chokes. Both fixed and adjustable sights have been presented. A scope rail is fitted to the left side of the receiver. This allows a shooter to slide on a red dot sight or low-power scope when shooting slugs.\n\nBeing that it&#8217;s an AK-based design, it is not too difficult to legally convert a Saiga-12 into something more socially oriented. Currently, there are a number of good gunsmiths doing excellent work in this regard. Tony Rumore of Tromix, for example, is one I would highly recommend. For this article, I chose to look at a Saiga-12 converted by Marc Krebs of Krebs Custom.\n\nRead more: [url]http://www.gunsandammo.com/reviews/saiga-12-review/#ixzz2UbX29q9E[/url]', ''),
(529535, ' The shotgun I reviewed started life as a standard Saiga-12 sporting shotgun. Krebs removed the factory firing mechanism, filled the holes and installed standard fire-control parts. A SAW-pattern pistol grip was added along with a standard fixed, military-type buttstock. To make the piece a bit handier, the heavy-wall barrel was shortened to 181/4 inches. Krebs then added one of his front sight assemblies to the barrel. This is held in place by two set screws. Robust ears on this unit protect a standard AR-type front sight. By utilizing a standard AR front sight, any of the commonly available aftermarket sights can be mounted. A very large-diameter aperture sight is mounted on the gas tube just ahead of the receiver. Diameter of the aperture is approximately 3/8 inch. Yes, it&#8217;s big and easy to pick up, either at speed or in low light. This sight is very fast on target when shooting shotshells, yet provides precision when firing slugs. The magazine release is the standard paddle type. The forearm is also the standard piece.\n\nThe result is a fairly short and handy shotgun with hardcore good looks. Overall length is just 363/4 inches. Balance point, with no magazine, is right at the bolt handle. With target loads and low-recoil LE buck and slug loads, it&#8217;s fairly pleasant to shoot. However, with full-house 00 buck or slug loads, the narrow military buttplate will not be denied its pound of flesh. A long day shooting heavy three-inch Magnums with this piece would not be at the top of my list of fun things to do. However, recoil is quite tolerable with 2¾-inch low-recoil 00 buck and slugs. Controllability is also quite good. The only problem is that those short, five-round magazines run dry way too quickly.\n\nThere are options to the standard Russian five-round magazines. AGP offers a 10-round magazine for the Saiga-12. Manufactured  in the U.S., this magazine is made from a robust glass-filled nylon. Made in separate halves that are screwed together, the body is also fitted with metal feed lips. At almost 11 inches long and more than three inches wide, these are big mags. They are actually bigger than the gun&#8217;s receiver. I purchased one of the very early production magazines and have been running it for almost two years. Reliability has been very good, but I did run into some problems after I had about 500 rounds through it. The follower became a bit sluggish coming up the last couple of inches. A little sanding cured that. ProMag also offers polymer five- and 10-round box magazines. The 10-round mag in particular has become popular among 3-Gun competitors. Suggested retail for the five-round mag is $26, while the 10-round design sells for $43.\n\nThe one thing you have to be aware of with the Saiga-12 is that a fully loaded magazine can be fairly difficult to lock into place. Loading down one round cures this, so I make a habit of only loading nine rounds in AGP magazines. Another thing to be aware of is that the front of the plastic shotshells can distort due to spring pressure. This can happen to the top round in the magazine if it&#8217;s left stored in the gun for a month or more. Basically, the heavy spring pressure driving the shell against the bolt deforms the plastic. I have seen shells deformed to the point where they wouldn&#8217;t chamber. Ammunition brand may play a part in this, but I think it is just the nature of plastic shotshells. The easiest cure is to simply not leave a loaded AGP magazine locked into your Saiga-12 for extended lengths of time. If you do, I highly recommend downloading it to eight rounds and frequently checking the top round for distortion.\n\nAnother option is drum magazines. These offer higher capacity over standard box magazines. The downsides are bulk and weight. However, for pure sex appeal and fun on the range, a 20-round drum in a 12 gauge is hard to beat. MD Arms offers a 20-round drum that weighs two pounds empty. It is available with a black, clear or smoke back cover. This design has three moving parts and only 15 parts total. It retails for $120. ProMag offers a similar design in two capacities, 20 and 12 rounds. As to be expected, the 12-round drum is quite a bit handier when locked into the gun. Both models have clear backplates to easily keep track of remaining rounds. The 20-round model retails for $124. The 12-round model retails for $99. One last option is Alliance Armament, which offers not only a 20-round drum but also a 30-round design. Very different from the previously mentioned designs, the Alliance Armament drums are open on the sides. They are also very expensive. The 20-round model retails for $379, while the 30-round drum retails for a whopping $425.\n\nAnother avenue one can take with the Saiga-12 is very old-school: all-brass shotshells. Brass shotshells will not deform in the same manner as conventional plastic hulls, so they might be the ticket for a magazine that will be left loaded and locked in to the gun long term. The problem, of course, is that no one currently offers modern 00 buckshot and slug loads in all-brass cases. There is no reason to let this deter you, however. Magtech offers brand-new empty brass 12-gauge shotshells for reloading. These are intended for Cowboy Action shooters, but don&#8217;t let that put you off. RCBS offers its Cowboy Brass Shotshell Die, which is specifically made for reloading brass shotshells. Better still, it&#8217;s designed to work in a standard reloading press. If you currently load pistol or rifle ammunition, you can load brass shotshells. Smokeless powder data is a bit hard to come by, but all components are readily available. Both Magtech&#8217;s hulls and RCBS&#8217; die set are available from MidwayUSA.\n\nOther than the problem stated, standard plastic shotshell performance is quite acceptable. Shells load into the magazines with little effort, and once you get the hang of it, magazines lock easily into the rifle if you load down one round. Pulling back the bolt and releasing it chambers one of the big shells smoothly. That still surprises me. Squeezing the trigger five times as fast as you can puts five empty hulls in the air. Cycle time is very fast, with empties being thrown five to 15 feet to the forward right depending on the load and gas port setting. Keep in mind, you do have an adjustable gas port. For best performance, run it on the lowest setting that will reliably function.\n\nHow does the Krebs-modified Saiga-12 pattern? To find out, I posted a large piece of cardboard at 15 yards. This is a practical distance for a shotgun intended for self-protection inside the home. Most encounters are likely to take place at this distance or much closer. Ammunition utilized for patterning was Federal&#8217;s Power-Shok 2¾-inch buffered 00 buck load. Five rounds were fired with measurements taken after each round. Performance was quite acceptable from this 12-pellet load. Average spread at 15 yards was 10 inches, and the patterns were very uniform in density. Switching to Wolf Performance Ammunition&#8217;s 2¾-inch one-ounce slug load, I tried my hand at 50 yards. Four five-shot groups averaged a respectable 4.9 inches. Recoil was fairly stout, though, thanks to the narrow buttplate.\n\nLately, there have been a lot of rumors circulating that the BATFE was going to halt the importation of Saiga shotguns. The worry here is that they were going to declare that the Saiga-12 was not a sporting gun. This was likely stirred up by the sudden surge of high-capacity drum magazines. While this has not happened, it is a worry that has certainly stimulated current sales.\n\nThe Krebs Custom-modified Saiga-12 is a very interesting gun with some excellent features. While it won&#8217;t win any beauty contests, it is extremely robust. When fed from AGP magazines downloaded to nine rounds, there are a lot of rounds on tap. Reloading is quick and easy. Controllability depends entirely on load selection. Full-house buckshot and slug loads pound on both ends. Low-recoil LE loads, on the other hand, are very controllable. Bred from the most reliable assault rifle in the world, it is an impressive-looking shotgun. Is it perfect? No. Mags will always be the weak point of this design due to the rimmed shotshells. Plus, in my experience the Saiga-12 is less tolerant than a 7.62x39mm gun regarding lubrication. However, properly lubed with good mags and low-recoil buckshot loads, the Saiga-12 is an impressive piece. If you are in the market for a tactical shotgun, the Saiga-12 is worth a look.\n\nRead more: [url]http://www.gunsandammo.com/reviews/saiga-12-review/#ixzz2UbXEqnZ4[/url]', ''),

(529571, 'Mod Eyes Only: Silver vs Guns Thread. Salams as you guys know I''ve been travelling most part of these past two years and I really haven''t had a lot of time to shoot any of my guns. Not only has that made me sad :( it made me even sadder to see those great guns sitting around while others could be enjoying them. \n\nThere is also the security risk factor of having too many expensive guns lying around while I''m not in town and me having the pain in  the neck of cleaning the entire lot every 6 months. Cleaning, maintaining and oiling about 50 guns is not fun when you''re in town for a short time.  \n\nI recently sold the Ruger Mark III, the Tac Ops and the Dan Wesson. I did not really have any use for the cash and thought I would do a little guns vs investment experiment. Through fundamental and technical analysis I identified Silver as having the most upside potential in the next 12 months (I had initially identified Tesla but bad timing made it run away from me) so I sold the guns for 150,000 (Ruger) + 250,000 (Tac Ops) + 200,000 (DW) = Rs. 600,000.\n\nWith Rs. 600,000 cash in hand I converted it to USD at the exchange rate of Rs. 100 to get $ 6000 handed back to me which I brought with me to Dubai. Here I did some research on the brands of Silver available locally, buying locations, storage etc. I went with the biggest Silver dealer in Dubai and with the Spot rate at USD 22.4 today placed an order. \n\nThere is a premium between spot rate and actual physical Silver. i.e the worldwide Silver price might be 22.4 but if I want to buy actual Silver Bars it would cost me $ 2/3 over spot. Apparently the market is so down these days that the bullion dealer himself told me not to buy right now as the market might go down further and I could buy the same thing much cheaper in the coming months. I was comfortable with the price and went ahead with the purchase as I can hold indefinitely and I have no hurry to encash.\n\nI had $ 6000 x 3.65 (USD to AED fixed exchange rate) = 21,900 AED in hand and with the doom and gloom scenario in the market I could ask the dealer for a discount in premium over spot. We finally agreed on a $ 1.2 price over spot. That made for a price of AED 2760 per KG Bar (approx 80 Pakistani Tolas). The market price today was AED 2915.\n\nFor AED 21,900 / 2760 I got 8, 1 KG Silver Bars minted by Emirates Gold (which are the most demanded/popular bars in UAE).

That certainly is an excellent reference which really helped me, but the only point I''d agree on giving up the idea of AK74 being NPB is its barrel length which is exactly 16.3 inches :) But once again its "[B]federal[/B]" notification and after 18th amendment, I think the powers divided among proviences weren''t limited to generation of electricity, but also last time I heard they get to define their own arm policies. And once again the weapons are sold on calibers, here in Sindh on NPB licenses is clearly written that this license is valid for all NPB calibers except .222 and .223, and to obtain one of those calibers you need to have one of those letters that are now being made here in our province :)  and so far what idea I have gained here is that other provinces aren''t even issuing any such letters for those calibers.\n\nAnother point to note is that in federal notificaiton, All shotguns (semi-auto or pump) having tube or magzine capacity of more than 4 shots are PB :D now where does that leave us bro? hahahahah... So, lets get back to start but this time try something different: "Hey I want to buy Akdal MK1919 or Hatsan MP-A (very reputed and budget shotguns, list may vary ofcourse)" and some one gets back to me with "Akdal has magzine capacity of 5+1 and Hatsan or any other Tube-feed shotgun has capacity of 7+1 or 8+1" therefore according to Federal notifications, they are [B]PB[/B]. But I do own one of those on my NPB license :-) ...\n\nNow we take about resemblence, take a look at lucky star market and you will find heaps of shops filled with heaps of .30sss with "more than" resemblence to AK47, MP5 and etc...\n\nAnother thing that I am not the only one who has this idea, actually its our group who have the same thinking but looks like no one wants to come forward and speak alongside here on forums, :-) I never even knew if AK74 was .222 until some of my friendsss from PakGuns told me about it, and now it seems I am the only one standing for it...

[COLOR=#ff0000]The NPB license for Rifle[/COLOR], now we know there ain''t many options out there. But almost all reputed dealers with big and dashing outlets have those .22 semi-automatic rifles. They come with mag capacity of 10, 20 (commonly), 25 and 30 :) rounds. They are AVAILABLE for sale out there, even right now... Go there, show your license and buy one.

I am sure some of our fellow PakGunners enjoy these .22s as well!\n\nThen comes topic of replicas and resemblance... So back to those .22 rifles I mentioned above, produced by Walther and imported by our dealers :) are actually [COLOR=#ff0000]advertised and sold as replicas of those well-known [B]PB[/B] weapons[/COLOR] like MP5 and M4 Carbines... These were the imported replicas I mentioned :) Then there are all those LOCAL .30in/7.62mm replicas being sold out there, and we are buying these for our guards and etc... Believe me some of they even exceed maximum barrel length to fall in pistol category BUT they do are considered as pistols...\n\nThen comes PISTOLs, well there is nothing much but all those extended and drum magz also fall in PB and several of us enjoy keeping those.\n\nSo I mean I refuse to accept that if there is a this SEMI-AUTOMATIC weapon, which you are allowed to purchase by government of Sindh on your NPB license...[COLOR=#ff0000] Even if the letter does [B]NOT [/B]say "semi-automatic", does it rather mention "bolt action" [B]???[/B][/COLOR] So to my understanding if the wording "bolt-action" is not mentioned, it clearly means any .222 weapon can be bought... Its about either if glass is half empty or half full!

That certainly is an excellent reference which really helped me, but the only point I''d agree on giving up the idea of AK74 being NPB is its barrel length which is exactly 16.3 inches :) But once again its "[B]federal[/B]" notification and after 18th amendment, I think the powers divided among proviences weren''t limited to generation of electricity, but also last time I heard they get to define their own arm policies. And once again the weapons are sold on calibers, here in Sindh on NPB licenses is clearly written that this license is valid for all NPB calibers except .222 and .223, and to obtain one of those calibers you need to have one of those letters that are now being made here in our province :)  and so far what idea I have gained here is that other provinces aren''t even issuing any such letters for those calibers.\n\nAnother point to note is that in federal notificaiton, All shotguns (semi-auto or pump) having tube or magzine capacity of more than 4 shots are PB :D now where does that leave us bro? hahahahah... So, lets get back to start but this time try something different: "Hey I want to buy Akdal MK1919 or Hatsan MP-A (very reputed and budget shotguns, list may vary ofcourse)" and some one gets back to me with "Akdal has magzine capacity of 5+1 and Hatsan or any other Tube-feed shotgun has capacity of 7+1 or 8+1" therefore according to Federal notifications, they are [B]PB[/B].

All those guns having 12 Land barrels which are outsourced from other countries like China.  Diana factory makes only 8 Land barrels.You can check your gun, whether its barrel is made by Diana or by an other manufacture.2.  Diana left the practice of getting outsourced barrel in 2010.3.  Diana scopes are not made in Germany.  These scope are made under licence of Diana company.  These are made in some other country like China but with very good quality control. These scope meets the purpose very well.4.  Diana scopes have the guarantee of only 2 years.5.  With magnum guns and fixed barrel guns, Diana give guarantee only if Dampa mount is used.6.  Almost all new Diana airguns come dry from the factory.7.  All new Diana guns which come dry from the factory change their behavior positively if properly greased and lubed inside the guns.  Be careful as improper greasing can destroy the internals of the gun.8.  Stock screws must be checked at some reasonable intervals as if these are loose, the accuracy may not be guaranteed.9.  T06 triggers may be adjusted to one''s like.  Only the 2nd screw in the trigger blade is suggested to be very slightly adjusted.10.  In Diana 54 airking, the sledge (anti recoil system) can be adjusted.  The best adjustment is one where the action remains locked upwards till the gun is given a slight jerk. With a slight jerk, the action should come backwards.11.  The best pellet weight is between 13 Gr. and 16 Gr.12.  It is difficult to shoot with magnum airguns accurately (except 54) unless and until a proper lube tune is made.13.  48, 52 and 54 models'' springs have relatively short life.  The spring break after approximately 6000 pellets fired.14.  There are even better springs available in the USA market15.  The best Tuning kit (Spring+ Guides) is made by JM Maccari which costs around 80$.  This spring and guide makes Diana 54 and any other Diana gun much more smooth and easy to shoot.  Also these springs do not break.16.  For airguns, only airgun rated scopes should be used.17.  Hawke scope are also considered good for airguns.  AGS Cobalt from Webley is also a good option.18.  Always keep your scope optically centered to achieve best results and to enhance the scope life.19.  Never use mineral based oils or mineral based grease in internals of airguns20.  Peep sight is one of the best options if you want some other means (other than scope and open sight) to shoot accurately.21.  Never fire an airgun without a pellet.22. If a magnum airgun is fired without a pellet,  the gun may be ruined and may never be repaired.23.  For short range, match type Wad cutter  pellets work fine.  For long range Dome shape is good for hunting.24.  Crosman Premier is one of the best low cost pelletsRegards,Umair Bhaur[/QUOTE]for all new members of this forum.', ''),

I liked the weapon then - its feel and shot groups were very good and was told that it was for only I think 40000/rs.  I put it on the back burner of things to buy.  Over this period of time, Abbas kept his Piranha and fired it till recently when I found out that over 15000 rounds had been fired through it already and the gun never showed any signs of wear.  Anyways, I borrowed the gun and gave it a slight trigger job.  I noticed that the gun was just as much fun to shoot as the TS single handed.  Furthermore it was shooting well with entry level shooters - they were dropping plates at 25meters with this gun the first time around.  I have yet to see someone do that with my TS even.  This is a lot to say.  I personally used Abbas''s gun and fired about 6000 rounds of S&B and REFUSED to clean it - just touching the muzzle of the gun meant black hands.  Needless to say, the gun shot VERY accurately always and it NEVER jammed on me.  Then the dreaded day came when Abbas bhai wanted his gun back :-(.  After cleaning it for over two hours I gave the gun back.  Since then I have been looking for it.  It was not available in Lahore, karachi, and Pindi.  Then I started to look in Peshawar, didn''t see it there.  Finally a dealer traced it down for me.  Why, this gun shoots great, accurately great, don''t believe me?  Be my guest at the Gclub.  For the past four months, I had stopped using my CZ TS (used it only once or twice), rather I was always taking the Piranha to range.\nBuy the gun... or wait for my video and then look for it...  Either way its a great gun.\n\nSP01 is just as heavy as the CZ TS - Skeeter60 bought both to WAH.', ''),

(529809, 'My Shooting Range (Early Stage) Recently some mountains made up of sand/bajri were removed from my farm and was taken away by trucks to be used for construction. As a result the place is now empty, some portion is always empty where the trucks and the labor doesn''t works.\n\nSo I decided to use the place as a shooting range. Although the place is fine in terms of safety and no one lives nearby the place so its fine for shooting plus the bullet wont obviously make it through to the mountains. Currently this is a temporary set up and it has no targets neither any other thing related to a shooting range or tactical shooting stuff. But tactical shooting can still be practiced there but again I don''t have any proper targets. \nI use empty glass bottles only to practice some target shooting there. I have though to make a proper set up in a another area on the farm and I can get as many truck loads of sand as I want to make a thick sand wall.\n\nI am working to make a shooting range somewhere at the farm and hopefully in near future I will come up with something good but obviously it won''t be state of the art.\n\nRecently I visited the farm and had a brief shooting session as well with my friends.\n\nBelow are the pictures of the place.\n\nThis is the place''s bird view...\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]21531[/ATTACH]\n\nThe actual place looks like this.

Especially when females are on board? I know all the ethics and I am sure several of our members here did get my point that what I meant to say...\n\nIf I did hit some BGs with front bumper of my car to have them slide over road while I could run, then its NOT a bad thing, its GOOD enough for me and there is NOTHING to feel guilty about. Even when I am armed, I will first to ensure safe escape route for myself if all the shootings can be avoided, no matter either I bump them or dodge them, its always the number 1 priority. Once again, I know the all the ethics but if you are willing to prosecute my argument then sorry to disappoint that I won''t discuss it any further, lol no offense bro.\n\nThe problem is that as these BGs approach closer to one''s vehicle and flash there shinny TT with a communist star on the grips... people get terribly confused that what they should do, and the "panic-mode" is triggered up there in brains! This is the difficult time but if one has confidence to understand the situation around him/her confidently, I assure you that there is always a way :-) However if shooting is the only possible response and your car is in motion then still its preferred to either go little ahead or reverse before pressing opening merciless fire. What should NOT be done is shooting everywhere in panic or driving away while shooting too to make it look like warning shots, trust me the projectile may go anywhere and hurt any bystander...\n\nNow we live in karachi... We have all faced such situations, If you want to commit here and tell you stories of how I fractured bones of some BGs, well sorry but I will have to disappoint you :P', ''),

Well i manually decock my both of vikings in same manner, so  what and where is the difference?. besides, by pointing both of my guns in safe directions, i deliberetly let my thumb slip to let the hammer strike the firing  pin but the bullet didnt went off ( no body should try this as results may varrie . if any body is doing this, he would be doing it on his own responsibility, i shall not be at cost , responsible for the cosequences) it was obviously due to firing pin safety or half cock arrangement as the baikal calls it. i saw a very good thread on it here as well which i cant find now . this is no less than a decocker.[/QUOTE]\n\n\n\nhi casanova ... im new on this forum can u plz share ur email with me to ask about viking .....', ''),

As with almost all birds of prey (BoP), the females are bigger than males; males average weight lies between 180-230 grams and that of females lie between 270-320 grams. Quite a fascinating bird to look at and to hunt with. It has got the heart of a lion, very aggressive, very fast on the wing and will often chase and bring down prey much larger than itself. Often they hunt in pairs. Its the only BoP I kept that remained aggressive towards me and while I had her my hands always sported the ''love bites'' she left ;) I''ve only seen one Turumti (who belonged to a friend) who wouldn''t bite otherwise they all seem to carry this nasty habit of biting and footing the falconer. We''ve flown Turumtis on a wide array of quarry including (but not limited to) quails, maynah, cuckoo, partridges, lapwings, pigeons and they tend to do well on whatever they''re flown upon. There''s this local legend of an old falconer who flew a cast of Turumtis (flying them in a pair, or more) and brought down a Kite with em. Our PG''s Mr. Turumti has kept many over the years and he will surely be able to tell you all what I''ve missed here. But in my limited years of falconry this bird has been able to super impress me with what she has to offer in such a small package :).

(530021, ' [QUOTE=Omkhan;367938]@ED and Zia,\n\nBro no 1 here ever suggests to shoot the mugger over mobile or some cash. The thing is you never know their full intentions and if you comply and have the wait and see kind of attitude then quite often it is too late and suicidal to respond if things start to go south. Basically its kind of like : I expect the BAD guys to do GOOD things and only cash/ mobile/ car is what they want.  \n\nSo hope for the best and prepare for the worst.[/QUOTE]\n\nBro, its not that I am willing to contend here but its just a usual difference of opinion here... In my opinion, There are several prospects of owning a gun apart from fun and target shooting, biggest of them is right to Self-defense and defense of others around you. \n\nAs far as we are living in city of Karachi, such incidients are inevitable because the city of lights is actually a land full of scapegoats where criminal elements abuse its civilans to fund their wars for known and recognized terrorist organizations like BRA, BLA and TTP. Trust me, if @EDs car would have entered those No-Go areas of Liyari :) Apne namaz parh laine thi gari ki...\n\nSecondly, its NOT that I am "pro-shooting-no-matter-what" type of person; Actually I have 2 cellphones for the purpose, so if I have to go nearby for smaller errands on bike, I carry cheaper one with me, I don''t carry wallet with me except needed amount of cash in my pockets and I certainly do NOT carry weapon on me! This means when I am going out like this, the mobile and any valuable thing in my pockets are actually "AMAANAT" of these BGs which I have all intentions to give up...\n\nBut when I am out there "properly", especially when I have my family with me... I keep a loaded gun with me with all intentions to shoot if escape through speeding by dodging and/or bumping is not possible. I don''t know if you have ever been in such situation in car but if its time of night and/or the vicinity is not really crowded which usually is during day time THEN trust me then will actually PULL YOUR OVER, even they are only after valuables or mobile and not the car; they will and search everything... And just imagine if they find a weapon on you in such case, everything will start to fall south wards on its own :| \n\nI request you to NEVER expect good things from BAD guys, not all of them are of same kind... Especially when you are out there with females on board, there are several heard and known cases of kidnappings during the simple car or mobile snatching crimes. May Allah (SWT) forbid such incidents and keep all of us from any harm of any kind.\n\nTherefore if I am out there with GUN, then its totally because I am willing to use it unless its avoidable through proper and safe escape. I don''t carry GUN with me to offer it as a gift to them when they are looting me, or I don''t carry GUN on me to just make them mad. Also if I am carry GUN on me and I have all rights of defense then why appreciate these BGs to let them loot you for once, and trust me they will feel appreciated and try to do it again and again with you, your family and others....\n\nOnce again prospects of owning guns gives you COMPLETE right to defense of your self, your property either movable or non-movable and as well as defense of others around you.\n\n[QUOTE][B]96.

Because there are several known cases in courts where surviving BGs are actually have there cases prosecuted against home owners by stating disgraceful things about their family and claiming that they were invited to home and didn''t just break in...

Now as Khilji mentioned, you have two zero points, one near zero the other one is far zero. \nTo obtain most optimum results from chairgun you 1st need to check your [B]gun''s velocity on a choro[/B], so that you have ACTUAL figures. Then using that average velocity, and the pellet you''re using, input data in chairgun.\nTry to provide all the information, even the scope height etc. Enter the kill zone as 1 inch. this would mean that the pellet over a certain distance will hit within 1/2 inch of your zero. \nYou''ll have a graph based on the info provided, with the pellet trajectory intercepting the scope''s line of sight twice. The 1st intercept is known as near zero and vice versa.\nNow hopefully that you''ve understood the basic concept, its easier to infer that at distances between your gun''s near zero and muzzle, the pellet will hit BELOW the zero (meaning you''ll have to place your shots on the mil dots BELOW the crosshair). Between near zero and far zero, ideally the pellet will hit ABOVE the scope''s line of sight (meaning you''ll have to place your shots on the mil dots ABOVE the crosshair).\nSimilarly at distances beyond your far zero, the pellet will start to drop, and you''ll place your shots on the mil-dots BELOW the crosshair.

So when he wanted to take video footage of some of his shooting  endeavors and found it difficult &#8212; as one would imagine &#8212; to hold both  his iPhone and gun at the same time, he came up with a solution.\n\nWithin just a few weeks [URL="http://inteliscopes.com/"]Inteliscope[/URL], which combines a mount and app, was born.\n\nThe Inteliscope system allows users to shoot video from the rifleman&#8217;s  perspective with a digital zoom of up to five times the usual distance  at a resolution that Giddings said is an improvement upon most  smartphones&#8217; quality.\n\nHere are some of the other features built into the app:\n\nBallistics and Firearm Data[/*]Built-in Compass[/*]GPS Position[/*]Local  Prevailing Winds[/*]Shot Timer[/*]Flashlight and Strobe using Built-in  LED[/*]\n[/list]\nWhat&#8217;s more, he pointed out the system comes with a set of  customizable crosshair options since &#8220;everyone has their own preference  in scopes.&#8221;\n\n&#8220;One thing folks are getting really excited about is the ability to  shoot around the corner,&#8221; Giddings said, explaining that the screen  would display the target while the firearm was held around the corner.  &#8220;It will let you not be in the line of fire from a bad guy on the other  side.&#8221;\n\nAlthough some of the capabilities of the Inteliscope app are [URL="http://www.theblaze.com/stories/2013/05/16/guess-how-demand-is-going-for-that-rifle-with-the-tech-that-makes-it-difficult-to-miss-a-shot/"]similar to those in the TrackingPoint system[/URL],  a &#8220;smart rifle&#8221; that claims to make it nearly impossible to miss a shot  and has gotten a lot of media attention of late, Giddings said his  system is a little less advanced but much more affordable.\n\nThe TrackingPoint system costs thousands of dollars, while Intelliscope retails for $69.99.\n\n&#8220;We are trying to build an inexpensive device so that everyone can have  access to it,&#8221; Giddings said, noting it isn&#8217;t intended to compete with  TrackingPoint, which is a whole rifle system, including the firearm,  that is designed for shooting at a further distance.\n\nEven Giddings said he would like to have a TrackingPoint system, calling  it &#8220;amazing,&#8221; but that it just isn&#8217;t feasible for everyone.\n\n&#8220;Our system is intended for tactical shooting,&#8221; he said. &#8220;[TrackingPoint] has a very niche following.&#8221;\n\nTaking only about seven weeks from the idea&#8217;s conception to sending out  the first generation of the products beginning in June, Gidding&#8217;s said  he was able to move so quickly with the technology due to his  established engineering company and other contacts he had in the  software field already.\n\nGiddings said he anticipates a software update once a month to continue  improving the technology and user experience. He added they have already  begun development of a mount with built-in shock absorbers for use on  rifles that are more than .308 in size &#8212; the traditional smartphone  mount is good for smaller rifles.\n\nAlthough only available for iPhone and iPod at this time, Inteliscope is  working on an Android version due to demand and expects to have it  ready within a month.\n\nThe system can be used on any firearm with a Picatinny (Mil-STD-1913) or Weaver tactical rail.\n\nCheck out more about the [URL="http://inteliscopes.com/"]Intelliscope[/URL] system on its website.\n\n[video]http://www.liveleak.com/view?i=128_1370018567[/video]', ''),

I have collected 7.62x25 Tokarev cartridges for the past 25 years and I have never found anything like that. You might find some Czech M48 ammo that is loaded hot, up to about 1700fps, but it is also meant for pistols. Every box I have (over 200) that even mentions what they are for says that the rounds are for Pistol AND SMG-use.\nOddly enough, about the hottest Tokarev ammo available on the market is S&B commercial production, in both S&B and Winchester boxes. I think some of that stuff has been clocked at 1800fps or above.\nAnd the pink wrapped Bulgarian is NOT PROOF ammo. It is loaded at the same pressure/speed as any other Bulgarian ball ammo. Some shooters did have some high pressure from some rounds, but that was more likely due to poor storage or poor quality control. Very little proof ammo leaves an ammo factory, and it only gets shipped to weapons factories. The quantity of pink-packeted ammo FAR exceeds any proof ammo production.', ''),

Let me add that before adopting the weaver stance in its true sense, I was used to a somewhat modified style in which my right arm (strong arm) would be straight and the supporting arm (left) would have a bent. With that stance, I observed that I had a strong control for the first 5-7 shots but after that the strain on the right arm''s triceps would make the strong arm a bit shaky, hence loss of accuracy.

You can further up the ate by securing the outer , inner or both the parameters of u r house . Outside parameter is secured by photobeam detectors and the inner one by installing gadgets on all athe entry and exit point of u r house . U can have a standalone arrangment ( just the hooter goes on and no backup) or u can have the option of having a backup of a security company that responds to the alarm in case of an emergency .I would be more then happy to assist you .The problem gets worse if u r house is located on the main road .

Umair bhai was kind enough to bring the moly grease and silicone based grease as we failed to find tar grease. Before opening up we chronied the gun using Crosman pellets and it averaged 925 fps. Opening it up wasn''t a big deal and it took us 20 odd mins to disassemble it. \r\n\r\nI think I wont exaggerate if I say that every one was mighty impressed with the gun''s internals, the machine work and especially the mainspring, which showed little signs of fatigue and wear despite having shot over 2700-2800 pellets through it. Everything was well finished and of good quality. \r\n\r\nSo Umair bhai was kind enough to work on the internals and deburred the cylinder cleaned the internals the mainspring etc while khilji made a washer to be inserted in the cylinder. Mr. Turumti was busy giving valuable advises and repairing his home made slingshot hahaha :p (which he later put to good use ;) ) anyways after all the internals were cleaned they were lubed  and it was time to put the gun back together; and that''s where it got tricky lol the trigger assembly was new to us all and as a result it took us at least 3 hours to figure stuff out and put it back together ;) and while at it a small screw type pin which connected the cocking arm to the anti-bear trap broke. Thankfully we were in good hands and Khilji quickly made another one and we were back in action :D. Finally it was all done and what I expected to take a couple of hours took more than 6 but the gun was finally in place. \r\n\r\nSadly there wasn''t enough light to check the gun on chrony again so we just settled on some test shots. I''ll mount the scope and shoot the gun today to see how has it changed. Hopefully its shot cycle and recoil are to improve considerably.

By the way, it almost certainly looks like worth of a handgun starts to show after maybe about 3000 rounds? At an average? Please don''t confuse it with the barrel life. That, is a separate issue, I mean Mr ABC buys a particular handgun from the Canik55 Series (Piranha/ Shark/ TP), if it''s not a complete lemon, I highly doubt it would pose a problem to make its owner dejected. But then, as Ashes gave a personal example of the TP-9 beginning to fail after 5000 rounds, he had to get rid of it. Heck, could someone give me an insight as to which particular set of handguns the Canik55 aims to compete with? Is it CZ? Like the ill-fated Caracal C which was titled as "The Ergonomic Glock 19, The best of Glock and Steyer"??[/QUOTE]\n\nAs stated earlier, Abbas bhai''s Piranha has had over 6000 rounds through it and majority were chinese. It is still going strong. So alloy pistols from Canik are good.\n\nLots of CZ users in USA are Canik buyers (check CZ Forum USA) , so maybe the target market is CZ fans and owners.

(530955, ' Salam All,\r\nIf I may add my "two cents", as some would say.....\r\n\r\nThe firing pin block serves few purposes, the major one can better be understood by the term "inertia block". Basically, if your firing pin is free to move to and fro, then theoretically if the gun is dropped barrel first, the firing pin "may" hit the primer with enough force to ignite the round in the chamber. Since the force required to move the firing pin block out of the way is always perpendicular to inertial force if dropped barrel first, there is "almost no chance" of both them activating at the same time. \r\n\r\nSo, IMHO, whether the hammer is cocked, half-cocked or uncocked, and whether the safety is engaged or not, the fact of the matter remains that there is always a chance AD in a gun that does not have a FPB if dropped.\r\n\r\nRegards.', ''),

However when bullets were put on lathe machine to know the material they are made of, it appeared to be the Iron . Magnet &#8220;HUGS&#8221; them all . The cases are also made of steel/iron as they stick with it..[/QUOTE]\n\n[QUOTE=Mian Jee;466371]@Zain bhai,\n\nAll Russian & few Chinese ammo will cling to magnet.\n\nwould you please mention the brand, make & calibers of the examined boolits.[/QUOTE]\nWow, that is incredible, it looks like the bullet is solid steel/iron!\n\nFor those who don''t know, steel cases are cheaper, but there are several issues compared to using brass. First off, they aren''t easily resized. You may think that if you don''t reload, that''s a non issue. But being less "elastic" also means that once the case expands after ignition, it doesn''t contract much. That, along with being less "slippery" than brass, means steel cased ammo won''t cycle as reliably, and in some guns it won''t cycle at all. \n\nWhen in comes to the bullet, using steel or iron is again cheaper, but the effects are much more serious. Lead with copper jackets or copper plating is ideal not only because of it''s density, but also because it is malleable. For any given caliber, the projectiles are generally oversized in relation to the barrel size. That is done so that when it''s fired, the bullet will grip the rifling, and also seal the barrel so that expanding gasses will actually push the bullet forward instead of just blowing by it. Some examples of this are, a .224" bullet in .223 Rem cartridges, .401" bullets in .40S&W cartridges, and a .452" bullets in .45 ACP cartridges. That is why its so important for the bullet to be made of a soft metal. If the bullet is made of steel or other hard metals, it will not properly deform to the size and shape of the barrel. At best, that would lead to reduced performance, decreased velocities, and accelerated barrel wear. At worst, it could blow up your barrel. Even the military "Steel Penetrator" rounds (M855 green tip 5.56), only have a steel core and tip, with the rest of the bullet being jacketed lead. If you suspect the bullets in your ammo is made up of anything other than lead and copper (which does not stick to magnets), be very careful should you decide to use it. \n\nZain bro has definitely done everyone a great service by discovering and sharing what "fake" bullets are made of.', ''),

(531115, ' Well bro since you have mentioned you have no experience of a hand guns at all... Here are the few things you need to know...\n\n1. Your first handgun MUST have external manual safety... Its actually a clip within reach of your thumb to engage or disengage manual trigger safety.  This is a feature you will find in Stoeger Cougar.\n\n2. Your first handgun MUST also have a decocker... It is necessary that once you load a mag in your gun and rack the slide, the modern DA/SA pistols will go in Single-Action mode as soon as you rack the slide. In SA mode, only very little amount of trigger pull is required to discharge a round therefore its not viable to carry it cocked (unless your gun has rare "cocked and locked" functionality).\n\nOnce again ofcourse Cougar also comes with decocker! \n\n3. Your first handgun SHOULD have external hammer... this way you can better understand and visually see if your gun is in cocked mode and even if your handgun doesn''t have decocker, an external hammer will let you decock manually (not recommended). Also some times when round fails to fire, with external hammer you can hit the primer with firing pin again easily by cocking hammer again with your thumb while in striker-fired guns you cannot continue shooting unless you eject that round.\n\n4. You first handgun SHOULD have drop safety... So if there is a live round in chamber and gun falls on a hard surface like concrete a handgun may discharge round :) therefore even I own one, I will not recommend Caracal F.\n\n\nThen there are other aspects like either you prefer guns with alloy/metal frame or polymer frames... Ability to conceal carry and etc... I am sure Steoger Cougar will come upto your expectations!', ''),

(531401, ' [QUOTE=tatur1;369134]Well bro since you have mentioned you have no experience of a hand guns at all... Here are the few things you need to know...\n\n1. Your first handgun MUST have external manual safety... Its actually a clip within reach of your thumb to engage or disengage manual trigger safety.  This is a feature you will find in Stoeger Cougar.\n\n2. Your first handgun MUST also have a decocker... It is necessary that once you load a mag in your gun and rack the slide, the modern DA/SA pistols will go in Single-Action mode as soon as you rack the slide. In SA mode, only very little amount of trigger pull is required to discharge a round therefore its not viable to carry it cocked (unless your gun has rare "cocked and locked" functionality).\n\nOnce again ofcourse Cougar also comes with decocker! \n\n3. Your first handgun SHOULD have external hammer... this way you can better understand and visually see if your gun is in cocked mode and even if your handgun doesn''t have decocker, an external hammer will let you decock manually (not recommended). Also some times when round fails to fire, with external hammer you can hit the primer with firing pin again easily by cocking hammer again with your thumb while in striker-fired guns you cannot continue shooting unless you eject that round.\n\n4. You first handgun SHOULD have drop safety... So if there is a live round in chamber and gun falls on a hard surface like concrete a handgun may discharge round :) therefore even I own one, I will not recommend Caracal F.\n\n\nThen there are other aspects like either you prefer guns with alloy/metal frame or polymer frames... Ability to conceal carry and etc... I am sure Steoger Cougar will come upto your expectations![/QUOTE]\n\nGood advise Tatur1 bro. I do agree with your advise and second you. But don''t agree with your suggested handgun(Stoegar Cougar). This is the only gun in Pakistan that i don''t like. There are much better options then Cougar.

(608557, ' [QUOTE=MIRZA1988;445188]You are right single shots are very very accurate and people all over the world take them as challenge...[/QUOTE]\nI used to think that too, with so few moving parts, how could it not be accurate? My experiences/review of the Baikal is as follows...\n\n>You guys ready for another long post by Fudgie? :D\n\n I was saving up for a target rifle to show off with at the range, that is, something that could put multiple bullets through the same hole at 200m (the furthest target at my club). I was browsing through some websites when the price of the Baikal caught my attention (yeah I''m a cheap bastard :)). I had heard of Baikal but never considered one before. But $250 for pretty much any caliber I wanted from 223 to 30-06, and a  break action that only has a hinge and the fire control group as the only moving parts meant it had to be accurate, I was getting more interested by the second. So without further delay, I hit the buy button on a Baikal IZH- 18MH in 270Win. I was thrilled at the thought of building a target rifle for 1/4 the cost of a nice bolt action. But my dream wasn''t to be. \n \nWhen the gun arrived, I went  out to shoot it that same day and got 2" groups at 100m. Ok for a starting point I thought. Then with optics, the groups shrank to 1 1/2". I then had the trigger worked on (around 4 lb break with no creep and over travel stop), got fancy scope mounts with matching rings, experimented with countless load recipes, and the best I ever got out of that rifle was 1 1/16". That isn''t bad, but its far from good since all my AR''s shoot MOA straight out of the box. Unable to get the accuracy I wanted (for a target rifle, I was expecting at least 1/2 MOA), I did more research, spoke to a few gunsmiths, and came to the realization that break actions work fine for shotguns, but as a rifle,  they leave much to be desired, being an inherently inaccurate design. All things being equal, they are actually the least accurate type of action, with bolt guns being on top. \n\nThere are several reasons why, here''s what I learned... first they have two piece stocks. So depending on if you''re resting the gun on a bench, on shooting sticks, holding it, how you''re holding it, pressure and contact on the barrel is never consistent. Consistency is accuracy. Compare that to a bolt action where the barrel can be completely free floated, meaning nothing touches the barrel, thereby alleviating any interference with it''s harmonics and thereby it''s consistency.  Furthermore, when the action is a completely separate component from the barrel, tight, solid lockup largely affects consistency. All metal parts wear, notice how a break action will loosen up after a couple hundred shots. On most guns a little wear is of little consequence, but where the action meets the barrel, a little deviation could mean being way off target at 100m. So the nature of a break action is such, that a little wiggle means a lot of inconsistency. Again compare that to a bolt gun, where the action can be bedded to the stock, ensuring a consistently solid alignment with the barrel (and the rest of the gun) for every shot. Next, when talking about extreme accuracy, extractor design may have an effect to a lesser degree, but an effect nonetheless. That is, the extractor on a break action is merely a section of the chamber face that pushes up the spent case. A good comparison with a bolt action is the claw extractor, of Mauser design, that actually takes a firm hold of the cartridge, keeping it in a secure position throughout the firing sequence, thereby aiding accuracy. Finally, most single shots are budget oriented guns, so match grade accuracy is not an aspect of their design.\n\nI ended up selling mine, but all that is not to say the Baikal is a bad gun, on the contrary. It''s not a target gun by any means, yet it never claims to be. So don''t expect very very good accuracy from it. Having to break the gun open to manually load a cartridge after every shot gets to be tedious in little time. So don''t expect a fun plinking gun.  But the single shot rifle excels at what it was meant for, and that is an inexpensive gun to take hunting. One that you won''t mind dragging through dirt, dropping in a river, and getting banged up. It''s more than accurate enough to take down game, is shot after shot reliable, and it''s light weight is a major virtue for a day in the fields. Another huge plus is its ability to change caliber with a simple barrel swap. So my verdict is: you have a great rifle in the Baikal single shot, a gun that is hard to top, just buy it for the right reasons :)', ''),

In my posts I quoted and explained reliability, cycling, accuracy and features on stoeger despite of my personal opinions like wither is beautiful or ugly, or I like the sound or not... In my personal opinion, Cougar is a classical beautiful handgun that works really well! You may also have rails option (the one that I own) and having even empty rails add dozen more points to its beauty! I also never even mentioned rotating barrel feature of Stoeger but it definitely contributes to its accuracy but still I agree to what you said that guns with rotating barrel work as good as these :)\n\n#20... yes bro indeed, but I never compared PT 92 with Stoeger... actually 92 is a full frame pistol :) while cougar is a normal sized firearm. I did knew Taurus makes PT92/99 of course but when I mentioned Turkey vs. Brazil, I also knew that there are SEVERAL other models of firearms produced by taurus, not limited to 92 alone. \n\nI kept my focus of Stoeger because the name is specified in the post # 1 from thread starter :)\n\nPlease I request you guys that don''t let personal preferences be any kind of factor here like if one doesn''t like Turkey or Turkish guns or shape/design of a gun then let it be, but its not a valid argument :D Now, suppose if our friend here goes to market, prior to purchase he takes cougar in his hands, tries to make a grip... if it doesn''t fit in his fist then definitely cougar is NOT the gun for him :) this all depends on the person him self...

As a result the place is now empty, some portion is always empty where the trucks and the labor doesn''t works.\n\nSo I decided to use the place as a shooting range. Although the place is fine in terms of safety and no one lives nearby the place so its fine for shooting plus the bullet wont obviously make it through to the mountains.

In my posts I quoted and explained reliability, cycling, accuracy and features on stoeger despite of my personal opinions like wither is beautiful or ugly, or I like the sound or not... In my personal opinion, Cougar is a classical beautiful handgun that works really well! You may also have rails option (the one that I own) and having even empty rails add dozen more points to its beauty! [/QUOTE]\n\nMy dear Tatur1 bro.\nI never complained about the reliability of SC. I did mentioned in my previous post that this is my opinion and i''m entitled to it, that''s why we are here. Deathrow bro asked me about why and what i didn''t like in SC. The posts were intended for him and not you. Bro if you like SC it doesn''t mean that i have to like it too :).

That''s my opinion again. Maybe your better shot with it then i am. As some people are deadly accurate with TT''s when i''m not. That doesn''t make TT a bad gun. But i does make it a bad gun for me :). \n\n[QUOTE]#20... yes bro indeed, but I never compared PT 92 with Stoeger... actually 92 is a full frame pistol :) while cougar is a normal sized firearm. I did knew Taurus makes PT92/99 of course but when I mentioned Turkey vs. Brazil, I also knew that there are SEVERAL other models of firearms produced by taurus, not limited to 92 alone.

But that doesn''t mean that all of us have to prefer Turkish guns over other.

(531853, ' one question might arise is that how am i certain of the exact zero at 50 yds and 100 yds ... the answer is that grouping is set of shot performed to check your accuracy but in general when u fire multiple shots u know where u did a slight error an where u did not, where a pellet was loose and in the end, your exact hit point is quite clear (to an accuracy of half an inch), it is just the limitations of equipment and other factors that u don''t achieve the ideal accuracy \n\nplus the fact that the grouping itself points to a zero position of hits', ''),

(531876, ' 1st of all, scope height of 2 inches!!?? In my understanding scope height is the distance between the surface of your receiver and scope tube''s center. I calculate it as follows: Distance between the receiver surface and scope main body + 1/2 of your scope''s tube dia (scopes come in two common diameters i.e. 1 inch and 30mm) which comes to 1/2 inch or 15mm.\n\nWhich pellets did you use for the aforementioned shoot?! If you used any pellets other than FTTs then chairgun''s readings will be out, as each type of pellet has a different BC and leaves the muzzle at a different velocity.\n\nNow, chairgun uses "average" BCs of the pellets and its readings CAN BE OFF esp when we''re talking about distances exceeding 50yards. The reasons are several and as you pointed out, the shape of pellet, wind, change in shooting shooting stance etc are a few to name. As the distance increases the differences become more pronounced. \n\nAlso, most of the readings given in chairgun are based on a standard scope magnification of 10x (until otherwise stated) and therefore the differences become visible as you alter the scope''s magnification. The reason being that the scope reticle is in a different plane and as you change magnification the "POA shifts". \n\nTo curtail this issues etched reticle FFP scopes are there (fixed focal plane) and the reticle is etched on a glass surface instead of a wire reticle; but these are expensive scopes and I''m not aware of an airgun rated FFP, etched scope. I have used a 1/2 mil-dot etched reticle scope on my airgun and while it was very accurate it had its short comings, 1) its reticle was very fine and since it wasn''t illuminated it was very difficult to use on high contrast subjects and in low light & 2) It broke after staying put for about 500 odd shots :p.', ''),

The posts were intended for him and not you. Bro if you like SC it  doesn''t mean that i have to like it too [IMG]http://www.pakguns.com/images/smilies/smile.png[/IMG].  As i said, this is how i feel about the gun and i''m not afraid to give  my opinion and i have rite to do so. I''m in no way forcing decision to  buy or not to buy this gun. If someone like this gun by all means go for  it.  \n\n\n\n\nBro SC is the least accurate gun i''ve fired. That''s my opinion again.  Maybe your better shot with it then i am. As some people are deadly  accurate with TT''s when i''m not. That doesn''t make TT a bad gun. But i  does make it a bad gun for me [IMG]http://www.pakguns.com/images/smilies/smile.png[/IMG]. \n\n\n\nBut you did compared both gun and you did said that you prefer Turkish  made guns over Brazilians. That your personal opinion and your entitled  to it. But that doesn''t mean that all of us have to prefer Turkish guns  over other. If i didn''t have good experience with Turkish guns or any  other for matter, its my duty to warn other people not to buy it. So  that they don''t waste their hard earned money like it did. This is the  exact purpose of this forum. But if they like it and get it anyways.  It''s their choice.[/QUOTE]\n\nMy respect Trigger Happy bro! Actually the argument I made was about  that you should indeed come forward and recommend the guns of your  choice either from the names pre-mentioned by thread starter or some  other suggestion with in price range (you can get an idea again from his  own choices). I am sorry if you are offended with my post but what I  intended to ask you was to not let SC be any inferior just because you  think it looks ugly, I mean the beauty lies in eyes of person which may  vary from person to person. \n\nI have shot thousands of rounds with one SC that I own, I even dropped  it, keep it loaded all the time...

It''s waves like these which sweep people away, who think that  they are standing at a safe distance, (while actually they are not)...\n\n[/B][/SIZE]Anyway over here I met Mr. Miraj Khan, the Chief Lifeguard who oversees this entire area (a 17 kilometer long stretch of beach) - From where Hawks Bay stars (at the west of Karachi), right up to Paradise Point, where Karachi Nuclear Power Plant (KANUPP) is situated.\n\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]21774[/ATTACH]\n\n[SIZE=2][B]Chief Miraj Khan.[/B][/SIZE]\n\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]21772[/ATTACH]\n\n[SIZE=2][B]High tension power lines coming from the Nuclear Plant.\n[/B][/SIZE]\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]21773[/ATTACH]\n\n[SIZE=2][B]KANUPP.[/B][/SIZE]\n\nMr. Miraj Khan and his team of over 50+ men are actually a group of very well trained firefighters, as well as a few local volunteers (patrolling over the beach 24/7). Anyway, they were all very welcoming - And even gave me a free class in aquatic rescue, as well as a tour of their Headquarters! So all these pictures are from my visit. It was not yet high tide, still the pictures turned out OK (and the weather too was partly cloudy, and thus not mercilessly hot)...\n\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]21775[/ATTACH]\n\n[SIZE=2][B]Mr. Miraj Khan, Chief of the Hawks Bay Beach Rescue Center.[/B][/SIZE]\n\nNow here I must mention that these people who daily risk their lives to keep the public safe, are actually treated very badly by everyone... These days there is a ban on swimming in the ocean, as the Monsoon season sea is just too rough! And this beach is known for extremely dangerous riptides (as well as some very sharp rocks just under the waves). \n\nBut the public doesn''t listen, instead these lifeguards are regularly hearing extremely vulgar swear words from the public, as well as an occasional tight slap from some [B]fat aunty[/B] who wants to get into the water with her piglets...\n\nChief Miraj Khan said that he once even had an SMG (sub machine gun) put on his temple by some Air Force officer who objected to Chief Miraj doing his duty... The police also (on paper at least) is suppose to assist these lifeguards in keeping the public safe. But they regularly charge a 200 to 300 Rupees bribe, and so allow anyone to get into the water - However when any fatality occurs due to these issues, it is always the lifeguards who get the blame for everything...\n\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]21776[/ATTACH]\n\n[SIZE=2][B]He is one of the longest serving lifeguards on this beach.[/B][/SIZE][B] [SIZE=2]On duty since 1997, and he says that he too gets slapped [/SIZE][/B][SIZE=2][B]by the ladies regularly (who object when told to stay out of the water)... In his own words: "They say that [/B][B]if you kill one person, it is like killing all of humanity. But [/B][B]if you save a life, then you have in effect saved all of humanity! [/B][B]So I just except the slaps as part of my day, as my main focus is saving lives" (he says with sarcasm) - How however has saved over 400+ people from death. So he indeed is a worthy candidate for some kind of presidential award. But as usual, he mostly receives a slap for doing his duty... [/B][/SIZE]\n\nContinuing this story in my next post...', '');

(531992, ' These lifeguards say one thing very clearly to you, that (God forbid) if you are swept away in these dangerous waters, we our not too well equipped to do much. So be mindful of that if you chose to ignore our advice and warning signs. Even the retrieval of dead bodies is not an easy task over here (as bodies often get stick in the rocks). One such person got swept away by the waves and drowned, and so his body got trapped in one of the 100s of underwater caves. They could not get the body out as it was too tightly jammed. So next morning they got all the heavy duty equipment, and so they bore a hole from the top of the rocks to get the body out. They started their work at 10:00 in the morning, and by 24:00 in the night, they were able to reach to the body - However by this time, the body had swollen up a lot, so the hole which they had dug, was no longer wide enough to get the body out. Therefore they asked for permission from the dead person''s father, to cut the body in parts (as that was the only way for them to get the body out).\n\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]21777[/ATTACH]\n\n[B][SIZE=2]This is the hole from which the body was recovered, see water [/SIZE][/B][B][SIZE=2]gushing out from it as the waves come in. This is just one such [/SIZE][/B][B][SIZE=2]trap we know of, there are actually 100s of others in this area.[/SIZE][/B]\n\nPermission was given, but only after a total emotional breakdown of the victim''s father... So the lifeguards say that you please avoid being a part of an accident like this - Please listen to us and don''t get into the water during this season. As the sea is too rough. Also don''t try to be a hero in case you see someone drowning - Just call is, our emergency number is 16 (which can easily be dialed by any mobile phone also). \n\n\nChief Miraj then tells of another case, where a group of collage kids were picnicking over the rocks. Suddenly they saw a local boy who slipped while trying to catch some fish. The boy who had slipped was a local, so he knew the territory well. Therefore he found a stable place between the rocks where he was safe until he got rescued. But the 2 picnicking collage kids who had jumped into the water to save him, were both killed. One of those 2 young men was the grandson of Dr. A. Q. Khan (father of our Nuclear Weapon''s program)... His body was found 16 hours later, swept away into the harbor.\n\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]21778[/ATTACH]\n\n[SIZE=2][B]This board in the lifeguard center clearly shows how [/B][/SIZE][SIZE=2][B]many people were rescued and how many died.[/B][/SIZE]\n\nWhile giving me a tour as well as teaching all about aquatic rescue - The team got an emergency call, so they were ready to swing into action! But it turned out to be out of their 17 kilometer jurisdiction. This drowning occurred near the Manora side (near PNS Himalaya). And since the person was now presumed dead, Chief Miraj said that he will now only go if called for assistance in the search for the body - Otherwise he would like to avoid it, as that is the Navy''s territory - So to do anything we first have to deposit our CNIC in one office of the Navy, then get into another office from where we would get our written permission to assist in the rescue, and so face even more Naval bureaucracy (with checking at every few yards), while the person who needs rescue drowns...\n\nThere are other problems too. Take this safety sign board for example (says the Chief). Now it''s one thing to ignore it, but totally another to steal it... Actually, it''s frame is made from thin steel angle irons - Which people often steal to sell as scrap iron... The lifeguard tower also (at the Paradise Point) is very badly vandalized. Where local people have stolen it''s steps, probably to use as firewood.\n\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]21779[/ATTACH]\n\n[SIZE=2][B]Newly made warning signs, soon to be stolen (when no one will be looking).[/B][/SIZE]\n\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]21780[/ATTACH]\n\n[SIZE=2][B]See the missing steps of the staircase of this Lifeguard tower.[/B][/SIZE]\n\nInside their briefing room, Chief Miraj explains that there is nothing more costly then a human life. So to save it, we will leave nothing to chance. He said that we once had 5 inflatable boats (in 2005). But one by one, they all got wasted with time. Their rubber actually decays as it ages. But they lost the majority of their boats due to damage sustained when they were called to assist in the Hyderabad floods. Their advantage is that they can work in shallow waters. But at the same time their disadvantage is that they are prone to damage by sharp objects (as they have a soft bottom). Therefore now they have just one boat of fiberglass left.\n\nOther things which the lifeguards use also don''t come cheap. One flotation device is like a soft tube, which the lifeguard can tie around an unconscious victim, and drag him or her to safety. While the other one is made from a very hard plastic, which a conscious victim can hold onto as the lifeguard pulls him or her to shore.\n\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]21781[/ATTACH]\n\n[SIZE=2][B]Soft flotation device costs 17,000 Rupees.[/B][/SIZE]\n\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]21782[/ATTACH]\n\n[SIZE=2][B]Hard flotation device costs about 12,000 Rupees.[/B][/SIZE]\n\nThese however are not the only issues, they also don''t have any motor vehicles other than a fire truck which they use to deploy their lifeguards on duty (while on other hard to reach areas the lifeguards have to walk on their own to get to their post). So a few ATVs (all terrain vehicles) would be great. They also don''t have an Ambulance, and neither a doctor at their station. Which is why they can only provide first aid. They also urgently require jet skis, but each one will cost them about 2 million rupees!\n \nAnother thing which they have requested the government for, is a body locating sonar. Cost of this is around 10,000 US dollars (a little under a million Rupees). Every well established lifeguard station in the developed world (like in North America, Europe, South Africa, and Australia) has this - But over here the Ministry of Defense is keeping them from getting this. They fear that this is a sensitive piece of equipment, which if stolen and/or misused, will easily be able to detect our Navy''s underwater secret activity...\n\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]21783[/ATTACH]\n\n[SIZE=2][B]This is all what is currently available in their first aid room.[/B][/SIZE]\n\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]21784[/ATTACH]\n\n[SIZE=2][B]Bluebottle is the biggest threat to swimmers these days.\n[/B][/SIZE]\nIn our society, we today have become so obnoxiously and disgustingly vulgar - That we would spend 2.5 million Rupees on a cow which will be sacrificed on Eid, (to show off our vast resources). But won''t even give a single Rupee to the victims of the recent floods, furthermore, we will also not do anything that will prevent a tragedy... Which is why, whosoever now reads this, please think of making a donation to these Heroic Lifeguards of Hawks Bay beach of Karachi - And for God''s sake, don''t swear at them, or slap them, (nor spit at them), and kindly don''t threaten them with your guns! As they are only there to save your life, by unselfishly putting their own at risk!\n\n[B]NOTE:[/B] When I asked Chief Miraj on what if I can have these flotation devices made for him in Karachi at a fraction of the cost? He said that please do, if anyone can do such a thing, please get in touch with us. \n\nNow I of course also know what the reality over here is like, which is that there will be a lot of bureaucracy and red tape which will not allow me to do this - So the easy and workable idea is to simply donate equipment to them (like floating jackets, or small inflatable rubber boats)! This way they will get it instantly, and so without any delay - You may indirectly end up saving many lives!\n\nSo is anyone over here man enough to donate equipment to these heroes? The time for the month of Ramzan (and thus Zakat) is drawing close. So I ask again, is there anyone man enough to do what is right? Their door is also always kept open for anyone who is ready to volunteer and devote some of their time, like say a doctor... Therefore I again ask, is there anyone man enough?\n\nNow I must say that in all of Karachi (which is a city of over 20 million people now), you are not likely to find a finer gentleman then Mr. Miraj Khan, Chief of Hawks Bay aquatic rescue center! And by the way, if anyone ever wants to volunteer as a lifeguard also, their doors are always open - Just prove to them that you are a good swimmer!\n\n[COLOR=#333333]Continuing this story in my next post...[/COLOR]', ''),

As a result the place is now empty, some portion is always empty where the trucks and the labor doesn''t works.\n\nSo I decided to use the place as a shooting range. Although the place is fine in terms of safety and no one lives nearby the place so its fine for shooting plus the bullet wont obviously make it through to the mountains. Currently this is a temporary set up and it has no targets neither any other thing related to a shooting range or tactical shooting stuff. But tactical shooting can still be practiced there but again I don''t have any proper targets. \nI use empty glass bottles only to practice some target shooting there. I have though to make a proper set up in a another area on the farm and I can get as many truck loads of sand as I want to make a thick sand wall.\n\nI am working to make a shooting range somewhere at the farm and hopefully in near future I will come up with something good but obviously it won''t be state of the art.\n\nRecently I visited the farm and had a brief shooting session as well with my friends.\n\nBelow are the pictures of the place.\n\nThis is the place''s bird view...\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]21531[/ATTACH]\n\nThe actual place looks like this. I use this wall as the place where targets are placed.\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]21532[/ATTACH]\n\nYou can see the soft sand right ahead of the person in blue shalwar kameez. That is the area where I place the bottles.\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]21533[/ATTACH]\n\nA friend shooting the bottle targets...\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]21534[/ATTACH]\n\nWell this is me, just for some show off lol :rockon:\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]21535[/ATTACH]\n\nThis is a temporary place although I appreciate input from fellow members about how to improve this place. I know I need the targets the ones which are used in ASCC and Airmen Club and I will get them made soon. Hopefully when I get some free time I will spend a couple of days at the farm and make a somewhat better range...SOON INSHA''ALLAH!!![/quote]', ''),

(532451, ' [QUOTE=Enigmatic Desires;370208]Am-freakin-azing!\n\nyears back i had a similar idea.. As regards the life guards at our beaches. But it died at its inception, partly cause I did not have any forum to write on or attract funds. \n\nThese people are chronically understaffed and under funded. \n\nA brainstorming session seems like a nice idea.[/QUOTE]\n\n\nYes, a brainstorming session is a must now... And here I would also like to thank the owners as well as the moderators of PakGuns - For giving us a free platform to talk about such issues. So thanks to this, we all can now email the link of this thread to anyone - Even to the Prime Minister!\n\nOK, now back at doing some brainstorming... When I was there (with these lifeguards), it was for only a few hours - So all that you see written by me here, is probably just the tip of the iceberg. Because the truth is that these people do far more than what we can see at first glance. They do all that is possible to save lives, and in the process also regularly get stung by Jellyfish and Bluebottles.\n\nAt their center they will also (provided that they have time) give you a free class in aquatic rescue - As they believe in making people aware, because that in the long run leads to less mishaps. Yet the most unfortunate thing is that the government doesn''t even bother to provide them with fresh drinking water at their center... So this I feel is EXTREMELY unfair!\n\nSecondly, I also feel very bad how our own people visiting the beach mistreat them regularly. This is totally uncalled for, as no one has the right to slap anyone in public... Chief Miraj Khan is in reality exactly like the the character of Mitch Buchannon (played by actor David Hasselhoff) in the hit TV show Baywatch. Only Mitch Buchannon was fiction, while Chief Miraj Khan is for real! So a little bit of respect for these brave men should be the first order of the day!\n\nAnd so thinking on these lines, I propose that we somehow recommend these lifeguards for a Presidential Award. So how exactly should we go about it? I mean, what is the exact mechanism to recommend someone for such an award???\n\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]21812[/ATTACH]\n\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]21813[/ATTACH]', ''),

Visit a reputed dealer, or make few friends on forums who can guide you to a reliable contact who deals in licenses.\n2. Apply for backdated manual DC license with 2 snaps and 1 copy of CNIC.\n3. Upfront guy with some money.\n4. Acquire your manual DC license as soon as its made, can take from a couple days to 1-2 weeks.\n5. Visit a reputed dealer once again for computerization process, should cost anywhere 5 to 7k (may cost upto 10-11k if you have those HMQ/Wajid Sheikh licenses LOL)\n6. Expect your dealer to call you with in a week, visit HD for photos and data entry.\n7. Provide all accurate data this time, like address and etc... All corrections should be made here.\n8. Expect your license in few days after this process...\n\nAnd there, you have a good to go computerized HD license. (with rounds limit increased to 200 instead of 25/50 that comes default in DC licenses).\n\nI am waiting for my computerized licenses by Monday or anytime next week, after that I will try to have one made for all Pak (I assume that same HD licenses will stamped for all Pak, really dunno)...

As a matter of fact, none of the pistols do that. It will only damage the spring.

But that was a SC so nothing actually happened :P pheewwww...

There is a "risk" only if you have one of those (identified) pieces from faulty batches. Contrarily , sensing threat from Caracal as a brand in whole is only assumption and made up risks in mind. However, I do agree that if one is unsure or feels a threat, he better keep his hands off from that specific thing.\n\nThe problem however lies (as usual) with Caracal management because, as I am sure there are several other batches made and being sold WITHOUT these vulnerabilities but alas! no new shipments coming in Pakistan neither any recall requests being entertained...', ''),

(532678, ' There once was a very poor fisherman, who hardly ever caught enough fish to feed himself and his wife. But since he didn''t know another profession, he stuck with fishing (in the hope that one day the sea will provide him with riches). So one time in the evening he went out in his boat again, far beyond the horizon, baited his hook - And threw his fishing line over the side.\n\nSuddenly there was a very strong tug on his line. So he instantly started to reel it in. Whatever he had caught was indeed big, as he had to fight it really hard  - But once he brought it over the boat and had a good look at his catch, he was astonished to have caught a real Mermaid!\n\nNow he knew that all his troubles would come to an end - But just as he started to row back towards land, the Mermaid begged him for mercy. Realizing that she would also talk blew him away at first, be he said that if he released her, he will forever remain poor. He had been waiting his entire life for such a prize from the sea - So how can he let her go now?\n\nSo the Mermaid said that if he lets her go, she will grant him a wish - Anything that his heart desired, she will do it instantly! Therefore the fisherman thought for a while, and then remembered that if there is anything which he desires more than wealth, is to somehow put an end to his wife''s piercing taunts about the size of his (you know what)...\n\nSo he at once ordered the Mermaid, to make it so, that whenever he stood up straight, his (you know what) be touching the floor - That''s how long he wanted to have it!!!\n\nThe Mermaid gave him a strange and slightly puzzled look, but said OK, granted! Now will you please let me go? So the fisherman threw the Mermaid back into the ocean.

That''s a pretty good description of how things work in a lot of places.\n\n Also note that video cameras are cheap nowadays, and many businesses and home security systems record the areas around them.  If you''re in public, there''s a good chance your actions are one someone''s hard drive, even if there aren''t any government video cameras nearby.  It''s routine for the police to check with local businesses and homeowners to ask if they have any surveillance equipment which might have caught the scene.\n\n These recordings may exonerate you of any wrongdoing... IF you don''t to anything stupid.  Waving your arms in the air and then squatting with your face in your hands won''t hurt your case, but if you walk over to the bad guy and kick him in the face a few times after he''s down, that''s not going to go over well.\n\n Stress makes you stupid.  Adrenaline makes you stupid.  And given how short the average encounter is - less than thirty seconds, by some figures - both will hit hard about the time it''s all over.\n\n Most people plan for or practice what they''ll do in a shooting situation, but what you do afterward is almost as important.\n\n The reason you practice is so that you''ll (hopefully) do the right thing when your brain is turned off by stress and adrenaline.', ''),

(532948, '46 Extra Long The 46 Extra Long rimfire was a Ballard cartridge for their single shot rifle and may have been used by others. It does not appear in the Remington 1871 catalog so possibly originated sometime after that date. Remington may have been the only one who loaded the cartridge and it was carried in their later catalogs up to World War I, but did re-appear the war.                                                                                                                                                                                                                         Remington listed the 46 Extra Long as being loaded with 305-grain bullet and 57 grains of black-powder. There apparently was never a smokeless loading. It would have been somewhat more powerful than the 46 Long and a better short-range deer cartridge. None of the 46-caliber rifle cartridges enjoyed a reputation for great accuracy.

To calculate the vigour of the members here. Because I was in the start told by a member to share something about guns too, as this is PakGuns after all... So I said OK, I will do exactly that, just as soon as I figure out the true spirit of everyone over here. As I''m not going to share my experiences and techniques about gunsmithing (which took a lifetime for me to acquire), so easily with people i have just come into contact with...\n \nYou see people, I never start a conversation, the multiple ends of which I haven''t already figured out beforehand. So I put forward the idea of a Presidential Award for these lifeguards, as they sure are worthy of it! And I asked if anybody over here knew anything about the mechanism through which such awards are given.\n\nTruth is that I had already known about the process (before I posted this thread). It actually look a 3 minute search with Google, and I came upon this page:\n\n[URL]http://www.pakdocs.com/honours-and-awards-policy/[/URL]\n\nSo the story of these lifeguards can easily be forwarded to anyone of our newly elected parliamentarians and senators. Furthermore, it can be directly sent to the Prime Minster even (for review) - Just go to this page, as the PM''s office too is today just a phone call away.\n\n[URL]http://www.findpk.com/yp/html/Government_Telephone_Directory.html[/URL]\n\nSo all this in total took just 5 to 7 minutes of searching with Google. But did anyone over here even try???\n\nTo conclude this thread, I would now just like to mention something which our [B]Dr. A. Q. Khan[/B] himself wrote in one of his articles. [B]When little stories are big Random thoughts[/B], published on 31st May 2010.\n\nRead the full article here: [URL]http://draqkhan.com.pk/?p=937[/URL]\n\n[B]" [/B][I]The obstacle in our path.\n[/I][I]\nIn ancient times, a king had a boulder placed on a roadway. Then he hid himself and watched to see if anyone would remove the huge rock. Some of the king&#8217;s wealthiest merchants and courtiers came by and simply walked around it. Many loudly blamed the king for not keeping the roads clear, but none did anything about getting the stone out of the way. Then a peasant came along, carrying a load of vegetables. Upon approaching the boulder, the peasant laid down his burden and tried to move the stone to the side of the road. After much pushing and straining, he finally succeeded. After the peasant picket up his load of vegetables, he noticed a purse lying in the road where the boulder had been. The purse contained many gold coins and a note from the king indicating that the gold was for the person who removed the boulder from the roadway. The peasant learned what many of us never understand. Every obstacle presents an opportunity to improve our condition!\n[/I]\n[I](In 1976, when we were acquiring the site for the nuclear plant, we used to go to Kahuta regularly, park the army jeep at the entrance, where Gate No 1 now is, and walk to wherever work was going on. There were no roads there at the time, only footpaths through the fields. Like the king in the story, which I did not know until then, I wanted to test people and placed a big stone right in the middle of the main path. For three or four weeks nobody removed the stone and a new path was forming around it. I then removed the stone myself, remarking to Gen Zahid Ali Akbar, then a brigadier who was in charge of civil works, that this clearly illustrated the calibre of the people we had to work with to make an atom bomb. If I had read the story, I might have thought of putting a wallet with some money under the stone.)[/I] [B]"[/B]', ''),

(533105, '.22 &amp; .25 Cartridges Yesterday I added these little darlings to my collection. The .22LR is for size and dimension reference. \n[ATTACH=CONFIG]21866[/ATTACH]\n\n[B][U].22 Hornet [/U][/B]\nThe .22 Hornet is a vermin, small-game and predator centerfire rifle cartridge. This makes it hand loadable and reloadable, and thus much more versatile. It was the smallest commercially available .22 caliber centerfire cartridge until the introduction of the FN 5.7x28mm. The Hornet''s virtual absence of recoil has made it even quite popular among deer hunters in some areas, although it is generally regarded as very underpowered for deer unless bullet placement is absolutely precise. Many jurisdictions such as the Netherlands, the UK and some states in the USA currently prohibit the Hornet for use on deer.\n[B][U]\n.22 High Power (5.6 x 52R)[/U][/B]\nThe 5.6x52R cartridge was created by Charles Newton and produced by Savage Arms in 1912. It is also known as the .22 Savage High-Power and .22 "Imp", and is based upon the .25-35 Winchester cartridge necked down to accept a .227in/.228in diameter bullet.\nIts inherent accuracy, relatively high velocity and "shocking" power led to an initial surge of popularity, and the "Imp" was attributed with almost magical killing powers even on large and dangerous soft-skinned game such as tigers. However, following a well-publicized spate of fatalities and severe injuries among big game hunters who had merely wounded their quarry with the "Imp''s" small, speedy bullets, the cartridge rapidly fell out of favor with safari and deer hunters.\n[B][U]\n.25 Remington (UMC-Union Metallic Co)[/U][/B]\nThe .25 Remington (also known as the .25 Remington Auto-Loading) is an American rifle cartridge. A rimless, smokeless powder design, this cartridge was considered to be very accurate by firearm experts and suitable for game up to deer and black bear. The .25 Remington cartridge dates back to 1906 with its introduction by Remington in the Model 8 rifle. Other rifles chambered for the .25 Remington include the Remington 14 slide-action, Remington 30 bolt action, Stevens 425 lever-action, and Standard Arms rifles.\n[B][U]\n.256 W.M- Winchester Magnum [/U][/B]\nThe .256 Winchester Magnum was a firearms cartridge produced by necking-down a .357 Magnum cartridge to .257 diameter. It was introduced in 1960 and designed for shooting small game and varmints. The cartridge was first chambered in the Ruger Hawkeye single shot pistol.\n \n[B][U].25-20 WCF- Winchester Centerfire[/U][/B]\nThe .25-20 Winchester, or WCF (Winchester Centerfire) was developed in 1895 for the Winchester Model 1892 lever action rifle. In the early 20[SUP]th[/SUP] century, it was a popular big game and varmint round, developing around 1460 ft/s with 86 grain bullets. It was easy and economical to reload, and was once a favorite with farmers, ranchers, pot hunters and trappers. Though the .25-20 has been used on deer and even claimed a whitetail deer of long standing record in 1914, its use on large-bodied game is not advised due to its sedate ballistics and light bullet construction, which makes humane one-shot kills unlikely.', ''),

(533108, ' Thanks, Ameer and AK47 for your comments. \r\nThe two adjustments are: one the distance on the trigger has to travel to fire from start and the other is the distance it takes to reset the trigger for followup shot. Both adjustments can be set for longer or shortner distances. I''m amazed as to the performance of the kit. It is extremetly good. BTW, for those who want a heavier trigger pull (factory settings)  can have it with the heavier spring. But then you ask; why change if i prefer the factory settings??? Well although you retain the factory 5.5lbs trigger; you get a very crispy trigger along with a very high performance mechanism and balance to assist with followup shot.

An experimental Thompson submachine gun was also made to fire .351SL in 1919, but was never produced commercially.\n[B][U]\n.300 Savage [/U][/B]\nThe .300 Savage cartridge is a rimless, .30 caliber rifle cartridge developed by the Savage Arms Company in 1920 for their popular Savage Model 99 lever-action rifle. Despite having a short case and a rather stumpy neck, the cartridge is capable of propelling a 150-grain (9.7 g) bullet at over 2,600 ft/s (790 m/s) with an effective killing range of over 300 yd (270 m).\n[B][U]\n.280 Flanged Nitro Express Jacketed Hollow Point -160 grn[/U][/B]\nThe .280 Flanged (rimmed) also called the 280 Lancaster (for the designer) was introduced in 1906. The .280 was meant for single shot and double barreled sporting rifles. It was one of the first successful modern high velocity small bore cartridges, and enjoyed a considerable, if brief vogue as a hunting round in the years before the First World War. It initially gained its reputation because of its evident ''knock-down'' effect on thin skinned game, but this began to sour when it was used on more dangerous game, which, if not killed outright, on occasion turned on the hunter with fatal results. Within its limitations, it was a very good cartridge.\n[B][U]\n.375 Flanged Magnum Kynoch 300 grn[/U][/B]\nThe .375 Flanged Magnum is also known as the .375 H&H Flanged Magnum and the .375 Flanged Nitro Express. \n[U]Technical Information[/U]\n·         Bullet Weight: 300 Grains\n·         Bullet Style: Woodleigh Weldcore Solid\n·         Case Type: Brass\n[U]Ballistics Information:[/U] \n·         Muzzle Velocity: 2425 fps\n·         Muzzle Energy: 3930 ft. lbs.', ''),

(533178, 'Baikal MP442 (8 round) review Baikal MP442 is perhaps the best concealed carry weapon available in  Pakistan. Having Russian origin, it''s design has the history of  reliability and ruggedness. The gun is available in two versions: one  accomodates single stack magazine housing 8 rounds and second  accomodates double stack magazine with the capacity of 12 rounds.\n\n[B]12-round vs 8-round version: [/B]\nAs I was looking for a conceal carry weapon, I opted for the 8-round  version because it''s dimensions are equal to Makarov PM (the official  sidearm of Russian army). The 12-rounder is wider and longer than the  8-round model.\n[CENTER] [URL="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-WwqTJVDsbAc/Ub7unkWr2tI/AAAAAAAAAS4/nGgqBmTOQ-Q/s1600/makarov+(3).jpg"][IMG]http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-WwqTJVDsbAc/Ub7unkWr2tI/AAAAAAAAAS4/nGgqBmTOQ-Q/s640/makarov+(3).jpg[/IMG][/URL][/CENTER]\n Baikal MP 442 comes in a plastic box. The package contains one gun, two magazines, one cleaning rod and a user''s manual.\n\nSpecifications:\n[B]Cartridge: [/B]9mm*18mm (9mm Makarov)\n[B]Action: [/B]Single action/ double action.\n[B]Safety: [/B]One safety button on the left side of the slide does  three functions (Blocks firing pin, decocks the hammer, and locks the  slide and the trigger)\n[B]Dimensions: [/B]161x127x30.5 (mm)\n[B]Barrel length:[/B] 93.5 mm\n[B]Sights: [/B]Fixed\n[B]Weight: [/B]0.73gms\n[B]Operation: [/B]Blow back \n\n[CENTER] [URL="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-rIiy4a4Me4Q/Ub7woDeOqQI/AAAAAAAAATI/ICsvLS4AvWE/s1600/makarov1.jpg"][IMG]http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-rIiy4a4Me4Q/Ub7woDeOqQI/AAAAAAAAATI/ICsvLS4AvWE/s640/makarov1.jpg[/IMG][/URL][/CENTER]\n \nUpon unboxing, the controls were found to be a bit stiff. The safety was  really hard to move and double action was not working at all. The  hammer would go rearward but would not break. I did the complete  dis-assembly of the gun, cleaned the factory lubricant and oiled the gun  lightly. I assisted the rearward motion of the hammer with my thumb a  couple of times and it was breaking crisp. The built quality is very  strong, the bluing was good, and the plastic grip is below average.\n[CENTER] [URL="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-yxnAc1hKEkI/Ub7yZNiuf7I/AAAAAAAAATY/5gDEF6K62NM/s1600/baikal+dis+assembly.jpg"][IMG]http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-yxnAc1hKEkI/Ub7yZNiuf7I/AAAAAAAAATY/5gDEF6K62NM/s640/baikal+dis+assembly.jpg[/IMG][/URL][/CENTER]\n \nI have a habit of dis-assembling my gun to bits. It has three benefits.\n[LIST=1]\n[*]You understand how your gun works,\n[*]You get to appreciate the design and manufacturing of the internal parts.\n[*]And you always learn new things.\n[/LIST] The dis-assembly is so easy that even a child would do that.\nLike all Russian guns, Baikal MP442 has an exceptional design.\nThe gun has very few parts. Of which two pronged leaf spring is most  amazing. The spring has three purposes: it gives support to trigger,  hammer and serves as a catch for magazine. I told my friend about the  amazing spring design and he joked,[INDENT] [B][I]"Had the gun inventor consumed one bottle less than his daily dose  of vodka, he would have found a way to use the leaf spring for managing  recoil as well."[/I][/B][/INDENT]\n[CENTER] [URL="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-p88xxFc8iLQ/Ub70hp6iLDI/AAAAAAAAATo/e5xFIasGimo/s1600/makarov+(2).jpg"][IMG]http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-p88xxFc8iLQ/Ub70hp6iLDI/AAAAAAAAATo/e5xFIasGimo/s640/makarov+(2).jpg[/IMG][/URL][/CENTER]\n  The magazines have thumb loading notches on them to ease the ammunition  loading. The gun is as small and as accurate as a conceal carry gun  should be. I highly recommend it for anyone who wants to have a good  conceal carry gun in a decent price.\\\n\n[URL]http://gondals.blogspot.com/2013/06/baikal-mp442-review.html[/URL]', ''),

I am not new to guns i have been shooting 12 gauge shotguns and have a Hatson magnum combo. I have however no experience of any handgun i just got my new license and am looking for my first 9mm. i have about 80K to put into a gun and i have narrowed down my choices to the following.\n\nTaurus 24/7 G2 - 70 K\nTaurus 809E - 70K\nCZ 75 P07 - 85K \n\nI really like the Taurus safety features the decocker, saftey and Taurus lock. I think i would use those until i got familiar and comfortable with the gun. Both 24/7 and 809 are based on the 24/7 OSS the only difference being 809 being hammer and G2 being striker fired. The G2 also has a Glock like trigger safety and adjustable sights. \n\nI like the feel of both the Taurus models and especially like the memory pads where fingers can be placed. The CZ also feels nice in the hands but i could not find a NIB in the market the quote above was provided by PARA and he says he will be getting stock next month. i found one used one and the dealer is asking 95K for it.\n\nAny advice would be welcome.\n\nThanks guys and this is my first post on Pak Guns i have been reading the forums for a few months now.', ''),

Try to practice [B]at or below 10x zoom[/B] because the higher zoom will not only magnify the subject but also the slightest movement of your hands/body. Also it pretty much renders quick target acquisition next to impossible. I do not go beyond 10x zoom even on 70-100 yards.\n\n1 more reason not to go max on zoom is that if you are using a mil-dot scope, your mil-dot estimation, and hence the accuracy will suffer. Greater than 10x zoom shifts the point of impact esp in non FFP (fixed focal plane) scopes in which the cross hair (reticle) is made of a brass wire.', ''),

See the market in Pakistan is very different, internationally there are more options available in poly handguns, the Walters, xd''s, m&p etc. which are all quite reliable, but given a choice I would always opt for a glock or hk depending on striker/hammer requirement simply coz they have been in the market for a very long time and have proven their worth. But here I simply refuse to buy at the ridiculous pricing, I''d rather buy an all metal handgun which is equally reliable, like Cz or a browning. The beretta and sig also make it to my list of top handguns but they too are grossly over priced....But leaving aside price, all of mentioned handguns are probably the best handguns ever made.\r\n\r\nRegards.', ''),

It is the next generation of the CZ handgun family. The Omega trigger system simplifies the CZ 75 trigger system, uses fewer parts and improves the trigger pull. The polymer frame design of the Duty and a sleek slide profile reduces weight, making the P-07 Duty a great choice for concealed carry. It has amazing grip angle with a bit aggressive grip so fits perfectly.With a slim profile can house 16 rounds of 9mm. Has a rail system for mounting light/laser.The pistol was origionally designed for law enforcement but now has been offered to lawabiding citizens of the country.\nIt is just a great Gun and very reliable.\nPosted by SULTAN.

Some posts i have read also suggest getting an all steel gun just for minimal recoil and better accuracy.[/QUOTE]\n\n\nBro..just get what feels right in your hand... trust me, many of us had striker fired pistols as their first hand guns and without any decocker or manual safety... the best safety is you yourself and always stick to the 5 basics of gun handling..

(533723, ' Salam All,\n@op, bro lemme put it this way.... if u''re concerned abt safety ''options'' and want a Taurus then the only gun worth its money is the pt92/99. If its just safety, then the cz 75 is as safe as a taurus but lacks a decocker. Both compared, the cz75 is more robust, reliable, accurate and much more ergonomic than the pt92/99. Both r GREAT handguns, choosing anyone of these would be understandable :)\nIncreasing u''re budget for a p01 would also be good, but the feel of an all steel(75b) is completely different than a alloy framed(p01) handgun.\n\nIf its polymer u want, then I''d suggest u go for the duty. As far as taurus poly''s are concerned, they are just OK guns in my opinion, whereas the duty is a GOOD gun.\n\nPlease note the use of the words GREAT, GOOD and OK..... :D\n\nRegards.', ''),

(533734, ' [QUOTE=Rana Naeem Ahmad;371659]dear zia raza bhai a.o.a,will u plz suggest me about now a days price of vepr 12 ?what is difference between saiga 12 & vepr 12 & which gun is more reliable.waiting for ur response.regards[/QUOTE]\n\nThe saiga is based off of the AKM (ak47) and the VEPR is based off of a RPK.(ak74).\nFirst of all Saiga-12c exp 01 is not the right model which you could compare with Vepr-12 correctly. You have to compare it with Saiga-12-030 or Saiga-12-040, Saiga-12&#1057;-EXP-01-030. in my personal opinion we compare only the cheapest and ugliest versions of Saiga-12 (that versions of Saiga-12 is not very popular in Russia)with vepr12.\n\nUpto my information Vepr-12 and Saiga-12-030/040 both were made under the same order form Special Forces of Russian Army and Police so they have interchangeable magazines that fits both, gas block without gas plug, non removable dust cover with Picatinny. Both Molot Vepr-12 and IZMASH Saiga-12-030 ware made for Law enforcement and Military use and later was adopted to civil market use. In many details Saiga-12-030 and Vepr-12 are completely different due to productions was adapted to AKM production line (IZMASH) and RPK production line (Molot).\n\nHence, we can differenciate saiga 030 and 040 as, saiga 030 is automatic gas adjustment mechanism and shorter sight radius, whereas 040 has manual adjustment for light and heavy loads i.e birdshot and buck/slug with a longer sight radius..\n\nFew noticed differences \n\n1) The RPK receiver is heavier and stronger then AKM receiver, so thickness of the receiver on Vepr-12 more than on Saiga-12-030/040....\n\n\n2) The technology of barrel production of Vepr-12 and Saiga-12 is also different, Molot use rotary forging during production and IZMASH use boring and their barrels have less resource and quality...\n(You can notice it when u shoot slug, sg/lg and see after marks in barrel, it tells u hardness of chromed)...\n\n3) The barrel walls of Vepr-12 are thicker than of Saiga-12....\n\n\n4) The inner diameter of the Vepr-12''s bore is 18.5mm, when Saiga-12 is 18.3mm....\n\n\n5) The different folding stock mechanism as well as stocks are little bit different (SVD-style)...\n\n\n6) Vepr-12 is heavier then Saiga-12...\n\n\n7) Both saiga and vepr have LRBHO (last round bolt hold open option), and both model i am discussing have mag well...\n\n\n8) Vepr-12 has different safety selector then Saiga-12-030/040... Vepr''s latch can also be operated by thumb...\n\n\n9) Vepr-12 has different gas tube, and AKM upper and low hand guard doesn''t fit Vepr-12 (only from RPK).\n\n10) saiga have rails on dustcover and a small one at lower hand guard, where as vepr''s dustcover and upper and lower handguard is allover covered with rails (altogether 6rails (includes small, med, large)\n\nrest if i am left with any seniors can add it\n\nNow my person liking, though vepr is some what u can say is lil bit better built, but still i like shooting saiga, because of its manual adjustment option.if once u get perfection in setting gas mechanism this option allows u to set minimum and maximum recoil (depending on mood and usage), saiga has tight barrel so reult in tight group, it fits me better... Well the one last thing i dont like about vepr is if u mix heavy and light loads it tends to jam, then i say wats the use of auto adjustment gas module, when in both cases u can fire same loads, either heavy or light.. \nWell i have fired few models of saiga ie. saiga12s, saiga 12c, 12c -exp-01, 030, exp0030, saiga 12k 0040-02, 040-04,0401 exp-01, both in wodden furniture and synthatic furniture...\nthe exp is for export models.. The difference in normal and export version is, the normal version only fires with its butt opened and if u have to fold the stock u, first have to lock the gun, then fold it by pressing the button. once fold, then lock gets stucked and dont open untill one opens the butt.. If force is applied it destroys the lock and trigger assembly and have to be taken to gunsmith.\nwhearas export version has no conection between folding stock and locking mechanism.. \nThis differenciation is due to russian civilian arms law.\n\nand in vepr i had fired only 2 model my own which was imported in 2012 with removable flasher and other one was with shortened barrel and fixed flasher ..\n\npardon my spelling mistakes and grammatical mistakes, and correct me,coz english is not my mother tongue, and am not good at writing details..\n [ATTACH=CONFIG]21960[/ATTACH]\n\nRecently i am after choke adapter for saiga, which allows chokes to be used on ordinary saiga.. It basically replaced by flasher, the adapter tube furtger have inner threads on other end which support chokes.. Well i myself has seen it only once, the guy was using it at range, with 23inch barrel and it looked like hunting model\n\nRegarding prices i believe both have same prices, but in khi dealers have given alot of hype to vepr''s quality and thus over charging alot...Hope this helps,', ''),

I was thinking of getting a new darra weapon, either the clone of beretta 92f or zigana F. which will cost me around 30k. I need you guys to help me decide what to do?

(533796, ' I think the "jumping around" phenomenon is due to two things: the grip of the gun (angle and size) and how you grip the gun yourself.\n\nThe grip angle of the TP-9 is fairly "straight", so to speak; this in turn, along with the changeable backstraps to fully accommodate the size of your hand, allow you to have a better purchase on the gun.\n\nAlthough the grip angle of the Caracal isn''t as extreme as that of the Glock per say, it is still slightly more slanted as compared to the TP-9. As a point of example, if you ever hold a 1911 in one hand and a Glock in the other, you''ll immediately realize that the shallower the grip angle, the easier it is to employ a sturdy two-hand grip. The extreme grip angle of the Glock (which is near identical to the grip angle of the P08 Luger) is actually ideal for [B]single-hand[/B] shooting; for using both hands, one needs to cant or rotate the wrists forward in order to line up the lights on to the target. The opposite is true for a 1911 (or any other gun with a relatively shallow grip angle, like the TP-9).\n\nThe grip angle, in turn, influences how we grip the gun; where does the thumb of the support hand rests, where does the base of the support hand''s palm rests on the gun''s grip, and so on. Hence, it is extremely important to first get a "feel" of the gun before you purchase it; if the gun doesn''t "feel" right or doesn''t sit in your hands perfectly, then it will [B]definitely[/B] jump around when discharged.\n\nI personally like guns with a shallow grip angle (metal CZ''s fit my hands the best, followed very closely by the 1911) and, therefore, I am able to manage the recoil easily as well.', ''),

(533809, ' pasting you an analysis I did of Caracal in one of the older posts\n\n[B]Pros:\nAn extremely crisp trigger without any creep (4 pound constant trigger as compared to a 5.5 pound Glock trigger). Without any bias, IMHO, this gun has the most crisp trigger as compared to all of the above mentioned\n\nLow Bore Axis: which results in extremely low recoil and excellent for follow up shots. Again amongst all the above mentioned, this gun recoils the least\n\nExtremely Accurate and this is not just a personal observation. Almost all those who have shot with a Caracal F agree upon this.\n\nThis point is probably an extension to the point mentioned above. Caracal Fs come with a 4.1 inch barrel which is longer than most of the regular handguns. However Pt92s come with a 5 inch Barrel.... a longer barrel results in more accuracy and range but any weapon with too long a barrel might become problem to conceal\n\nThe gun is Polymer made and weights only 750 grams as compared to its counter Rival Glock 17 which weights 650 grams.. However all of the above mentioned handguns weigh more than Caracal.\n\nCaracal has extremly slim profile (Even slimmer than Glocks) which again makes them comparatively easier to conceal\n\nThe Full size Caracal F is slightly shorter than the Full size Glock 17 and just slightly longer than the Sub Compact Glock 19 which again supports in its Conceal\n\nCaracal F holds 18 Rounds, None of the above mentioned guns including Glocks hold that much fire power\n\nA Torture test was conducted by Armi on Caracal Fs. They shot 5000 rounds within 92 minutes through this gun without any failures. Further our very own Cheif conducted a torture test on this weapon as well. You can check out the Caracal Club or directly Youtube to find links of both.\n\nThis handgun was designed by Wilhelm Bubits who at one time was part of the Glock team and later joined Steyr to develop models M and S with them and Caracal F is his final design\n\nCaracal F holds 3 extremely tough and stringent certifications which only a few handgun manufactures such as Glock or Sig hold. Again you can check out the details of these on their website\n\n\n\n[B]Cons:\nThis gun is not for you if you don''t handle it like a professional. It comes without any Manual Safety. However it does have the 3 Safeties which are Trigger Safety, Drop safety and firing pin safety. But if you pull the trigger on a cocked gun, it''s gona shoot and ain''t nothing gona stop it..\n\nThere has been an optional recall called on Caracal F''s due to doubt in drop safety functionality. You can read details on their website\n\nThis gun comes with 2 sight Options. Quick sight (QS) and Straight 8 or 2 dot sights. The QS are excellent for short range follow up shots but do not have satisfactory results with slightly increased distances so no fun at the range. Straight 8s or 2 Dot sights are excellent sights but they may require some time getting used to[/B][/B]', ''),

(533839, ' [QUOTE=Ahnab;371806]I think the "jumping around" phenomenon is due to two things: the grip of the gun (angle and size) and how you grip the gun yourself.\n\nThe grip angle of the TP-9 is fairly "straight", so to speak; this in turn, along with the changeable backstraps to fully accommodate the size of your hand, allow you to have a better purchase on the gun.\n\nAlthough the grip angle of the Caracal isn''t as extreme as that of the Glock per say, it is still slightly more slanted as compared to the TP-9. As a point of example, if you ever hold a 1911 in one hand and a Glock in the other, you''ll immediately realize that the shallower the grip angle, the easier it is to employ a sturdy two-hand grip. The extreme grip angle of the Glock (which is near identical to the grip angle of the P08 Luger) is actually ideal for [B]single-hand[/B] shooting; for using both hands, one needs to cant or rotate the wrists forward in order to line up the lights on to the target. The opposite is true for a 1911 (or any other gun with a relatively shallow grip angle, like the TP-9).\n\nThe grip angle, in turn, influences how we grip the gun; where does the thumb of the support hand rests, where does the base of the support hand''s palm rests on the gun''s grip, and so on. Hence, it is extremely important to first get a "feel" of the gun before you purchase it; if the gun doesn''t "feel" right or doesn''t sit in your hands perfectly, then it will [B]definitely[/B] jump around when discharged.\n\nI personally like guns with a shallow grip angle (metal CZ''s fit my hands the best, followed very closely by the 1911) and, therefore, I am able to manage the recoil easily as well.[/QUOTE]\n\nCheers Ahnab, makes perfect sense! glad i spent a lot of time "feeling up" various hardware (damn, that don''t sound right at all!)...\n\nanyhow, the TP9 felt just about right, which is why i am enjoying it and absolutely comfortable carrying and handling it too :)\n\nthe second thing that felt right was the Taurus 709 Slim G2 and the Steyr M9-A1 (a friend''s) maybe when someday i''m richer, I''ll get me a Steyr :D\n\ntill then lemme save up for a 709 for CC ;)\n\nHopefully as I learn and develop, I''ll grow to handle other guns as well too', ''),

It''s not something you want to shoot all day, but you can get used to it because the recoil is more of a shove rather than snappy.\nWhile Ive never shot a 12 bore pistol, Im sure it would be even more challenging and would kick even harder than the S&W (which is already much more powerful than a Deagle in 50 AE).

I would recommend you to go for CZ P07- Duty. I had a SC for last two year but liked CZ more. I don''t know it is only with me but i never felt contended with SC (Though this gun is excellent). Where as in case, when i fired first round from DUTY, i was straight away in love with this handgun. \n\nI am not a professional shooter, just an average hobby-keeper sort of person but believe me i achieved unbelievable targets with this pistol, e.g. 5/5 from 10 meters in 1 Sq.in Target or 5/5 from 15 meters in 2 Sq.in Target.\n\nThe feel, grip and overall handling is also near perfect. Sights are solid and easy to shoot(glock type). Dissembling is easy, though i don''t like its spring much. \n\nIt comes either with de-cocker or safety lock. Good for conceal carry. One more beautiful feature is its trigger.. 100/100 points. it is called Omega Trigger System from CZ. Pull is feather light on SA and quite manageable on DA. \n\nOverall, it is a reliable weapon to keep as CCW, SD or HD.', ''),

(534014, ' [QUOTE=zia raza;371744]The saiga is based off of the AKM (ak47) and the VEPR is based off of a RPK.(ak74).\r\nFirst of all Saiga-12c exp 01 is not the right model which you could compare with Vepr-12 correctly. You have to compare it with Saiga-12-030 or Saiga-12-040, Saiga-12&#1057;-EXP-01-030. in my personal opinion we compare only the cheapest and ugliest versions of Saiga-12 (that versions of Saiga-12 is not very popular in Russia)with vepr12.\r\n\r\nUpto my information Vepr-12 and Saiga-12-030/040 both were made under the same order form Special Forces of Russian Army and Police so they have interchangeable magazines that fits both, gas block without gas plug, non removable dust cover with Picatinny. Both Molot Vepr-12 and IZMASH Saiga-12-030 ware made for Law enforcement and Military use and later was adopted to civil market use. In many details Saiga-12-030 and Vepr-12 are completely different due to productions was adapted to AKM production line (IZMASH) and RPK production line (Molot).\r\n\r\nHence, we can differenciate saiga 030 and 040 as, saiga 030 is automatic gas adjustment mechanism and shorter sight radius, whereas 040 has manual adjustment for light and heavy loads i.e birdshot and buck/slug with a longer sight radius..\r\n\r\nFew noticed differences \r\n\r\n1) The RPK receiver is heavier and stronger then AKM receiver, so thickness of the receiver on Vepr-12 more than on Saiga-12-030/040....\r\n\r\n\r\n2) The technology of barrel production of Vepr-12 and Saiga-12 is also different, Molot use rotary forging during production and IZMASH use boring and their barrels have less resource and quality...\r\n(You can notice it when u shoot slug, sg/lg and see after marks in barrel, it tells u hardness of chromed)...\r\n\r\n3) The barrel walls of Vepr-12 are thicker than of Saiga-12....\r\n\r\n\r\n4) The inner diameter of the Vepr-12''s bore is 18.5mm, when Saiga-12 is 18.3mm....\r\n\r\n\r\n5) The different folding stock mechanism as well as stocks are little bit different (SVD-style)...\r\n\r\n\r\n6) Vepr-12 is heavier then Saiga-12...\r\n\r\n\r\n7) Both saiga and vepr have LRBHO (last round bolt hold open option), and both model i am discussing have mag well...\r\n\r\n\r\n8) Vepr-12 has different safety selector then Saiga-12-030/040... Vepr''s latch can also be operated by thumb...\r\n\r\n\r\n9) Vepr-12 has different gas tube, and AKM upper and low hand guard doesn''t fit Vepr-12 (only from RPK).\r\n\r\n10) saiga have rails on dustcover and a small one at lower hand guard, where as vepr''s dustcover and upper and lower handguard is allover covered with rails (altogether 6rails (includes small, med, large)\r\n\r\nrest if i am left with any seniors can add it\r\n\r\nNow my person liking, though vepr is some what u can say is lil bit better built, but still i like shooting saiga, because of its manual adjustment option.if once u get perfection in setting gas mechanism this option allows u to set minimum and maximum recoil (depending on mood and usage), saiga has tight barrel so reult in tight group, it fits me better... Well the one last thing i dont like about vepr is if u mix heavy and light loads it tends to jam, then i say wats the use of auto adjustment gas module, when in both cases u can fire same loads, either heavy or light.. \r\nWell i have fired few models of saiga ie. saiga12s, saiga 12c, 12c -exp-01, 030, exp0030, saiga 12k 0040-02, 040-04,0401 exp-01, both in wodden furniture and synthatic furniture...\r\nthe exp is for export models.. The difference in normal and export version is, the normal version only fires with its butt opened and if u have to fold the stock u, first have to lock the gun, then fold it by pressing the button. once fold, then lock gets stucked and dont open untill one opens the butt.. If force is applied it destroys the lock and trigger assembly and have to be taken to gunsmith.\r\nwhearas export version has no conection between folding stock and locking mechanism.. \r\nThis differenciation is due to russian civilian arms law.\r\n\r\nand in vepr i had fired only 2 model my own which was imported in 2012 with removable flasher and other one was with shortened barrel and fixed flasher ..\r\n\r\npardon my spelling mistakes and grammatical mistakes, and correct me,coz english is not my mother tongue, and am not good at writing details..\r\n\r\nRecently i am after choke adapter for saiga, which allows chokes to be used on ordinary saiga.. It basically replaced by flasher, the adapter tube furtger have inner threads on other end which support chokes.. Well i myself has seen it only once, the guy was using it at range, with 23inch barrel and it looked like hunting model\r\n\r\nRegarding prices i believe both have same prices, but in khi dealers have given alot of hype to vepr''s quality and thus over charging alot...Hope this helps,[/QUOTE]\r\n\r\nZia Raza, I would rather say that you have a strong communication with good hold over language.

Treble, you said it''s 2" low but didnt mention at what distance. You might try taking a point of aim hold, rather than the traditional 6 o''clock hold most people typically use. But if you''re not comfortable with that, you can always install an adjustable rear sight. But there are instances where an adjustable rear still lacks enough elevation change to correct the issue. In which case you''ll have to change the height of your front sight. Use this formula to determine the amount of change required...\n\n[SIZE=3][B]sight radius X impact distance / target distance = height change[/B][/SIZE]\n\nFirst, convert all values to inches. The sight radius on a G34 is 7.56" It''s stock front sight height is 0.165" (refers to exposed blade portion only when discussing sight height). Impact distance is how far youre off from point of aim, and target distance is how far you are from the point of impact. If you are shooting low, you will have to decrease front sight by the calculated amount.\nAnyways, hope that helps!\n\nOn a side note, none of the G34''s I''ve ever had nor G17L''s came standard with adjustable sights, so I wouldn''t be too concerned if yours doesnt have them.', ''),

Yes, that mousetrap video of mine - See link below... :bounce:\n[URL]https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CaysEyaiv0I[/URL]\n\nI had actually made that to enter into a video competition of Focus Forward Films, where the first prize was a 100,000 US$! The theme (by creating a short video) was to feature an invention which had the greatest impact on human civilization. And since the mousetrap is really the most frequent invention filed in the patent offices worldwide - It seems liked the obvious choice. So when combined with my own AutoCAD skills, it made for a great video!!!\n\nSee this link to know a bit more about the competition:\n[URL]https://vimeo.com/34468561[/URL]\n\nBut guess what, all the judges were so [B]*Bad''zauk*[/B] by nature, that they awarded prizes to videos which had a [B]*roti-dhoti*[/B] sob-story kind of a theme (like the invention of prosthetic limbs)... And so my efforts were not even considered worthy of being in the top 100... Somehow, I feel that it was due to discrimination (since I am a Pakistani). They of course favored an Indian, partly because he also had a [B]*roti-dhoti*[/B] theme, but mainly because (I feel) he was not from a Muslim country...\n\nOf course, had I showed something like extreme poverty, or some other type of extreme injustice (like throwing acid on the faces of women). And also featured some cry-baby lawyer too, who''d be fighting a constant uphill battle with no end in sight - Then I too could have easily won an Oscar Award... Another shortcut to success is to write a controversial article or a book (preferably bordering on blasphemy), and then hire some goons to do some firing at your own house - After which you then go seek asylum somewhere in Scandinavia or EU. And so in the process also get interviewed by CNN and BBC too!\n\nBut somehow, I decided not to tarnish the image of my own nation - As I really do owe a lot to Pakistan. So instead I just have fun with my YouTube account (as video making is just a hobby of mine). However yes, I too have been offered to participate in making something horrible, the offer actually came from Israel (when I traced the IP number). It came at a time when my account had crossed 200,000 views - So I guess that''s when it caught the attention of their "talent scouts".

(534662, ' @ Kashi! Bro! My advice is to get your money back asap. For your information, the procedure for MOI is:\n1. On your application, MOI issue an Approval Letter addressing to NADRA.\n2. After Receipt of Letter at NADRA (Take 2/3 Days), You submit application form at NADRA and NADRA issue you challan for deposit of Processing Fee at Naional Bank of Pakistan. After which form along with challan is submitted at NADRA.\n3. NADRA issue you a Demand Note (Ahhhh: don''t ask for time line, heard it takes 21 to 45 days).\n4. After Receipt of DN, you buy weapon from dealer and get it register with DCO.\n5. After that Demand Note is deposited back at NADRA.\n6. After 14 days, you will get Card License along with Supplimentary Document (One Page Document).\n\n\nThe dealer provides you the Demand Note on which you buy weapon. The rest is handled by dealer. For confirmation that your license is genuine, ask dealer to provide you copy of Approval Letter, Challan Form and Receipt. Best is to get the receipt after re-submission of DN (after purchase of weapon) and receive the card by yourself from NADRA. It will eliminate chance of any foul play.', ''),

It''s gonna take a bit more than sand and carpet to make a bullet trap. What actually catches the bullet is lead. Steel plating goes behind it as reinforcement (at least 1/4" if you''re only testing 22''s, at least 1/2" for 9mm). You can use an empty drum to hold all that and then throw some sand on top. If you want to suppress sound, I''d go professionally made. But it''s up to you if you want to stick your hand in a homemade can with a bullet riccocheting around in it. Otherwise, you can pretty much count on making enough noise to get your neighbor''s attention. Also keep in mind the issue of lead inhalation (from primer and vaporisation of bullet when gunpowder goes off) when shooting in an enclosed area with no ventilation. But again it''s upto you. It can be done but personally, unless someone is paying you to fix and test their gun in a limited amount of time, I''d wait to go to the range.', ''),

The frame is considered a low stress component. "Frame bulge" on CZ''s is strictly a cosmetic issue, with no effect on durability, reliability, nor accuracy. Ruger even uses all polymer frame rails on their P345 (in 45ACP!), and Beretta uses a polymer striker in their CX4. The locking block, slide, barrel, chamber, are the parts that are exposed to high impact, high pressure, high stress, and are thus always made out of steel. Even in metal Sigs, the frame is aluminum and the upper is steel. If the technology was available 100 years ago, all pistols would have had plastic frames for its advantages in low weight, ease of production, economy, and durability. That''s why the new models from HK, CZ, Glock, S&W, Sig, Caracal, FN, Keltec, Ruger, SA, and Beretta... are all polymer framed. Dont know if I like it, but RIA even makes a polymer framed 1911.', ''),

In this forum most of the fellows are recommending CZ999 but when I have read some international forums and top 10 9mm pistol list. I have found PT92/99 in 7th position around the world''s best 9mm pistols. I could not find CZ999 in any of the top 10 list and I could not understand it why.[/QUOTE]\nBro, seriously, if you are really deciding to buy a gun, do not put too much weight on these "Top 10" or "Best Of" lists. If you ask 10 people their opinion on what the best gun is , you can get 10 different answers. If you asked 20 people to recommend a gun, you''d probably get 50 different answers. However, those guns mentioned would probably include all the new models of the last two decades. The point is, it''s pretty hard to get a "bad" gun these days, and the reason why you get so many different answers is because not everyone has the exact same hand size, shape, strength, experience, or even eyesight. You obviously have a good number of recommendations, so if you are at the stage where you''re itching to spend some money, the best thing to do is to go hold, feel, fire if possible, otherwise dry fire, and look down the sights of the top choices in your mind. The most important thing with a gun is for [B]you[/B] to be comfortable. If you are not comfortable with its operation, safety, size, shape, weight, then even though its someone else''s number one, it may as well be a twenty one for you.... which means you either won''t shoot it very well, or youll end up not shooting it at all.', ''),

(535070, ' [QUOTE=babaz7;372929] has any pakgunner built this to test weapons?[/QUOTE]\n\nDear Babaz7,\nYes I have, and what I''ve got is very effective also (as I''m always tinkering with my gun endlessly) - But before I tell you anything, I first would like to know exactly how good are you at constructing things? Do you have any welding experience? If yes, then are you good at gas welding, or electric? Also, have you ever smelted lead from a used car battery? And cement masonry work - Do you have any personal experience in it?\n\nIf you say that you''ll hire people to get it done for you - Then like all other respected members of this forum, I too will tell you to just go to a shooting range instead of bothering with this kind of stuff. Seriously, this is not child''s play we are talking of here...\n\nAlso, when doing this indoors (as I too do not wish to annoy my neighbors) - You''ll need breathing, eye, and specially ear protection. Otherwise you''ll really live to regret it some time in the future. See this picture I just took. I have a very good goggle for eye safety, a gas mask to make sure that I don''t breath in any gunsmoke, thick leather gloves too (for added safety) - And most importantly, I use double ear protection. So first I put on ear plugs, on top of those I then wear heavy duty earmuffs! Otherwise I''d simply go deaf...\n\nSo only if you have some technical experience when it comes to constructing things (like knowing how to cut/shape steel with grinders and other machine tools, how to smelt metals like lead, and how to fix it all securely in cement), and are also well equipped with safety hardware - Is when I''ll explain how to build such a thing... And soundproofing a room where you''ll be doing this is a subject that I haven''t even touched yet!\n\nTherefore, like everyone else is suggesting here, please go to a shooting range instead. As in my opinion too, a shooting range is a safer and cheaper option for you. I just did this crazy thing because A, when I started this hobby, there weren''t many shooting ranges one could get easy access to (and I too was underaged). And B, I am (even today) most uncomfortable carrying a gun from one place to another (specially when section 144 is in effect). So that''s the only reason why I did it. And C, my experience with guns goes back to almost 3 decades (as I started when I was just 6 years old). So that''s why I was confidant that I''d do it correctly. And I so did - But anyone else PLEASE don''t try it unless you know exactly what you are doing. As even the slightest mistake can lead to a very serious accident...\n\nBy the way, you can buy all this safety equipment from any shop on Serai road (near the Khori Gardens area).\n\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]22076[/ATTACH]', ''),

(535267, ' [COLOR=#222222][FONT=Times][SIZE=4][FONT=arial]Hi Beretta, Leupold are obviously very high quality, the reason I was recommending Vortex is for their equal quality, options, and value. I don''t know how the pricing will translate in Pakistan, but all things being equal, I find Vortex to offer better value for an equivalent model. Also, I feel they offer more options for reticle types, illumination or not, adjustable eye relief, turret style... But what got me into them was that I was looking for a short to medium range optic solution. I ended up using a red dot with a 3x magnifier behind it. That way, with a quick disconnect mount I could twist the magnifier off for short range. Then my friend said Vortex has a 6x scope and when you turn it to 0 mag, you can use it like a red dot with unlimited eye relief and illuminated reticle. I forget the model now, but i checked it out and really wanted that setup. It was too late for that, but I was still looking for something long range and ended up getting a Viper Hs 6-24X50. Needless to say I was extremely impressed with its adjustability, build quality, and image clarity and brightness, so I''ve been singing their praises ever since. I also really like how Vortex organizes their model line up, Razor series is high end, Viper is medium high, Diamondback medium low, and Crossfires are lowmend models. I think Leupold has more variety, but their models always confuse me with their hunting line up, tactical, rimfire, VX... oh, and like Leupold, Vortex offers a transferable lifetime warranty. Also, Jerry Miculek, S&W''s world record holding shooter recommends them which is a nice vote of confidence. Anyways, I''ve used Bushnells, Nikon, and Leupold, but from now on as long as they have something that fits my needs, my first choice will be Vortex.[/FONT][/SIZE][/FONT][/COLOR]', ''),

First off, for optimum terminal ballistics, you want the bullet to retain as much weight as possible so it can do the most damage when it reaches the internals. The RIP bullet sheds its petals very early on (causing just flesh wounds) and only a small base is left to reach the target''s core. Secondly, the odd shape of the bullet has resulted in ftf''s in otherwise reliable guns.

If you ask 10 people their opinion on what the best gun is , you can get 10 different answers. If you asked 20 people to recommend a gun, you''d probably get 50 different answers. However, those guns mentioned would probably include all the new models of the last two decades. The point is, it''s pretty hard to get a "bad" gun these days, and the reason why you get so many different answers is because not everyone has the exact same hand size, shape, strength, experience, or even eyesight. You obviously have a good number of recommendations, so if you are at the stage where you''re itching to spend some money, the best thing to do is to go hold, feel, fire if possible, otherwise dry fire, and look down the sights of the top choices in your mind. The most important thing with a gun is for [B]you[/B] to be comfortable.

Specially when sealed in plastic (so the water cannot drain out due to gravity), in more or less the same size and shape as a red brick used in construction. So just stack up a few of those. You will of course need a plastic heat sealer that people use to plastic cover their books, (which you can from across the road, on the other side of M. A. Jinnah road, when going to Serai road or the road after that) - Do keep in mind that this wet foam brick can only be used for just a few times, but it is damn effective... \n\nBehind it of course, you''ll need a thick plate of lead (2 inches will be more than enough), and behind that a few sandbags (to absorb the impact).

Unless you are using tracer bullets - But those too will pass through the styrofoam so quickly, that I seriously doubt anything will catch fire. And even if it does, it will be just a 4 inch disk of styrofoam which will burn. So who really cares? I only suggested styrofoam because it will not create any high speed shrapnel when getting hit by a bullet, (as you are new to this) - Otherwise (in a situation like this) I myself would actually prefer small mirrors that would be reflecting the bright blue sky.

I have given him many tips and unlike some here - he has the guts to say ''what the heck'' and do things like I do regarding firearm disassembly, modifications, and such.

But still no offense bro... Again its still too soon to judge a gun with 180 rounds, I don''t say if its a bad gun actually I have no experience of it! but still if some one had reviewed this gun for you, then it means they are giving you space to learn more about it and NOT dictating you to either buy or don''t buy the gun because that is your judgement in the end :-)\n\nIf you ask for my review on duty then no I don''t like it because its grip was smaller for my hands last time I fired it, although I only fired 3 rounds from it, but it kept jumping off my fist. \n\nAlso since you have bought 809 and now want to change to Duty, one thing about gun prices is that if you buy a NIB branded imported gun in box and go back to sell it next day, there is minimum of 25% to 30% damage and it is standard rule in market. So better visit the dealer where you bought it from and they will be able to make you a deal, I am sure if you are changing one to another from same dealer, they will take care of you.', ''),

There is no need of stamp paper or attestation of Notary Public. NOT AT ALL! Just write it down on white paper and get it signed from the owner and keep it along with CNIC copies of owner and yourself. Nothing else is needed.\n\nBTW, Notary Public is a lawyer designated by Bar Council for the job. His attestation holds legal value. In Pakistan, I have seen that usually weak lawyer (who does not have good clientele) is given the post to financially accommodate him. Notary Public have offices in every Court (Kachehry / Adalaat). All he charges is Rs. 50 / 100 per document and even less and there is no hassle involved (but your uncle will have to go with you or if you have any lawyer friend, he can get it done for you). So, you can get it done easily but that is not required.\n\nAn addition: You can even mention the geographical boundaries with in which the authorized person can drive the car (e.g. Within Lahore, Within District of Lahore, Within Province of Punjab or Within Pakistan).\n\n@ raff: Bro! You are right. But there is no law on this (authority letter thing). If the vehicle is not registered in the name of person who is driving, as per law, all they can do is "Fine" the driver. They cannot even impound the vehicle. But you know, LEA can break or bend laws. So, to remain on safer side. You can take care of the issue e.g. attestation of Notary Public.[/FONT][/COLOR]\n\n[/FONT][/COLOR]', ''),

When I slapped in the 2nd mag the issue appeared, without pressing the slide release lever the Duty just loaded the ammo from the 2nd mag itself.

(536463, ' Re: Shipping or bringing gun parts internationally?\nQuote:\nOriginally Posted by colagrrl\nAnd I just now found your thread on the PAFOA board :-) I''m an avid lurker over there, although I have posted before, but I''m still a little too timid to join in for the most part. I was off work today and had some free time on my hands, so I spent some time researching various websites, including: the BATF, US Customs and the TSA looking for an answer to your question. At one point I saw info regarding firearm importation on the ATF site that said to contact the US Customs, and then on the US Customs site they said to contact the ATF...talk about circles and red tape!\n\n\nTo make a long story even longer, here''s where my research led me: on the FAQ section of the ATF site, under the heading of O. Semiautomatic Assault Weapons and Large Capacity Ammunition Feeding Devices (SAWs and LCAFDs) there''s a section on "Importation" that says that large capacity magazines are still subject to the provisions of the Arms Export Control Act and that a Form 6 import permit is still required. Then if you take a look at the "Instruction Sheet" for Form 6 on the ATF site, specifically section 9b that states: "9. Under Arms Export Control Act regulations in 27 CFR 47.41(c), a permit is not required for the importation of: b. Minor components and parts of Category I(a) firearms, except barrels, cylinders, receivers (frames) or complete breech mechanisms, when the total value does not exceed $100 wholesale in any single transaction. The $100 wholesale value supersedes the previous dollar threshold of $500 wholesale in any single transaction." If you then search the ATF site for 27 CFR 47.41(c), you''ll come across "Subpart C - Firearms" which relates to the "Control of the International Movement of Firearms, Their Parts and Components, and Ammunition". If you look at the bottom of page 6 & top of page 7, you''ll see section 47.41 (c) under the "Permit Requirement" heading, which also states that if the total value of the parts doesn''t exceed $100, then a permit is not required.\n\n\nI know you said you had a phone number for the BATF, but I found this info on the site directly related to importing, "If you have any questions or concerns about temporarily importing\nfirearms or ammunition into the United States, please call ATF’s Firearms and Explosives Imports Branch at 202-927-8320."\n\n\nFWIW, the TSA has one page about "Traveling With Special Items", relating to how to store your firearms and ammunition for traveling.\n\n\nAt any rate, I hope this helps you out, but I''d suggest calling the ATF Imports Branch just to confirm. If you do find out exactly what the law is, I don''t know about anyone else, but I''d definitely be interested in knowing what they had to say.\nI posted this question on several forums, this is by far the best response I''ve gotten. \n\n\nAlso, I''ve asked on a couple of gun-shops, and everybody looked at me like I was crazy..\n\n\n"Of COURSE you can have them mailed. So long as its nothing illegal, like a supporessor, some NFA item or a complete handgun."', ''),

With extensive combat experience around the globe, instructors Travis Haley and Chris Costa cover not only the "how to" aspects of the Carbine but also the "mindset" required to employ a carbine effectively under stress.\n\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n\n(NEW IN 3.0) Magpul Dynamics- The Art of The Tactical Carbine, Volume 2\n\n\nInstructors Travis Haley and Chris Costa take Carbine operation to the next level. An informative and exhilarating Dynamic Carbine class that focuses on pushing your failure points and finding the perfect balance between speed and accuracy. Using real advanced shooters from the firearms industry, law enforcement SWAT, and military special operations, this DVD set will show that no matter what level of the game you''re in, you always have the ability to excel.\n\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n\n(NEW IN 3.0) Magpul Dynamics - The Art of the Dynamic Handgun\n\n\nUsing a diverse group of beginner, intermediate, and advanced students, instructors Travis Haley and Chris Costa guide the class from the fundamentals of handgun operation, to problem solving, and through complex real-life scenarios. This progression from basic to advanced weapon manipulation pushes students of all skill levels to their failure points, illustrating how even the best shooters can advance and excel.\n\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n\n(NEW IN 3.0) Shotgun Gunfighting- Gabe Suarez \n\n\nThe shotgun, if used correctly inside its performance envelope is, potentially, the best CQB weapon in existence today. This dynamic DVD presents a reality based, aggressive, close quarters combative method of deploying the shotgun. We discuss the various generations of shotgun development, as well as common-sense accessories that the viewer will find useful.\n\n\nFilmed outside, in the Northern Arizona back country, we had the freedom to do as we pleased with regards to setting up shots and angles to capture every nuance of handling the weapon. There is some wind evident in some parts of the production, but it does not detract from the presentation of the information. All four generations of shotgun development are discussed and shown to include the double barrel, the pump action, the semi auto and the magazine-fed semi auto, as well as what each generation brings to the table. Most demonstrations are conducted with the Remington 870, the Remington 1100, or the Saiga 12.\n\n\nMost shotgun schools spend a great deal of time discussing modifications and additions to the shotgun, or try to convince the viewer to turn this CQB weapon into some sort of a rifle suitable only for range games, or gun school scores. That is happily not the case in SHOTGUN GUNFIGHTING! In this DVD you will learn what the shotgun is REALLY for, and perhaps as important, learn the weapon''s limitations. After a brief overview of the fundamentals, we progress quickly to advanced reality-based drills such as Hostage Rescue Shooting, Ambidextrous Work, and Ammo Transitions. This is the Shotgun version of Close Range Gunfighting.\n\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n\n(NEW IN 3.0) Practical Shooting- Matt Burkett\n\n\nWatch and learn as professional shooter Matt Burkett teaches his student (Kevin Elpers) the techniques required to be a successful handgun shooter. Everything is covered: Safety, Equipment Choice and Set-up, Stance, Grip, Eye Dominance, Sight Information, Weak/Strong Hand, Target Transitions, Draws, Reloads, Trigger Control, Shooting while Moving and lots more! Guest Star Don Golembieski (master gunsmith) takes you through equipment selection and maintenance. Volume 3 includes a bonus interview with your host who discusses cross-dominance, sighting techniques, the fundamentals of shooting, and, the "breakdown of firing a single shot" maybe more than you bargained for. :) This video set will teach the skills and techniques needed to dominate in the competitive shooting sports as well as provide an advanced level of knowledge and skill set for the casual shooter.\n\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n\n(NEW IN 3.0) Kalashnikov Rifle Gunfighting - Basic and Advanced- Gabe Suarez\n\n\nThe AK-47/74 series of rifle is one of the most prolific and useful weapons on earth. More than 100 million have been made in various parts of the world, and the odds of encountering one on the battlefield or in a civil disturbance are high.\n\n\nBest-selling author and maverick combat shooting instructor Gabriel Suarez has embraced the Kalashnikov rifle system for its utility, accuracy and ruggedness. In this original Paladin Press production, Suarez teaches you the "caveman simple" skills you need to operate the AK rifle platform and win in a combat environment.\n\n\nSuarez addresses the common myths about the AK and explains why it is one of the best weapon choices for urban and close quarters combat. He teaches you about the AK fire control system, proper use of the sling, zeroing the AK and ready/carry positions. Then you will learn about ambidextrous use of the rifle, snap shooting, CQB shooting and the use of the rifle in movement. For information purposes only.\n\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n\n(NEW IN 3.0) Advanced Close range Gunfighting- Gabe Suarez\n\n\nIn Close Range Gunfighting, Gabe Suarez, the most controversial trainer on the planet, showed you that traditional range training can get you killed. He showed the basics of how to break out of the range mentality. In doing so he challenged the status quo like no one before and changed the way gunfighting is taught in America.\n\n\nIn Advanced Close Range Gunfighting, he shows you the rest of the material. Very fast-paced and full of full-speed concealed carry shooting action, this video will have you doing things most people think are impossible. Gabe shows the benefits of Appendix Carry, Ambidextrous Gunfighting, Weapon Transfers and why it is important you know how to do them, Enhanced Get Off The X Footwork, and an important discussion on the Elements of the Combative Technique of the Pistol. This video will move the art of gunfighting another giant leap forward. \n\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n\n(NEW IN 3.0) AGI- Firearm Defense- Shooting In Realistic Settings\n\n\nA Second Amendment Foundation DVD. May I first state that this 1:10 long movie deals with pistols, however, some tactics are covered where rifles can be substituted. Topics in the movie include aiming, speed firing, clearing rooms/buildings, and more. The instructor in the video is a professional, training everyone ranging from normal civillians, to the police and military. \n\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n\n(NEW IN 3.0) The Tactical Advantage- Gabe Suarez\n\n\nGiven enough time and practice, anyone can shoot a two-inch group under perfect conditions on the firing range. The problem is that the vast majority of criminals or terrorists aren''t on the range, so to be a well-rounded, reality-based combat shooter, you need to know how to move and shoot under various conditions where you''ll be at a disadvantage.\n\n\nBased on veteran combat shooting instructor Gabe Suarez best-selling book The Tactical Advantage, this video production from Paladin Press teaches you the vital basics of handgun tactics under difficult circumstances.Suarez kicks off his instruction with a comprehensive look at "slicing the pie," navigating both primary and off-side corners to minimize your exposure to danger while giving you the drop on your assailant.\n\n\nFrom there, he shows you how to best clear T-intersections and doorways, traverse stairwells going up and down, clear rooms and deal with a variety of shoot/no-shoot situations.Good marksmanship is only part of the true-fighting arsenal: you need to know tactics.\n\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n\n(NEW IN 3.0) Combative Pistol Marksmanship- Gabe Suarez\n\n\nIn Combative Pistol Marksmanship, Gabe Suarez establishes the foundation necessary for future intermediate and adsvanced levels. The entire premise is that "SHOOTING IS EASY".\n\n\nGabe proves that, by giving you all the steps needed to fire an accurate shot. All the secrets are here from the fundamentals of marsksmanship to really understanding the surprise break, and the use of the sights, and more. This DVD is suitable for both the advanced shooter as a refresher of things forgotten, and for the novice to learn the correct way the first time. \n\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n\n(NEW IN 3.0) Judicious Use Of Deadly Force- Massad Ayoob\n\n\nAnyone who has been around firearms for any lenhth of time knows who Massad Ayoob is. His long list of credits include being a sworn police officer as well as a police firearms and deadly force instructor, Director of the Lethal Force Institute (LFI), trustee of the Second Amendment Foundation, and associate editor of Guns Magazine, American Handgunner, Combat Handguns,and other magazines. He is a strong advocate of gun rights for private citizens. The author of nearly 3000 published articles on weapons, self-defense, and law enforcement, he is best known for his 1980 book In The Gravest Extreme: The Role of the Firearm in Personal Defense.\n\n\nIn this 1990 video shot during a course at LFI, Ayoob explains in detail the situations in which lethal force is justified in self defense, and how the Court will analyze such usage. This is recommended viewing for anyone who uses or carries a firearm for self-defense. \n\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n\n(NEW IN 3.0) Police Survival Shooting- Massad Ayoob\n\n\nOne of the most accomplished police trainers in the U.S., Ayoob takes the officer through all phases of shooting, reloading, cover concealment and criminal apprehension with pistol and shotgun. This is an extension of personal instruction incorporated in Ayoob''s Lethal Force Institute classes.

When you apply for it you will first get a demand note just like any other demand note for any other MOI license, it will have original seals and stamps. After you register your weapon you will get a card license with your picture and the pakistan Seal holograms in the background.

(536776, ' The Taurus 809 is a decent enough gun; the look and feel is very similar to the TP-9 (it''s almost like a hammer-fired second-cousin of the TP-9), so if you''re comfortable with the TP-9 then you''ll most probably enjoy the 809 as well. They''re both, however, near identical in dimensions as well, so if you feel the the TP-9 is too big or heavy to CC then the 809 won''t work for you either.\n\nJust a point of note: The Taurus 809 is the hammer-fired version of the Taurus 24/7 G2 (which is striker fired). Some people have noted that they experience a few failure-to-fires (due to the firing pin not hitting the stiffer primer of certain bullets hard enough), so if you do get an 809, either get a slightly stiffer main spring or a slightly lengthened firing pin (that way you''ll ensure that the firing pin rams the primer of the chambered round and sets it off).', ''),

(536907, '22LR - Very Unique Cartridge Throughout history many small game brass cartridges have been invented. Most have disappeared from the scene into history. Among those that have survived, one stands out - the venerable 22LR.\n\nLet us review some of its properties that make this classic invention the most popular cartridge in world. It is the cheapest rim-fire cartridge. It is effective on small game at distances from the width of a football field and up to the length of that field. No wonder it is called a marvel cartridge.\n\nThe 22LR comes in various derivations to cater to the varying interests of hunters and shooters - standard velocity, high velocity and hyper velocity. Beside availability of different velocities - the diverse shapes and styles of the bullets refine the selection into custom 22LR ammunition.\n\nIf you have never experienced the 22LR in your hands in the field or at the range, you have not lived a full life. It is never too late to step forward and join those who savor the 22LR cartridge - affectionately known at the Number One.', ''),

(536924, 'FAO Zastava M57 owners - real or copy? Salams All\n\nHope you are all well.\n\nI have recently picked up am M57 Zastava but I have serious doubts that it is a local made/copy now.\n\nFor those who own M57, kindly review and respond.\n\nHere are my observations after reviewing another 2 M57 from 2 different dealers:\n\nPistol has not been fire tested, not a single bullet loaded in the mags.\n\n1. [B]DIFFERENCE:[/B] The box for my Zastava has very light purple (close to blue) colour that is not solid (i.e. it has background white of the box seen in it). Other 2 dealer Zastava boxes were darker purple and solid colour on the box (where Zastava Logo and Serial Number area is)\n2. Stamping on the box - Model: MOD57, CAL: 7.62mm, Serial Number: 22XXXX ([B]DIFFERENCE:[/B] Serial Number for the other 2 started with C2XXXXX!!)\n3. Paperwork (with serial number & an envelope containing feedback questionnaire) inside are identical to other 2, there is no difference whatsoever.\n4. Serial numbers stampings on the pistol''s right side are in the same place on the frame\n5. [B]DIFFERENCE:[/B] There is no serial number on the barrel on mine, only 7.62mm is stamped, whereas other 2 have Serial Numbers stamped on the barrel\n6. [B]DIFFERENCE: [/B]The round stamp - the barrel trademarking by Zastava - (visible on the barrel) is not as refined as the one on the other 2 that are very clear and even under the magnifying glass\n8. [B]DIFFERENCE:[/B] The round groove on the barrel on the trigger side is visible on mine - right at the top edge of the ejection port) whereas it is not visible at all on the other 2.\n9. [B]DIFFERENCE:[/B] On the right side, on the upper frame of the pistol, it is stamped M57 TT not below the ejection port but on the right side, whereas on the other 2 it is stamped 7.62x25 M57 below the ejection port (just as Abbas Bhai''s M57''s picture in his first post of his review of M57).\n10. [B]DIFFERENCE:[/B] On the right side, on the lower frame, it is stamped ''Read Owners Manual Before Use'' - what owner manual??? This was not stamped on the other 2 M57''s anywhere.\n11. [B]DIFFERENCE:[/B] Finish, specifically the uneven lines on the top frame to the front sight and the grip finish, show a very poor workmanship on mine when comparing to the the other 2 M57''s.\n12. [B]DIFFERENCE:[/B] Finishing and fitment of the trigger mechanism is nowhere near the same ... (as you know the complete mechanism just pulls out)\n13. [B]ISSUES:[/B] One one particular empty mag, it is very heavy to cock and does not engage the open barrel as it should on an empty mag. After cocking it just twice, the trigger does not engage, NO DRY FIRE, and the mag is jammed until the slider holding the pin to remove the top frame is pushed and the pin is pushed out - thats when the pressing the remove mag button works.\n- On the 2nd mag, everything flawlessly!! \n14. I am suspicious of the Zastava Arms markings on the left side of the frame (top and bottom) as there are not as refined as on other 2 M57''s.\n\nThis is from one of the 3 regular arms dealers I purchase from. One dealer refused to call it a copy (for ethical reasons quoted) but allowed me more than sufficient time to compare the 2 he had in stock with the one I purchased to make my own judgement.\n\nFor those who purchased and/or owned M57''s, your comments are much appreciated. A jamming mag is sufficient reason for me to return it as I want a pistol that is fully functional from the word go and the dealer has already said that he would replace the weapon. I just don''t want to get it replaced with a copy! \n\nPrice I paid for mine is 40K versus 48K the other 2 dealers were demanding.\n\n\nPlease advise on identifying a genuine Zastava M57?\n\n\nReason I like Zastava is that the grip fits well versus the Norinco''s 30cal. Intention is for HD...........  Shall I dump the M57 idea and for HD get the Norinco .30CAL (24K market price and easy to get extra mags) plus a Norinco 1911 .45ACP instead with some money on top. Already have a semi-auto shotgun with 1x 10 rounds mag, and 3 x5 rounds mags. For CC, I have Stoeger (my fav), PT92, PT709 Slim and Walther P22Q. All I desire now is a long range high cal rifle .... but custom built one (& that should leave me content for a good while)\n\nSuggestions please? Thanks in advance.\n\nPS: (off topic a bit): does anyone know where I can source a 416 SS Bar to make a custom rifle barrel?\n\n\nIf you need to see pics of this M57, please let me know. Thanks again.\n\nPics attached:\n\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]22369[/ATTACH]\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]22367[/ATTACH]\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]22365[/ATTACH]\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]22363[/ATTACH]\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]22372[/ATTACH]\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]22370[/ATTACH]\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]22368[/ATTACH]\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]22366[/ATTACH]\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]22364[/ATTACH]\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]22371[/ATTACH]', ''),
