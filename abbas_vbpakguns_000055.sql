But could''nt resist having another ''Go'' at the traders there. I was joined by little Tatur1. We visited a total of 11 outlets And if I have forgotten anything I would request Tatur1 to add his memory to mine. \r\n\r\nOur visit was marred by the extremely disturbing news that one of the few dealers that I respect and purchase from was abducted by extortionists. I would request all our brethren here to pray for his early recovery. He has infant children. A number of dealers I talked to are still in a state of shock.\r\n\r\n[b]General  Impression:[/b]\r\n Most of the dealers were in a pretty good mood. And gave us a lot of time. But then this was the 2nd half of a Saturday during Ramadan. Business was slow and they seemed glad to talk.\r\n\r\n[b]1st  port of call[/b].. Haji something or the other This outlet is right next to Ansari arms and the khan sahib deals exclusively in locals. ( I have given his gunsmith my shotgun) The display case was full of shotguns of all shapes and sizes. Some I could recognize as crude versions of the AR 15, M16 and the Seiga 12 and still others that looked like they came straight out of a 5 year old’s nightmare. I asked him if any of them were capable of SD. He did not even bother to look up, simply refused.  \r\nThat’s why I like this guy, once before I had gone to him looking for a 9mm for SD. Even then he had refused. In fact had advised me against getting one if serious SD is my aim. This guy is incidentally either the cousin or the brother of the owner of the Moonstar arms company outlet. \r\n\r\n[b]After that it was Pioneer arms.[/b]\r\n\r\nI think he is a whole seller for his prices were pretty decent. 60K for an Akdal M1919 and 50k for the Hatsan MP A.

No room for ide chit chat so we left\r\n\r\n[b]Ghulam Ali and Sons.[/b] The dealer was quite locasious a best. Wont even let me look at his local offerings. He showed me a lot of guns. Nice ones too! Even when I did not want to see them.. Went a bit further and even showed me videos of him skeet shooting! A little more time and I might have ended up with an invitation to meet his family. However he did show me some really nice stuff. \r\nThe Akkar 222 semi-auto shotgun.. Comes with excellent ghoast ring sights and a highly visible front fibre optic sight. Compared to the Akkar the MP A’s front fibre optics were a complete disapointmnt\r\nThe weapon had a picatinny rail for accessories . 4 chokes and and extra hunting barrel. A rubberized pistol grip and a fairly well made stock completed the ensemble: Asking 60k. \r\nHe said that no Turkish gun should be used with a slug. Not even those with slug barrels. Only Amarican guns are slug capable. To prove it he showed us a mossy maverick pump 5+1 70% or so. 80k. Since I had already seem a similar weapon NIB at Mega. I was not interested.  \r\nThen it was on to handguns. I finaly saw the Salsimarz ST 10. I a dead ringer for the H&K USP. Unfortunately while it looks like fairly accurate clone of the H&P USP. It does not have the functionality of the “Universal Style Pistol”  I.e a safety lever but no decocker.  He also showed me a USP as well. Bout 80% or so. Asking 350k and NIB 400K \r\nHe was offering a plain vanilla Cougher (Black w/o rails) 65k. CF NIB 44k and Kanuni 2 tone in 65k\r\nP.S. Knew all about Gun forums: In his opinion losers hang out at those…\r\n\r\n[b]Haris :[/b]\r\n The man was busy (I think) Girsan 21 & 23 Not available. Zigana F 75k M1919 65k Hatsan MP A Not available. I saw a 24/7 in the display case and ask him if he had it.. He said No. I realized he really did not like being disturbed. I left.\r\n\r\n[b]TNT Arms:[/b]\r\nThe gent was more helpful then the last time I went there. He deals more or less exclusively in local products. Every weapon there had the Legend “Gul” in a little sunflower on his gun. He was selling Seiga 12 and AK-47 Shotgun knock offs at 28k apiece. Asked us to take em home and shoot to our hearts’ content and if satisfied to pay later, He claimed they had been made from Russian Machine guns. Well the barrels  must have been pretty badly chopped up cause I could see multiple welding  joints where the melted metal had been covered in a thin layer of paint. The bolt was rusty as was the folding stock. In fact most of it was covered in rust. He made the usual claim that-his-products-were-the best –in-the-market. And the firing pins and extractors were all made In USA!! What u got was a so-callled American Russian hybrid that would put a vodka soaked Siberian to shame. Honestly speaking I really cant understand why they do this? To us and to themselves as well???\r\n\r\n[b]Ali Muhammad and Sons:[/b]\r\nThis outlet is now a subsidiary of Ammar and co. Adnan handles it as his own outlet. They have a lot of good stuff there and since they are importers at pretty reasonable rates. M1919 at 60k asking Hatsan MP 32k Plain vanilla Cougher 60k and 809 70k as well as G II at the same rate.  I also saw a Taurus  judge .410 revolver 120k. He had gotten it off Guns and accessories.  Taurus .38 special 6 shot 80k .357 and .38 bullets at Rs. 100 and  .410  shot shells at Rs. 120 each (Those things are tiny compared to a 12 guage) Adnan is a friendly chap unlike most of the jaded and cynical dealers around. He was nice enough to let us handle the weapons to our hearts’ content. A practice most dealers frown upon specially with stranger. But this may have been due to the fact that I am old customer of his Uncle’s Khuzema Bandulwala. The original  owners of Ali Muhammad and sons. \r\nUnlike other dealers who refused to make licenses for people below 25 years of age he has no issues as long as the person is 18+. Rate 15k Permits are Rs. 2500. \r\n he had to go somewhere and left us to our own devices while we were extolling the different advantages of the 809 and the cougher his father walked in with a bunch of people in tow demanding to see ‘bareeetas’ “Hamain bareeta dekhao”  His father started yelling at his absent son for leaving the store at his salesman at the boy on the counter… he seems quite fond of it. Yelling I mean.. Before he started on us we decided to slink away. Highly recommended.. Good service reasonable prices. But do check and make sure Papa is not around before you walk in. \r\n\r\n[b]Famous arms:[/b]\r\n\r\nA slightly under the weather Mehmood bhai was sitting  alone in the shop.. He seems quite upset about the abduction of a fellow dealer in the market.. He felt like talking. We  were only too eager to oblige. He had some pretty decent Seiga 12 and ak style shot gun knock offs9(The term ‘decent knock-off” sounds a bit like an oxymoron does’nt it) Asking price 18k and the quality was better.. Much better then the stuff at TNT. He has his own service centre adjacent to the shop. And gives a 3 month replacement warrenty for his weapons and also a lifetime service warranty for all his products including small parts such as pins and extractors. He also offered to test fire the weapon before purchase. A practice that most dealers balk from where shotguns are concerned. \r\n\r\n[b]Bashir Khan and Co.[/b]\r\nA trader rather like TNT offering similar products. T similar prices. Claimed that no 144 has been imposed in Karachi and all licences are closed. He had a TT he called “naga Parbat” partly cause she had heart shaped holes in the slide and was supposedly matt chrome.. Only it turned out to be some sort of light gray colur with little bubbles etched in it. He was selling the Zigana f for around 80k. His products were known by the name of “Chamkani” \r\nLocal bullets rs. 30 and Chinese Rs. 40\r\n\r\n[b]Mega Armoury:[/b] \r\nI dropped in at my old ''friend'' Danish at Mega.. The minute we walked in They gave each other a “oh-no-not-him-again-look ..oooohh we are just closing..Do come back on Monday… M1919  65k (With customers like U we have to have room to maneuvere its not like U are going to give me what I ask) DC License 18k irrespective of age. \r\n\r\n[b]Conclusion:[/b] \r\n\r\nZiganas and Girsans and other Turkish offerings are just bout and in some cases slightly more then Taurus.  70 to 80k range. \r\nMost dealers  are vary of firing slugs in Turkish shotguns.. Specially M1919. The Nickle Plated Akkar pump is not available in fact dealers have not even heard of it.The market is evenly spread b/w dealers who are not willing to make licenses for people below 25 and those who are willing to do so. \r\n\r\nRest I will continue when I pick up my shotgun on Tuesday.', 1, 1, '119.155.9.201', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

Interesting Information about dealers about guns.:clap2::second:\n\n[QUOTE=Enigmatic Desires;283954]This review is in continuation of my series of reviews at Lucky Star (The Karachi version of Neela Gumbad) I had originally gone there to get my shotgun repaired. But could''nt resist having another ''Go'' at the traders there. I was joined by little Tatur1. We visited a total of 11 outlets And if I have forgotten anything I would request Tatur1 to add his memory to mine. \n\nOur visit was marred by the extremely disturbing news that one of the few dealers that I respect and purchase from was abducted by extortionists. I would request all our brethren here to pray for his early recovery. He has infant children. A number of dealers I talked to are still in a state of shock.\n\n[B]General  Impression:[/B]\n Most of the dealers were in a pretty good mood. And gave us a lot of time. But then this was the 2nd half of a Saturday during Ramadan. Business was slow and they seemed glad to talk.\n\n[B]1st  port of call[/B].. Haji something or the other This outlet is right next to Ansari arms and the khan sahib deals exclusively in locals. ( I have given his gunsmith my shotgun) The display case was full of shotguns of all shapes and sizes. Some I could recognize as crude versions of the AR 15, M16 and the Seiga 12 and still others that looked like they came straight out of a 5 year old’s nightmare. I asked him if any of them were capable of SD. He did not even bother to look up, simply refused.  \nThat’s why I like this guy, once before I had gone to him looking for a 9mm for SD. Even then he had refused. In fact had advised me against getting one if serious SD is my aim. This guy is incidentally either the cousin or the brother of the owner of the Moonstar arms company outlet. \n\n[B]After that it was Pioneer arms.[/B]\n\nI think he is a whole seller for his prices were pretty decent. 60K for an Akdal M1919 and 50k for the Hatsan MP A. The TS was not available.  He had the only MP A in the whole market. \n\n[B]Hussain Brothers:[/B]  M1919 was 63k MPA was not available. A to-thepont-man. No room for ide chit chat so we left\n\n[B]Ghulam Ali and Sons.[/B] The dealer was quite locasious a best. Wont even let me look at his local offerings. He showed me a lot of guns. Nice ones too! Even when I did not want to see them.. Went a bit further and even showed me videos of him skeet shooting! A little more time and I might have ended up with an invitation to meet his family. However he did show me some really nice stuff. \nThe Akkar 222 semi-auto shotgun.. Comes with excellent ghoast ring sights and a highly visible front fibre optic sight. Compared to the Akkar the MP A’s front fibre optics were a complete disapointmnt\nThe weapon had a picatinny rail for accessories . 4 chokes and and extra hunting barrel. A rubberized pistol grip and a fairly well made stock completed the ensemble: Asking 60k. \nHe said that no Turkish gun should be used with a slug. Not even those with slug barrels. Only Amarican guns are slug capable. To prove it he showed us a mossy maverick pump 5+1 70% or so. 80k. Since I had already seem a similar weapon NIB at Mega. I was not interested.  \nThen it was on to handguns. I finaly saw the Salsimarz ST 10. I a dead ringer for the H&K USP. Unfortunately while it looks like fairly accurate clone of the H&P USP. It does not have the functionality of the “Universal Style Pistol”  I.e a safety lever but no decocker.  He also showed me a USP as well. Bout 80% or so. Asking 350k and NIB 400K \nHe was offering a plain vanilla Cougher (Black w/o rails) 65k. CF NIB 44k and Kanuni 2 tone in 65k\nP.S. Knew all about Gun forums: In his opinion losers hang out at those…\n\n[B]Haris :[/B]\n The man was busy (I think) Girsan 21 & 23 Not available. Zigana F 75k M1919 65k Hatsan MP A Not available. I saw a 24/7 in the display case and ask him if he had it.. He said No. I realized he really did not like being disturbed. I left.\n\n[B]TNT Arms:[/B]\nThe gent was more helpful then the last time I went there. He deals more or less exclusively in local products. Every weapon there had the Legend “Gul” in a little sunflower on his gun. He was selling Seiga 12 and AK-47 Shotgun knock offs at 28k apiece. Asked us to take em home and shoot to our hearts’ content and if satisfied to pay later, He claimed they had been made from Russian Machine guns. Well the barrels  must have been pretty badly chopped up cause I could see multiple welding  joints where the melted metal had been covered in a thin layer of paint. The bolt was rusty as was the folding stock. In fact most of it was covered in rust. He made the usual claim that-his-products-were-the best –in-the-market. And the firing pins and extractors were all made In USA!! What u got was a so-callled American Russian hybrid that would put a vodka soaked Siberian to shame. Honestly speaking I really cant understand why they do this? To us and to themselves as well???\n\n[B]Ali Muhammad and Sons:[/B]\nThis outlet is now a subsidiary of Ammar and co. Adnan handles it as his own outlet. They have a lot of good stuff there and since they are importers at pretty reasonable rates. M1919 at 60k asking Hatsan MP 32k Plain vanilla Cougher 60k and 809 70k as well as G II at the same rate.  I also saw a Taurus  judge .410 revolver 120k. He had gotten it off Guns and accessories.  Taurus .38 special 6 shot 80k .357 and .38 bullets at Rs. 100 and  .410  shot shells at Rs. 120 each (Those things are tiny compared to a 12 guage) Adnan is a friendly chap unlike most of the jaded and cynical dealers around. He was nice enough to let us handle the weapons to our hearts’ content. A practice most dealers frown upon specially with stranger. But this may have been due to the fact that I am old customer of his Uncle’s Khuzema Bandulwala. The original  owners of Ali Muhammad and sons. \nUnlike other dealers who refused to make licenses for people below 25 years of age he has no issues as long as the person is 18+. Rate 15k Permits are Rs. 2500. \n he had to go somewhere and left us to our own devices while we were extolling the different advantages of the 809 and the cougher his father walked in with a bunch of people in tow demanding to see ‘bareeetas’ “Hamain bareeta dekhao”  His father started yelling at his absent son for leaving the store at his salesman at the boy on the counter… he seems quite fond of it. Yelling I mean.. Before he started on us we decided to slink away. Highly recommended.. Good service reasonable prices. But do check and make sure Papa is not around before you walk in. \n\n[B]Famous arms:[/B]\n\nA slightly under the weather Mehmood bhai was sitting  alone in the shop.. He seems quite upset about the abduction of a fellow dealer in the market.. He felt like talking. We  were only too eager to oblige. He had some pretty decent Seiga 12 and ak style shot gun knock offs9(The term ‘decent knock-off” sounds a bit like an oxymoron does’nt it) Asking price 18k and the quality was better.. Much better then the stuff at TNT. He has his own service centre adjacent to the shop. And gives a 3 month replacement warrenty for his weapons and also a lifetime service warranty for all his products including small parts such as pins and extractors. He also offered to test fire the weapon before purchase. A practice that most dealers balk from where shotguns are concerned. \n\n[B]Bashir Khan and Co.[/B]\nA trader rather like TNT offering similar products. T similar prices. Claimed that no 144 has been imposed in Karachi and all licences are closed. He had a TT he called “naga Parbat” partly cause she had heart shaped holes in the slide and was supposedly matt chrome.. Only it turned out to be some sort of light gray colur with little bubbles etched in it. He was selling the Zigana f for around 80k. His products were known by the name of “Chamkani” \nLocal bullets rs. 30 and Chinese Rs. 40\n\n[b]Mega Armoury:[b] \nI dropped in at my old ''friend'' danish at Mega.. The minute we walked in They gave each other a “oh-no-not-him-again-look ..oooohh we are just closing..Do come back on Monday… M1919  65k (With customers like U we have to have room to maneuvere its not like U are going to give me what I ask) DC License 18k irrespective of age. \n\n[B]Conclusion:[/B] \n\nZiganas and Girsans and other Turkish offerings are just bout and in some cases slightly more then Taurus.  70 to 80k range. \nMost dealers  are vary of firing slugs in Turkish shotguns.. Specially M1919. The market is evenly spread b/w dealers who are not willing to make licences for people below 25 and those who are willing to do so.\n\nRest I will continue when I pick up my shotgun on Tuesday.[/QUOTE]', 1, 0, '116.71.30.68', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

Of all the 7 fundamentals of shooting, [B]THE[/B] most important is trigger control; [B]Skeeter60[/B] Sir once told me that trigger control is 60% of the game!\n\nUnfortunately, trigger control is also [B]THE[/B] most difficult fundamental to master. I still haven''t completely  mastered it, despite being a very regular shooter. But, from personal experience, I have learned a few things:-\n\n1) First off, know that the human hand contains [B]NO[/B] muscles; we articulate our fingers and thumbs via tendons which stretch all the way up to the muscles in our forearms. Therefore, the trick is to "isolate" the trigger finger so that your forearm doesn''t shake.\n2) As a rule of thumb, make sure that the center of the first digit of your trigger finger is placed on the trigger, not a joint or a knuckle. I know it''s not intuitive or instinctive, but it''s the best way to "isolate" the trigger finger.\n3) Pull, not squeeze, the trigger; that way you''ll pull the trigger straight back instead of "curling" your finger on it, which will remove any "curling" effect on your primary hand.\n4) Be gentle, and don''t rush your trigger pull. Be calm and relaxed, and gently pull the trigger rearwards. Take all the time in the world.\n5) As practice, I recommend pasting a small target on your wall and slowly dry firing your gun. I personally do dry fire drills everyday for atleast 2 hours every night.\n6) Lastly, give yourself time to master the trigger. Don''t be impatient with yourself, give yourself the learning time and space. Manipulating a trigger, initially, is quite counter-intuitive. So just relax and let it come to you naturally, don''t rush yourself.\n\nI sincerely this helps you out bro.', 1, 1, '182.185.177.57', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

Lee Ermey", which focused on the development of different types of weapons. An inspiring video for Pakistani women in sports shooting.\n\nWhen Kim Rhode, then 17, stood on the podium at the 1996 Olympic Games in Atlanta with her first gold medal hanging from her neck, she never dreamed 16 years later she would make history in London at the 2012 Summer Olympic Games, but that''s exactly what happened Sunday morning. \n\nRhode, 33, set a new Olympic record in qualifying for Women''s Skeet with 74 hits out of 75. She went on to match her own world record with a perfect 25 in the final for a total of 99 out of 100, winning the gold. \n\nShe is the first U.S. athlete in history to medal in an individual sport at five consecutive Olympic Games. \n\nBefore today, Rhode had collected two gold medals in the Double Trap event in 1996 and 2004, a bronze in 2000 and a silver in the Skeet at the Beijing 2008 games, cementing herself as one of the best competitive shotgun shooters in the world. And she''s not done yet.\n \n"I do not see myself quitting any time soon," Rhode says on the official Olympics website. "I''m looking forward to 2016 and a few more after that. The oldest Olympic medalist was a shooter and he was 72, so I still have a few more in me."\n \nThat means continuing her intense training schedule. Rhode shoots as many as 500 to 1,000 shells a day and has continued a dedicated practice routine for 23 years. She estimates she has fired as many as 2 million shotshells in her life.\n \nChina''s Ning Wir took the silver in Women''s Skeet and Slovakia''s Danka Bartekova won bronze after a shoot-off with Russia''s Martina Belikova.\n\n[url]http://www.trbimg.com/img-50153f79/turbine/la-sp-on-kim-rhode-20120729-001/600[/url]\n\n[url]http://www.huntinglife.com/imgLib/20100131_KimRhode2010PostcardPhoto.JPG[/url]\n\n[url]http://www.perazzi.com.au/Images/Kimberly%20Rhode.jpg[/url]', 1, 1, '212.26.16.62', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

If one eye is closed then the open-eye become dominant eye after a certain time. It is autonomous system of the body to coop with the deficiencies. For ground shot, you may close your recessive eye (the key to success is &#8220;Practice&#8221;). And for aerial shot, it is obvious that both eyes will be remained open. Eyes will adjust themselves automatically after a certain time. Without considering the shoulder, when both eyes are opened, the dominant eye aims. During shooting, the firing gadget should be in the line of nose. (This all is my humble observation. May be wrong.)[/QUOTE]\nwhile agreeing 100 % with Doc Sahb, may I suggest that as far as your shotgunning problem is concerned the answer lies in dry firing practice. the best way to do that is to stand in a room or outdoors with shotgun in both hands in lowered position. now you got to suddenly and without thinking pick up a small target (a speck, bulp, or anything similarly small on the wall if indoor) and mount your gun quickly on that target without aiming. hold this position and close left eye and aim deliberately like a rifle and see if your point of aim shifts or not. pick up targets in different directions and elevations and keep doing it till such time you consistently find that your quick pointing without aiming and deliberate aiming point remains the same. I carry out this practice before start of each shoot even after 36 years of shotgunning and believe me, it helps. as for pistol shooting cross eye dominance doesnt count because in that in any case you are firing with a deliberate aim and with left eye closed. most likely your problem lies with trigger control (99 % of pistol shooting is about trigger control)', 1, 0, '119.154.106.14', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

Glad to see you now have a place for you and your Piranha to get better acquainted. :)\n\nAs for ammo, I''ve fired S&B (115gr & 124gr), Barnaul, PoF Mk1Z and Chinese Redbox with my Piranha. Of these, the best I found was the S&B 115gr and Barnaul (they''re almost identical and great ammo). I''m currently using Redbox because of it''s lower price (Rs. 38-40/round here in Lahore) and it''s shooting perfectly. If I were to compare S&B/Barnaul and Redbox, the big difference would be that the Chinese round is slightly "hotter", meaning it has slightly greater velocity and a flatter trajectory, but it''s also as dirty as a year-old used diaper! :p\n\nBottomline: If you strictly want performance and money isn''t an issue, then go for either S&B 115gr or Barnaul.

Steel shot, because it is three times harder than              lead, stays round, and develops a shot string that is 50-60% shorter              and 60-70% narrower than lead.  Or, looking at it another way,              steel provides a much more precise "hitting zone" than you''d get              with lead shot.   We recommend that you practice shooting              with steel shot so you can get used to its compact, hard-hitting              "sweet spot" before hunting season.[/SIZE][/FONT][/CENTER]             [CENTER][IMG]http://shotshell.drundel.com/images/leadpath.jpe[/IMG]\n\n[IMG]http://shotshell.drundel.com/images/stlpath.jpe[/IMG][FONT=Arial][SIZE=3][/SIZE][/FONT][/CENTER][/TD]\n[/TR]\n[/TABLE]\n[/CENTER]\n[/TD]\n[/TR]\n[/TABLE]\n[FONT=Verdana][SIZE=2]\n[/SIZE][/FONT]', 1, 1, '125.209.116.158', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

I owned guns from glock, cz, colt, para,detonix etc. etc..

Why do any of us buy guns? i bet the main reason would be the same as mine.

Glad to see you now have a place for you and your Piranha to get better acquainted. :)\n\nAs for ammo, I''ve fired S&B (115gr & 124gr), Barnaul, PoF Mk1Z and Chinese Redbox with my Piranha. Of these, the best I found was the S&B 115gr and Barnaul (they''re almost identical and great ammo). I''m currently using Redbox because of it''s lower price (Rs. 38-40/round here in Lahore) and it''s shooting perfectly. If I were to compare S&B/Barnaul and Redbox, the big difference would be that the Chinese round is slightly "hotter", meaning it has slightly greater velocity and a flatter trajectory, but it''s also as dirty as a year-old used diaper! :p\n\nBottomline: If you strictly want performance and money isn''t an issue, then go for either S&B 115gr or Barnaul.

Issue date of this license is "28-12-2011" (written on page 12) while I applied on 27th May 2012.\n\n2. On page # 18, "Date on which license expires" is 31-12-2012. Its written by a pan in handwritting with no stamp on it. When asked about, Rabbi said its no issue.\n\n3. Page # 19 is stamped (4x) one of them states "Home Minister Quota", and other one has 3 rows looks like a payment stamp worth 4500 with receipt number and date of "28-12-2011".\n\n4. On page # 11, My photo is stamped ("Commissioner Karachi Division Karachi") and signed as well.\n\n5. Most of the copy is filled with manual writing from a pen such as page # 17 which defines ammunition that is "50 P/A" with enough space to make it "500" (however I have decided to not play with it at all).\n\nAfter taking it from Rabbi, at that point he said its now possible to buy weapon directly but instead I decided to take it to "Ali Muhammad & Sons" shop at Lucky Star which I have very friendly experience of (I went there with Engagement Desires) bro on survey a week ago. I didn''t find same person but there was a guy called Nadeem or I don''t exactly remember name (but sure starts from "N") who said he will still renew license and get NBP stamp on it, increase ammo to 250 and get me a pink slip from NBP and some other process which will cost me 4500.', 1, 1, '110.38.85.126', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

If I have forgotten anything I would like MIG and Usama to add anything they like to it.\n\nWe went to [b]Shaheen[/b]. A tiny little shoplet on main Mansfield street. Usama bhai wanted his air gun repaired. Shaheen told us to go Mustafa traders. He had some pretty expensive hardware for such a small shop.   Gamos and Dianas ranging from 63k to 96k. I had no idea air guns were this expensive. \nHe said he will have some air pistols (Gamo) available in the next few weeks.\n\n[b]Mustafa Traders:[/b]\n\nHe had what I wanted. A used CF 98. His asking price was 34k. Did not bother to show me the weapon. Simply gave me his card and asked me to cal him back with my offer.  Had a Zigana F clone Pretty neat. At first sight I mistook it for the original. Asking 26k And a reasonable looking CF clone asking 20k \nHow he is with air guns. I guess Usama would be able to tell us further. Was not interested n procuring licenses or permits.\n\nWe went to [b]International Arms Company[/b] but they were out of stock of just about everything&#8230;. Very surprising really since the outlet was full of customers \nTried [b]Haji Abdur Rehman[/b] and same answer. They deal only in locals and asked us to come next week since their shipment is due then. \n\nThen it was [b]New Shaheen arms[/b]. The dealer claims to be a wholesaler. He had few weapons in stock. Offered us a CF for 41k. \nAnd a Zig clone that looked like a bloated TT in .30 bore. Refused to even consider helping out with 144 permits or had anything to do with licenses. Would not even have the weapon registered at the HD.  Just stamp the license and that&#8217;s it. \n\n[b]Moonstar Arms Company[/b]\n\nThey are Moon Star&#8217;s Factory outlet and have some excellent local shotguns. However Khan sahib is in a class all by himself. I am an old customer of his but he remembers the fact that I have visited his outlet without buying stuff&#8230; A few months back. \nHe had some really nice shotties. And I have heard that his Moonstar brand of local pistols are pretty good. me, Usama and MIG got a taste of his ''temper'' Even though I am old customer he really does not like people who come and browse and not buy. Even though MIG bought a couple of mags (TT local) from him he was not mollified.\n When I wanted to see some stuff the sahib said something in pusto to the attendant and they started laughing at us..\nthe 3 of us. viz. Usama , Mig and I were scolded as well.. He won&#8217;t even take a gun out of the window. I had to do this myself. and as regards handguns. I kept telling him how much his Berretta clone is appreciated and how it has a reputation of being amongst the best clones in the market. before I managed to coax him to let me see it.\nits so freaking difficult getting him to show something on his own. Last time I went to him I had mentioned that I have heard that his betty clones are good. But that was not reason enough to persuade him to show em to me.. \n\nThis time we was prepared. We told him that I have heard they are the very ''bestest-est'' clones in the market. And the rest are useless in comparison. And I have heard so much about em that I will definitely make em my SD/HD weapon. If he would consider them good enough for his purpose. Since he knows better then I do. Etc et. Then he consented to ask some1 to put a betty clone in front of me.\n\nPlease bear in mind that I am an old customer of his. And even now we purchased a couple of mags from him. He claimed that what ever local stuff we buy he can give it cheaper. But &#8220;Tum loag Pathan per aitbaar nahi karta&#8221;  U people don&#8217;t trust pathans.. Heck had I not trusted him I would never have bought from him. His Saiga 12 clone final rate was 22k and for the AK style 20k . The betty clone was 20 as well. Don&#8217;t know much bout other clones since he never did show em.  Not interested in helping out with lics or permits an all that\nThe concept "The customer is always right" is as alien to him as Martians on the Lyari Expressway\n\n[url]http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cQDvBrVCCM&feature=g-vrec&context=G2c3afe7RVAAAAAAAADA[/url]\n A video of the Moonstar arms company manufacturing facility in KPK\n\n[b]Majid Latif and sons[/b]\nHe is a nice old man who remembered me from my vist a couple of months back. Had taken my number too. Fliped though the pages and found me there. Liked the fact that I patronized his shop. However barring a Danish pump action for 7.5k He had noting to display at that point in time. And unlike last time he was not forthcoming about lics and permits. But after some small talk he said things can be worked out. \n\nThis concluded the first part of our visit. Usama had to leave and me and Mig continued for our rendezvous  with Canik for our review of Tactical Arms.

What an activity, it gives you a new energy every time you do that. Being an amateur, to better understand the gun cleaning process further, I have few humble questions :\n\nOne, as Abbbas Bhai said "even if you fire one round, 500 or 1000, the gun should be cleaned afterwards", so how often this stripping should be done?\nSecond, since the firing pin and the firing pin springs, both are in a concealed chamber, how to service/lubricate this mechanism?\nThird, how to clean/lubricate the trigger as well as ejection mechanism, and how often it can/would be done?\nFourth, what if the gun is not fired at all after the previous servicing, does it need the same servicing after being kept idle, if yes, how often?\nFifth, are there any harms involved due to striping or it is as simple as we take bath after removing our cloths and then put them on, no damages;)\nSixth, even if all parts assembled properly, can the gun malfunction even then, just due to the striping and cleaning exercise (As according to a friend)?\nSeventh, again according to the same friend, this should only be done by a gunsmith:ban:, what you say?\nEighth, after this energizing work (for both the gun and the enthusiast), how to test the gun if it is working fine, when you don''t have a choice to go to the range or can''t even shoot a bullet instantly? Is testing after service is a must, or you just can be confident that it will work fine and no malfunctions will occur?\nNinth, if there could be any malfunctions due to striping only, what could be these as regarding SD, this means life?', 1, 0, '175.110.157.102', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

Sometimes they are set at the factory so they are very sensitive to jarring/movement. If the screw moves slight left or right (turns), it can switch between ejecting and non ejecting.

Yours is a fairly simple question that requires quite a detailed answer.\n\nWe will start with pistols\n\nThere are different types of safties for different guns. First lets go though the kinds of hand guns in the \n the Pakistani market while keeping your budget in mind\n\n SA\n\nSA (Single Action) \n\nThe single action pistol requires that you cock it I.e pull back the hammer before the first shot. The trigger only releases the hammer but does not pull it back.  Every subsequent shot will automatically cock the weapon and U dont have to pull it back every time. \n\nThe most common example of this system is the Tokerov Tule model of 1933 Commonly reffered to as the TT. It has an 7 shot magazine and is the least expensive item around.. rates start from 4k (Used pak made) to 40k (Zastava & Russian) The most common is the Chinese TT costing 20k approx. NIB (new in box)\n\nDA (Double Action)\n\nIn this type of weapon the Trigger is capable of pulling back the hammer as well as releasing it. Most 9mms in your budget are DAs\n\nNow on to safeties\n\nInternal safeties:\n\nFiring pin block\n\nA firing pin block is a mechanical block used in semi-automatic firearms and some revolvers that, when at rest, obstructs forward travel of the firing pin, but is linked to the trigger mechanism and clears the obstruction to the pin just before the hammer or striker is released. This prevents the firing pin from striking a chambered cartridge unless the trigger is pulled, even if the hammer is released due to a faulty sear or the pin is dropped or struck by another object.\n\nHammer block\n\nA hammer block is similar to a firing pin block. It is a latch, block or other obstruction built into the action and normally positioned to prevent the hammer contacting the cartridge primer or firing pin when at rest. Similar to the firing pin block, the obstruction to the hammer''s travel is removed as a consequence of pulling the trigger. This allows the hammer to contact the primer or firing pin only when the trigger is pulled.\n\nDecocker: A decocke is lever that when manipulated correctly will decock the weapon I.e switch it from SA to DA mode\n\nExternal safety: This feature when applied effectively either blocks the firing mechanism or disconnects it all together. \n\nLCI (Loaded chamber indicator) It shows if there is a round in the chamber or not.\n\nThe TT has none of the above safety features. No firing pn block no hammer block no decocker. if u drop it it wil fire if U decock it and your hand slips it will fire. It does have a hammer half cock safety, but if the weapon falls on the hammer it may disengage. \n\nCanik C100/L120 are pretty nice guns clones of the formidable CZ line up. They are equipped with a manual safety But no decocker. I.e u have to decock the weapon manually with your thumb..  highly accurate Price around 50k\n\nThe NP 22/ NP34 / HP77 series\n\nthese are also around 44 to 50k or so NIB excellent weapons Made in china. SIG clones..Very sturdy.. very realiable bult like tanks spacialy the HP77 A big heavy all steel affair.  Unlike the Caniks They do have Decockers.. but no manual safety. i.e If u are carrying with a round in the chamber there is no lever to flip on or off. u simply  point and shoot. The long heavy  double action trigger pull is considered safety enough.\nHighly reliable \n\nCF 98\n\nStandard side arm of the Chinese army.. It is light waight and has low felt recoil and muzzle flip (partly cause of its rotary berral mechanism) It has both a decocker and a manual safety lever and a firing pin safety as well as loaded chamber indicator. price 40 to 44k\n\nTP 9 a bit over your budget starting from 55k on words. \n\nVery Very light waight easy to carry comes wiht 2 different holsters and different grips for differnt hand sizes. Has a decocker but no manual (external safety)  No one knows much about this gun since no one at the forum has fired it yet.\n\nGirsan M 23. A Berreta 92 clone.. Comparatively rare but a clone of the berreta 92 the standard side arm of the amarican army. hass both a decocker and manual safety\n\nAll the above guns have magazine capacity of around 15 or so round about. give or take a couple of rounds.', 1, 1, '59.103.197.229', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

Striker fired guns have various built-in safeties but very few would come with an external safety or decocker. It boils down to what you feel comfortable with and, more importantly, what you think you can handle safely.\n\nAs a newbie to the gun world, and this is just my opinion, one should lean towards hammer fired weapons that have external safeties and decockers. The Stoeger would be a good example of something like that. Taurus also make quite a few guns that fit the bill here but you probably need to handle each gun to see which best fits your hand and the purpose.\n\nIn addition you may also want to consider barel length in your assessment for range and HD use.

External hammers can be manipulated for manual decocking if the option is not available on the gun. Striker fired guns have various built-in safeties but very few would come with an external safety or decocker. It boils down to what you feel comfortable with and, more importantly, what you think you can handle safely.\n\nAs a newbie to the gun world, and this is just my opinion, one should lean towards hammer fired weapons that have external safeties and decockers. The Stoeger would be a good example of something like that. Taurus also make quite a few guns that fit the bill here but you probably need to handle each gun to see which best fits your hand and the purpose.\n\nIn addition you may also want to consider barel length in your assessment for range and HD use.

But if your a timid guy then even a cougar might be showing from behind your clothes.\r\n\r\nFor S.D and H.D it depends on the situation in which the user is IMHO........most of the times the enemy would be in your face in SD situation hence you''ll need a gun which you can get your hands on quickly, hold firmly plus easily and instantly put the bugger down with a bullet.\r\n\r\nNow home defense can be like a medium range shoot out between you and the bugger for which you might require a gun which is accurate beyond 25meters!!\r\nWell this is what i think.........not saying this is the real core principal!\r\n\r\nAs far as external hammer and internat hammer thing goes, toh what i''ve learned from my uncle''s who are gun enthusiasts is that the ammo we get in pakistan usually is of low quality which screws up guns with internal hammers.

I met Naveed bhai with PG Members coming out of Hira Arms as I was getting ready to go in.  Soon after Ahnab arrived there as well with Rmishaq on the way to Nila as well.  We figured hey plenty of time... God was I wrong to think that everything was fine....\nIshaq bhai called up from Para and asked me to hurry over there.  As Ahnab and I got up and looked outside... words can''t come to mind the sight we were seeing.  Both his Honda City and My Civic were surrounded by atleast 2.5feet of water (thats higher than the door floor sill).  Soo we ran opened the door to get in and quite a bit of water entered the car with us.  As we started the car and backed out of parking I noticed the car was floating more than driving... lolz.  We drove out and the water kept on rising till NOT EVEN THE WHEELS of the car were showing anymore.  A bus passed me and the water WAVE not splash WAVE made my front hood disappear for a sec giving me the scare that something might short out or in my case (driving auto) the car might shut down.  I called Ishaq up and said sorry lets get the heck outta here.  He too left out.  Ahnab called me on the phone and told me to follow him out and lets go to his house.  By that time, water had entered the car to the point where from the knees down I couldn''t see anything.  Still the car kept on going as did Ahnab''s.  It took us two hours to get from Hira to GORII.  RmIshaq got home at about 9:30pm a good 5 hours stuck in traffic.  As soon as I got to Ahnab''s home, I started to drain water out of my car with the car started... then the car finally gave out and died.  Called an electrician, he came about an hour or so later, there was a contact point which was shorted as the water did finally seep in the circuitry.  I finally got to leave lahore (took a chance) at about 10pm.  And got home at about 3am.  Today the entire day has been spent dis-assembling and washing out the interior of the car.\nI would like to apologize and say thanks to Ahnab (thanks again for taking me to your home, meal and the mechanic) & Rmishaq (its because of me they missed the GTG, its also because of me that they were at Nilagumbad that their cars got damaged).  I would also like to say thanks to Abbas bhai for offering me a car and driver for tow to anywhere.  Denovo bhai thanks for offering to pick us up, we mainly refused because you too would have missed the GTG by being stuck in the ridiculous traffic.\nAnd now for pics....\n[IMG]http://i1109.photobucket.com/albums/h427/pyramids99/8-2.jpg[/IMG]\nimage taken upon finally entering a road with no water.\n[url]http://youtu.be/9Q3cBPiYspQ[/url]\nvideo taken after reaching Ahnab''s house two hours later\n[IMG]http://i1109.photobucket.com/albums/h427/pyramids99/5-1.jpg[/IMG]\ntaking things apart this morning\n[IMG]http://i1109.photobucket.com/albums/h427/pyramids99/6-3.jpg[/IMG]\ntaking more water out of car\n[IMG]http://i1109.photobucket.com/albums/h427/pyramids99/3-7.jpg[/IMG]\n[IMG]http://i1109.photobucket.com/albums/h427/pyramids99/2-7.jpg[/IMG]\n[IMG]http://i1109.photobucket.com/albums/h427/pyramids99/1-9.jpg[/IMG]\n[IMG]http://i1109.photobucket.com/albums/h427/pyramids99/7-1.jpg[/IMG]', 1, 1, '58.65.182.65', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

We had a pre Iftar gup shup session followed by a great Iftar menu, prayers followed by an even better dinner.

I have always maintained that a person''s knowledge and experience is useless and he is indeed selfish if he doesn''t pass on and teach what he knows to his community and peers. That is that only way forward to grow into and surpass world class firearms enthusiasts as not everyone can afford (in time, or in money, or in experience) what a few have the luxury to learn. It is the duty and greatness of those fortunate few to pass it on so the community can learn and grow.   \n\nI would also request guests and friends to look at our GTG pictures and note the quality of our members MashAllah.

All of us PakGunners would go out of our way to educate our friends, family & peers on proper firearm responsibility & use. \n\n@Ka_Khan Thank you, you were missed as always.

Which one is good for everyday use conceal carry??\n\nIs Glock 19 really worth the extra money??[/QUOTE]\n\nThe Glocks are really what you can call a "Gadha Mar" Pistols, shoot a 1000 rounds non-stop and they won''t die ( provided with proper cartridges , not those darra reloads ). On the other hand, the problem I''ve faced with glocks ( own a 17 ) is that they''re  made of polymer frame, that makes them light, which on  one hand makes it an easy carry , and is the pistol of choice for many police officers around the globe, it backfires. Backfires in the sense that the balance is not that good and you actually feel the blowback/recoil much more. \n\nCZ75s however, while being made of all metal, are heavy, but I like the balance and grip on them, and hence are very good to shoot. So if you''re looking for a concealed carry and self defense, get a glock ( even Gen 3 is equally as good ). But if weight is not an issue, and if I were you, I''d rather look into other options like Beretta 92FS or Taurus 917 as well. At the end of the day, the decision is up to you. Glock 17/19 has so many mods, but you''ll always be stuck with the same polymer frame and the grip is a bit tricky. I like the grip on CZ75 and also the balance.

Onwards to the discussion on safeties and guns with safeties causing majority of ND; my NCC instructor in college once said (loosely translated into English because typing roman punjabi on the phone is difficult) "a guns'' safe usage is directly proportional to the experience and intelligence of the wielder" ... Although certain terms he used were not polite so this is a verrry lose translation :)\nCase being, and no offence to anybody who got hurt, incorrect handling of a gun is the cause of negligent discharge not the presence/absence of safeties.

Apologies for that.\n\nThat being said, the argument here is the premise that if the presence of safety on a gun is useless because people have had NDs with guns that have safeties. That''s akin to saying that, since car accidents happen because people fail to apply the brake in time, we should not have brakes in cars. So instead of trying to address the improper usage we end up increasing the probability of an incident....hmmm!!! I''m unable to connect the dots there but that''s probably because I''m not that we''ll versed with guns without a safety or decocker anyway.\n\nYour preference for not having safeties on guns is just that: a preference. In the context of a discussion and putting it forward as a "point of view", especially from a senior members like yourself who actually hold a lot of weight for me along with other newbies and amateurs, there should be some sound reasoning behind it.\nYou''re right in saying that this discussion is for another thread and I''m also not the best qualified to pursue this further coz I just used up all of my knowledge on the subject :). I leave this to your expertise and experience.[/QUOTE]\n\nAOA,I agree with Mr.AK47, and I think most people missed the  point, the point isnt that people get into accidents in cars due to failing to apply brakes in time, its becuz people are careless/reckless/sleepy/drunk/complacent/over speeding in a residential area etc, so in that case hving brakes or not isn''t going to change the outcome( i.e the car getting in an accident).  \nThere is a reason why people that hv handled firearms all their lives religiously insist on people obeying the 4 laws of Gun safety, none of which include buying guns with multiple mechanical safeties :\nThe 1st Law - The Gun Is Always Loaded!\nThe 2nd Law - Never Point The Gun At Something You Are Not Prepared To Destroy!\nThe 4th Law - Keep Your Finger Off The Trigger Until Your Sights Are On The Target!\n\nEVERY SINGLE ND involves a violation of one of these 3, irrespective of how many safeties a gun has on it. ND''s tend to be rare events at Gun ranges becuz people are being Careful, and then they go home/go out and start ignoring these laws. These Rules are to be applied Everywhere. \n[b]People Suggesting a Certain Gun is Safe to Handle compared to Another becuz of Number of Safeties , are wholly missing the point.[/b]\n\nNow just to over-blow the whole Safeties on a gun debate thing ,with a gun hving multiple Safeties, All engaged It would be really safe if u carried the gun in a Safe in your car, with the Key hidden in Another Safe inside your home , and  Effectively , reducing the probabality of a ND to Zero, And ALSO limiting the usefulness of ur SD Weapon to Zero too.\n\nAll in All, If u plan on being complacent/casual, get a gun with multiple manual safeties, but remember that will never mean ur gun is Now SAFE in all circumstances (in All honesty, people that become complacent are the ones that get into ND situations, some just outa pure bad luck, and a some due to bad/broken/non-functional Safeties.)\n\nTrue Safety doesn''t exist, u can only minimize the Risk''s, not by buying a gun with multiple safeties, But by practising the 4 laws of safe gun handling ( and not depending on mechanical Safeties to Always work , at all time) .\n\nback on topic ,the tp 9 seems like a promising entry. But I didn''t really like the finishing on it :(  \nRegards.', 1, 0, '182.177.209.103', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

Regarding your question, Well the cheapest and reliable handgun would be CF98, But i would recommend you to increase you budget slightly and go for Baikal Viking MP446. There is no gun in Pakistan which is as well built as this Russian tank. Not a big fan of Stoegar''s. Although its pretty reliable, but it''s not a very accurate gun because of its rotating barrel. Zigana''s are also good guns but nothing beats Mp446. Yes you can use lasers and lights on you handguns but no silencers. You can overcome you fear of noise in 2 ways. First use earmuffs, if they don''t work then wear the earmuffs and load your handgun with live rounds mixed with snap caps. As you friend to load the mag randomly with a live round and a snap cap without you knowing. This practice will not only help you overcome you fear of noise but also help you overcoming with the flinching issues.', 1, 0, '119.154.212.223', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

I love it when we have such open debates! :) Seriously, one gets to learn so much!\n\nWhen I first started CC-ing (I''ve always carried chambered since day one), I used to do so with the safety on. Now, considering that in a DA/SA gun the "hammer down" itself is a safety of sorts, I still felt I wasn''t a mature or experienced enough operator to carry with the safety off. But with the passage of time (and after God knows how many draw drills), I eventually felt that I''m now competent enough to start carrying with the safety off.\n\nI think (and this is strictly my personal opinion), how an individual feels regarding safeties is directly dependant on his/her experience with firearms in general and how comfortable he/she is with a specific gun in particular.

Regarding your question, Well the cheapest and reliable handgun would be CF98, But i would recommend you to increase you budget slightly and go for Baikal Viking MP446. There is no gun in Pakistan which is as well built as this Russian tank. Not a big fan of Stoegar''s. Although its pretty reliable, but it''s not a very accurate gun because of its rotating barrel. Zigana''s are also good guns but nothing beats Mp446. Yes you can use lasers and lights on you handguns but no silencers. You can overcome you fear of noise in 2 ways. First use earmuffs, if they don''t work then wear the earmuffs and load your handgun with live rounds mixed with snap caps. As you friend to load the mag randomly with a live round and a snap cap without you knowing. This practice will not only help you overcome you fear of noise but also help you overcoming with the flinching issues.[/QUOTE]', 1, 0, '182.186.43.82', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

I had a look at the Zastava but even the compact version is not completely a CCW. So after visiting most shops the Cz P-01 fitted in my hand like it was made for me and I felt goose bumps in my stomach whilst holding it. Wow Bros its beautiful and the design is sleek. Thank You Leon bro for getting me discount and also advising me. I also liked the Cz Rami and if I get another license made then I will be buying a Rami.\nAnyway theres not much choice in the shops due to import issues.

Why do I say so ? No magic involved, I like Canik products personally, slide to frame fitting was passable, trigger was average, it''s almost a copy of a successful/reliable design, finishing was decent, sights I thought were below average, grip angle was decent, slide was good, frame was average, minor other things etc and a little bit of experience thrown in. \n\nIf you notice, I''m rating most of the important things as average then why would I think it''s a good gun ?? The answer is: Value. Price is what ultimately decides if a gun is successful. I, for example have sold all my Glocks because I simply cannot justify to myself the price they command in Pakistan. Similarly a few PakGunners were sitting the other day and we all agreed that PakGuns and Pakistan would be having an unending love affair with Caracal if it had launched at 65,000 instead of 150,000.

Stick to decent pellets, be it Gamo as that is far better than these. I''ll post some pictures later today regarding accuracy at approx 18 yards using Gamo Promagnums and Crosman Premeir HPs. Although the promagnums did not do well compared to the CPHPs but still i''d stick with these if i had to choose between these and the local/irani/afghan pellets.

And it is complete code of life, we can find many teachings which are directly related to subject and object of the PakGuns. For example, Islam strictly prohibits aiming a weapon towards a believer, Islam encourages having weapons etc and many more of such beautiful information provided by Islam. Which All PakGunners should know including me.\nSo, I very humbly request and suggest you that kindly Islamic discussions should be made and allowed, who knows how many get guidance and Abbas Bh you will be rewarded for that. Also, it will be a source of spreading the message of Islam. \n\n2ndly, Can you kindly tell me that is it possible to get Non-Prohibited bore handgun on a prohibited bore licence. As I am allowed to get Prohibited bore licence, so what do you suggest that I got PB Licence and then get NPB handgun on it or for that I have to get another NPB licence? and are the licence are issued now days? ( I mean koi ban to impose nai aaj kal?) Thanks.\n\nHope to see your kind and positive reply quite soon.

I owned guns from glock, cz, colt, para,detonix etc. etc..

They just use a brush/cleaning liquid through the barrel and around the firing pin area, wipe the gun down with a cloth and store it. It does work but stripping the gun is highly recommended after shooting as that''s the proper way to clean your gun. It takes hardly a few seconds and makes cleaning much easier. \n\n[QUOTE]\nSecond, since the firing pin and the firing pin springs, both are in a concealed chamber, how to service/lubricate this mechanism?[/QUOTE]\n\nSome guns have removable firing pins (CZ TS etc) which come out easily without any disassembly required. But not really needed for most people as they tend to gunk up or start giving problems after 3,500 to 5,000 rounds. \n\n[QUOTE]\nThird, how to clean/lubricate the trigger as well as ejection mechanism, and how often it can/would be done?[/QUOTE]\n\nI use a hard brush or an old toothbrush to clean the trigger, no need for disassembly. As for lubriction, one or two drops of oil on the trigger spring is enough. \n[QUOTE]\n\nFourth, what if the gun is not fired at all after the previous servicing, does it need the same servicing after being kept idle, if yes, how often?[/QUOTE]\n\nNot really for years if cleaned/lubricated properly before storage but I take my guns out every 6 months or so and inspect for signs of rust, wipe them down, re lubricate and store again.\n\n[QUOTE]\nFifth, are there any harms involved due to striping or it is as simple as we take bath after removing our cloths and then put them on, no damages;) [/QUOTE]\n\nNo harm, these guns are supposed to be stripped and cleaned. It''s not "a" way to do it, it''s "the" way.\n[QUOTE]\nSixth, even if all parts assembled properly, can the gun malfunction even then, just due to the striping and cleaning exercise (As according to a friend)?[/QUOTE]\n\nAny machinery can malfunction but due to stripping and cleaning, no. The simple rule is just disassemble what you need to and understand how to put back together. It''s not complicated, gun designers have made it ridiculously simple. \n\n[QUOTE]\nSeventh, again according to the same friend, this should only be done by a gunsmith:ban:, what you say?[/QUOTE]\n\nA detailed strip, yes. A field strip (general cleaning) like the one shown above no. \n\n[QUOTE]\nEighth, after this energizing work (for both the gun and the enthusiast), how to test the gun if it is working fine, when you don''t have a choice to go to the range or can''t even shoot a bullet instantly? Is testing after service is a must, or you just can be confident that it will work fine and no malfunctions will occur?[/QUOTE]\n\nAfter you reassemble your gun, just do a function check but without any ammo. i.e rack the slide a couple of times, point in a safe direction and shoot. If it fires properly it will fire properly at the range as well.\n\n[QUOTE]Ninth, if there could be any malfunctions due to striping only, what could be these as regarding SD, this means life?[/QUOTE]\n\nNo, these guns are meant to be taken apart for cleaning. Once put back together and function checked they will perform fine.\n\nRegards,\n\n@PA Thank you.', 1, 0, '117.102.39.179', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

Much much better looking gun than the Baikal Mp153 which initially amused me (but was in short supply in the market). The guns aesthetics are great, and the thinner forearm provides a comfortable grip. Also I like how the gun is so light even in wood stock.\n\nThis is no review, but just my initial impressions. I''m not so familiar with shotgun terms, just enjoy shooting them so pardon me for any mis-quotes. Also the review done by 12GAUGE is far more informative.\n\nThe checkering/engraving is commendable for such a cheap shotgun. Taking advantage of the sling swivels, I attached a sling to it for easier handling while out on strolls. The sling, along with a basic cleaning kit I received complementary from Mustafa at Badruddin (where I purchased it) and it sure is a great good-will gesture.\n \nI like the design of the magazine cut-off compared to the one on the Mp153.\n\nI chose wood stock as it''s quite beautiful in wood, while the same in the fibre/plastic stock looks ugly as hell.\n\nAlong with the gun I got 5 chokes, M, IM, IC, F, and I think the one currently fitted on the barrel is a skeet choke (Cylinder skeet)?? \nThere were 4 stock shims too in the box with chokes,  to adjust stock drop and cast. (not familiar with them though)\nThe magazine capacity is 4+1 originally, but since the gun comes with a mag extension tube - the capacity can be made 7+1.\n\nIt has a 76mm/3" chamber and a 28" barrel. The gun is capable of ''eating & spitting'' lighter skeet loads to 3" magnum rounds with auto adjustments in the gas piston.\n\nThe rubber recoil pad seems quite thin but surely would reduce felt recoil by 15-20%?\n\nI heard I need to clean the gun of lubricants before shooting sessions, and oil metal parts and the firing pin area (after passing cloth with a rod through the barrel). Is this all, or should I do more to maintain it?\n\nAlong with the gun got some skeets, Shaheen #4, #6, SG, and Victory slugs. But haven''t had time to shoot it, maybe within a week.\n\nHere''s some pics... alot of them.\n\nThe box seems attractive\n[IMG]http://i1203.photobucket.com/albums/bb399/B77W/hatsanescort001.jpg[/IMG]\n\nWhich aftermarket recoil pad do you suggest?\n[IMG]http://i1203.photobucket.com/albums/bb399/B77W/hatsanescort002.jpg[/IMG]\n\n[IMG]http://i1203.photobucket.com/albums/bb399/B77W/hatsanescort003.jpg[/IMG]\n\n[IMG]http://i1203.photobucket.com/albums/bb399/B77W/hatsanescort004.jpg[/IMG]\n\n[IMG]http://i1203.photobucket.com/albums/bb399/B77W/hatsanescort006.jpg[/IMG]\n\n[IMG]http://i1203.photobucket.com/albums/bb399/B77W/hatsanescort007.jpg[/IMG]\n\n[IMG]http://i1203.photobucket.com/albums/bb399/B77W/hatsanescort008.jpg[/IMG]\n\n[IMG]http://i1203.photobucket.com/albums/bb399/B77W/hatsanescort013.jpg[/IMG]\nSaddlers gun case and ctg belt\n[IMG]http://i1203.photobucket.com/albums/bb399/B77W/hatsanescort014.jpg[/IMG]\n\n[IMG]http://i1203.photobucket.com/albums/bb399/B77W/hatsanescort017.jpg[/IMG]\n\n[IMG]http://i1203.photobucket.com/albums/bb399/B77W/hatsanescort019.jpg[/IMG]\n\n\nPlease enlighten regarding choke usage, which choke/ctg combination to use on which game (quail, partridge, pigeon, rabbit, duck, goose, boar) at particular ranges.

I am sure you will enjoy this shotgun for a very long time. now coming to the questions that you have asked:\r\n\r\n1. take the choke out, if its marked Sk, then its skeet. otherwise it could be a cylinder choke if shows CL or no marking on it.\r\n\r\n2. Bro, the choice of aftermarket recoil pad depends upon many factors such as gun fit.  autoloaders usually do not need recoil pads therefore it is not wise to spend money on an expensive accessory, especially if you are not looking to change some important gun characteristic such as length of pull etc.,\r\n\r\nstill if you bent on getting an aftermarket recoil pad then my recommendations would be:\r\n\r\n>>>>stick with the original thickness of the pad if you are comfortable with the length of pull.\r\n\r\n>>>>instead of going for super expensive and high performance recoil pads such as Limbsaver and Kickeez, try to get a pachmyer old english skeet pad. its looker way better than any limbsaver or kickeez pad I have ever seen. its recoil performance may not be up to par with the two big names but since the said gun is an autoloader, you do not need a canon to kill a bird. for your purpose,  pachmyer old english skeet pad works way better than any factory supplied recoil pad.\r\n\r\n3. nopes! not much is required in terms of cleaning. kindly refer to a shotgun cleaning thread for a detailed cleaning one you reach a certain round count.\r\n\r\n4. for quail and partridge use Improved Cylinder (IC), for pigeon use Improved Cylinder or Modified (depends upon shooting conditions such as range), for Duck Improved Cylinder or Modified, for Rabbit use Modified and for Boar use Improved Modified.\r\n\r\nI personally never recommend full choke. I don''t know why but I have always found full choke''s pattern to be less than ideal in most shotguns. in my humble opinion, tighter chokes require a much higher degree of manufacturing quality and most shotgun makers tend to put quality chokes at the lowest priority. now you know why aftermarket choke tube manufacturers thrive in this highly competitive industry.\r\n\r\n5. don''t shoot the gun without a choke tube installed. nothing will happen but you run the risk of damaging fine choke tube threads.\r\n\r\n6. you use a choke wrench. besides, you hardly need to change the choke tube during a hunt. unless you put in a wrong tube for the job in the first place.\r\n\r\n7. you may use any choke tube for buckshots. your range, pattern performance and personal preference will decide which choke to ultimately use.\r\n\r\n8. modern slugs are said to be safe in any degree of choke. however just to be on the extra safe side, its better to use more open chokes such as Cylinder, Skeet, Improved Modified. I have always found that slugs perform better when there is just a slight degree of choke. it kinda promote consistency in the flight path of slug when it leaves the muzzle. I would suggest start with Improved Cylinder. at times, Cylinder/Skeet gives better results. anyways, you''ll have to test them at a range to know for sure.\r\n\r\nRegards.', 1, 1, '39.47.66.173', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

You guys did a great job and we were also fortunate enough to experience infighting between the importers/investors resulting in cancellation of almost all middle men and direct sales by one party to the market. \n\nI would however request that any such future ''molestations'' not be taken out very soon. :) One per year is enough.\n\nThe 1100 round test was more of an attempt to destroy the gun that no owner would willingly do to their weapon. I could never really comment on accuracy as after what I put the gun/barrel though, that gun could not represent Caracal guns as a whole. \n\nWould also request you guys that since Caracal has come down to your desired price range, let''s now drop any preconceptions and judge the gun on merit and with an open mind. Otherwise it sends a really bad signal to the firearms manufacturers/importers/dealers as in the past about 75 % of Caracal discussions were over price and the members who had bought one are having to defend their choice/purchase.\n\nDo you think Caracal (regardless of it''s price) would want purchasers of it''s products to have to defend themselves specially when they went out on a limb to offer us something which is unheard of in Pakistani gun markets ?\n\nI want firearms manufacturers and dealers to keep on offering us weapons to test as it''s great for our forum and a honour for us. We have to be politically correct sometimes, this whole Caracal bit did show off the power of the forum but lost us CZ advertising and CZ products to test whose deal was almost in the finalization stages. CZ guys and the importer saw what we were doing to Caracal pricing and how potent the forum is and suddenly backed out as bottom line the importer likes his margins and the manufacturer would not want forum admin/management dissing products where they are being advertised. \n\nI mentioned to all you guys in our conversation in person about CZ but never really gave details of the deal. Let me give details so you guys can better understand what we lost to gain the 65K Caracal. \n\nCZ offered us Rs. 250,000/year for one medium size CZ banner on our homepage. Access to all new CZ products on first import, discounts and promotions for PakGuns members i.e we would have been able to offer 5 CZ Duty''s for Rs. 60 K, two months later 5 CZ Shadows for 75 K, two months later 5 Tac Sports for 90K etc. Import of cheap ammo (Rs. 35 fixed for Privi/S&B), funds and help to setup a CZ PakGuns range in partnership. \n\nFantastic isn''t it ? :) Anyway, I did try to pursue the guy but he sort of avoided me. I think we''ll put 12G on his case as he can handle and convince him on a more ''sustained'' basis . After Eid when convenient to 12G, will setup a meeting with that guy for both of us here in Lahore and introduce you. I''m sure you can convince him and follow up with him better that I.\n\nIn the end, I understand and congratulate what you guys achieved.

As the shot leaves the barrel it begins to disperse in the air. The resulting cloud of pellets is known as the shot [URL="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pattern"]pattern[/URL], or [URL="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shotgun_shell#Spread"]shotgun shot spread[/URL]. The ideal pattern would be a circle with an even distribution of shot throughout, with a density sufficient to ensure enough pellets will intersect the target to achieve the desired result, such as a kill when hunting or a break when shooting clay targets. In reality the pattern is closer to a [URL="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution"]Gaussian[/URL], or normal distribution, with a higher density in the center that tapers off at the edges. Patterns are usually measured by firing at a 30 inch (76 cm) diameter circle on a large sheet of paper placed at varying distances. The hits inside the circle are counted, and compared to the total number of pellets, and the density of the pattern inside the circle is examined. An "ideal" pattern would put nearly 100% of the pellets in the circle and would have no voids—any region where a target silhouette will fit and not cover 3 or more holes is considered a potential problem.[/FONT][/COLOR]\n[COLOR=#000000][FONT=sans-serif]A constriction in the end of the barrel known as the choke is used to tailor the pattern for different purposes. Chokes may either be formed as part of the barrel at the time of manufacture, by squeezing the end of the bore down over a[URL="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandrel"]mandrel[/URL], or by threading the barrel and screwing in an interchangeable choke tube. The choke typically consists of a conical section that smoothly tapers from the bore diameter down to the choke diameter, followed by a cylindrical section of the choke diameter. Briley Manufacturing, a maker of interchangeable shotgun chokes, uses a conical portion about 3 times the bore diameter in length, so the shot is gradually squeezed down with minimal deformation. The cylindrical section is shorter, usually 0.6 to 0.75 inches (15 to 19 mm). The use of interchangeable chokes has made it easy to tune the performance of a given combination of shotgun and shotshell to achieve the desired performance.[/FONT][/COLOR]\n[COLOR=#000000][FONT=sans-serif]The choke should be tailored to the range and size of the targets. A skeet shooter, shooting at close targets might use 127 micrometres (0.005 inches) of constriction to produce a 76 cm (30 inch) diameter pattern at a distance of 19 m (21 yards). A [URL="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trap_shooting"]trap[/URL] shooter, shooting at distant targets might use 762 micrometres (0.030 inches) of constriction to produce a 76 cm (30 inch) diameter pattern at 37 m (40 yards). Special chokes for turkey hunting, which requires long range shots at the small head and neck of the bird, can go as high as 1500 micrometres (0.060 inches). The use of too much choke and a small pattern increases the difficulty of hitting the target, the use of too little choke produces large patterns with insufficient pellet density to reliably break targets or kill game. "Cylinder barrels" have no constriction.

Some turkey hunting tubes have constrictions greater than "Super Full", or additional features like porting to reduce recoil, or "straight rifling" that is designed to stop any spin that the shot column might acquire when traveling down the barrel. These tubes are often extended tubes, meaning they project beyond the end of the bore, giving more room for things like a longer conical section. Shot spreaders or diffusion chokes work opposite of normal chokes—they are designed to spread the shot more than a cylinder bore, generating wider patterns for very short range use. A number of recent spreader chokes, such as the Briley "Diffusion" line, actually use rifling in the choke to spin the shot slightly, creating a wider spread. The Briley Diffusion uses a 1 in 36 cm twist, as does the FABARM Lion Paradox shotgun.\n\n[/FONT][/COLOR]', 1, 1, '39.52.63.120', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

Much much better looking gun than the Baikal Mp153 which initially amused me (but was in short supply in the market). The guns aesthetics are great, and the thinner forearm provides a comfortable grip. Also I like how the gun is so light even in wood stock.\n\nThis is no review, but just my initial impressions. I''m not so familiar with shotgun terms, just enjoy shooting them so pardon me for any mis-quotes. Also the review done by 12GAUGE is far more informative.\n\nThe checkering/engraving is commendable for such a cheap shotgun. Taking advantage of the sling swivels, I attached a sling to it for easier handling while out on strolls. The sling, along with a basic cleaning kit I received complementary from Mustafa at Badruddin (where I purchased it) and it sure is a great good-will gesture.\n\nI like the design of the magazine cut-off compared to the one on the Mp153.\n\nI chose wood stock as it''s quite beautiful in wood, while the same in the fibre/plastic stock looks ugly as hell.\n\nAlong with the gun I got 5 chokes, M, IM, IC, F, and I think the one currently fitted on the barrel is a skeet choke (Cylinder skeet)?? \nThere were 4 stock shims too in the box with chokes, to adjust stock drop and cast. (not familiar with them though)\nThe magazine capacity is 4+1 originally, but since the gun comes with a mag extension tube - the capacity can be made 7+1.\n\nIt has a 76mm/3" chamber and a 28" barrel. The gun is capable of ''eating & spitting'' lighter skeet loads to 3" magnum rounds with auto adjustments in the gas piston.\n\nThe rubber recoil pad seems quite thin but surely would reduce felt recoil by 15-20%?\n\nI heard I need to clean the gun of lubricants before shooting sessions, and oil metal parts and the firing pin area (after passing cloth with a rod through the barrel). Is this all, or should I do more to maintain it?\n\nAlong with the gun got some skeets, Shaheen #4, #6, SG, and Victory slugs. But haven''t had time to shoot it, maybe within a week.\n\nHere''s some pics... alot of them.\n\nThe box seems attractive\n\nWhich aftermarket recoil pad do you suggest?\n\nSaddlers gun case and ctg belt\n\nPlease enlighten regarding choke usage, which choke/ctg combination to use on which game (quail, partridge, pigeon, rabbit, duck, goose, boar) at particular ranges.

After all the processes had been completed and a number of books were converted into cards.. The Sindh high court declared cards illigal.

Now these same cards have been declared "illigal" and have to be converted into "legal" books again that had been declared illigal in the first place but are now legel!!!\r\n\r\nThe task of issuing the computerised books has been delegated to NADRA once again. \r\nSupposedly.... \r\nNow wehter NADRA has the authority to issue these or eventualy the MOI (Like the sindh home department) will have to issue them is a moot point. right now its in the discussion stage. Now all those people who have their card MOI all Pak in the pipeline are not sure what they will get. if they get cards from Nadra the card wil have to be given back to nadra for conversion into books.. If they dont get cards but books. They wil have to wait since it wil take a long time before NADRA actualy starts printing book lics..  \r\n\r\nThe same confusion rests with PBs as well. \r\n\r\nWith the added problem that the political uncertainity wil render the actions of this govt. null and void in the next I.e the PB lics of the  govt might be declared illigal by the new one.\r\n\r\nmy email addy is in my profile', 1, 1, '116.71.62.204', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

Following examples will help you to understand.\n\nI received my manual license in Oct 09, and was renewed in Dec 09 (Same year) so in your case it is equally OK. BTW, you always enjoy one month grace period as well.\n   \nlicense will be automatically registered with the National Bank Of Pakistan when you will go for its renewal. the Bank cost is Rs 500 per year and you can pay for as much years as you wish.\n\nThana registration is compulsory and not optional as written on the licensee too and this is within the specific time. Just walk into the concerned police station and meet the Head Moharrar personally.  Rest will be taken care of by him. normally no charges. I registered two licenses (One Manual and One Computerized) with my concerned police station and no charges paid\n\nfor DCO registration, er buying the weapon, walk into the DCO office, meet the receptionist, submit your license and it will get registered on a manual journal.  please do register with the DCO as well because when you will go for a computerized copy, DCO verification will be asked by the Home Dept.\n\n Hope this will help you in your case.:smile:', 1, 0, '180.92.157.202', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

The MOI (Federal ministry of Interior) had declared all MOI issued  book licences illigal after a certain date and these had to be submitted to NADRA along with relevent documentation to be converted into "legal card licences".. After all the processes had been completed and a number of books were converted into cards.. The Sindh high court declared cards illigal. Soo Now the After the "illigal book licences" were converted into "legal" cards. Now these same cards have been declared "illigal" and have to be converted into "legal" books again that had been declared illigal in the first place but are now legel!!!The task of issuing the computerised books has been delegated to NADRA once again. Supposedly.... Now wehter NADRA has the authority to issue these or eventualy the MOI (Like the sindh home department) will have to issue them is a moot point. right now its in the discussion stage. Now all those people who have their card MOI all Pak in the pipeline are not sure what they will get. if they get cards from Nadra the card wil have to be given back to nadra for conversion into books.. If they dont get cards but books. They wil have to wait since it wil take a long time before NADRA actualy starts printing book lics..  The same confusion rests with PBs as well. With the added problem that the political uncertainity wil render the actions of this govt. null and void in the next I.e the PB lics of the  govt might be declared illigal by the new one.my email addy is in my profile[/QUOTE]Ed Bro, you yourself in intitial post said that Nadra is still making such licences....[QUOTE=Enigmatic Desires;287098]Actually NADRA is still making these licences in Sindh.

It all depends on situation to situation and place to place:\r\n\r\nYour Qs. 1) You will have read in internet sites that mallards and all other ducks you mentioned r attracted to mallard decoys and call of a mallard female ... I think this ain''t true for our situations here. Reason is we have a lot more gunning pressure here than in States coupled with the fact that mostly river hunting takes place here and as mallard is a bird of undisturbed marshes, this King of all ducks has unfortunately become increasingly scarce. ''Undisturbed marshes'' are a rare commodity here. Here it is advised thus to use the same decoys that you generally hunt. But most of times, good qlty pintail and teal decoys (12 each, though teals can be more) alongwith few (like 4 to 6 each) pochard & shoveler decoys are best combo for decoys. Bunch them together or bunch them according to species .. your decision ... but as Liano said, make open zone in bw for ducks to land. Reason: Puddle ducks do not fly over other ducks (decoys too) generally when coming and like to have their space to settle. Patterns of decoys spread is a lengthy debate but generally it is good to bunch one group of decoys along shore on right side of blind and one bunch on left side, with an open space in bw. Use 15 yards minimum distance from blind and maximum 30-35 yards (in general, though NO specifics can be claimed here).\r\n\r\n2) Spead 24-48 decoys (geese shells painted with same color in matte finish) in majority feeding pose and others resting ones with 2-4 sentries .. in same pattern as our geese  generally graze here in wheat fields. Do not follow the Americanized type patterns. If you intend to make two separate bunches, just use two bunches maximum .. one on either side of blind at considerable distance ... not near blind. Geese are wary. Use a distance of 25-40 yards from blind, no more than 40 yards for last decoy. And use a call. Same call as our species. I have four or five of them & they are deadly in pulling the flock at 10 yards distance from guns.. especially the feed chuckle which is a gr8 tool. I use silhouettes too (about 12-18)..try them ..they fill up the spread well. Use a very very dense blind, preferably few feet dug into ground (semi PIT blind).\r\n\r\n3) Answered in no.1 above.\r\n\r\n4) Call them only if you are a master caller and are using good quality duck calls and with the right tone. TONE and volume of call you use are very important. But...if you are not a master caller or an old hand, when birds spot the decoys at say about a 100-200 yards, stop calling and lie still and close to ground as possible with head down and wait for them to come in point blank range (10-25 yards) and then daz dazz dazzz ....\r\n\r\n5) Motion decoys are a delight to shoot with if one uses the right model and with appropriate placement. I have five motion decoys (battery/cell types) now which I experiment with at different times and have seen some patterns with their usage on ducks. The usual mallard male mojo with large metal flashing wings scares ducks off when ducks  are near hide..at least thats what we have seen here. Reason: they are common everywhere since last 1-2 yrs and give off a high flash with less rotation speed. That makes them a duck repelling instrument rather than an attractant. Even if one has them, use a remote to switch ''em off when ducks have spotted the decoys and are coming towards blind. Idea basically is to let them see decoys and spread and make an attractive looking space (from skies) in between the spread. NOTE: they will land AGAINST wind (almost always) when they finally decide to set their wings to land.\r\n\r\nI think that might address your confusion to an extent ... and settle your unease with not getting an answer  to your query ;)', 1, 0, '110.36.199.128', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

They are not particularly easy to accure thse days.. and sometimes they have the calibre marked on em. I.e 9mm... or .30 etc..\n\nMore ever theere are some excellent .22 revolvers around.. I tend not to go for a pistol with .22 rimfire rounds. Pistols are suseptable to FTFs with differnt loads with different pistols prefering different brands. Thats why I prefer wheel guns for those.. Generaly they go bang every time...\n\nHowever U might need a revolver lic for that.. So U see. the lic is waaay more important then the gun.. Contrary to what people new to fireems think. 1st getting the right weapon then going afte rthe licence.. its kind of like putting a cart before the horse.. \n\nIf U decide to get a .22 wheel gun U will need a lic for that. if U go for a 9mm pistol U mught need a differnt lic for that. or alternately u mignt need to change your old one.. \n\nSo first U have to decide which lic. then we can go about finding the right gun for that particular lic. \n\nAs a general rule we usually ask a newbie if he has a license before telling him all bout the guns he might be interested in... Because he wont even be able to see the weapon he might decide on, at the dealership. The dealers dont entertain people wihtout lics.. ANd until and unless one actualy feels a weapon in his hand the rest is reduntent..\n\n\n\nBtw the cougher was with rails. And a 63k SC wiht rails is as good as it gets these days. \n\nAs regards CF. I consider the CF better then teh cougher in terms of features if not fit & finish. Cause it has a loaded chamber indicator. \n\nTHe CF is a military fire arm so wil work wel wiht FMJs however it might give problems wiht JHPs.  \n\nThe CF is Made in China. Its a military fire arm so the fit and finish is strictly functional. CFs do have stiff controllevers. But not all. The cougher''s lever is not exactly soft either.. Ambidextous controls do tend to be stiff.. \n\nThe Cougher is made in tuerky by soeger a berreta subsidary. in fact the cougher is actualy a berreta. They just handed over production to the turks. and the magazines are still made in Italy.

And considering your post I think it is wise to go for the Provincial one.\n\nOK, but about your suggestion regarding revolvers, bro, honestly I feel I dont like revolvers, and prefer pistols, may be due to larger magazine capacity but what ever the reason is, I like pistols more than revolvers.\nAnd I found in this forum Walther P22 (dont know its current price) it is a .22 pistol and hope there will be others pistols in .22 too. \nSo do these also have FTF/FTE issues?\nAs a senior member from ISD, Br Moeen has had also Walther p22 and he said he didn''t have any issues and fired around 3000 rounds or so with it.\n\n[URL]http://www.pakguns.com/showthread.php?2758-P22-Walther&highlight=walther+p22[/URL]\n\nBut seriously I am a bit confused in selecting to which caliber should I go for? Because you suggested .22 for me to start and later go to 9mm etc. But also said that pistols in .22 have FTF etc issues...so :confused:\nAnd you also forgot to tell that is .22 good for SD/HD? also what is price difference bw 9mm and .22 ammunition?\nAnd later If I go to 9mm I also had to undergo the procedure of changing caliber on my licence.\nSo, 9mm or .22 still a complicated issue.

Much much better looking gun than the Baikal Mp153 which initially amused me (but was in short supply in the market). The guns aesthetics are great, and the thinner forearm provides a comfortable grip. Also I like how the gun is so light even in wood stock.\n\nThis is no review, but just my initial impressions. I''m not so familiar with shotgun terms, just enjoy shooting them so pardon me for any mis-quotes. Also the review done by 12GAUGE is far more informative.\n\nThe checkering/engraving is commendable for such a cheap shotgun. Taking advantage of the sling swivels, I attached a sling to it for easier handling while out on strolls. The sling, along with a basic cleaning kit I received complementary from Mustafa at Badruddin (where I purchased it) and it sure is a great good-will gesture.\n \nI like the design of the magazine cut-off compared to the one on the Mp153.\n\nI chose wood stock as it''s quite beautiful in wood, while the same in the fibre/plastic stock looks ugly as hell.\n\nAlong with the gun I got 5 chokes, M, IM, IC, F, and I think the one currently fitted on the barrel is a skeet choke (Cylinder skeet)?? \nThere were 4 stock shims too in the box with chokes,  to adjust stock drop and cast. (not familiar with them though)\nThe magazine capacity is 4+1 originally, but since the gun comes with a mag extension tube - the capacity can be made 7+1.\n\nIt has a 76mm/3" chamber and a 28" barrel. The gun is capable of ''eating & spitting'' lighter skeet loads to 3" magnum rounds with auto adjustments in the gas piston.\n\nThe rubber recoil pad seems quite thin but surely would reduce felt recoil by 15-20%?\n\nI heard I need to clean the gun of lubricants before shooting sessions, and oil metal parts and the firing pin area (after passing cloth with a rod through the barrel). Is this all, or should I do more to maintain it?\n\nAlong with the gun got some skeets, Shaheen #4, #6, SG, and Victory slugs. But haven''t had time to shoot it, maybe within a week.\n\nHere''s some pics... alot of them.\n\nThe box seems attractive\n\n\nPlease enlighten regarding choke usage, which choke/ctg combination to use on which game (quail, partridge, pigeon, rabbit, duck, goose, boar) at particular ranges. Skeet choke on skeet, but whats special about it?[/QUOTE]\n[COLOR=#333333]Congrats bro..[/COLOR]', 1, 0, '39.47.77.105', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

Though my primary choice was CZ 455 Varmint or American, due to acute shortage of 22lr bolt-action rifles in the market these days, 2[SUP]nd[/SUP] best option according to my preferences was this Savage Mark II.\n \nKnown for its inherited out-of-the-box accuracy & Accu-Trigger mechanism, this rifle has got good reviews by the users except one dislike, the rattling 10 round banana clip. The rifle comes in typical khaki cardboard box.\n \nFor me, there was another added benefit in this version. The polymer stock & over-all matte finish.

I was searching for 70K gun and had PT92, Baikal, Stoeger in my mind and my heart with Taurus PT 809. I did window shop the market couple of times and when I was finalizing between Baikal and Stoeger I had the opportunity at one shop to check out CZ Duty. The grip fitted in my hand just perfectly and the slim compact look was awesome. The guy was demanding 110K final so it was just a dream for me at that time. I went for stoeger and started managing my funds to buy it. Finally got the chance to buy it at 85K and I sold my Stoeger for 55k (bought for 58K) and purchased CZ-75 P07 Duty from Peshawar. And this time my love materialized. :)\n \n[B]The impressions without firing[/B]\n \n[B][I] In and out of the Box[/I][/B], It came with two standard magz of 16, some manuals stuff and a CD, a cleaning brush. That’s it.\n \n[B][I]Safety/Decocker[/I][/B] Its with a safety however t there is an option to change the safety with decocker and as per manual its quite easy to do, even user can do it without needing help of gunsmith etc. I am fine with safety bcuz manual "decocking" is not that science and therefore "decocker" is not required badly. Though I do quite fine with manual decocking with my dad''s tees bore and with empty CZ but today when I decocked it manually with a live round, hammer got slipped and hit the firing pin from more than halfcocked position. Didn''t fire the round.\n \n[B][I]Hammer[/I][/B] is not hard. Its easy to cock and decock.  \n \n[B][I]Grip[/I][/B] is awesome. It fits in my hand as if it is made for it. Serrations on the grip make it perfect for sweaty hands. It just doesn''t slip even when hands are raining sweat.\n \n[B][I]Slide[/I][/B] is not polymer and its not black either. Its kinda greyish black. As the slide and barrel is metal that’s why when mag is empty, the gun in hand drops forward bcuz of the weight of barrel and slide. But when mag is loaded with around 10 bullets then its balanced. When the slide is locked back then barrel does not appear to be steady straight. Its kinda tilted upwards from front side. Donno why is that.\n \n[B][I]Magzines[/I][/B] are easy to load. Loading Stoeger''s mag was quite hard. But CZ Duty''s were fine however couldn''t load the 16[SUP]th[/SUP], tried twice on both the magz and then left it for some other time. Mag drops free easily. You guys will be surprised to know that Sig P226''s mag fit in, load the bullet in chamber and extracts it perfectly.\n \n[B][I]Disassembly[/I][/B] takes time, atleast its kinda difficult than Stoeger. It cud have been quite better. Guiding rod is plastic and spring is just pain in ass. It took me half an hour and still cudn''t put it back. I thought I am one big jerk to buy a handgun and can''t assemble it. Opened youtube and found everyone complaining about the spring, relieved tried again and did it on second attempt. I am now scared of disassembling it again just bcuz of that bloody spring.       \n \n[B]Had the opportunity today to visit my frnd''s village for some firing. So here are some range details.[/B]\n \n[B]Ammunition[/B]\n \n1. Chinese Brown box (11)\n2. Chinese Red box (15)\n3. WCC Nato (15)\n4. Armscor JHPs (10)\n\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]10541[/ATTACH]\n \nDidn’t have enough time so could only manage to fire 51 rounds. No problem whatsoever. No FTE, no FTF.\n \n[B]Cherry Popping[/B]\n \nThis time I thought not to deflower my handgun thru "flat nosed" ammo (Chinese :p) or "no nose" philpo ammo (Armscor JHP) so the only option left was WCC NATO and Chezh Republic''s beauty''s cherry was popped thru US''s WCC Nato rounds.\n \n[B]Performance at 10 meters[/B]\n \n5 WCC Nato rounds went first. Remained on 7 o clock from target, one was a flyer. There was a smell of burning gun powder after WCC rounds, never happened when i fired chinese rounds with stoeger.\n\n5 Chinese red box next. 3 bull''s-eye. 1 at 8 o clock near bullseye and one again far at 7 o clock. The slide didn’t lock back this time.\n\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]10542[/ATTACH]\n \n11 chinese brown box next. 2 were damn in the bullseye, and 3 were smelling the boundary, so I will say 5 were bullseye :p, 4 were at 6 o clock, 1 was at 3 o clock and one was flyer.\n\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]10543[/ATTACH]\n \n10 armscor JHPs next. 2 bullseeye, 1 was quite near so lemme say 3 bullseye :p, remaining seven managed to be on the chart, literally everywhere like cricket fielders, long thirdman, short thirdman, back on boundry at midwicket, long on and long off.\n\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]10544[/ATTACH]\n \n10 WCC Nato rounds next. Didn’t hit the target. :( one was again flyer :p ... Again that smell ... \n\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]10545[/ATTACH]\n \nSo, 11 out of 41 bullseye, and it was my second time on target shooting with handgun. I am lovin'' it :p\n \nNow time for being a little controversial here :p\n \n[B]CZ Duty VS Caracal[/B]\n \nBeing a new learner and novice, I think I should be using hammer fired handguns to be familiar with guns and stuff. If hammer or no hammer is not a problem and I shud pick one based on internet reviews, I''ll go for CZ Duty with my eyes closed. Personal choice, no offence meant.\n \n[B]CZ Duty VS CZ 999[/B]\n \nWell, that’s an awkward comparison. Charade GTTI or Baleno are cheaper than VTI, could outrun vti oreal, and their consumption is quite better than VTU but still people buy VTI oreal, are they stupid or what or there are few things like brand loyalty, or ego, or lust for having good thing whether not it outperforms its cheaper competitor. Its as simple as you read it. So, if price is not the factor, CZ Duty anytime of the day. No comparison whatsoever. :p\n\nHere are pix of my queen :p\n\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]10546[/ATTACH][ATTACH=CONFIG]10548[/ATTACH]\n\nDenovo bro, Naved bro, any help for pix ...

Besides, game meat of wild birds is one of the best sources of animal protein with good cholesterol and amino acids...all without synthetic hormones etc etc ... you can ask any nutritionist. Besides that, religiously speaking too, hunting was a sport of some of our Prophets (a member ''Engineer'' br. can throw better light on this topic from religious pt of view). Yet the issue of quantity which was raised....thats not a continuous occurance. It is occassional and infrequent that a handsome quantity of game birds is found, then shot and also retrieved. All these three aspects (found + shot + retrieved) are not easy, therefore occasional hunting of good bags should not be objectionable. Also, the bags, whatever they are, are divided among 4-6 group members most of times including hosts and guides ... so, per head quantity of birds that a gunner takes home is not much. And, yes ...all game is devoured keenly in every home and enjoyed over dinners among family members & close friends. Some game is even given to special friends who had requested for it since season start. So, on face of it though, it might appear obnoxious to you, from a closer perspective, it is not that outrageous or treacherous ;). The "image" of a hunter holding a shotgun and firing at (so-to-say harmless) gamebirds does always appear as objectional to all NON-hunters.\r\n\r\nP.S: These "beasts" such as wild boars, deer etc are also very harmless, rather both run at the first sight of a human. Its only in jungle lore that animals are portrayed as dangerous. In reality, they are not. They are very much afraid of humans.

The bottom plate of the receiver displays laser etched CHURCHIL with a very minimalist approach to aesthetics. The trigger guard is also engraved with a leaf pattern. the receiver is finished in something that looks like semi gloss powder coating.\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i998.photobucket.com/albums/af103/12gauge-pakguns/Churchill%20Over%20and%20Under%20Shotgun/IMG_1952.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\nThe bore and 3 inch magnum chambers are chromed lined for ease of cleaning and corrosion resistance. The safety button (also serves as a selector) and opening lever offer plenty of purchase for easy operation.\r\n\r\nThe action was quiet stiff for a guy who is used to Russian Baikals. I wasn''t really expecting a Turkish shotgun to be this stiff even when new. Not only it was difficult to open, it was equally difficult to close as well.\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i998.photobucket.com/albums/af103/12gauge-pakguns/Churchill%20Over%20and%20Under%20Shotgun/IMG_1954.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\nThe serrated 7mm rib runs true to the bore with no noticeable flaws in manufacturing.\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i998.photobucket.com/albums/af103/12gauge-pakguns/Churchill%20Over%20and%20Under%20Shotgun/IMG_1955.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\nThe recoil pad though soft and easy to shoulder (thanks to the plastic heal) feels too thin for the job.

The finish is a deep black/blue unlike the ugly black chrome finish on some of the current budget oriented Turkish offerings.\r\n\r\nThe side ribs are vented probably to reduce weight.

The part that takes up stress is made out of stainless steel.\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i998.photobucket.com/albums/af103/12gauge-pakguns/Churchill%20Over%20and%20Under%20Shotgun/IMG_1973.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i998.photobucket.com/albums/af103/12gauge-pakguns/Churchill%20Over%20and%20Under%20Shotgun/IMG_1974.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\nThe aluminum receiver is super light. The machining is reasonably impressive for a gun that costs 55K. definitely beats the Russian shotty in finish.\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i998.photobucket.com/albums/af103/12gauge-pakguns/Churchill%20Over%20and%20Under%20Shotgun/IMG_1975.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i998.photobucket.com/albums/af103/12gauge-pakguns/Churchill%20Over%20and%20Under%20Shotgun/IMG_1978.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\nI was kind of concerned about the wearing out of aluminum specially at the breach area but then I found that the breach face is piece of stainless steel held in its place with the help of a screw. With the wearing out issue settled, I am thinking if parts are ever become available in future, one can get it replaced if this plate ever gets worn out. A plus in my books&#8230;well&#8230;. sort of.\r\n\r\n[B]Final Thoughts:[/B]\r\n\r\nWell, its basically everything you would expect out of an otherwise extremely ordinary double barrel over and under shotgun. However there is one thing that instantly strikes anyone who picks up this shotgun for the first time, that is, its weight. Weighing at slightly less than 6.5lbs, this gun is extremely light and well balanced.\r\n\r\nQuick on the shoulder and lightning fast due its less weight. Sure, the recoil was a little on the higher side but its nothing out of the ordinary for a light weight field double barrel shotgun.\r\n\r\nOver all 50 rounds were fired from it with zero malfunctions of any kind. The gun shouldered superbly and pointed quiet nicely as well. the gun did felt a little whippy but I guess it happens with super light shotguns and the operator is accustomed to shotguns that handle like  2*4s.\r\n\r\nAnyways, as far as durability, finishing and looks are concerned, I am afraid there are probably better options in the market in its price range however if a super light weight and reliable shotgun is your primary requirement, to carry a lot and shoot a little, look no further as this shotgun gladly gets included in the &#8220;bang for the buck&#8221; list.\r\n\r\nRegards.', 1, 1, '39.47.208.162', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

Besides, game meat of wild birds is one of the best sources of animal protein with good cholesterol and amino acids...all without synthetic hormones etc etc ... you can ask any nutritionist. Besides that, religiously speaking too, hunting was a sport of some of our Prophets (a member ''Engineer'' br. can throw better light on this topic from religious pt of view). Yet the issue of quantity which was raised....thats not a continuous occurance. It is occassional and infrequent that a handsome quantity of game birds is found, then shot and also retrieved. All these three aspects (found + shot + retrieved) are not easy, therefore occasional hunting of good bags should not be objectionable. Also, the bags, whatever they are, are divided among 4-6 group members most of times including hosts and guides ... so, per head quantity of birds that a gunner takes home is not much. And, yes ...all game is devoured keenly in every home and enjoyed over dinners among family members & close friends. Some game is even given to special friends who had requested for it since season start. So, on face of it though, it might appear obnoxious to you, from a closer perspective, it is not that outrageous or treacherous ;). The "image" of a hunter holding a shotgun and firing at (so-to-say harmless) gamebirds does always appear as objectional to all NON-hunters.\n\nP.S: These "beasts" such as wild boars, deer etc are also very harmless, rather both run at the first sight of a human. Its only in jungle lore that animals are portrayed as dangerous. In reality, they are not. They are very much afraid of humans. So harmful or harmless, does not apply IMO.[/QUOTE]\n\n\nThanks, and I think your last sentence seems true, that hunting seems objectionable to non-hunters.

I was initially thinking of marking the first and second strings on the photos using the Photo Editor but again that would defeat the purpose (especially I do not have a photographic memory).

So that''s a 77 out of 100 with so-so grouping.\n\n\n[U][B]Chinese Redbox[/B][/U]\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]11848[/ATTACH]\n\nThe Redbox resulted in a lower overall score of 69 but the grouping on the second string is the kind I would like to see on a consistent basis. The 4 snug little holes at 8''o''clock in 7 and 6 plus the on in 7 down  at t''o''clock.\n\nThere I''m happy with the gun now (I''ll get to that in a bit) and, after one more session, it will become my EDC.\n\nNow onto the fun bit. Last week and this week as well, I noticed that the gun is shooting left. So after having done with the range report, I decided to adjust the rear sights as per my normal shooting stance using 3 round strings. I required 2 minor adjustments and the stages are somewhat visible on the target as well :)\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]11851[/ATTACH]\nSuffice to say the last few rounds of the day (before the torrential downpour) were all nines. The grouping will improve as I get more used to the trigger (you will note that I have stopped hoping for the trigger to improve and instead focused more on getting used to it). I will also wait for a proper review on the gun by Abbas. Hopefully we should be able to do that next week or whenever he is free.\n\n\n[I]Edit: I noted that the pics aren''t showing.

I am in  contact with some friends and they also called me up long time ago as  WHY i was NOT posting on the OTHER forum.\nIt is more so a jealousy  kind of a thing. The postings that are HERE are NOT liked by some of the  members over THERE as TGF is over taking by leaps and bounds.\nOne of  the comments that i heard were "The TGF people are arrogant and the  seniors are too proud to answer properly when asked a question even  through PM."\nand "TGF people think of themselves as superior to  others"... i dont know where did they get this.. I have never felt this  on the forum.\n\n[B]\nWasn''t it your Atiq? if I had authority I  would love to kick your stinking @@@ out of the both forums, read how  you whined in the OTHER forum 4 weeks ago, you filthy back biter.[/B]\n\n\n[QUOTE=atiq;278581]@Enigmatic Desires.\nI  had considered my decision by weighing in many things at the same time;  If someone wants to get some nice tips then he should treat the other  person with same respect as he would give to his teacher and if he  doesn''t then it simply shows the lacunae left in his upbringing. I DONT  care about any of them even the least bit, MAINLY because I have a LOT  in my life going on and am MORE than happy with it; In fact i dont ask  Allah to give me anything anymore.. He has given me everything that i  can possibly need.. (read this as 500 chinese and 2000 local brand ammo  FREE of cost every month). HEHHEHE\n\nTrue that there is a better  discussion on some of the things on TGF but what about the support of a  bad egg by almost the whole lot that was present there, except Canik  (member of TGF) NO ONE said anything against such outburst??? IT all  just made everything clear to me in all the confusing things that i was  patiently handling. However I still miss some discussion over there as I  have completed the detailed testing of ammo and wanted to post it  there. All the pros and cons of local ammo is tested and soon i will  take photos and post it here.\n\nBTW: have you thought about all the  other forums?? cauz research has led me to a forum where all the  possible questions are already answered. HOW do you think i got the  sponsorship as mentioned above?? it was in the sponsorship section of a  forum and i did as it was advised. Secondly ... just the presence of  Skeeter sb here more often makes this place well above any other place  that can possibly be.\n\n[B]Anyways i find this forum a lot  better then TGF; and i think that incident was bound to happen and make  me come here and post here only.[/B] I have been practicing a LOT  with the local ammo lately at a private farm house of a friend and many  of the people around me get the same benefit of free shooting casually  if the ammo i am given is in excess to my shooting mood. This all  happened from the ASCC friend''s MEHARBANI. He introduced me to someone  and it all went up hill in full swing.[/QUOTE]\n\n[B]And you SA; dont  you find it pertinent to reveal how many more ID''s than Glock19 you made  on your own forum? you are such a hypocrite and arrogant self acclaimed  superior knowledgeable son of a gun.[/B]\n\nSA wrote:\n[B]I feel it pertinent to repeat my post made in another thread started by[/B] MythBuster.\n\nGlock19 wrote:\nAnother  thing I would like to share is that TGF probably does not enjoy very  good reputation in the areas of Rawalpindi and Lahore. In fact some of  my gun enthusiast friends advised me to stay away from this forum. I am  not sure about the reason for this but I found nothing bad on this forum  rather most of the things are up to my liking.\n\nregards\n\n\nThe  reason is that the ''other'' forum mainly comprises of members from those  two cities and in between and creation of a new forum two years ago was  taken very negatively, which should not have been the case. TGF  continued concentrating on quality rather than large number of members.  The forum pruned it''s inactive members regularly and continues to do so.  TGF management kept ignoring the finger pointing and mud slinging and  continued towards it''s goal. Today, TGF has members actively  contributing from several countries including US, UK, Canada, Czech  Republic, New Zealand, Croatia, Serbia, UAE, Turkey, Philippines, etc.\n\nCity-wise  (from Pakistan''s perspective) we have actively contributing members  from Karachi, Lahore, Rawalpindi/Islamabad, Skardu, Gilgit, Quetta,  Peshawar, Hyderabad, Nawabshah, RahimyarKhan, Multan, Sanghar, etc.,  which I believe, is a pretty decent representation from east to west,  north to south of the whole country.\n\nHowever, I''d like to  reiterate the point made earlier, i.e., the aim is not to confine  knowledge-sharing to any city or country. TGF DOES NOT HAVE ANY  GEOGRAPHICAL BOUNDARIES, nor is it confined to members of any ethnicity,  race, religion or color. \n\nAs for non-contributing members......  we should not feel bad about members who refrain from contributing for  whatever reason. This is the norm on almost all international forums  where you have members in thousands but hardly a few dozen contributing  actively. Similar is the case with TGF, however, here, we regularly  prune inactive accounts after few months. Till now over 4,500 members  joined TGF out of which around 3,500 member accounts got pruned because  of inactivity.\n\n\n\n[B]You all should see your faces in above  mirrors and do some brain storming as  how a reasonable person can  accompany arrogant liars like you.[/B]\n\n  					[/TD]\n[/TR]\n[/TABLE]\n[/TD]\n[/TR]\n[/TABLE]\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSorry again bro''s but it was getting unbearable and causing increase in blood pressure, so had to do some chitrol to relieve my nerves.', 1, 1, '39.45.88.2', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

Actually, a Glock is also a production gun, there is a small chance(ok very small :D) that it might be a lemon, or maybe just some issue of replacing a faulty part or 2. The thing that needs to ascertained is whether all these AT Glock''s that are floating in the market have these kinds of problems.

The finish on most of the 92 fs models here in Pakistan is Bruniton. There might be quite a few of the blued ones, but they are not common. Also, an original Beretta Blued gun can be seen a mile away. About markings, well none of the italian ones I have seen have the markings on the barrel and they all had the serial number cut into the frame. So, it can be marked or cannot be, it can have a printed serial or not. Now the Problem is that the market is flooded with clones, and the only thing that is conclusive is the finish, since clones can be marked in all these places.... or not.... but the bruniton or rare Blue on a Beretta cannot be replicated here. \r\n\r\nThe thing is that Beretta is a pretty old company and the 92fs is one of the most sold handguns in the world. If you refer to the site I linked in one of our earlier conversations, there are many many different models that have been produced, with all these different markings, which is inconclusive to the fact whether the gun under question is fake or original.

The reason we have so many visitors at our forum is because it is open for all, i.e no membership is required to read the content here. At Tgf the picture is completely different, what are 1106 users doing there everyday if they are not members and can''t read the content ?? Understandable that maximum maybe they have 106 members online in a day, what are the other 1000 guests doing ?

First, answer yes or no to the following questions (for this particular scenario, assume that you have made the decision to use lethal force based on your particular state laws):\n\n1. Do you know how to select and utilize gear that will ensure your survival as opposed to allowing you to lose your gun during a dynamic situation?\n\n2. When dealing with a potential threat more than three yards away, can you access and draw your firearm efficiently and quickly (under two seconds), and do you practice those techniques weekly (at a minimum)?\n\n3. If you were forced to deal with that same threat and they were less than three yards away, do you know what to do in that close proximity?\n\n 4. What if that same threat were so close (less than a yard) that they could grab or punch you? Would you know how to handle that situation, i.e., could you protect yourself against the punch?\n\n5. If you were seated in your vehicle, seat-belted in, would you know how to deal with a threat?\n\n6. During your critical incident, if you drew and shot the threatening person yet they failed to stop, would you know how to handle that or what caused it?\n\n7. If you were injured or one of your hands was occupied during a critical incident, could you still draw, reload, and clear malfunctions in your handgun with one hand?\n\n8. If cover was available, could you use it efficiently and still return fire?\n\n9. During your incident, you might experience some physiological and psychological effects that could easily rattle you. Do you know what to expect?\n\n10. Lastly, have you ever exposed yourself to stress that simulates a real fight, and if not, do you know what it will be like?\n\nMost tests have a minimum passing score of XX, right? This test does not. If you don&#8217;t get 100% &#8220;yes&#8221; on it, you might die. The ten questions all describe critical items that can mean the difference between life and death &#8230; yours, that is. Take the time to find the answers before your critical incident. Unfortunately, most people consider carrying a firearm a convenience that simply makes them feel safer, and fail to address the seriousness of actually carrying a firearm for self-defense. The truth is, if you have made the decision to carry a gun for self-protection, you are a warrior. Now you must begin to train and act like one.\n\nComplete Article :[url]http://www.personaldefensenetwork.com/articles/tactics-defensive-issues/the-concealed-carry-trap/[/url] \n\n\nI was sitting in on a Combat Focus Shooting Instructor Development course in Washington state when my ears perked up. Rob Pincus, the lead instructor and developer of the course, had drawn a couple of rectangles on the whiteboard. One depicted a target with shots evenly distributed within its area, and the other the same number of shots tightly grouped in the center.\n\n&#8220;What can you say about these targets?&#8221; he asked the instructor candidates. &#8220;Good shooting!&#8221; exclaimed one student, the others joining in the ensuing laughter.\n\nRob looked a little puzzled. After all, the goal in defensive shooting is to make the bad guy go away using the least amount of time and energy necessary. Was spending time and energy to achieve smaller groups really a mark of good defensive shooting -- or simply a display of meaningless athletic prowess?\n\n&#8220;I don&#8217;t think,&#8221; he said, &#8220;that shooting more precisely than the target needs is good shooting.&#8221;', 1, 0, '182.177.140.62', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

The new hammer type pistol was unveiled at the 10th International Defence Exhibition and Conference (IDEX 2011) in the capital.&#8220;It is my first fire-arm design, which will be marketed. I always had the passion to design machineries, particularly vehicles and their engines. This is my hobby,&#8221; said  Mohammed Abdul Aziz Al Mutawa, who is employed at Caracal&#8217;s Research and Development Unit, told [I]Khaleej Times[/I].\nThe young Abu Dhabi engineer, who acquired his Bachelor of Science degree in Mechanical Engineering from a US university in 2005, joined Caracal, a Tawazun Holding company, three years ago as a research team member. The 9mm-bullet with 18-round magazine hammer type pistol is named Caracal-H. It is the company&#8217;s first hammer type pistol that adds a new series &#8211; Caracal-H series &#8211; to its profile.\nAl Mutawa explained: &#8220;Now we have the prototype here on display. The actual production for this type of pistol will begin by the end of 2011. I designed this with the combination of both modern and hammer type technologies and features to guarantee safety &#8232;and precision. \n&#8220;A number of key characteristics ensure high-performance from the Caracal H type. Its low profile helps provide greater accuracy and balance through limit muzzle movement, which improves the pistol&#8217;s stability, and makes for faster target acquisition during dynamic shooting.&#8221;  He further added the pistol features a smoothing trigger pull with a precise stop which also enables &#8232;accurate shooting. Tawazun Holding, he added, played a key role by providing all means of support and encouragement to produce a pistol that combines high performance, stability, ease of use and elegance.\nAccording to Caracal, the H type designed and developed by Mutawa is aimed primarily for the &#8232;specialty market.   Caracal COO Salem Al Matroushi commenting on the new design said: &#8220;The Caracal-H type represents another example of Caracal&#8217;s commitment to innovation and focus on the continuous improvement of its range of products to meet the requirements of Caracal customers.&#8221;\nHe also said lots of interests were shown for the product at the exhibition and it will find both local and international markets when produced and available. Al Mutawa said such success could not have been achieved without the unwavering support of the country&#8217;s leadership.\nHe urged young Emiratis to make use of the facilities provided in the country to develop their capabilities and to boost innovation in technology and manufacturing sectors.\n[/SIZE][/COLOR]\nSource KhaleejTimes\n[URL]http://www.khaleejtimes.com/biz/inside.asp?xfile=/data/business/2011/February/business_February427.xml&section=business[/URL]', 1, 0, '113.203.177.52', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

MOST important of all is the original license, CNIC and the Section 144 Cr.P.C permit with you, as well as a copy of it in your car as well as a copy at home. It may seem not so important but carrying a weapon when restrictions to carry are imposed becomes a crime even though you have a valid license with you. The carry condition as is mostly said by the police mean NOT on YOUR BODY condition. i.e. inside the car in glove compartment, console or under the seat or inside the door compartment. The gun should always be in a concealed condition because terrorism and the political parties have made it a habit of brandishing heavy licensed weapons leading a fear of insecurity to the masses. Hence this awkward conceal carry is imposed which has NO support from the Legislation and LAW.. the ONLY support it has comes from the notifications under the Home Department only. NO ONE has yet challenged it in court but untill someone does and wins the legal battle till then we do have to follow the notification and carry a gun with 144 permit duly issued by the department.\n\nI am here as an Advocate who has had about 10 years of experience of full fledged lawyer as well as 3 years of experience as junior clerk..

I am sure you will enjoy this shotgun for a very long time. now coming to the questions that you have asked:\n\n1. take the choke out, if its marked Sk, then its skeet. otherwise it could be a cylinder choke if shows CL or no marking on it.\n\n2. Bro, the choice of aftermarket recoil pad depends upon many factors such as gun fit.  autoloaders usually do not need recoil pads therefore it is not wise to spend money on an expensive accessory, especially if you are not looking to change some important gun characteristic such as length of pull etc.,\n\nstill if you bent on getting an aftermarket recoil pad then my recommendations would be:\n\n>>>>stick with the original thickness of the pad if you are comfortable with the length of pull.\n\n>>>>instead of going for super expensive and high performance recoil pads such as Limbsaver and Kickeez, try to get a pachmyer old english skeet pad. its looker way better than any limbsaver or kickeez pad I have ever seen. its recoil performance may not be up to par with the two big names but since the said gun is an autoloader, you do not need a canon to kill a bird. for your purpose,  pachmyer old english skeet pad works way better than any factory supplied recoil pad.\n\n3. nopes! not much is required in terms of cleaning. kindly refer to a shotgun cleaning thread for a detailed cleaning one you reach a certain round count.\n\n4. for quail and partridge use Improved Cylinder (IC), for pigeon use Improved Cylinder or Modified (depends upon shooting conditions such as range), for Duck Improved Cylinder or Modified, for Rabbit use Modified and for Boar use Improved Modified.\n\nI personally never recommend full choke. I don''t know why but I have always found full choke''s pattern to be less than ideal in most shotguns. in my humble opinion, tighter chokes require a much higher degree of manufacturing quality and most shotgun makers tend to put quality chokes at the lowest priority. now you know why aftermarket choke tube manufacturers thrive in this highly competitive industry.\n\n5. don''t shoot the gun without a choke tube installed. nothing will happen but you run the risk of damaging fine choke tube threads.\n\n6. you use a choke wrench. besides, you hardly need to change the choke tube during a hunt. unless you put in a wrong tube for the job in the first place.\n\n7. you may use any choke tube for buckshots. your range, pattern performance and personal preference will decide which choke to ultimately use.\n\n8. modern slugs are said to be safe in any degree of choke. however just to be on the extra safe side, its better to use more open chokes such as Cylinder, Skeet, Improved Modified. I have always found that slugs perform better when there is just a slight degree of choke. it kinda promote consistency in the flight path of slug when it leaves the muzzle. I would suggest start with Improved Cylinder. at times, Cylinder/Skeet gives better results. anyways, you''ll have to test them at a range to know for sure.\n\nRegards.[/QUOTE]\n\nSIR 12 Guauge\nI have two questions \n1) I am unable to open the baikal mp153''s tube''s cover cap   i dont know what its called kindly correct me f im wrong.how it should be opened?\n2) I emptied whole box of shaheen no6 today it fired and ejected every catridge but i felt something was striking the barrel .i got the  sensation on my left arm that was on forearm? is it ok was it bolt or sth else. should i reassemble the gun.?\ncan you please upload a video of assambely of mp153\nRegards,', 1, 0, '39.53.136.143', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

I''m 21 years old, a student in Lahore and I come from a middle-class family. I am not gun crazy or enthusiast, I don''t own any firearm for that matter but I have a lot of interest for marksmanship and recreational shooting.\n\nBeing living in Pakistan, I''ve not heard of anybody who does shooting for entertainment and fun. In our society, firearms are considered only for killing or defence. For a youth like myself, owning a firearm is considered to be what I would call taboo, if I used the right word.\n\nAnyways, I had interest in firearms by playing PC games such as counter strike, call of duty and what not. I was not really interested in shooting until I saw Top Shot on History Channel and I thought it should be a lot fun if I try target and competitive shooting. I''ve only shot a firearm total of 2 times in my life, with a TT33 aka china pistol. However, I am aware of how to use a firearm safely and I am responsible.\n\nHence, I joined this forum to ask you guys about how can I get started in a safe world of shooting sports, preferably handgun or rifle. I am aware that the economic conditions and inflation in our country are getting worse and worse by day and shooting is expensive. Hence, I am thinking that the first firearm that I would purchase will be .22 long rifle handgun, preferably a revolver. I am looking forward to get the Smith & Wesson 317 kit gun but I don''t know if it is available in Lahore or not.\n\nWell, my introduction is getting longer. I would appreciate some tips from experts here about how can I get starting in shooting, financial needs, what process will I have to go through to own a firearm and where I can practice or compete safely in Lahore. What should be my first purchase? etc....\n\nThank you for reading.', 1, 0, '39.53.115.143', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

I am aware that the economic conditions and inflation in our country are getting worse and worse by day and shooting is expensive.\n\nWell, my introduction is getting longer. I would appreciate some tips from experts here about how can I get starting in shooting, financial needs, what process will I have to go through to own a firearm and where I can practice or compete safely in Lahore. What should be my first purchase? etc....\n\nThank you for reading.[/QUOTE]\n\nSalams brother and welcome to our forums. You''ve picked the greatest of sports to enter into, the world of firearms is a  hobby which grows on you and stays with you for a lifetime. A lot of friends started this passion in their teens and still pursue it in their 60''s/70''s with the same excitment and zest.\n\nTo answer your questions in point form:\n\n1). Get a Licence made. There are two kinds, provincial and Federal. It will allow you to purchase a semi-auto / bolt / pump action firearm (handgun/shotgun/rifle) from a dealer in almost all sporting calibres. The requirement is your ID card, two pictures and a filled in form. It can be made through a reliable firearms dealer. Processing time varies but anywhere from 1 month to 3 months. Costs range from approx Rs. 13,000 - 19,000.\n\n2). Once your licence is made, you need to select a sporting weapon/catagory. For competitive shooting there are three / four common disciplines in Pakistan. Standard (.22 LR, Single handed shooting at 25 meters), Big Bore (double and single handed shooting of handguns above .32 CAL) double handed is known as Amateur and Single handed professional, targets are set at 25 Meters. Skeet & Trap (Shooting down clay birds (think airborn firni toothi''s) with a shotgun) .22 LR rifle shooting (open sights at 50 Meters) and Air pistol (single handed shooting at 10 Meters) \n\n3). When you have decided which line of shooting to pursue, the third step is to have a place to shoot/practise. For that you need to have a range membership. There are excellent ranges for all disciplines in both Karachi (Karsaz Range) and Islamabad (Gun Club), in Lahore there is LRC which has all of the above except shotgun facilities. Range memberships are stupidly expensive in Karachi and Islamabad but reasonable in Lahore for Rs. 25,000 one time and Rs. 1000 per month.\n\nSince you''re probably studying and on a limited budget I would suggest you start with Air. There is no licence requirement, no hefty ammunition costs and you can even delay the range membership by practising at home. The gun would cost about Rs. 125,000. Walter SSP, Pardini, Walther GSP Expert, Hammerli etc are good options. Ask for suggestions again in the air pistols section if you decide to go this route. At LRC there is a good Air Coach available free of cost, targets are also free and you can refil your pistol air cylinders there as well.', 1, 0, '117.102.34.121', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

Every guy into quail hunting knows that this term "bulara" is used for live bird calling to others to lure them.

''They'' say electronic bulara (tape) does not come under the term "bulara" they allow. Every other quail pattee has elec tape callers everywhere sucking in thousands of birds from skies into their huge nets for oepn sale in markets....literally destroying bird populations.....And the genuine shotgunner''s main tool for quail hunting is electronic tape with speakers (elec bulara)...thats the technicality they do not allow. Reason is obviously to leave as many loopholes as possible in game hunting to give leaverage to ''them'' to twist genuine hunters'' hands in field for obviously their own ''benefits''.

The other shotgun i have is tomahawk it also came with three chokes the  bore sizes of it chokes are 18mm, 17.5mm and 17mm  can any one let us know the maximum bore to minimum bore of the chokes[/QUOTE]\r\n\r\nWith Baikal MP-153, three (IC,M,F) are supplied usually. Bore size of Baikal MP-153 is Tru Bore i.e. Tru Choke i.e. 0.729" which is standard for almost all English guns too. Beretta mobil has 0.723" bore size and Beretta Optima bore has 0.732" and so on.\r\n\r\nNow, the chokes...........\r\nAny choke tube that you have with MP-153 will be according to following. I am assuming 0.730" bore diamter (ID):\r\n\r\n***** Cyl choke: 0.730" exit dia i.e. 0.000" constriction\r\n**** IC choke: 0.720" exit dia i.e. 0.010" constriction\r\n*** Mod choke: 0.710" exit dia i.e. 0.020" constriction\r\n* Full choke: 0.700" exit dia i.e. 0.030" constriction\r\nXtra Full choke: 0.690" exit dia i.e. 0.040" constriction\r\n\r\nFor Tomahawk, you have to find Bore ID (Internal Diameter) first as per manual or their website, then see the chokes similar way as above. Note: term "bore ID" is used for barrel & "exit diameter" for chokes.\r\n\r\n[Note: 18mm = 0.710" , 17.5mm = 0.690" , 17mm = 0.670" ... approx]\r\n\r\nSo, based on that, 18mm exit dia choke for MP153 is a MODIFIED pattern choke for upto 35-40 yards shooting. And, 17.5mm exit dia choke is Extra Full (XF) pattern choke with ranges of 40-50 yards but of crs for that high powered cartrgs are better alongwith that to reach out to that range. Thats infact a turkey hunting choke and not for our use here. The third choke supplied with MP153 would be IMO the 0.719" (18.25mm approx) exit dia choke which is IC and is best upto 30-35 yards shooting. This would be your decoying duck choke with regular #6 cartrg and for longer ranges, 18mm (Mod) would be the best duck choke with #6 Super Shaheen or better imported cartrgs. My suggestion would be only use #6 for ducks, 31gms for all rounder shooting and 36gms for longer ranges (if required).\r\n\r\n[Pls correct any dimensions or typing errors if I''m wrong]', 1, 0, '110.36.199.128', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

Its way too heavy by modern standards, and after owning and carrying one for 2 years, im pretty much sick of it ( personal opinion, your mileage may vary, also that may lead to my opinion being biased against it).\n\nThe only Army(s) that use it are Serbian , the country of its origin. I hv no idea why the CZ 999 gets pushed so hard on these forums.\nThe CF 98 is cheaper, adopted by the Chinese army ( and did I mention its cheaper) , the MP446 Viking adopted by the Russian military.\nMy Observations are as follows :\nObjective assessment (Cons only, you ll find plenty of pro''s)\n[b]CZ999[/b]\n1. Is pretty much a full frame pistol with a 15 +1 mag ( other full frame pistols generally hold more)\n2.Heavy and THICK(I really don''t like those protruding Slide Stop/ Decocker''s sticking out)  by modern standards ( glock 17 which is the gun used by Most LEA agencies in the world, most armies use Rifles, 2ndry firearms dont really matter )\n3. Can not be concealed in summers ( maybe by some1 taller than 6 feet 1 inches )\n4.Tends to get stuck on clothing while drawing from holster (not as much of late, that''s mainly due to the slide release sticking out with plenty of empty space for it to catch on clothing articles), kind of a subjective issue\n5.Machining marks and sharp edges on the internals, which really put me off.\n6.What''s with the card box packing?(subjective issue)\n7.Subjective issue, the Slide finishing needs a lot of care.\n8. Between its Heaviness/thickness/grip texturing or the lack of it, the gun is pretty ''slippery'' if shots are made in quick succession. \n9.DA and SA pulls were about average, maybe towards the lower end of "average" but certainly not awful or unmanageable.\n[b] Stoeger and VIKING [/b] Both are an equal match with some additional points\nLike ED brother has mentioned. \n\nCommon features : All of these guns will out last the user.\nAll of these guns are equally reliable.\nAll of these guns are as accurate as any normal SD/HD/Combat user might need them to be.\nAll of these are good value for money, (becuz Glock''s are just crazy over the top over- priced) [u]I Bought my CZ999 for 40k two years back and Cougar 8000 for 42k, they shud be sub 55K, however I am unaware of current prices, but I wouldn''t buy ''em if they were more expensive than that.They arn''t really worth more than that to me[/u] I would just get the CF 98 or a Turkish handgun. \nAll of these guns are not easily concealed ( the Cougar 8000 is the easiest)\nI had a hard time Finding good holsters for the CZ999 and Cougar 8000, I think its the same with the Viking ( and a good holster makes a HUGE difference).  \n \n[b]Suggestion[/b] I would definitly re consider the CF-98 if u hvnt already.( cheaper, and will serve you very well, best Budget SD/HD/Carry/Duty handgun out there. )\nAlso check the Piranha Turkish Canik 55 handguns, CZ 75 Clones and JUST AMAZING BEASTLY guns.( some might argue they are best Option, in the current Pak market, hard to produce a counter argument) \nIn the 60-80k Range ( if u can stretch that much) consider the Caracal and the amazing CZ Duty.\nSometimes it comes down to simple stuff as looks etc, so just check them out in person, and which ever gun you feel is right , just go with it :)', 1, 0, '182.177.184.51', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

However, the question about barrel life is kinda moot. \nAt 40 rupees a pop,10k rounds equates to 4lac rupees which implies that we''d be spending a million rupees to reach the barrel limit which is a lot of money to spend on a 55K gun.

However the P-08 was a complicated design and due to intricate cuts and tolerances involved and time consuming factor it was expensive to manufacture. The most important issue is that P-08 has a very fine toggle fitted mechanism which  reportedly got jammed in wet , humid and muddy climate of central Europe ,it hung up for empty brass cases , had lengthy disassembly/ reassembly procedure, but its draw backs were kept secret by the Germans. Due to this in 1940. Fritz Walther by 1931 started working to remove the negative factors of P-08 a pistol having lesser parts. His first success was Walther PP blow back action followed by Walther PPK having lesser parts. Every year lot of research , evaluation went on secretly by the Germans silently with parallel promotion of P-08 the best pistol of the world. Due to same in 1940 June the German Army issued orders to Mauser Obendorf to cease P-08 Luger production & to start manufacturing P-38 which was massively opposed by the Germans soldiers not knowing the drawbacks, so to calm the issue  limited P-08 manufacturing was restarted & it continued till 1942 November after which Mauser started massive production of P-38 only. P-08 of limited production are very rare to find and P-38 are the trophy guns of WW-II which were first produced by Walther then by Mauser and later by SpreeWerke Berlin Spandau.  Due to approved & accepted designs it was given the name of P-38s Walther, To sum up P-08 ( Luger ) is WW-I & P-38 is WW-II gun , i am only attaching P-08 pic , regards', 1, 0, '182.187.58.203', 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

I kind of lamented the fact that she does not have a safety lever :\n\nMe: Too bad she does not have a safety lever\nSalesman: We have a model that does\nMe: Umm the TP 9 does not come with those\nSalesman: Wait lemme show u one that does (starts rummaging around with boxes an stuff) opens a box goes&#8221; sorry it has been sold and puts back.\nMe: I&#8217;d still like to see it\nSalesman: Ummm\nMe: It did not have one did it?\nSalesman:( Ruefully) No\n\nMeanwhile we spotted a Desert Eagle that bore the legend &#8220;Made in Japan&#8221;&#8230; I had no idea the Japs were doin Deagles or for that matter any handguns since the 2nd world war. There were other Japs. Handguns there as well also manufactured in Tokyo. But we were not able to examine any of those.\n\nMe: May we see the Deagle? And how much does it cost?\n\nCanik: May we see the Deagle? And how much does it cost?\n\nThe salesman suddenly became very very very busy&#8230;\n\nSo Canik decided to take the bull by the horns and asked Mr. Rabbi Motiwala to give us some time if he could.\n\nWhen we introduced ourselves Mr. Motiwala informed us that he really doesn&#8217;t care what the forums write about him? He only cares for the customers in front of him I.e. u people are here ergo u are my customers. Why should I care who writes what. He further state that he only takes Rs. 5000/- per gun as profit. He also told us htat he had fired his previous salesman cause he was rude. And that is indeed his right. Can&#8217;t really argue with a man in his own shop who wants to eke out a living making a meager 5k a gun&#8230;\n\nCanik: Err if u take only Rs. 5000/- as profit, how can u sell local handguns some of which are available at 7 to 8k apiece.\n\nMr. Motiwala: We don&#8217;t deal in local weapons.\n\nWe all tried to avoid looking at the pile of local boxes behind the counter.. (Doubtless they were there to store the Jap. Deagles)\nWe also avoided looking at the double column Local TTs in the display case&#8230; (Proberly part of Mr. Rabbi&#8217;s personal collection.. A very patriotic individual indeed.. Since he sells imported stuff but keeps the locals for himself)\n\n[b]Prices:[/b]\n\nMr. Motiwala explained the concept of &#8220;Tag Prices&#8221; i.e. the price quoted by the salesman and the price at which he will sell. I guess his 5k profit margin applies to the sale price.\n\nThe Vepr 12 MOLOT..( I went up to her&#8230; and like a vision from somewhere up above&#8230; I found her in my arms courtesy the very obliging sales man.. She has some sort of tactical grip equipped with light and laser on her. While I was cuddling and caressing her I remember Canik arguing with Mr. Motiwala.. But the world had kind of blurred and I really don&#8217;t know what they were up to..) Then he quoted the price and I put her away in a hurry. The tag price (TP) 225k. Market tag price is 150k ( By Market price Tag I mean the world outside T.A)\n\nStoeger cougher without rails 68k tag price: market tag price 63k\nCaracal: 78k T.P and market T.P 72k\nCanik TP9: 72k T.P\nCF 98: T.P 44k M.T.P 42k\nGrips for hand guns: The smallest one 1.5 inch approx. (not Hogue) 6k Tag price\n\nUs: Rabbi Bhai your prices are higher. Much higher than the market..\n\nMr. Motiwala: I also run a gold jewelry business for women. Have been doing that for years.. Women bargain a lot. Men don&#8217;t!&#8221;\n\nDamn! All these years I thought I was a feminist.. It turns out I am actually &#8220;feminine&#8221; :S\n\n[b]Licensing:[/b]\n\nTatur1 ( A young member of this forum) had his first license made through their auspices : Tag price of the lic. 22k . Final price 20k .. Delivery in 20 days. Advance 10k. After 2 months he was required to re-submit his docs. He got the license after 2..5 months. Its Home department back dated from last year. Purchase period long since expired and no registration at the national bank. To be fair though Mr. Motiwala took 17k\n\nSince, DC lics are being issued why would he do this is beyond me. We took the license to Lucky star where Ali Muhammad and son&#8217;s manager (Nasir) has been trying to clean it up. We really hope that it actually has entries in the relevant places and is not just a book handed over to us. (Amount spent to date: 4.2k)\n\nMr. Motiwala refers to such licenses as &#8220;purchase ready&#8221;\n\n[b]My feelings:[/b]\n\nThe Vepr 12 MOLOT is an awesome weapon.. And as regards T.A great place to window shop..Especially if U are an avid bird watcher and have a thing for Japanese Desert Eagles\n\n[b]My recommendations:[/b]\n\nAvoid it if u are a newbie and have no knowledge of firearms. Even though it&#8217;s a nice shiny place with nice cool air conditioners and a 5 star type ambiance.\n\nHowever for those of us who know their way around the arms market.. Don&#8217;t worry about the prices, once u let them know that you have done your homework&#8230; They will reduce them.\n (Tatur1 was offered the Cougar or 60k at TA). And please don&#8217;t allow them to do your licensing for you.', 1, 1, '119.155.20.171', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

The 809 has this feature. it also has an external safety that can be flicked on and off as and when the shooter want. It helps prevent accidental discharge and the weapon also has a decocker. That decocks the weapon i.e lowers the hammer. The 809 can be carried cocked and locked as well. I.e hammer down and safety on safe mode. I.e U just need to flick off the safety and shoot. It also has a loaded chamber indicator that can be both felt and seen.\r\n\r\nThe weapon comes with 3 different grips for different hand sizes and a magazine loader as well and it also has a rail for tactical laser/light accessories.  \r\n\r\nHowever it is not the most reliable weapon around.

Maybe my tone, or posture, or the way I said it, rubbed the chap the wrong way, and he replied in coin, Janab Sahib, safety ON ha.\nThen he proceeded to Remove a A loaded mag, And with his Finger Still in the Trigger guard( still off the trigger I presume) disengage the safety and pulled the slide back and Shook a round out of the gun. I swear to you , I was about to Flip.\n\nAnother Event, a friend of mine after making an expensive handgun purchase popped over to show off his New toy, he was wearing it in his IWB holster, he pulled his Gun out and while pointing it in my general direction, asked , ''Oye check it mate, you like? ''\nI asked him to point it else where, He replied , ''safety on ha'', checked his , gun, and then with an embarrassed look went like,'' Yaar Main ne on ki thi'' , and snapped it into safe. It turns out while tucking his Shirt in/pulling his pants up , He had inadvertently knocked the safety off.\n\n[QUOTE=GunFun;291331]i might be wrong, but, seems like people seem to be building a case in favour of caracal. whether i like caracals or not, i most definitely wouldn''t recommend a caracal as your first gun. why go through various practices, drills etc when you can simply have an external safety on your first gun?! i don''t mean to offend, but, somethings are clear and other things clearly don''t make sense![/QUOTE]\n\n[u]I''m not building a case for the Caracal, I''m just trying to change this mindset, where people Behave Carelessly when they "[b] think[/b]" their gun is Safe[/u] \n\n[QUOTE=GunFun;291331]why go through various practices, drills etc when you can simply have an external safety on your first gun?[/QUOTE]\n\n[u]When did safe handling of a firearm become mutually exclusive to external safeties?[/u]   Drills and practice are for dummies who want to learn how to safely handle a tool designed primarily to kill/wound.\nAlso , You don''t need Drills, just Education.

Remember, a handgun with good ergonomics "encourages" the shooter to place his finger on the trigger; it takes practice and experience to "unlearn" this instinct.

Remember, a handgun with good ergonomics "encourages" the shooter to place his finger on the trigger; it takes practice and experience to "unlearn" this instinct. The reason I personally advocate a hammer-fired pistol with a thumb safety for a new shooter is because it minimizes the chance of an ND due to an accidental trigger pull. As you said so yourself, [B]"it has it mounted on the trigger, and you can disengage it in one smooth  motion, when you are squeezing the trigger with your index finger.[/B][B]"[/B], it''s incredibly easy for a new shooter to accidentally disengage the safety and pull the trigger./QUOTE]\n\nI disagree with you completely bro.

( The rifle must be fixed ) this movement can be as small as an inch or so and could be as large a s a FOOT.\nThis is where the quality of the scope build and lenses and lens coatings come in.\nI want to draw your attention to an important point; a modestly priced scope will not be much poorer in quality if it is UNDER 8 or so Magnification and the objective lense is around 40mm. \nA cheap scope is in any case a disaster waiting to happen.\nA quality scope is also taxed hard, if it is of a higher magnification than let us say 10 \nto overcome Parralex problem.\nBuy as expansive as you reasonably can. ( In optics there are no compromises )\nKeep the Magnification under 10 and objective dia at least 36 mm.( When preparing to buy a scope )\nTry to position your head at same spot along the stock comb and maintain a constant  eye  relation and keep the eye in the center of the  circular vision or the view and the black circle around the eye piece should be centered. This will help.\nThere are scopes where the parrallax can be adjusted but then these are specialist scopes for snipers and I will not like another opening in the scope to leak gas and draw moisture on a moderately priced hunting scope. These bells and whistle are only workable on USD 2000 sniper scopes.\nFor a hunting scope follow Mr Murphy buy the best scope fixed 6 X 42 and you will get a Ziess or a Schmidt & Bender for USD 600 to 800 or a fixed 4 and have a life time trouble free scope. Never ever buy a fixed of more than 6 magnification, preferably 4 X.\nYou want a variable  go for a 2.5 -8 X 36, or 3 - 9  X 40, or a 3.5 -10 X 50 but at least a Leupold Vari X 3. and if you are loaded go for Ziess, Shcmidt & Bender or Swarowski, but remember Keep It Simple Stupid ( KISS ) this is one kiss which will keep you out of trouble.\nProblems start when we go into higher and higher magnification.

These are the ones which don''t require a license in the UK and most people there use. I have seen videos of guys shooting sub12fpe Weihrauch HW100 PCPs at 200yds with the pellets landing on target (tin cans) with around 1-1.5ft/lbs of energy.\nAnd as a fact, the Airforce Talon (much lesser powered than the Condor) I''ve seen being shot at 400yds.\nPeople with PCPs like AirArms, Weihrauch, Airforce, etc shoot birds with consistent accuracy at 150yds as it adds to the fun.\nOn paper, these can be shot at alot more.\n\n(2)Thanks for sharing your experience with us! But sadly in my experience the MAX [B]EFFECTIVE[/B] range of ANY sub3in 12ga shell is certainly lesser than 70yds or maybe this is the limit. Agree with Khilji. The spread at 200yd or 150yds is too great for anything and the drop is considerable.\n\n(3)I have a question, how did you find the range? Because I know people who say they shot big boars with LG at 90yds and all but I''ve seen majority of shooters emptying whole mags of SG into boars from 50yds till point blank but still those beasts kicking and breathing. 30yds is the max effective range of SG on boar, maybe 50yds for deer.\nNow what I fail to understand is how can one shoot a bird (goose sized target) at [B]200yds[/B] with a ctg containing just [B]9 pellets[/B] If you''re shooting boars at 50-80yds with DBBL/SBBLs, hardly 2-3 pellets hit the target (or on desired spots)....... wouldn''t the pellets be occupying a GIGANTIC GIGANTIC circumference at 200yds?\n\n(4)What about LG? But the problem with buckshot is at longer ranges you don''t know if a pellet''s even going to hit the target?????\n\n(5)The only slugs available in the market are imported. But I''m totally confused @>1KM range for a slug :confused:\nThe max effective range I''ve heard/seen people shooting slugs in smooth bore shotguns is 60yds or MAX MAX 80yds.\nIf you''re using a rifled barrel, then maybe 150yds with Sabots or MAX MAX MAX 200yds.\nCorrect me if I''m wrong, I''ve heard the drop of a 12ga slug is more than anything after a hundred yards and it doesn''t stay in flight for long afterwards.......... 300yds maybe? 400yd????? 500????? No more.

Someone told me that the best market to look for these engines is Brandreth Rd market Lhr.\r\n\r\nYes Samad boats are really good and very stable for turbulent waters but.....very costly now. Earlier I bought one for Rs10,500 (5 man model, smallest one) and used it extensively. Later on a friend also bought same and we both used that in exclusive hunting areas with some fabulous duck shooting.\r\n[IMG]http://i1225.photobucket.com/albums/ee387/Francolino/19022010003.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\nBut now it is very costly; the smaller size has been discontinued and the larger one is not practical for duck shooting and phenominally expensive now. Also, trailer needs to be made with it, to transport it to river beds....I then wonder whats the difference bw that and other fiberglass or aluminium models? Latter are much economical and puncture proof of course too. One can dump steel duck stools, mojo rods, sharp objects, decoys, anything in the fiberglass/aluminium ones, but the inflatable types such as Samad or the ones they are copied from (Avon, Quicksilver, Zodiak etc) get puncture after one or two shoots.

Normally hunters mix word Snipe with "Common Greenshank" or "Common Redshank" which are also common here & have interesting whistling sounds. Common Snipes are the toughest to shoot if walked up and flushed, treading slowly in shallow marshes (feeding grounds) and ideally require a 24" barrel shotgun with an open choke like e.g. IC and 9# 31g cartrg with very fast reflexes to be shot consistently. If a shooter lets it go after the initial flush, the quarry is more likely to be missed...it has to be taken just after the initial flush. If the shooter waits a bit longer to let it get stable in flight (like we do with quails normally), snipes flip left & right very fast as if delibertely trying to dodge the shooter ;). On the contrary, quails have to be taken with a bit more patience as they get stable in flight after the initial spring from ground. Normally hunters miss quail because of this factor i.e.  taking hurried shots immediately after the initial flush. Thus I consider Common Snipes as the toughest wingshooting targets here, but relatively much easier if shot from blind during duck hunting...as they sometimes accidently bump into you approaching towards blind during early mornings on route to their feeding spots.

This is the proper way to test a gun''s accuracy.

What we want to see is how the gun performs in the hands of established shooters firing just a few rounds from it.

If we''re all having issues shooting it then almost 100 % new shooters will as well.\n\nOn our forums we try to be as less academic as possible and as practical as possible.

The gun was loaded, but it just wouldn''t fire. I kept trying but it didn''t work. So I called Mr. Nafees at Hira arms, and he told me to bring the gun back. I took it to him immediately. He was also pretty surprised, and couldn''t understand what was wrong. So he replaced it and gave me a new one. This time, I fired five shots outside his shop just to make sure. It was working fine. Then I took it home, and fired one shot and it worked. But on the second shot, the trigger jammed again. I really don''t know what to make of it.

There are do''s and donts of charrying non lethel weaponry. I have carried a stun gun, a baton and am a near religious advocate of pepper sprays..

Which is what I did with my last wanna be robber) If he is armed it would be wise NOT to mess around with him. You might.. just might be able to get the job done if his gun is in his waist band.. I.e just spray him in the face and run.. These things are terribly disorianting.. (Personal expereince) However, if he has the drop on you... I.e His weapon is pointing at U. then DONT do anything foolish.. Period!..\r\n\r\nMy advice: next time a BG asks for your stuff hand em over.. Nothing unmacho bout it. I know a number of people who carry firearms and have done the same. \r\n\r\nHowever If you stil insist on carrying a non lethel weapon. Then the pepper spray can enable you to engage without making actual contact.. and the spray will instantly blind and disorient a man for at least an hour... \r\n\r\nU can get em at Tactical arms bahadurabad.. Or  Tayabally and sons  Lucky star. Or Ahmed Traders at Khadda market or DAAD at main Zamzama.

I guess that''s the impression you probably got when you read a review about this gun, what people actually mean when they test accuracy is  :''How well I shoot this gun'', not how accurate the gun is.

The group on the right is 5 hits out of 5 shots with a group size of 0.79&#8221;. Now I&#8217;m not about to claim I can do that every time, but if you look at the group on the left, it&#8217;s just as good except I missed the group with one shot (you can see it just kissed the target at about 3 o&#8217;clock), still, including the miss, it''s a 1.27&#8221; group.\nYou see how the grouping opened up, not becuz of the handgun''s supposed inaccuracy but becuz of the Shooter error.And all it took was one shot to take a sub 1" group to above 1". So accuracy in review threads is subjective, Not a matter of fact.\nTo be honest accuracy assessments should just be ignored for the most part.\n\n[b]All of that being said, Its a great gun, and it will server you well.[/b]', 1, 0, '182.177.164.180', 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

Normally hunters mix word Snipe with "Common Greenshank" or "Common Redshank" which are also common here & have interesting whistling sounds. Common Snipes are the toughest to shoot if walked up and flushed, treading slowly in shallow marshes (feeding grounds) and ideally require a 24" barrel shotgun with an open choke like e.g. IC and 9# 31g cartrg with very fast reflexes to be shot consistently. If a shooter lets it go after the initial flush, the quarry is more likely to be missed...it has to be taken just after the initial flush. If the shooter waits a bit longer to let it get stable in flight (like we do with quails normally), snipes flip left & right very fast as if delibertely trying to dodge the shooter ;). On the contrary, quails have to be taken with a bit more patience as they get stable in flight after the initial spring from ground. Normally hunters miss quail because of this factor i.e. taking hurried shots immediately after the initial flush. Thus I consider Common Snipes as the toughest wingshooting targets here, but relatively much easier if shot from blind during duck hunting...as they sometimes accidently bump into you approaching towards blind during early mornings on route to their feeding spots. And, their meat is quite good too.\n[URL]http://www.avibirds.com/html/Snipe.html[/URL][/QUOTE]\nNice Information francolino bro.

Normally hunters mix word Snipe with "Common Greenshank" or "Common Redshank" which are also common here & have interesting whistling sounds. Common Snipes are the toughest to shoot if walked up and flushed, treading slowly in shallow marshes (feeding grounds) and ideally require a 24" barrel shotgun with an open choke like e.g. IC and 9# 31g cartrg with very fast reflexes to be shot consistently. If a shooter lets it go after the initial flush, the quarry is more likely to be missed...it has to be taken just after the initial flush. If the shooter waits a bit longer to let it get stable in flight (like we do with quails normally), snipes flip left & right very fast as if delibertely trying to dodge the shooter ;). On the contrary, quails have to be taken with a bit more patience as they get stable in flight after the initial spring from ground. Normally hunters miss quail because of this factor i.e.  taking hurried shots immediately after the initial flush. Thus I consider Common Snipes as the toughest wingshooting targets here, but relatively much easier if shot from blind during duck hunting...as they sometimes accidently bump into you approaching towards blind during early mornings on route to their feeding spots.

Normally hunters mix word Snipe with "Common Greenshank" or "Common Redshank" which are also common here & have interesting whistling sounds. Common Snipes are the toughest to shoot if walked up and flushed, treading slowly in shallow marshes (feeding grounds) and ideally require a 24" barrel shotgun with an open choke like e.g. IC and 9# 31g cartrg with very fast reflexes to be shot consistently. If a shooter lets it go after the initial flush, the quarry is more likely to be missed...it has to be taken just after the initial flush. If the shooter waits a bit longer to let it get stable in flight (like we do with quails normally), snipes flip left & right very fast as if delibertely trying to dodge the shooter ;). On the contrary, quails have to be taken with a bit more patience as they get stable in flight after the initial spring from ground. Normally hunters miss quail because of this factor i.e.  taking hurried shots immediately after the initial flush. Thus I consider Common Snipes as the toughest wingshooting targets here, but relatively much easier if shot from blind during duck hunting...as they sometimes accidently bump into you approaching towards blind during early mornings on route to their feeding spots. And, their meat is quite good too.\n\n[URL]http://www.avibirds.com/html/Snipe.html[/URL][/QUOTE]\n\nNice Brief Advise Dear. Nice share', 1, 1, '39.45.194.0', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

We acknowledge the fluctuation in the Price of Caracal Pistols in Pakistan. It is mainly because we haven''t finalized the dealers for Punjab and Khyber Pakhtunkhawah. It is the process. Regarding the price, our Karachi dealer being the only dealer has sold most of the Caracal Pistols between the cost of Rs.\n135, 000/ to Rs. 165,000/. We have now restricted the Dealer to not to sell Caracal Pistols above the retail price of Rs. 85000/. The factory price, shipping, various situations with customs, import license cost, banking cost and huge duty structure add to the cost. As per my knowledge and documentations presented to me, the Caracal Pistols cost between 65000/ to 70,000/ to the dealer when reached in Pakistan.  \nThe dealer has to make money, then the transfer money to other cities and then the retailer makes his profit. We don''t know who is your friend and where he bought the Caracal Gun from and how close he is with the dealer who sold him around the cost price. We cannot force the dealer to sell at his cost price. We can only monitor that the retailers do not sell above our suggested price of Rs. 85000/.\n \nHowever, by realizing your ambitions we will see that if we can arrange to sell the three pistols to you at the rate of Rs. 70,000/ from our own import which we do to sell the weapons to Army / Police Officers at discount prices.

Always remember Allah is our sole protector, not ourselves nor our guards neither our firearms thus a first weapon of choice before leaving your home is Aytal ul kursi and a firm believe.\nComing to the thread, I see pretty sensible comments by most of the members here esp. ED. Jokes apart regarding BGs, there is a point where i tend to disagree with most members. For me life of a BG is not worth a penny let alone\na cell phone. No matter how poor or professional he is, a BG is a BG he chose the path he is walking down himself no\nmatter at what circumstances thus he should also stand responsible to bear the consequences of his choice. The problem of the matter is we as a society have just stopped giving a damn about what is happening around us,\nesp. in the case of street crimes. we are often told to stand down and hand over everything we have irrespective of how cheap or expensive it is because it’s not worth it. This mentality of ours have given\nthese mother F***ing BGs a clean chit to mugged us at free will day in and day out with no or very little resistance from the victim. This is an alarming situation we have to change this mentality for\nthe right start, like a member said everyone has his own faith and believe but there is a Hadith summing it up " If one sees any unlawful act, one must try to stop it by the power of his hand, if he is weak, he should\nspeak out loud condemning it as unlawful, and if the person is weak to the extinct that can’t even raise his voice than should surely believe in his heart that the act is unlawful and un justified, surely it''s the\nweakest sign of eman." And with all due respect we as proud firearm holders are strong enough to use force against this unjustified act. Playing macho is not what is am asking for, but for me killing a BG is "sadqha e\njariyah" these pple are a cancer to our society, who knows how many pple this one BG is gona rob and shot tomorrow who just mugged you today and you had the power to stop him but you didn’t for in your mind you thought it was not worth it.\nWe have to stand up for this cancer someday. Atleast we have to define some clear red lines and for me the red line is when a guy points out a gun blank at you. Of course no one should be that stupid and try to be a macho when the BG\nis pointing a gun at your face, but one should have situational awareness all the time and should act accordingly when the time is right. As far as our corrupt police is concerned well yes they will bug you if you kill a BG, but then again that is the only thing that we expect them to do.\nMoral if we can install generators and UPSs to curb electricity shortages in our homes as the GOP has failed to do so, we can surely arm ourselves with licensed weapons and defend our lives and valuables with it since the GOP has\nfailed at it too.\nJust my two cents.', 1, 1, '39.48.129.163', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

We acknowledge the fluctuation in the Price of Caracal Pistols in Pakistan. It is mainly because we haven''t finalized the dealers for Punjab and Khyber Pakhtunkhawah. It is the process. Regarding the price, our Karachi dealer being the only dealer has sold most of the Caracal Pistols between the cost of Rs.\n135, 000/ to Rs. 165,000/. We have now restricted the Dealer to not to sell Caracal Pistols above the retail price of Rs. 85000/. The factory price, shipping, various situations with customs, import license cost, banking cost and huge duty structure add to the cost. As per my knowledge and documentations presented to me, the Caracal Pistols cost between 65000/ to 70,000/ to the dealer when reached in Pakistan. \nThe dealer has to make money, then the transfer money to other cities and then the retailer makes his profit. We don''t know who is your friend and where he bought the Caracal Gun from and how close he is with the dealer who sold him around the cost price. We cannot force the dealer to sell at his cost price. We can only monitor that the retailers do not sell above our suggested price of Rs. 85000/.\n\nHowever, by realizing your ambitions we will see that if we can arrange to sell the three pistols to you at the rate of Rs. 70,000/ from our own import which we do to sell the weapons to Army / Police Officers at discount prices. But it will take sometime because we have just started the import process for lahore only yesterday. It can take about 20 days till the weapons come out of the custom.

I had to shorten .30-06 brass to the correct length, swage the shoulder back with the sizing die, fireform it with fast powder, then reload it normally.  After all that, reloading any ordinary cartridge was very simple.\n\n Actually, my wife does all the pistol-caliber reloading.  I''ll set the dies up and she will crank through two or three hundred rounds at a time before she gets bored.\n\n When I was learning how to reload I bought a book called "ABCs of Reloading" by Dean Grennell.  There''s another out there now with the same title.  Grennell assumed you were reasonably intelligent and motivated, but you didn''t know anything about reloading.  So he told you what to do.  The best part was the pictures of what happened if you did something wrong.\n\n At the beginning of the book he said, "Many people get into reloading because they think it will save them money.  In reality, you just get to shoot more for the same money you were going to spend anyway."\n\n\n Reloading lets you shoot guns you otherwise can''t find (or afford) ammunition for, and even for popular calibers, it lets you find exactly what your gun likes for maximum accuracy.

You definitely value it more than I do.       A couple of things here , 1.Are you planning on shooting Cheap local Pakistani ammo i.e Darra hand and hammer reloads? or do you mean POF Ammo , becuz if its the former, Pls for the Love of 12G...DONT!!!   2.Well it does have deficiencies.I wont go into what I don''t like about it( since you''ve already bought it now), but One huge problem for me is the current price.( which IMO is inflated for no reason other than ''hey I''m the only dealer that has it, if you want this then You pay however much I ask'' )  3.Best accuracy ? how, when, where, compared to what? I guess that''s the impression you probably got when you read a review about this gun, what people actually mean when they test accuracy is  :''How well I shoot this gun'', not how accurate the gun is. There is a Huge Difference b/w the two. For reference, check the Following image and description.                  These were both shot a 15 yards, off-hand in an &#8220;I&#8221; stance. The group on the right is 5 hits out of 5 shots with a group size of 0.79&#8221;. Now I&#8217;m not about to claim I can do that every time, but if you look at the group on the left, it&#8217;s just as good except I missed the group with one shot (you can see it just kissed the target at about 3 o&#8217;clock), still, including the miss, it''s a 1.27&#8221; group. You see how the grouping opened up, not becuz of the handgun''s supposed inaccuracy but becuz of the Shooter error.And all it took was one shot to take a sub 1" group to above 1". So accuracy in review threads is subjective, Not a matter of fact. To be honest accuracy assessments should just be ignored for the most part.  [b]All of that being said, Its a great gun, and it will server you well.[/b][/QUOTE]  Agreed you are 110% right brother i bought this gun for 46K and @65K i should consider other options to. i have a thought that dealers are closely observing our forum and prices of the guns are changing according to the reviews and likeness of our forum regarding any specific gun.

The Parabellum name comes from ancient Latin saying [I]Si vis Pacem, Para bellum[/I] -  if you want Peace, prepare for War. The Lugers'' design is based on  earlier Hugo Borchard idea, but Luger re-designed the Borchards'' locking  system into much smaller package. Most pre-WW II Parabellums were  developed by DWM company in Germany, with some being manufactured under  license in other countries. During WW II, many companies, such as Mauser  werke and others, also produced Lugers.  	The first country to adopt Lugers was Switzerland - they adopted the  model 1900 Lugers, chambered in 7.65mm Luger/Para[bellum] round. In 1902  the DWM, along with Luger, by request of German Navy developed new  round, 9x19mm Luger/Para[bellum], one of the most common pistol  cartridges of the world, by re-necking the case of the 7.65mm Luger  round. The Luger model 1904, in 9mm, was adopted by German Navy,  following the German army (Reichswehr) in 1908. Since then, the Lugers  were adopted by many countries and servred untill probably the 1950''s or  so.  	All Parabellums are recoil-operated, locked breech, semi-automatic,  striker fired handguns. All Lugers featured unique locking system,  consisting of two tilting-up bars and short moving barrel. Some early  Lugers featured automatic grip safety at the rear side of the grip. All  lugers also featured frame-mounted manual safety at the left side of the  gun. Lugers were manufactured with different barrel lenghts - standart  german army Pistole 08 (Luger M1908) had 102 mm barrels; Navy models  featured 152 mm (6 in) barrels, and Artillery models featured 203 mm (8  in) barrels. Commercial models were manufactured with barrels ranging  from 98 mm up to 350 mm (14 in), some in ''carbine'' versions, with  additional forward handguard and detachable buttstock.  	All lugers were very erconomical and accurate pistols, especially for  the period those were developed in. However, all Lugers were too  sensitive to fouling and for loose manufacturing tolerances, as well as  too pricey, when compared to more modern designs, such as Browning High  Popwer or Walther P38. \ni was surprised to see that this pistol is a collecter item all over the world and prices of the used ones are ranging from $ 1,300 to $ 5,000. Although outdated, the Luger is still sought after by collectors both  for its sleek design and accuracy, and for its connection to [URL="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_Empire"]Imperial[/URL] and [URL="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazi_Germany"]Nazi Germany[/URL].

Even going on marketing principles, Eley Alphamax (for a common man, at Orient Arms) price Rs1700-1800 vs Rs950 does not justify shooting ORDINARY ducks IMO even if some minor velocity difference is there. This velocity difference does not give dead birds nor prevents cripples... I always thought the aim does. And then, the main Qs is: at what price? And for which bird?...just for ordinary ducks. Similary one can say, one should shoot Italian 36g Fiocchi shotshells (common in market too) at dove and pigeons.\n\nWould the 4th shell at the 4th bird ensure a non-cripple if fired with a ''stinger-look-alike'' Eley Alphamax of UK .... even if the aim is non-centered??? [B][U][I]Or do you mean to say it chases the bird till Sind and back to Siberia? Lolxxx!\n[/I][/U][/B]\nIMO, within the usual 35 yards maximum shooting over decoys, ordinary ducks (except ruddy shelducks) don''t need a bigger punch than #6 LEAD 31gms shell; even #4 lead is a personal preference, though not needed.

Geese shooters are aware too that Eley would not ensure a dead bird in that case ...if the shots are haywire or lead incorrect...nor Shaheen Super #4 give cripples vice versa....as geese usually require 2-2.5 body lengths lead...people frequently miss them by aiming at its huge body and seemingly stationery flight while the huge bird actually is as fast as a mallard.[/QUOTE]\n\n\nHahahhhahahahah .........

Browning and Colt had produced pistols in various designs for the civilian market.  The Army''s requirements were mostly driven by its cavalry users.  The design the Army liked was the Model 1905 Colt, which didn''t have a safety at all.  Browning figured if you wanted to shoot, you just pulled the hammer back and you were ready.  Lower it with your thumb if you changed your mind.\n\n The Army first wanted Browning to add the grip safety, which was already a feature on some European guns.  They figured if a soldier sitting on a horse dropped the gun, it would be a good idea.  Then they decided that since a rider would have the reins in one hand and the pistol in the other, cocking the hammer one-handed might be awkward when wearing gloves or in very cold weather.  So they requested the safety lever.  The gun would be cocked as soon as it was loaded, and the safety set.  Moving the safety lever was much easier than cocking the gun one-handed, and didn''t have the "oops!" problem if the hammer slipped out from under your thumb.\n\n Yes, the Army requested two safety features that weren''t present on the civilian model.\n\n There wasn''t much of an idea of "product liability" a century ago.  It was a gun, it was *supposed to* shoot.  If someone were to file a lawsuit, it would have been much more likely claiming the gun *didn''t* shoot when it was supposed to.  A gun that didn''t shoot when the trigger was pulled would obviously be defective.\n\n The Army spent a lot of time training soldiers how to use the 1911, specifically because revolvers and most other automatics didn''t have such a thing, and they didn''t want some soldier getting killed because he forgot to flip the little lever while under stress.', 1, 0, '76.125.99.223', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),
