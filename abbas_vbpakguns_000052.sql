Since last year head rasool is dry so we are focusing on head khanki which has got some good spots for the game. From next season I am planning to have one more boat for down stream head marala.\nThe gun is franchi raptor 4+1 which I am using only for water fowling since 2007, for uplands I love to use doubles from last many years.', 1, 0, '119.154.174.209', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

Wilhelm Bubits as we know worked for Glock and Steyhr, and what he learned from those designed he incorporated into the Caracal. So he just built off his previous designs. For example, the grip angle is that from a Springfield XD9(I dont think he worked for Springfield) as many people dont like the sloped angle grip from that of a Glock. It took the simplicity and few parts from the Glock and made them fewer and simpler. There is also a loaded chamber and cocked indicator, which i dont recollect in a Glock if I am not mistaken. There is a lot more, but the Caracal shouldn''t be downplayed because it is new to the market, rather it improves on the many great designs we have today.\n\np.s.

I''ll say, guides rods are not designed to take enormous amounts of pressure to begin with therefore there is no need for a heavy, solid metal guide rod. on the other hand, Baikal''s guide rod is designed (IMHO) in such a way to reduce the chances of spring buckling under load during cycling, possibly increasing reliability. which is a big time plus in my books.\r\n\r\nmoving on, Baikal''s trigger is the best in its class. no need to discuss it any further.\r\n\r\nmoving on again, Baikal''s chamber clearly speaks that its designed to fire something NASTY. barrel on the other hand is nothing out of the ordinary.\r\n\r\n[B]CZ 999 Scorpion:[/B]\r\n\r\na time proven design that has faced the most critique consumers and lived to tell the tale, The U.S. consumers.\r\n\r\na design that has seen war/conflict. the hardest of any tests. undergone changes afterwards. stating that the product matured or incorporated the lessons learned.\r\n\r\nThe hammer forged barrel of the CZ 999 Scorpion is thicker than Baikal MP446 Viking. after measuring both with a vernier caliper, I welcome anybody to reject my statement. another plus, it is chromed lined from inside and outside whereas Baikal''s barrel is chromed lined from inside only.\r\n\r\nThe rifling on CZ 999 Scorpion is deep and more profound than on Viking. I do not know what that means but I would rather have deep rifling. kinda gives an impression to me that such a barrel would have longer life. but thats only my guestimation. your mileage may vary.\r\n\r\nWhen it comes to handguns, barrel isn''t everything. frames are a big variable as well. Baikal''s frame is polymer reinforced with steel insert. so its steel on steel whereas on CZ 999 Scorpion, it is Steel slide on aluminum frame. not the strongest of setup as Steel on Steel will always be better than Steel on Aluminum. plus Polymer is maintenance free, where Aluminum is high maintenance.\r\n\r\nNow coming to controls, Baikal''s trigger is the best in its class but it ends here. there are other controls too. CZ 999 is supplied with an ambidextrous decocker, slide release and magazine release. this is a big time plus in my opinion. whereas baikal''s controls in my opinion are less than impressive.\r\n\r\n[B]Bottom Line (just my humble opinion, I''m not insisting on anything):[/B]\r\n\r\nIn my humble opinion, Baikal is all about durability whereas CZ 999 scorpion takes into consideration comfort as well. in my opinion, comfort and smoothness matters. I''m not saying that durability doesn''t. all I''m saying when we go to a store to buy a pair of boots, we buy the ones that are strong and comfy. why don''t we all go and buy something made of all metal/steel? strong as hell but would rip out feet to shreds. so why should firearms be any different. \r\n\r\nAny tool that we buy should be strong and comfortable as well. strength isn''t everything. otherwise we would all be wearing pants made of HDPE and boots made of fiber reinforced polymer or carbon steel instead of leather. a firearm is a complete package. you just cannot/should not focus on any two/three variables and forget the rest.\r\n\r\nHowever, your mileage may vary. this is just my personal opinion. if you desire durability to a point that comfort isn''t a necessary trait for you then by all means, Baikal is the way to go. there is no doubt about it. from durability standpoint, it is better than any CZ 999 at any given day. however if you desire a more complete package, CZ 999 offers a lot more than just durability so do look into it.\r\n\r\nin my humble and personal opinion you can do a lot more with CZ 999 than what you can do with Baikal from customization/accessory/repair standpoint.\r\n\r\nyou can make your own guide rods, similarly you can replace all major springs with commonly available spring in the market (slight modification may be necessary). you can also get quality Kydex holsters that fit a CZ 999 whereas with a baikal you are limited to cheap nylon holsters. did I mention that you can easily convert inexpensive beretta/sig magazines to CZ 999 Scorpion compatible magazines?\r\n\r\nRegards.', 1, 1, '182.177.42.116', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

We have to live with this reality, although some times it can happen.\nOne has to try different makes and weights and shapes of bullets to find out which make, shape and weight of bullet gives most accuracy in ones particular pistol.\nShort barrels from compact pistols usually give lesser velocity and this effect is more pronounced when lighter bullets of a given caliber  are used. There fore when using short barrels it is wise to use heavier bullets like 124 gr or 135 or 147 grains in short barrels so the bullets do not lose more velocity and energy. This happens as heavier bullets ensure more efficient combustion of propellant in a shorter barrel.\nGenerally ( as a matter of fact ) heavier bullets fired from pistols tend to strike higher due to a longer barrel time and the lighter bullets strike lower as these take a shorter barrel time.\nACCURACY is some thing you have to determine by trying out different bullets in your pistol. Once you find the most accurate load or make, bullet weight and shape stick to it; if it is also dependable and does not cause stoppages.', 1, 1, '58.27.153.78', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

Being an air rifle junkie my self I decided to start a series of threads about restoration of my airguns, I thought I was being quiet unjust to all the air rifles I have, and even though im a really big vintage car and vintage motorbike nut I haven''t devoted as much time to my first love " my air guns".\nI will be going ahead and restoring my Diana 27 first, due to a multitude of reasons first and foremost due to the reason that I actually wanted to restore it in 2008 and dedicate the restoration to my grand mother who passed away in 2006 and was an inspiration to me, she encouraged me to keep shooting from the moment I shot my first bird with this exact Diana 27. I will never forget the moment when I shot my first bird which happened to be a green finch perched in a bottle brush tree in our house. The other reasons that encouraged me to restore the Diana 27 first include that it was my first air gun, well it was given to my brother but he didn''t use it much so I guess it was mine hehe. \n\nThis particular Diana 27 was given to my elder brother by my chacha who had been shooting it since the early 60s and it belonged to a Taya of mine before that so I am guessing by the serial numbers and the markings that its from the early or mid 50s. The gun has seen its fair share of use and abuse over the years probably most of which was done under my ownership, as I broke the original stock and hid it fearing I would get a scolding other things which happened to it under my ownership would be the loss of the rear sight and the end cap. I got most of the original parts for it from the US this time I came home so If all goes well this and the others will be speedy restorations. Other guns which will undergo restoration include Diana 35, BSA meteor, BSA scorpion pistol and a Gamo Delta.

The  Center fire, as the name would suggest has a specific area of impact (primer)in the middle of the bullets base.\nAnother difference is that rimfire casing cannot be reused because the primer is built into the bullet and not separate like in center fire bullets.\n+p refers to hi pressure ammo. This ammo tends to create an above normal pressure inside the gun when fired.

I submit that the best definition is one that recognizes the weapons average inherent accuracy (in MOA to a maximum deviation of 18" (the width of an average man''s chest)) and still retaining enough energy to inflict great bodily harm or death.\r\n\r\nA round that reaches the target but can''t take it out of the fight is worthless.  A weapon that fires a round that at 100 yards has enough energy to kill but is not likely to actually hit the target except by pure blind luck is also worthless for shots at 100 yards.\r\n\r\nA 9mm can travel 1 mile (1.5K).  It won''t kill at 1 mile (1.5K).\r\n\r\nAnd this assumes the shooter can actually employ the weapon at the maximum effective range.  Give a guy with no long range shooting experience a hyper accurate rifle and he''s still only a 50 meter shooter no matter the weapon''s max effective range.\r\n\r\nA top notch 1911 might shoot a 1.5" group at 25 yards.  That''s a 3" group at 50 yards.  6" at 100 yards, and 12" at 200 yards... but how many people could make use of a 1911 at 100 yards?  Few. I shot at a target about 90 yards away with a US Army Marksmanship Unit built 1911 with good factory ammo.  I hit a stationary target which was blue on a white background and frankly a bit over sized 7 out of 9 shots.  I had all the time in the world. No wind.\r\n\r\nAdd to the 1.5" inherent accuracy of the gun a great shooters group a 2" hold at 25 yards and you have a 14" group at 100 yards with about 18" in drop.  If the shooter doesn''t know the drop, or add wind into the equation, that''s a miss, every time, maybe a single lucky hit in 100.\r\n\r\nIf the shooter is printing shots in an 8"group at 7 yards... the maximum effective range for that shooter is likely only 15 yards.\r\n\r\nSo the answer is a very clear and definitive...

I submit that the best definition is one that recognizes the weapons average inherent accuracy (in MOA to a maximum deviation of 18" (the width of an average man''s chest)) and still retaining enough energy to inflict great bodily harm or death.\n\nA round that reaches the target but can''t take it out of the fight is worthless.  A weapon that fires a round that at 100 yards has enough energy to kill but is not likely to actually hit the target except by pure blind luck is also worthless for shots at 100 yards.\n\nA 9mm can travel 1 mile (1.5K).  It won''t kill at 1 mile (1.5K).\n\nAnd this assumes the shooter can actually employ the weapon at the maximum effective range.  Give a guy with no long range shooting experience a hyper accurate rifle and he''s still only a 50 meter shooter no matter the weapon''s max effective range.\n\nA top notch 1911 might shoot a 1.5" group at 25 yards.  That''s a 3" group at 50 yards.  6" at 100 yards, and 12" at 200 yards... but how many people could make use of a 1911 at 100 yards?  Few. I shot at a target about 90 yards away with a US Army Marksmanship Unit built 1911 with good factory ammo.  I hit a stationary target which was blue on a white background and frankly a bit over sized 7 out of 9 shots.  I had all the time in the world. No wind.\n\nAdd to the 1.5" inherent accuracy of the gun a great shooters group a 2" hold at 25 yards and you have a 14" group at 100 yards with about 18" in drop.  If the shooter doesn''t know the drop, or add wind into the equation, that''s a miss, every time, maybe a single lucky hit in 100.\n\nIf the shooter is printing shots in an 8"group at 7 yards... the maximum effective range for that shooter is likely only 15 yards.\n\nSo the answer is a very clear and definitive...

Reason being, as one of our dog gurus here, Easy Rider bro, who has a vast experience with dogs, is a breeder himself, and has taken part in international dog shows with winning dogs, was kind enough to give me some time over the phone and a couple of useful suggestions.\n\nThe difference in cost of keeping a pedigreed/non-pedigreed is nil. You feed them the same.\n\nThe difference in care for each is also nil. You take good care of both and make them part of the family.\n\nYou spend equal much of time in socializing them. Training. Training cost, if sent over for such.\n\nIn case of mating even, pedigreed pups will ensure continued good dog blood in the house, and if you offer pups for sale, demand for pedigreed pups is higher than the non-pedigreed.\n\nHence, the only difference is the initial cost. Means, 25-35k''s for the non pedigreed, 50-60K''s for the pedigreed (not show class). \n\nI have decided to invest the bit of extra mileage, deeming it worth it.\n\nThe issue is just that the "Rott itch" keeps coming back over me, lolz!\n\nI find myself in exactly the same dilemma as when loaded with a license and having to select a new handgun.\n\nThe Rott is kind of cal.45, Alsation/GSD a 9''er, more [I]stamina[/I], less "recoil", "easy carry", lolz!\n\nI wonder why on the earth I always land in tough dilemmas, when selecting a handgun, car, dog, etc, lolz!

I myself once suffered a near-traumatic experience when an Armscor JHP round (the fourth round I ever fired!) got stuck in the chamber of my gun (causing the slide to go out of battery). What''s more, the slide had completely frozen up, and no amount of force could move it (so now I couldn''t even rack the slide to eject the bad round). Fortunately, the slide had stopped at the exact spot where it needs to be in order for the gun to be disassembled. So I took the gun apart (after wrestling with the slide for almost 20 minutes before it finally budged) and then had to use a rifle''s cleaning rod to force the stuck round out of the chamber! This whole experience scared me to such an extent that, since then, I''ve never fired a single JHP from my gun! :p', 1, 1, '110.36.195.23', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

Let me explain here briefly how things are made, inspected & QC''d.\n\nEach individual parts is inspected after being made for tensile strength, sizing, finish, fit etc. There always are different testing/inspecting standards for different parts.\nEach part is again checked, inspected & tested on each stage once product starts getting assembled; mainly for fit n flawless function.\n\nNow plastics (polymers): There always are huge rejections in making plastic products; be it extrusion, molding (injection or pressed) or die casting; [B][COLOR=#b22222]no matter its Glock, Styer, S&W, Caracal, Taurus or who ever is the manufacturer[/COLOR][/B] . So the product is checked, inspected 100% for molding, extrusion or casting faults, to compensate this rate of rejection mostly plastic manufacturing department keep their production run up to 10% more than they are requisite for.\n\nNow crack in Viking''s frame: It without a doubt is an inspector''s overlook; pieces that had to go in rejection got slipped in the passed production. [B]We all know where Biakal is made and how slack is there QC thats the only reason they design their own guns having character of easy to make, lot less prone to manufacturing faults instead of making some [COLOR=#b22222][I]mongrel[/I][/COLOR] guns ;)[/B]\nThere can be lot different reasons of a hairline crack in a specific area but one thing is sure that its easy to spot n eradicate the consistently occurring manufacturing fault than something unusual n inconsistent, so hopefully this crack issue will be solved by manufacturer soon.  I am saying that being a manufacturer of soccer balls of Sig standard myself ;)\n\nAs 12G bro explained earlier, if plastic is not bonded at a specific place it will show from the very beginning giving a 2 eyed customer chance to avoid the rejected product.\n\nMy take on Viking (after cracking issue is high lightened):  a person considering a similar handgun can either;\n\n    [COLOR=#008000][B][I]a)[/I] Do the QC by himself while buying the gun (if he thinks he is capable of) and go home with a pure tank by his belt.[/B]\n[/COLOR]\n    [B][I]b)[/I] Go for something else made with stricter QC by paying extra for the expensive quality inspection job.\n[/B]\n\n[COLOR=#ff0000]I love Viking and be going for it when ever I got a chance [B]but not with my eyes closed[/B][/COLOR] ;)[/QUOTE]\n\n\nHats off to explanation.

Hence, it''s beyond my logic that only Vikings [I]drop to the ground and break[/I]??!!!Come on, are we talking toys?\n\nThe ballistic recoil pressure is manifold any gravitational force bro, that the gun that breaks down by a simple drop during transportation, can''t get harmed by the use of it, as you mention there may be no QC issues with Baikal Viking??!!\n\nAlright, let''s [I]discuss[/I]. In my opinion, there''s more than just a QC issue Canik bro, there may be serious [I]design flaws[/I] even!\n\nI am of the opinion with respect to Vikings that it''s too "[I]tight[/I]" a gun. Everything is too  "snug" about it. The slide-to-frame fit, the recoil spring, the hammer reversal, the hammer drop even. Just try to drop a hammer on a Viking with controlled force. And just rack it back for loading up. You''ll know instantly what I''m talking about, you need to apply quite some force for this. Alright let''s move on, though these are my personal reflections, you may agree or not, but nevertheless this is what''s called a "discussion".\n\nIn order for a gun not to take up or [I]absorb [/I]too much of the recoiling forces, there needs to be some sort of a "play" in the thing somewhere. This will let the gun "vent out" somewhere, and also transfer more of the recoiling forces to the hand holding it. When everything is too "snug", rest assured, the mechanism and structure of the body take up most of the forces, probably causing the[I] after-use cracks[/I] mentioned.\n\n As for the NIB pre-used ones with cracks, well, that seems to be a QC issue with the materials used by manufacturer, no [I]transportation breakages[/I], as such, it''s not ''fragile glass", hopefully.\n\n Hence, we may have both things in combination about the Viking, design flaws and QC issues as well.\n\nI am of the opinion that the manufacturers are aware of these things, hence the frequent changes with the different models.\n\nI myself would like to see a finally perfect Viking model. So far, I agree with Chief''s blunt remarks, "dump it".\n\n\nRegards.', 1, 1, '182.177.101.202', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

As you know I visited the Police Station on Thursday evening and the ASI said that he will call me on Friday but unfortunately there was no call. So I visited again yesterday evening and met him. He said that he could not check my case as he was busy but he was cooperative person and he approached to his officer (Sub Inspector) and tried to explain him my case but that guy said [U]“MUJHAY NAHIN PATA, YEH [B]MUHARRAR[/B] WAGHAIRA JANTAY HAIN, AGUR TUMHAIN NAHIN PATA TO KISI SENIOR MUHARAR SAY PATA KARO”[/U]\r\n  So the ASI called another [B]MUHARRAR[/B] somewhere in another station (I think at SSP office in ISB) and checked with him and finally asked me to wait outside of his office for a while and he will call me. After waiting for about 10 minutes his assistant came out and said is this your license and then asked me to come inside.   He, the assistant opened a Register No. 17 and started entering my license information and meanwhile asked me about the photocopies of the license and NIC which I gave him. He got stuck when he saw my residence address of Pindi on my NIC, then I explained him again that I changed my residence in XYZ Society in Islamabad and gave him the proof (copy of Society’s property transfer letter with the copies of utility bills). So he entered my new address in his register and fixed the police station stamp on the last page of my license where he wrote:  [CENTER][CENTER][B]“BAMUTABAQ REGISTER NO. 17 SAFFA ALLAF SERIAL NUMBER 25 PUR INDRAJ HOA”.[/B][/CENTER][/CENTER]  [CENTER][CENTER][B]Name of ASI – THANA xyz[/B][/CENTER][/CENTER]  Finally he returned me the stamped License, I asked him about the fee he said [B]“SIR JEE SARKARI FEES TO KOI NAHIN HAY MAGHUR HE HE HEEEE[/B].

That, Sir, is a FACT![/B]\n\nI emailed Canik55 after I bought my Piranha-F and asked a whole slew of questions. Included in them was the life of my barrel, if it was safe to shoot +P ammo, and would it effect my gun in any way. They replied by saying that my gun''s barrel life is 35,000 rounds, yes I can fire +P ammo, and if I''m going to use +P ammo [B]exclusively[/B] then my barrel''s life would be reduced to 20,000 rounds. Using +P ammo does have a drastic effect on barrel life, but using such ammo is perfectly safe (as long as the manufacturer confirms it). Here''s another [B]fact:[/B] Also, almost all armies across the world exclusively use +P ammo, which means guns like the CF98 (standard sidearm of the Chinese Army) and CZ999 (standard sidearm of the Serbian Army) [B]are manufactured [/B][B]to be capable of firing +P ammo![/B] All Canik guns are based on the CZ75 (which itself is used by almost half a dozen military units across the world) and are capable of firing +P ammo without any worries. Here''s another [B]fact:[/B] Chinese Redbox ammo, which is so commonly available & used here in Pakistan, is [B]+P ammo![/B]\n\nJust keep in mind that using +P reduces barrel life, that''s the reason why usage of +P ammo is usually discouraged. But then again, when was the last time you heard of anyone firing more than 15,000 rounds from the same handgun! :p It all comes down to personal choice; if your gun is capable of shooting +P ammo and you want to try out some, then go right ahead.

I''ll say, guides rods are not designed to take enormous amounts of pressure to begin with therefore there is no need for a heavy, solid metal guide rod. on the other hand, Baikal''s guide rod is designed (IMHO) in such a way to reduce the chances of spring buckling under load during cycling, possibly increasing reliability. which is a big time plus in my books.\n\nmoving on, Baikal''s trigger is the best in its class. no need to discuss it any further.\n\nmoving on again, Baikal''s chamber clearly speaks that its designed to fire something NASTY. barrel on the other hand is nothing out of the ordinary.\n\n[B]CZ 999 Scorpion:[/B]\n\na time proven design that has faced the most critique consumers and lived to tell the tale, The U.S. consumers.\n\na design that has seen war/conflict. the hardest of any tests. undergone changes afterwards. stating that the product matured or incorporated the lessons learned.\n\nThe hammer forged barrel of the CZ 999 Scorpion is thicker than Baikal MP446 Viking. after measuring both with a vernier caliper, I welcome anybody to reject my statement. another plus, it is chromed lined from inside and outside whereas Baikal''s barrel is chromed lined from inside only.\n\nThe rifling on CZ 999 Scorpion is deep and more profound than on Viking. I do not know what that means but I would rather have deep rifling. kinda gives an impression to me that such a barrel would have longer life. but thats only my guestimation. your mileage may vary.\n\nWhen it comes to handguns, barrel isn''t everything. frames are a big variable as well. Baikal''s frame is polymer reinforced with steel insert. so its steel on steel whereas on CZ 999 Scorpion, it is Steel slide on aluminum frame. not the strongest of setup as Steel on Steel will always be better than Steel on Aluminum. plus Polymer is maintenance free, where Aluminum is high maintenance.\n\nNow coming to controls, Baikal''s trigger is the best in its class but it ends here. there are other controls too. CZ 999 is supplied with an ambidextrous decocker, slide release and magazine release. this is a big time plus in my opinion. whereas baikal''s controls in my opinion are less than impressive.\n\n[B]Bottom Line (just my humble opinion, I''m not insisting on anything):[/B]\n\nIn my humble opinion, Baikal is all about durability whereas CZ 999 scorpion takes into consideration comfort as well. in my opinion, comfort and smoothness matters. I''m not saying that durability doesn''t. all I''m saying when we go to a store to buy a pair of boots, we buy the ones that are strong and comfy. why don''t we all go and buy something made of all metal/steel? strong as hell but would rip out feet to shreds. so why should firearms be any different. \n\nAny tool that we buy should be strong and comfortable as well. strength isn''t everything. otherwise we would all be wearing pants made of HDPE and boots made of fiber reinforced polymer or carbon steel instead of leather. a firearm is a complete package. you just cannot/should not focus on any two/three variables and forget the rest.\n\nHowever, your mileage may vary. this is just my personal opinion. if you desire durability to a point that comfort isn''t a necessary trait for you then by all means, Baikal is the way to go. there is no doubt about it. from durability standpoint, it is better than any CZ 999 at any given day. however if you desire a more complete package, CZ 999 offers a lot more than just durability so do look into it.\n\nin my humble and personal opinion you can do a lot more with CZ 999 than what you can do with Baikal from customization/accessory/repair standpoint.\n\nyou can make your own guide rods, similarly you can replace all major springs with commonly available spring in the market (slight modification may be necessary). you can also get quality Kydex holsters that fit a CZ 999 whereas with a baikal you are limited to cheap nylon holsters. did I mention that you can easily convert inexpensive beretta/sig magazines to CZ 999 Scorpion compatible magazines?\n\nRegards.[/QUOTE]', 1, 0, '59.103.222.184', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

It was sunny and hot at range with no one else to disturb our first date; so things from zeroing to different ammo test was a cool affair.\r\n\r\nI honestly had no intention to buy another .22 (as already have Erma .22lr semi auto) but an unbearable itch started with Avais bro''s new bolt action .22lr Brno acquisition. Requested "The Bond of Nilagumbad" (Naveed bro) to find me a .22mag (preferably a CZ) and he didn''t take more than 2 days to find a CZ 455 Lux ;).\r\nReason for choosing .22 mag simply is to have something between .223 & .22lr ( I know I know its a lame excuse but had create one to treat the itch ;) ).\r\n\r\nCZ 455 is newest rifle in CZ''s rimfire range that they developed as a multi caliber platform; like .22mag can easily be turned into .17hmr by just changing the barrel. New barrel changeability feature although is useless for us living in Pakistan but still owning this rifle is no doubt is a thing to be proud of along with CZ''s inherent accuracy.\r\n\r\nNow rifle specs:\r\n\r\nCalibre:     .22 WMR.\r\n\r\nMagazine: Detachable with Capacity of 5 rounds.\r\n\r\nStock:       (Lux) Walnut. \r\n\r\nTrigger: Adjustable for weight of pull. \r\n\r\nSights:   Adjustable.\r\n\r\nOverall length:  38.5 Inches. \r\n\r\nBarrel:  (Hammer Forged)  20.5 inches. \r\n\r\nWeight: 2.8 kgs. \r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i577.photobucket.com/albums/ss220/denovo87/CZ%20455%20Lux%2022mag/Rifle1.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i577.photobucket.com/albums/ss220/denovo87/CZ%20455%20Lux%2022mag/Rifle2.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i577.photobucket.com/albums/ss220/denovo87/CZ%20455%20Lux%2022mag/Rifle3.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i577.photobucket.com/albums/ss220/denovo87/CZ%20455%20Lux%2022mag/stampmadein.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i577.photobucket.com/albums/ss220/denovo87/CZ%20455%20Lux%2022mag/stampCZ455.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i577.photobucket.com/albums/ss220/denovo87/CZ%20455%20Lux%2022mag/stampcaliber.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPut a Redfield 3-9x40 scope on that I think is quite enough for this rifle as I felt comfortable with 6 magnification at 100 mtrs, more than that was bit of discomfort as holding cross on target was not possible (for me at least).\r\nZeroed rifle at 60 meters as read that .22mag with 2000fps velocity zeroed at 60m will again be on bull at around 120m.\r\n\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i577.photobucket.com/albums/ss220/denovo87/CZ%20455%20Lux%2022mag/Rifle4.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRifle is a thing of beauty on account of furniture, metal, finish, bluing, bolt, action & what not.

The both addresses (Current & Permanent) on my NIC is showing our Pindi address.

I''m asking coz there''s a lot of difference between a CZ 75B/Shadow and Pirhana''s weight.\n\nAlso, Ahnab Bro, the use of +p ammo does not only increase the wear on the barrel only, it also exerts pressure on the slide and frame(especially on the area which stops the rearward travel of the slide) and also wears out your springs more. Usually if someone tends to shoot +p ammo frequently or exclusively, it is recommended that the factory spring be replaced with one with a higher load rating. You are right in one point though, there are very few people who''d shoot the gun so much that it wears out, and occasional shooting of +p ammo would be ok in a full size handgun like the Pirhana.\n\nRegards.[/QUOTE]\n\nYou''re absolutely right regarding the toll +P ammo takes on a handgun, hence it should be used sparingly (IMHO). I''m no firearms expert, but personally I wouldn''t recommend shooting +P on a regular/exclusive basis (although I guess a few, occasional rounds wouldn''t hurt).\n\nThe Piranha-F has an aluminum alloy slide & body.

The original idea came about ten years back to Swiss armourer Vivian Mueller, who at the time experienced cutting and welding together multiple parts of the famous Sig P210: the result was a long slide, double barrel 9mm, highly decorated collector piece, which indeed shot very well.\r\n\r\n[img]http://cdn5.thefirearmsblog.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/af2011_a_1_double_barrel_pi_stol_arsenal_firearms-tm-tfb.jpg[/img]\r\n\r\nOur idea took the challenge further: to commemorate the legendary Colt 1911-A1 in the Centenary by making a true industrial market-ready double barrel .45 caliber pistol. We achieved success in the brief span of 6 months, after intense and round-the-clock 3D designing, stereolithographic modeling and parts machining.\r\n\r\nThe gun can be handled by any shooter able to shoot with a .45 Acp and it is not only very pleasing, but very accurate and great fun. The AF2011-A1 holds amazing and surprising target performance for the shooter: in fact, it will group all the 8 double .45 caliber rounds (16 bullets) held in the duplex, single columns magazines, in a target of the size of an orange at 15 yards and of a water melon at 25.\r\n\r\nThe stopping power of the AF2011-A1 is tremendous: 2 bullets for a total of 460 Grains weight impacting at 1 to 2 inches apart (depending on the distance of the target) will knock down a bull, while the whole 18 bullets, for a payload exceeding 4000 Grains, can be delivered to the target in about 3 seconds.\r\n\r\nThe AF2011-A1 obviously features a number of very special parts, such as the single slide, the single frame, the single spur double hammer, the single grip safety, the single body double mainspring housing and the single double cavity magazine floor plate, the long and double magazine latch, the special barrel bushings and the hold open lever and side lever safety with long shafts: but the most interesting feature of the new pistol which we strived to keep during the development of the project, is the interchangeability of most internal parts, which come as standard 1911 replacement parts. These include the firing pins, the firing pins plates, the sears groups, the triple springs, the inner parts of the mainspring housings, the recoil springs and recoil springs rods, the magazine bodies and inner parts, the sights (including after market adjustable sights) the grips and grips screws and bushings.\r\n\r\nThe AF2011-A1 ("Twenty Eleven" for aficionados) can be ordered either with 2 independent triggers and one sear group (left or right, with user-interchangeability for right or left operations) or with 2 triggers permanently joined and the choice of 1 or 2 sear groups. The AF2011-A1 is available in mirror finish Deep Blue or with a 3400 Vickers surface hardness White Ash Nitrite coating.\r\n\r\nCourtesy: [url]http://www.thefirearmblog.com/blog/2012/03/12/arsenal-double-barrel-1911/[/url]', 1, 1, '119.154.69.96', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

There appears to be no logic or justification for this announcement except to attempt to win over the lawyer&#8217;s community.[/B][/FONT][B][FONT=Georgia !important] \n\nIn the first place prohibited bore are assault weapon and not weapons of self-defence, hence none of the sections of public including our worthy ministers, members of Parliament, bureaucrats, generals, judges or journalists should be favoured with such lethal weapons, which are capable of being misused and would inevitably add to the rampant violence and killings across the country. The authorities should be conscious of the fact that no matter how many arms you may possess, the person who pulls the gun first, becomes the master of their fate.[/FONT][FONT=Georgia !important] \n\nInstead of pursing the policy of deweaponizing the society, which was the agenda of Chairperson Shaheed Benazir Bhutto, much to our disappointment the present governments both at Federal and provincial levels are continuing to follow policies of General Pervez Musharraf to weaponize all the rich and influentials by dolling out to them lacs of licences to possess prohibited assault weapons to further assert on the poor, oppressed and unarmed citizens particularly in the rural areas.[/FONT][FONT=Georgia !important]\nFederal and provincial governments are also not mindful of the fact that with the proliferation of the weapons in our society, there is a consistent unchecked rise and rise in militancy and incidents of terrorism. Not only people of Pakistan are already suffering immense sense of insecurity but the terrorism is the biggest enemy and threat to the integrity of our country as well.[/FONT][FONT=Georgia !important]\nAs regards, the plea to secure the ruling elite, it may be remembered, that they are already enjoying protection free of charge from the soldiers of Para-military forces, commandoes and police in more than required numbers. On the contrary, what is more important and deserving is the security of the life and properties of ordinary citizens. This is the paramount duty of the State as guaranteed under Article 9 of our Constitution\n\n[/FONT][FONT=Georgia !important]The policy of the Government to encourage and promote private security agencies, are capable of assuming the role and shape of private armies and impinge upon the privacy of the citizens as well. It must be noted that the private armies are clearly forbidden under Article 256 of the Constitution. Despite, this clear constitutional prohibition, we witness huge number of licensed and unlicensed private arm groups under one garb or pretext or the other. By promoting these private security agencies, the governments are implying that they have failed to discharge their basic obligation to protect life and property of ordinary citizens.\n[/FONT][FONT=Georgia !important]\nAnother pertinent question arises as to why should lawyers alone be favoured with a blue passport and licences to possess assault weapons. Why not the same privilege is granted to all other professional bodies. After all their contribution in the society is not less than the lawyers. I would advise all professional bodies to hurriedly invite Mr. Rehman Malik, (before he changes his mind) as their chief guest on any pretext, praise him so much that he is swayed to pronounce the same privileges to the members of the respective bodies.\n[/FONT][/B][FONT=Georgia !important][B]\nAssuming, if all other professional bodies are treated at par with the lawyers community, which will be in accordance with the Constitution and all of them are granted &#8220;Blue Passports&#8221;, then an amusing aspect would emerge that colour of most of the Pakistani passports will change from &#8220;Green&#8221; to &#8220;Blue&#8221;, which is the colour of the ordinary passports of Indians.\n[/B]\n[URL]http://blogs.thenews.com.pk/blogs/2012/03/09/implications-of-blue-passports-and-black-kalashnikovs/[/URL][/FONT][/quote]', 1, 0, '182.178.167.25', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

But we all are committing this sin without even realizing it. An ideal personality is the one whose footsteps we follow. Just think about it for once, do we follow the footsteps of Quaid or Allama Iqbal? NO. Do we do what they told us to do? NO. Then why we always lie about it and teach our children to do the same. Satin was God’s most favourite angel but when he refused to obey God’s command he was cursed by GOD and angels. Then he promised God he will misguide all human beings till the end of time and look he is fulfilling his promise look at his determination. And we are puppets in his hands. Whatever he promised to do he is doing it no matter what. That’s what is called determination. We humans always look at the negative side of the picture if we are truly idealizing him and following his footsteps, why don’t we follow his strong will and determination. We just curse him when something bad happens instead of fighting him.

For thise who compare baikal with Ak47, please be advised that ak47 though is durable but least accurate beyond 100 meters and malfunctions after extensive session. Because pure steel and alloys have different heating points ( as per my knowledge). \nI have heard that baikal patters not as good as hatsan do even with inserted chokes.\nIf durability is the only concern, then barrel is not the thing which bears the load, its the chamber(correct me if i am wrong).

I was ready to go to bring [I]roti [/I]for me from a near-by [I]tandoor [/I](which is just 2 minutes away from my home, walking), I took my wallet and my cell-phone and she said, just take Rs. 20 out of your wallet and do not go outside with your wallet and cell-phone, street crimes are high these days ... \n\nThis fear of my mom was not only bcuz of the on going street crimes but also two incidents happened within family which led us to be more cautious and made me purchase my akdal semi-auto shotgun for HD and stoeger cougar 9mm for HD/SD. one of such incident is related below.\n\nMy younger brother, with his better-half, was going to Lahore from Faisalabad back in Nov-10 and at raiwind road his car was stopped by a blue Liana. Time was around 8.15-30 pm. Some 4-5 people came out of the car, and two of them started walking towards his car. Distance between the cars was around 15-20 feet. One went for passenger door and one went for driving seat. By that time, these two had already withdrew their pistols. My brother tried to push-forward the car but the guy at the right side tapped the bonnet with his gun and he stopped. Meanwhile, the guy on the left side tried to open the door of bhabhi side but it was locked. My brother at once started reversing the car at the full speed. His car was already on the edge of the road, half on road and half on side-way. BGs started firing straight at the car but my bro does not remember if he heard any bullet hitting the car. His plan was to reverse the car to get out of the deadly firing range and then turn the car on wrong side and flee but there was an electric pole behind, which, ofcourse, he could not see and car rammed in it badly. BGs were coming towards the car and he had no other option but to run them over. He asked her wife to sit tight bcuz she was in pain from a sudden jerk she sustained when car hit (she was not wearing seat belt but by brother was). He forwarded the car at the full speed he possibily could and he says that he still remembers the BG on right side aiming and firing at the car but he does not remember any sound of any bullet hitting the car. He says BG might be trying at tyres or whatever. Some of the BGs had to jump to save them from hitting and he fleed. Stopped at the near-by CNG station, called police and all went fine after that. When he came back home (Rwp) tomorrow morning in the same car and we checked the car for bullets we found out that one bullet hit the front grill, went into battery, missing a wire with just one mm, exited making a big hole (kind of bursted), damaging two cells of battery and no trace after that for bullet. No other mark of bullet hit was found. Car didn''t start after that and we had to replace the bettry to get it started. Gave sadqa for the new lives of our brother and sister and thanked God for his grace upon our family. And now, we have a loaded handgun in our easy reach when driving outside. Pictures of the car from back side are attached to analyze the speed in which he was reversing his car. \n\nHe wishes that he had gun at that night so that he could take one or two BGs. And this incident make us feel that gun is the necessity these days than luxury. I didn''t buy a luxurious tip-top mobile just to buy my handgun.\n\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]9128[/ATTACH]\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]9129[/ATTACH]\n\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]9127[/ATTACH]\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]9125[/ATTACH]\n\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]9126[/ATTACH]', 1, 0, '202.147.183.150', 0, 1, 5, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

It was the day after deer season had ended, yet they spied a handsome animal bedded down in the snow. Not wanting to pass up an opportunity, they silently crept up on their quarry, raised their rifle, lined the deer up in the crosshairs ... and then took a picture through the scope with a mobile phone. That photo provided all the proof they needed that they had successfully stalked their prey, without bringing home an illegally-obtained carcass. It also inspired them to create the Kill Shot photo/video-recording rifle.\r\n\r\nCurrently still in the development phase, the Kill Shot would simply be a replica hunting rifle, that takes pictures instead of firing bullets. Users would sneak up on their quarry and get them in the crosshairs as per usual, but pulling the trigger would cause a digital camera - built into the scope - to grab a time- and date-stamped snapshot. That camera could also zoom, and record video.\r\n\r\nImages would be saved to a memory card, that would mount in the same location as an ammunition magazine on a real rifle. A USB port would allow users to download their photos or footage onto a computer, where they could be shared with other no-kill hunters.\r\n\r\nThe Gregg brothers, along with their other brother, Daniel, see several possible applications for the Kill Shot. For starters, it could simply be used by people who like the idea of tracking down wild animals in nature, but who don''t want to kill them - the Greggs aren''t stuck on the name "Kill Shot," by the way.\r\n\r\nIt could also be used as a means of training novice hunters, without the dangers of using live ammunition. Additionally, they suggest that it could be used by regular hunters for "hunting" animals outside of season - although this could lead to some interesting run-ins with game wardens. As a side note, Randy himself works as a park ranger in Pennsylvania.\r\n\r\nThe three brothers are currently raising funds for prototype and commercial development of the Kill Shot (or whatever it''ll be called) on Kickstarter. A pledge of US$150 will get you one, should they ever see production.\r\n\r\nWhile some people might find the idea of a combination camera and rifle kind of ... well, silly, it is not unprecedented. The 1980s TV series Max Headroom depicted mercenary news videographers wielding RR-7 Gun Cameras, while Russian camera company KMZ used to produce a product known as the Photosniper - a very rifle-like stock and trigger, which an SLR body and lens could be mounted onto.\r\n\r\nCourtesy: [url]http://nomanshah.com/blog/camera-gun-would-let-harmless-hunters-get-killer-wildlife-shots/[/url]', 1, 1, '119.154.1.198', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

Rifles chambered for the 300 Winchester Mgnum have since been introduced by most American and European manufacturers.\n\nThe 300 Winchester Magnum arrived as something of an anti-climax, because everyone even remotely interested in guns had been predicting it from the day the 338 Winchester Magnum was brought out back in 1958. The 30-338 wildcat quickly followed, and both it and the 308 Norma Magnum are practically the same thing. The newer 300 Winchester magnum has a slightly longer body (by about .12-inch) and the shorter neck than any of its predecessors. According to principles of moders cartridge design, this short neck would be considered a poor feature. It means the heavy bullets will have to project back into the powder space quite a bit. Whether Winchester just wanted to be sure their round was different than everyone else''s or made the body longer so owners of 30-338 or 308 Norma rifles could rechamber to the new cartridge is anyone''s guess. Because all are belted cases, it would probably be all right to shoot the shorter rounds in the longer Winchester chamber, naother advantage of the slightly longer body. This would fire form the brass to the new dimensions for subsequent reloading.

[/B]\nThat''s the price in USA, would be more costly in Pak even if it is available. This model you''re talking about is Gamo Whisper - Silent cat, Gamo Whisper X is locally available though not very much liked.\n\n[B]900fps is good enough with recommended scope[/B]\nThe scope comes with the combo that website is offering, you can''t buy it online from PK. If you buy a gun from here, no such combos exist, so you''ll have to get the scope separately.\n\nSecondly, the 950fps is [B]exaggerated[/B], I repeat again exaggerated. Gamo and almost all other airgun manufacturers have a trend of hiking the velocities of their guns to make a spot in the market. I remeber people on PG bought Chinese under-lever airguns thinking they''re 750fps as claimed, but in reality the velocity hovered around 400-500fps.\nIt clearly says on the top of the page that it''s 950 fps with PBA pellets. Now let me tell you what PBAs are. They''re steel pellets made by Gamo, 5-8X more expensive than the normal lead pellets commonly available. They''re totally in-accurate and not at all suitable for hunting, and accuracy is king in airguns.\nUsing 14gn lead pellets (the most common ones like Gamo, Diana, Crosman domed or pointed or whatever), this airgun achieves 710-715fps the max. On the other hand, the Diana 34 spring is much more durable and longer-lasting than these Gamo springs which break after a couple of thousand shots.\nThe 34 will achieve +-730 fps with the same pellets. This variation is not something to write home about.\n\n[B]Diana 34 classic recommended by Chaudhary, its good but .22 is 750 fps as yours recommended has 950fps in .22[/B]\nAlready answered this in my previous paragraph.\nDiana airguns are durable, tough and reliable. Many users of Gamo Whisper are dis-satisfied with their gun''s performance. \n\n\nGo to the market for recce, check out the prices, see all guns personally and then get the one which you like better.', 1, 1, '119.73.2.2', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

Interesting thing was almost all species were there especially in the evening 2 hr session - Mallard, Garganeys, Gadwalls, Pintails, Teals, Wigeons, Shovelers & Pochards (few).  The abundance of shoveler flocks roaming around and arrival of very vocal Garganey flocks indicates that it is almost the last leg of duck spring backmigration...I maybe wrong..hopefully..The waterfowl waves should at least last till 25th-30th Mar this time due to cold waves in Pb/KPK. In the almost full moonlight, the flocks were good in numbers and responding well to decoys surprisingly, and now in the dwindling (waning) moon, reports are already stagnant and I am wondering whether the flocks would go for one final hike in the last spell maybe. But indicators are negative as of now (today)....Any differing views on that?\r\n\r\nSecondly, if you look at the duck (migration) shooting here in Punjab, there is a very very small shooting window (time) available, either during autumn migration (arrival) or spring backmigration (return), and even out of those few weekends, many weekends are lost due to cloudy/overcast and rainy spells. As compared to this, in many areas abroad, a very long mid season is available. This is is due to NO habitat (mainly food sources) available here during Winters, except the reserve areas which are mostly out of bound for ''almost'' all. This gives another complex dimension to duck shooting here, and thats one of the reasons why almost all areas on rivers/marshes etc are flooded with gunners and hides everywhere during that small shooting window.\r\n...One cannot blame hunters like a discussion got started here at some thread in recent past!

Having handled multiple weapons I started off with the Taurus 24/7 compact as it fit my hand perfectly and the online reviews seemed decent enough. After encountering fail to eject issues with this particular piece after about 500 rounds I decided to make a change. [/FONT]\n[FONT=Arial]The pakgun forum is always abuzz with Cz talk and that is what I went to next, Cz PCR to be exact. The online reviews seemed good and the size was just perfect. Seemed like a match made in heaven but the moment I took the gun to the range at my farm it just seemed off. My smallish hands just didn''t seem to get into a comfortable position on the thick grip leading to recoil issues. My search started again and after having fired a couple of other guns the Norinco NP34 (sig 228 clone) seemed to have the perfect grip. An exhaustive search through lahore, islamabad and peshawar ended up short and I never found one. The original sig 229 just seemed way out of my league with its extravagant price .[/FONT]\n[FONT=Arial]I loved the PCR&#8217;s compactness, decocker and all around sexiness, now only if I could make it fit my paws.

My confidence when drawing the weapon has also gone up.[/FONT]\n[FONT=Arial]I have finally made the realization that the fit of a gun in a particular hand is the most important factor when choosing a weapon.

(255053, 5588, 178312, 'masood357', 4098, '307 Winchester', 1331737040, 'The development of the rimmed 307 Winchester apparently began in 1980, with the first public announcement in December, 1982. However, the cartridge and the Model 94 XTR Angle Eject carbine chambered for it were not actually on the market and available until early 1983. The Marlin Model 336ER in 307 chambering was introduced at about same time, but is no longer offered. The Angle Eject feature is a design modification of the beefed-up Model 94 XTR that ejects spent cartridge cases to the side rather than straight up, which was the way they excited in all of the earlier Model 94 actions. This was accomplished bu changing the position of the extractor and ejector and lowering the right receiver side wall slightly.\r\nThe 307 caliber designation is simply to avoid confusing this cartridge with some of the other 30 calibers, and it actually uses standard .308-inch bullets. The 307 Winchester is essentially a rimmed 308 Winchester, although there is a difference in the overall cartridge length and case thickness. The original factory loadings had 150-and 180-grain bullets. \r\n\r\nThe popular Model 1894 Winchester lever action has always suffered from three major deficiencies: It was not strong enough to handle modern high-pressure cartridges; the design did not allow proper center mounting of a scope sight; and the tubular magazine required the use of flat-point bullets to prevent one cartridge from setting off others in the maganine under recoil. These combined to relegate the Model 1894 to largely short-range woods and brush use. The new XTR Angle Eject redesign eliminates at least two\r\nof the shortcomings and modernizes an old, but popular action. \r\nThe 307 Winchester will certainly enhance the range and power of both Winchester and Marlin lever-action rifles so chambered. It is, based on factory ballistic figures, more powerful than the 30-30 by some 375 fps increase in muzzle velocity . Although the 307 Winchester has the same general configuration as the rimless 308 Winchester, differing primarily in the addition of a rim, there are certain slight differences that prevent it from achieving the full power of the 308. For one thing, the bullet is seated slightly deeper to maintain an overall length compatible with the length of the Model 1894 action, and the case is made thicker than the 308, all of which reduces the powder capacity by about 6 percent. The result is that in nay given barrel length, with the same bullet weight, the 308 will deliver approximately 60 to 110 fps greater velocity at the muzzel. Also, with its pointed bullet, the 308 will loose velocity at a slower rate than the 307 flat-point and this will give it a greater edge as the range increases.\r\nIt may be possible to chamber and fire 308 cartridges in 307 rifles, but that is a distinctly unsafe practice that could result in damage to the rifle and possible injury to the shooter.\r\nThe 307 has only slightly less velocity at 200 yards than the 30-30 has at 100 yards. If the 30-30 is an adequate 125-yard plus deer cartridge, then the 307 is certainly a 225-yard deer cartridge with the additional possibility of taking larger game at moderate ranges. It is not likely to replace the 30-30 as America''s favourite deer cartridge for many years, if ever, but it is more versatile cartridge and certainly takes the Model 94 carbine out of the woods, bush and short-range class.', 1, 0, '203.81.223.100', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

(255056, 4456, 154641, 'masood357', 4098, '', 1331737717, 'In 1887 the Stevens Arms Co. developed the ultimate in .22 rimfire cartridges, the .22 Long Rifle. This used the .22 Long case with a 40 grain RN bullet loaded to higher velocity than the 29 grain Long bullet. It shot flatter and hit harder than any of the previous .22 rimfires except the .22 Extra Long, whose performance it essentially duplicated in a shorter case, and it was more accurate than that cartridge.\nThe .22 Long Rifle caught on, was adapted to both rifles and pistols, and became the most popular sporting and target shooting cartridge in the world. After the advent of smokeless powder a High Velocity version of the .22 LR was introduced, which further extended the .22 LR''s superiority as a small game hunting cartridge.\nModern .22 LR target ammunition is loaded to a MV of about 1085 fps with a 40 grain RN bullet. .22 Long Rifle High Velocity cartridges drive a 40 grain copper-plated bullet at a MV of 1255 fps and ME of 140 ft. lbs. from a rifle barrel. For small game hunters, most manufacturers offer a 36-37 grain copper-plated lead hollow point bullet at about 1280 fps (Remington figures). This load expands nicely and makes for quick kills on small game, given proper bullet placement.\nBecause of its popularity there are many permutations of the .22 LR cartridge. One of the more useless is the .22 LR shot cartridge, which fires a pinch of very fine #12 shot. This load is used, among other things, to collect very small creatures, mice and the like, for museum displays. This is not a hunting load, as it is ineffective for use even on very small birds beyond about 10 feet.\nFar more useful are the Hyper Velocity .22 LR loads pioneered by CCI in the form of the Stinger. These use lightweight hollow point bullets at increased velocity for flatter trajectory and dramatic expansion. Remington followed suit with their famous Yellow Jacket load, and the idea was subsequently picked-up by most other manufacturers. The CCI Stinger drives a 32 grain GLHP bullet at a MV of 1640 fps with 191 ft. lbs. of ME.\nIn 1890 the .22 Winchester Rim Fire (WRF) was introduced. This cartridge is loaded with a 45 grain, flat point, inside lubricated bullet with a full diameter heel, rather than the tapered heel bullet of the .22 LR. The .22 WRF fires a .224" diameter bullet, just like modern centerfire .22s and the later .22 Magnum (WMR). At one time a 40 grain HP bullet was also available, but it has since fallen by the wayside.\nRemington called this cartridge the .22 Remington Special, and loaded it with a 45 grain RN bullet. The .22 Rem. Spec. and .22 WRF are the same cartridge and are interchangeable.\nThe .22 WRF is a good small game cartridge, superior to the .22 LR. CCI loads the ammunition, and Winchester does an occasional run of .22 WRF. Modern CCI ammo is loaded to a MV of 1300 fps and ME of 169 ft. lbs.\nToday the .22 WRF is kept alive primarily as a less destructive small game load for rifles chambered for the .22 WMR cartridge. The .22 Magnum is a lengthened version of the .22 WRF and will chamber in firearms designed for the .22 WMR, much as .38 Special ammunition may be fired from .357 Magnum guns, although it will not function correctly in autoloaders.\nIn the early 20th Century a pair of cartridges about the same size and offering about the same ballistics as the .22 LR were introduced. These were designed for use in autoloading rifles, used smokeless powder and inside lubricated bullets, and in that respect are a more modern design than the .22 LR. However, as soon as the established .22 LR was universally converted to smokeless powder, the .22 Auto cartridges became superfluous.\nThe .22 Winchester Automatic cartridge was designed for their Model 1903 autoloading rifle (discontinued in 1932). Ammo was produced into the 1970''s. Remington''s .22 Automatic appeared in their Model 16 autoloader. That rifle was discontinued in 1928, and the ammunition was not loaded after the Second World War. Although similar, these two cartridges differ dimensionally and are not interchangeable.\nJump to 1959, the year Winchester introduced their very successful .22 Winchester Magnum Rimfire (WMR). This cartridge pushes the limits of pressure possible with a rimfire case given the limits of contemporary metallurgy. The .22 Magnum was initially offered with 40 grain FMJ and JHP bullets at an advertised MV of 2000 fps from a rifle barrel and 1550 fps from a pistol barrel. Due to its high velocity, .22 WMR cartridges are loaded with jacketed bullets.\nThe .22 WMR is based on a lengthened version of the .22 WRF case, like that cartridge uses standard diameter .224" inside lubricated bullets, and remains to this day the most powerful .22 rimfire cartridge ever. It has been adapted to many types and brands of firearms, and .22 WMR ammunition is loaded by all of the major rimfire ammunition manufacturers and is very widely distributed.\nAs good as the .22 WMR is as a rifle cartridge, I feel that it is even better as a revolver cartridge. It offers velocity and trajectory similar to the centerfire magnum pistol cartridges at a fraction of the recoil and cost. Convertible revolvers, supplied with both .22 LR and .22 WMR cylinders, are the ultimate in versatility for plinking, small game hunting, and varmint shooting.\nToday the .22 WMR is available with bullet weights ranging from about 30 to 50 grains, and CCI loads a shot shell version. The standard Winchester 40 grain JHP bullet is now loaded to a rifle MV of 1910 fps with ME of 324 ft. lbs. The various 30-40 grain JHP bullets are best for varmint hunting, but are overly destructive on small game intended for the dinner table. A better choice in that case are the heavier 45-50 grain bullets intended for small game hunting, or the use of .22 WRF ammo when possible.\nThe .22 WMR is the newest, commercially successful, .22 rimfire cartridge (so far). With .22 rimfire cartridges now available from the BB Cap to the WMR, the field seems pretty well covered. Recent rimfire development has concentrated on lighter, smaller caliber bullets that can achieve higher velocity within the existing pressure limits. The .17 HMR, based on a necked-down .22 Magnum case, is the best example.\nRimfire cartridge design is limited by the fact that the brass case rim must be weak enough to be crushed by the blow of the firing pin. This severely limits the permissible maximum pressure and thus the performance of the cartridge. I suspect that the advent of more potent .22 rimfire cartridges will depend on the future development of more advanced case materials.\n\n\n\n25 ( 6.35mm ) Automatic Pistol\n\nIntroduced in the United States in 1908 with the Browning-designed, Colt-manufactured, 25 Vest Pocket Automatic Pistol. It was introduced in Europe a few years earlier in the F.N. Baby Browning, which is practically identical to the Colt. The design of these two pistols has been copied by manufacturers all over the world and literally dozens of different pistols have used this cartridge. The original Browning is still made ( for European consumption ), but Colt did not resume manufature of their model after WWII. Beretta, Galesi, Astra, Star and others also make 25 automatic pistols. The 25 Automatic has fairly high elocity for such a amall cartridge. However, the energy it delivers at any range is quite low, and this, combinedwith the full-metal jacketed bullet, adds up to very poor stopping or killing poweron anything. The 22 Short rimfire with the hollowpoint bullet is a better killer and will infact a more serious wound than the 25 Auto. In fact, small semi-auto pistols chambered for the 22 Short rimfire cut sales of the 25 Auto for a time. The 22 Short is much cheaper, too. The 25 auto is not powerful enough for hunting anything but sparrows or rats, nor is it adequate for serious self defence. However, the 25 semi-auto pistols are popular because of their small size. Their principal usefullness is as a threat, because no one wants to get shot if it can be avoided, even with the little 25. The 25 Auto has one adantage over the 22 Short in that being a rimless case, it feeds and functions more reliably in automatic pistols.', 1, 0, '203.81.223.100', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

Interesting thing was almost all species were there especially in the evening 2 hr session - Mallard, Garganeys, Gadwalls, Pintails, Teals, Wigeons, Shovelers & Pochards (few).  The abundance of shoveler flocks roaming around and arrival of very vocal Garganey flocks indicates that it is almost the last leg of duck spring backmigration...I maybe wrong..hopefully..The waterfowl waves should at least last till 25th-30th Mar this time due to cold waves in Pb/KPK. In the almost full moonlight, the flocks were good in numbers and responding well to decoys surprisingly, and now in the dwindling (waning) moon, reports are already stagnant and I am wondering whether the flocks would go for one final hike in the last spell maybe. But indicators are negative as of now (today)....Any differing views on that?\n\nSecondly, if you look at the duck (migration) shooting here in Punjab, there is a very very small shooting window (time) available, either during autumn migration (arrival) or spring backmigration (return), and even out of those few weekends, many weekends are lost due to cloudy/overcast and rainy spells. As compared to this, in many areas abroad, a very long mid season is available. This is is due to NO habitat (mainly food sources) available here during Winters, except the reserve areas which are mostly out of bound for ''almost'' all. This gives another complex dimension to duck shooting here, and thats one of the reasons why almost all areas on rivers/marshes etc are flooded with gunners and hides everywhere during that small shooting window.\n...One cannot blame hunters like a discussion got started here at some thread in recent past! The habitat and situations are dicey and unstable and many times it takes a lot of luck too to get a decent outing out of the hunt trips.[/QUOTE]\n\n\n Wow nice hunt bro. Very nice bag too.

And, thats exactly what I was refering to: That after last Sunday 12th March, due to cold wave (maybe), huge duck waves have suddenly come to stop & scarce pockets are now there, even in Chashma upstream as well as downstream.

The reserve areas or sanctuaries are an exception though.\r\nThe Sind hunting parties are having a v gd time these days which shows ducks are still in South of Pakistan in quite a handsome qty still, and hv yet to migrate North. It is our guess too...that ducks will certainly show a second boom...but I saw several flocks of Garganies (you can see Garganies in my recent pic) decoy point blank in our spreads and the Shoveler flocks were really abundant, which probably shows the LAST LEG of migration...isnt it...becoz these 2 bird r the last to migrate?? One fact is: Pintails have not been seen in bulk yet like last year and the pics from Sind are still showing Pintails being hunted. So maybe a second boom is expected...the current situation is not encouraging though. Qs is: Keeping all that in perspective, when will the SECOND DUCK BOOM be witnessed here (approx)...

Which cartrg and choke are you using. The gun is Urika2 (Opt) I guess. I would suggest IC choke + 6# Shaheen regular cartrg. The spread will be to your advantage and #6 lead shell has enough penetrating power for a duck. So...keeping this cartrg/choke pellet spread in mind, crossers shd not be a problem if you shoot just a 1''-1.5'' ahead of bird with a fluid gun swing keeping the swing maintained after firing. The common problem we all make in such shots is: that we stop the swing and start looking for second bird to take down in a hurry. Actually ducks when decoying give ample time for 3-4 shots and all shd be fired with lot of patience..''sakoon se barrel mila ke'' as they say. I had several multiple 3-4 bird hits (dead drops) in my last 2 shoots which I enjoyed thoroughly. Hurried shots are what cause ducks to go by scot free. Thats my humble observation and suggesion.

If you achieve perfect sight alignment and sight picture and then slap the hell out of the trigger you will ruin all the work you have made in sighting the gun.\n\nWe are visual creatures who receive most of our input about the world through our eyes.  As a result we tend to make sighting far more important that it is.  Not that sighting isn''t important, just less important than it is.\n\nYes, if we ignore sighting it will hurt us.  But we can sight quickly and accurately, very easily.  Once we have done this, we need to maintain that sighting through the trigger press.\n\nI teach students that 90% of accuracy is in proper trigger manipulation.  9% in sighting.  The remaining 1% is grip and stance.  \n\nWith this emphasis on trigger manipulation and down-playing the imporance of sighting I can produce students who can outshoot 70% to even 90% of the shooters on a public firing line on any given day.  \n\nTry it sometime.  Note how quickly you can accurately sight the gun and then concentrate on the best trigger manipulation you can, slow, with no antipation or expectation the gun will fire at any particular moment.\n\nMost people induce more error when they press the trigger than the wobble or shake they were seeing.\n\nYou did a great job explaining sighting, and I commend you on it.  The real secret to both fast and accurate shooting resides in proper trigger press.[/QUOTE]\n+1 steven bro \nand a tip from my side is\nbe gentle and smooth with trigger and remember..\nSlow is smooth and smooth is fast...', 1, 1, '118.107.139.40', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

The spread will be to your advantage and #6 lead shell has enough penetrating power for a duck. So...keeping this cartrg/choke pellet spread in mind, crossers shd not be a problem if you shoot just a 1''-1.5'' ahead of bird with a fluid gun swing keeping the swing maintained after firing. The common problem we all make in such shots is: that we stop the swing and start looking for second bird to take down in a hurry. Actually ducks when decoying give ample time for 3-4 shots and all shd be fired with lot of patience..''sakoon se barrel mila ke'' as they say. I had several multiple 3-4 bird hits (dead drops) in my last 2 shoots which I enjoyed thoroughly. Hurried shots are what cause ducks to go by scot free. Thats my humble observation and suggesion.

Afew days ago my cousin tested it and told me over the phone that it was a complete let down. Disappointingly it kept miss-firing etc. He rang the dealers who we purchased it from. As we are on friendly terms with him he said bring it down to our factory and we will get it sorted out. This morning they took it to their factory in peshawar n they changed the spring and afew other parts and got it sorted out. was told its firing OK now. But here comes the interesting bit. He told me their new production batch that they now make is being sold around in the market as the original ones because they are producing exact identical clones. Not not only that they are even putting computerised numbers on them. Then they sell them to different dealers for anything between 20-25K a piece and the dealers are then selling them in the markets for anything between 30 to 40K.

Massad Ayoob reviewed one by Springfield Armoury and said that it performed just like the "puritanical" version of the  1911, except it had a nominal recoil ("bump like a .22", to quote the man) and was, therefore, an excellent gun to run at the range.\n\nNow, I know that a lot of people believe that a 1911 is [B]only[/B] a 1911 if it''s true to John Browning''s vision & design (i.e. chambered in .45ACP).

Which cartrg and choke are you using. The gun is Urika2 (Opt) I guess. I would suggest IC choke + 6# Shaheen regular cartrg. The spread will be to your advantage and #6 lead shell has enough penetrating power for a duck. So...keeping this cartrg/choke pellet spread in mind, crossers shd not be a problem if you shoot just a 1''-1.5'' ahead of bird with a fluid gun swing keeping the swing maintained after firing. The common problem we all make in such shots is: that we stop the swing and start looking for second bird to take down in a hurry. Actually ducks when decoying give ample time for 3-4 shots and all shd be fired with lot of patience..''sakoon se barrel mila ke'' as they say. I had several multiple 3-4 bird hits (dead drops) in my last 2 shoots which I enjoyed thoroughly. Hurried shots are what cause ducks to go by scot free. Thats my humble observation and suggesion.

Interesting thing was almost all species were there especially in the evening 2 hr session - Mallard, Garganeys, Gadwalls, Pintails, Teals, Wigeons, Shovelers & Pochards (few).  The abundance of shoveler flocks roaming around and arrival of very vocal Garganey flocks indicates that it is almost the last leg of duck spring backmigration...I maybe wrong..hopefully..The waterfowl waves should at least last till 25th-30th Mar this time due to cold waves in Pb/KPK. In the almost full moonlight, the flocks were good in numbers and responding well to decoys surprisingly, and now in the dwindling (waning) moon, reports are already stagnant and I am wondering whether the flocks would go for one final hike in the last spell maybe. But indicators are negative as of now (today)....Any differing views on that?\n\nSecondly, if you look at the duck (migration) shooting here in Punjab, there is a very very small shooting window (time) available, either during autumn migration (arrival) or spring backmigration (return), and even out of those few weekends, many weekends are lost due to cloudy/overcast and rainy spells. As compared to this, in many areas abroad, a very long mid season is available. This is is due to NO habitat (mainly food sources) available here during Winters, except the reserve areas which are mostly out of bound for ''almost'' all. This gives another complex dimension to duck shooting here, and thats one of the reasons why almost all areas on rivers/marshes etc are flooded with gunners and hides everywhere during that small shooting window.\n...One cannot blame hunters like a discussion got started here at some thread in recent past! The habitat and situations are dicey and unstable and many times it takes a lot of luck too to get a decent outing out of the hunt trips.[/QUOTE]\n\nNice Hunting And Nice Bag Sir...............', 1, 0, '116.71.169.74', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

Fortunately, the slide had stopped at the exact spot where it needs to be in order for the gun to be disassembled. So I took the gun apart (after wrestling with the slide for almost 20 minutes before it finally budged) and then had to use a rifle''s cleaning rod to force the stuck round out of the chamber!

Nor is it sighting or stance or grip in the traditional sense that grip is how you hold the gun.\r\n\r\nYou are doing something else.  Something you should should not be doing.  The holes are low because the barrel is pointed there, where the hole is. \r\n\r\nYou pointed the gun there.\r\n\r\nStop pointing the gun there. \r\n\r\nTo stop pointing the gun low you will need to know why you are pointing the gun low.  It might be called "pre-ignition push"  or "flinch" or "anticipatory action;" but no matter the name, just before the shot is fired, you point the gun down.  I don''t know if you are afraid of the recoil/blast or are trying to hold the gun flat, but stop it.\r\n\r\nMaybe these words will help.  Your job is not to make the gun go band.  You don''t direct the shot to happen at any particular moment in time.  Instead, your job is to press the trigger slowly.  Press the trigger with no anticipation or expectation that the shot will happen.  When the shot does happen it should come as a bit of a surprise.  \r\n\r\nAlso, try to pay attention to how the good shots feel.  They feel different than bad shots.  You can feel yourself push the gun down if you are open to it.  You can feel when you don''t push down also.  Try to let/make the shots feel the way they do when you don''t push down.\r\n\r\nAlso, dry fire.  Dry firing trains you to press the trigger with no other actions.  You are doing some other action.  Train yourself to do nothing more than stand there, gripping the gun, sighting and pressing the trigger.\r\n\r\nHope that helps.', 1, 1, '69.154.245.127', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

However, it is easy to stand comfortable and balanced.  You''ve been doing it for decades, you do it every day.  Don''t make it a big deal.  Just get comfortable and balanced and forget about it.  If your stance is wrong in an extreme (like uncontrolled falling over or causing great pain) then you will never shoot well.  But again, it is easy to stand comfortably.  I can shoot good fast shots standing on one leg, even on one leg while slowly falling over (unbalanced) or in an uncomfortable position if I line up my sights and press my trigger well.\r\n\r\nGrip is simply holding onto the gun.  There is no good science which proves that any one grip is better than another and people have shot and continue to shot well using different grips.  So grip isn''t all that important if you have positive control over and the comforting sense of contol over the gun.  Like stance, you can have an extremely unconventional grip which might cause problems. but most people can find a good enough grip easily that will have little negative impact on their shooting.  So, just stand there and grip the gun.\r\n\r\nSighting is important.  If we allign the sights 5" to the left of the bullseye, that is most likely where the bullet will land.  We quickly and easily (intuitively) allign the sights.  We know very bad sighting and when it looks pretty good.  Most people will unfortunately fuss their sights to the point of frustration and then just slap the trigger to make the shot happen when for a moment the sight picture looks correct.  But, they moved the sights far more with that horrid manipulation of the trigger than their wobbly or shake in their sighting ever did.\r\n\r\nThis leaves us trigger manipulation.  Unlike, seeing and standing and holding the gun which comes rather naturally and can be learned or understood easily; pressing the trigger is not easily intuited.  It has to be practiced the most to be executed well. \r\n\r\nThat is why I opine that trigger manipulation is most important to accuract shooting.  \r\n\r\nThe next time you shoot, reflect on this.  Note how natural it is to stand, and how easy it is to look at the sights and allign them.

(256389, 8519, 0, 'forcetrip', 5903, 'Florida Law. &quot;Stand your ground&quot;', 1332301032, '[B](CNN)[/B] -- Trayvon Martin went out to buy some  Skittles -- and was shot dead before he made it home. The case is  horrifying, maddening, grotesque. And -- perhaps worst of all -- there  may be nothing Florida law enforcement can do about it.\n As the world now knows,  the 17-year-old Martin walked to a store in Orlando to buy some snacks  on the night of February 26. George Zimmerman, a volunteer Neighborhood  Watch captain, thought the boy looked suspicious and called 911. The 911  operator told Zimmerman to keep his distance -- police would be sent --  but there was a confrontation between Zimmerman and Martin. Martin was  killed with a single shot to the chest. Florida authorities have not  arrested Zimmerman, and federal authorities recently joined the  investigation.\n\n\n [B]The legal question at the  heart of the case involves Florida''s so-called "stand your ground" law,  which the legislature passed, at the behest of the National Rifle  Association, in 2005. Before that time, Florida law resembled that of  most other states; during confrontations, individuals had a duty to  retreat rather than to respond to provocations. Under the new law, a  person is allowed to use deadly force if he is in a place he has a right  to be and feels reasonably threatened with serious harm.[/B]\n\n\n In this case, then, the  question is whether Zimmerman was in such a place and felt reasonably  threatened. The 911 operator told Zimmerman to keep his distance from  Martin, but Zimmerman had a right to be on the street. That''s where  neighborhood watch volunteers work.\n  \nClearly, the question at  the heart of the case is whether Zimmerman reasonably felt threatened.  On this issue, the evidence currently seems murky. There appears to have  been some sort of confrontation between Zimmerman and Martin. Police  found Zimmerman with an injury to his head. Most important -- and most  tragic -- the police will hear only one side of the story about this  confrontation. Trayvon is not around to tell his story. The continuing  investigation will surely focus on finding other witnesses.\n\n\n The facts of this case  show why the "stand your ground" law is so important. The law focuses on  the subjective understanding of the shooter. Was his understanding of  the situation "reasonable"? Ultimately, that would be a question for the  jury to decide, but it still gives a lot of deference to the  perpetrator of a violent act.\n\n [B]The new law even allows a disproportionate  response; if someone comes at you with a fist, you can reply with a  gun.\n[/B]\n[B]In light of the shift in  the law, it''s not surprising that since the law went into effect,  reports of justifiable homicides have tripled, according to the Florida  Department of Law Enforcement.\n\n[/B]\n\n Another case under  litigation in Florida highlights the effect of the law. In September  2010, David James was playing basketball with his 8-year-old daughter on  an outdoor court in Valrico. A boy was skateboarding on the court at  the same time, and Trevor Dooley, a man who lived in the area, told the  boy he shouldn''t be skateboarding there. James stood up for the boy, and  he and Dooley had a confrontation.\n Dooley was carrying a gun  and wound up shooting James dead. Dooley asserted that he felt  threatened by James, and has asked that the case be dismissed before  trial under the "stand your ground" law. (The judge will soon make a  ruling.)\n In both of these cases  -- in the deaths of both James and Martin -- the legal defense for the  shooters appears to rely almost completely on the "stand your ground"  law. In the death of David James, prosecutors are doing their best  against tough odds. In the death of Trayvon Martin, it''s prosecutors who  are taking the heat for failing, thus far, to bring any charges against  George Zimmerman.\n But this outrage,  understandable though it is, might be directed somewhere else as well.  The Florida legislators who voted for the "stand your ground" law -- and  Gov. Jeb Bush, who signed it -- have something to answer for as well.\n\n[url]http://edition.cnn.com/2012/03/20/opinion/toobin-trayvon-martin/index.html?eref=igoogledmn_topstories[/url]\n\n\nI am guessing this law will be under review in the coming years.

Mag capacity is higher of the 9mm (8 .45ACP rounds vs 9 9mm rounds). And yes, 9mm ammo is comparatively much cheaper then .45ACP, so it''s kinda ideal for bulk practice, giving you more range time at a cheaper price.

The SC model has a reduced length, height and width and is technically somewhat different compared to the other Caracal pistols. The manufacturer markets the SC model as a primary weapon for government professionals who must conceal a handgun for job related situations, or as a secondary back up pistol.[1] According to Caracal''s managing director Hamad Khalifa Al Neyadiof, the new SC sub-compact model has fewer cross pins giving a smooth surface, allowing for a more efficient assembly and a better quality build. The SC model can also use the larger detachable box magazines of the C and F models, giving a magazine capacity of up to 18 rounds of 9*mm ammunition.[18] According to Jane''s the SC model has a separate safety switch located beneath the trigger guard, rather than on the trigger itself. A special grip adapter that has been developed for the Caracal SC has to be used for using the larger magazines from other 9*mm Caracal weapons. The SC model also has a solid synthetic striker, resulting in reduced manufacturing costs and a very smooth action. The synthetic unit will be introduced to the F and C series later in 2009.[19] The SC magazines are offered with a standard flat bottom or a slightly developed magazine with a finger rest for extra grip.[1] The Caracal SC will be available to commercial users by fall 2012.', 1, 0, '119.160.59.58', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

The principle is that if one is in a location that they have a legal right to be in, and has a valid legal reason to engage in justifiable homicide, then the shooting is legal.  For example, if I am in a park, and I am set upon by an armed thug, I do not have to retreat, even if I am able, and I am legally justified in shooting my attacker.  \n\nThe legal principle is two fold.  One must have a legal right to be where they are, and one must have the legal right to use lethal force.  As a general rule, one may use lethal force to protect one''s life, or that of another, or to prevent grave bodily harm, or to prevent a felony.  In this case, I do not believe any of the conditions were met, and a young man has lost his life, and a noble law is now being abused.  \n\nSadly in the United States, this has become a case of racial anger, and also of misdirected rage towards gun laws, and gun ownership.[/QUOTE]\n\nThis is definitely going to get worse. Especially for the minorities. More states are going to be introducing gun ownership laws in the next 5-10 years. The intolerance is growing to a point of discomfort. I am sure you guys watch TV and see how 50% of Americans really feel about the minorities.

I stalk all the way just beneath it and the vertical distance remains only (about 15 yards). Try to find a comfortable position and after a 5 minute struggle settle down with the gun resting on a branch of a small tree with the dove still as it is since the beginning.\nI aim for it''s upper chest zoomed in at 4X, having a clear view of it and there''s a branch just in the middle of the dove (through the scope). Shoot, it goes down... tries to recover a little and falls down 5-8 meters ahead.\nI keep my gun aside and run into the woods to retrieve it, and am sad not to find the dove...\nWell suddenly I hear the dove trying to recover and running away: can''t fly. Behind it was coming a cat colored brownish (seemed like a lion, the way it was chasing the dove). It came quite authoritatively as if it was his/her kill and got hold of the dove quite easily. Now the dove''s head is in the cat''s mouth and it''s wound is visible front-wards. The cat''s coming where I am and I ask her to give the dove to me ;) \nIt doesn''t listen to me... so I pick a pebble just to scare her to see whether she gives the dove (still flapping it''s feathers for some seconds until it eventually finishes).

Based on the discussion above, reviews and the best grip which fits my hand etc, finally, I got myself a Stoeger Cougar 8000F for Rs. 58K from Shamsuddin, Rawalpindi. Bought a saddler’s holster too for Rs. 1,400. This gun does not need any introduction or review (unlike my Akdal MKA 1919), however my little experience with this gun is being shared here.\n \n[b]Beretta or no Beretta[/b]\n \nI have gone thru the debate over its Beretta or no Beretta in this forum. Some say that its essentially the Beretta Cougar with [b]only[/b] the new name i.e. Stoeger Cougar and as Stoeger Industries is subsidiary of Beretta so it shud enjoy somewhat same status as that of Beretta. And some say that if this is the case then why hasn’t it been given the name “Beretta Cougar”?\n \nWell, I am quite indifferent bcuz when it does the job well then no matter if its beretta or no beretta but if it doesn’t do the job then its being beretta is useless to me. Even if it had not got the “tag” of Beretta with it, I would have preferred it over PT92 and Baikal for my purchase.\n \n[b]Cherry popping ceremony[/b]\n \nI have “de-flowered” it firing 80 rounds, Chinese. No problem of any kind so far except one spent brass was tossed back on my face. Strange that 1 out of 80 extracted back-asswards, must have been any lapse from my side but I do recall that somebody also complained about backward extraction (in shirt’s pocket) in this forum.  \n \n[b]The science of rotating barrel[/b]\n \nI have been reading much about rotating barrel of Stoeger Cougar which helps reducing recoil. Well, I didn’t find this ‘science’ that good. The jerk while firing is quite much (than expected by me) and I wonder if other compact 9mms have any gr8r recoil. Bcuz if other compact ones have more recoil than stoeger then it must have been compromising on accuracy. I have not tried anyother compact, but do guess that recoil would be same and there would not be any [b]significant[/b] difference in recoil due to rotating barrel. And I feel that if the recoil is “almost” the same then this rotating barrel science does only seem to be a marketing tool.\n \n[b]Loading magz[/b]\n \nFirst time loading was a hell pain in the neck. I was wondering what I have purchased which can’t be easily loaded. After first time, I kept the magz loaded for some weeks and now its quite smooth than the first time. Hopefully it gets better day by day.\n \n[b]Performance (mine, not the gun’s)[/b]\n \nMy performance with the gun was not that bad at 10 meters but kinda hopeless at 20 meters. See the results:\n \nFired 15 shots from 10 meters and 14 were on the chart, at least, one was never found :p Some shots were really encouraging and motivating for the other trip …\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]9432[/ATTACH]\n \nFired around 30 shots from 20 meters and it was all messed-up. I only managed to find 3 shots in the black area and all others were flyers.

Best Barbeque. Best quality food and taste.\n\n[B]Lahore:[/B] "[B][COLOR=#ff0000] Village[/COLOR][/B]" - Best Buffet. And [COLOR=#ff0000][B]Bundhu Khan[/B][/COLOR], Mall Road.\n\n[B]Wah Cantt[/B]: [COLOR=#ff0000][B]Green Lagoon[/B][/COLOR] - G.T Road. Best Taste in everything.\n\n[B]Peshawar[COLOR=#ff0000]: Baba Wali [/COLOR][/B](The genuine one). And course, Namak Mandi. Here I prefer the one just before Nisar Charsi, the venue at the corner.\n\n[B]Rawalpindi:[/B] (Never found the right spot)\n\n[B]Abottabad:[/B] (Never found the right spot)\n\n[B]Muree:[/B] [COLOR=#ff0000][B]"Lintott''s[/B][/COLOR]"\n\n[B]Nathiagali/Sikandarabad[/B]: "[B][COLOR=#ff0000]Elites[/COLOR][/B]" and "[COLOR=#ff0000][B]Fogland[/B][/COLOR]".

KFC, well, just occasionally.\n\nSorry to hijack the topic a bit, but this is what I feel would serve anything useful, the mentioning of food-stuff and the venues where served as well.

Clays guns are heavier by design. A target gun is heavier to  help reduce the felt recoil of shooting a couple of hundred rounds or  more in a day. Field guns are lighter so they can be carried all day  long and not wear you down. Odds are you will not be shooting a couple  of hunderd rounds hunting in a day. \nThe thing to do is find a good gun that fits your needs and budget. I  have hunted with my Browning GTI before but it does get heavy at the  end of the day. The benifit is that I have shot it thousands of times  low gun during clays, so shooting live birds hunting makes it seem  almost second nature. I found myself having to wait so I did not shoot  the bird too close.  \n\nFind a quality gun that offers the features you need and try it for a  season. You may find you want a second gun for hunting or a clays only  gun. And everyone here knows you can never own too many shotguns!

Baikal IZH-27 "hunting":\r\n\r\nTried and tested. built tough and ready to withstand field abuse. long standing history of reliability and durability. very good choice for a budget field shotgun. good balance and handling.\r\n\r\n2. Baikal IZH-27 "Sporting":\r\n\r\nmechanically similar to IZH-27 "hunting" therefore all good traits of the hunting model are also present in this shotgun. as a bonus, with sporting shotgun one gets some other enhancements which are very useful in sports shooting. now these benefits have an associated cost which must be paid the user/ower in terms of weight. ofcourse, "sporting" model is heavier compared to "hunting" model and does not come with sling attachments that aid during long walks in hunting. however one must understand that this disadvantage pays for itself in the terms of the comfort and advantage that one gets in sports shooting.\r\n\r\nif you are not interested in sports shooting then I really do not see a reason why you should go for a sporting model shotgun. simple!\r\n\r\n3. Hatsan Optime O/U shotgun:\r\n\r\nwell....looks like a quality shotgun. however one cannot say anything conclusive about this shotgun as there is not much of a history behind it.\r\n\r\n4. interesting point to wonder and kill a few million brain cells over:\r\n\r\nBaikal IZH-27 is being manufactured and marketed since 1973. it is essentially built on a design that dates back to 1931 in the form of Browning Superposed which was designed to be a first mass produced over and under shotgun. if you compare the two shotgun you will find that Baikal is basically a modified (or improved) form of the Superposed shotgun. certain parts were modified to make them easier to produce or simpler in function and we all know that "the simplest solution is often the best the solution".\r\n\r\nhas anyone noticed why Browning resorted to mechanical trigger system in their latest Superposed based offering Browning 725? did I mention that Baikal also has mechanical trigger. I am really not implying anything, just asking a simple question. :)\r\n\r\nnow, coming to Hatsan. its built on Beretta action. very good and highly refined action which is  not only difficult to manufacture but also depends on many parts that are hand fitted and require a greater degree of fine tuning such as inertia trigger system. this is where the dichotomy lies. some say a budget O/U shotgun manufacturer can do a similar level of fine tuning and attention to detail as a high end shotgun manufacturer whereas other say that a budget shotgun O/U manufacturer can never invest the huge amount of resources involved in fine tuning a shotgun to such degree. they also say that a budget O/U manufacturer cannot afford to put that much attention to detail otherwise the huge cost jump would simply push their product out of the "budget" bracket and into the high end O/U shotgun bracket where nothing is ignored. in this bracket, they have to compete with the big dogs. where manufacturing flaws are not forgiven as honest mistakes but penalized for not doing the right job.\r\n\r\nthink about it? which school of thought do you belong to?\r\n\r\nRegards.\r\n\r\nnow thats history. whereas Hatsan which', 1, 1, '182.177.37.162', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

Baikal IZH-27 "hunting":\n\nTried and tested. built tough and ready to withstand field abuse. long standing history of reliability and durability. very good choice for a budget field shotgun. good balance and handling.\n\n2. Baikal IZH-27 "Sporting":\n\nmechanically similar to IZH-27 "hunting" therefore all good traits of the hunting model are also present in this shotgun. as a bonus, with sporting shotgun one gets some other enhancements which are very useful in sports shooting. now these benefits have an associated cost which must be paid the user/ower in terms of weight. ofcourse, "sporting" model is heavier compared to "hunting" model and does not come with sling attachments that aid during long walks in hunting. however one must understand that this disadvantage pays for itself in the terms of the comfort and advantage that one gets in sports shooting.\n\nif you are not interested in sports shooting then I really do not see a reason why you should go for a sporting model shotgun. simple!\n\n3. Hatsan Optime O/U shotgun:\n\nwell....looks like a quality shotgun. however one cannot say anything conclusive about this shotgun as there is not much of a history behind it.\n\n4. interesting point to wonder and kill a few million brain cells over:\n\nBaikal IZH-27 is being manufactured and marketed since 1973. it is essentially built on a design that dates back to 1931 in the form of Browning Superposed which was designed to be a first mass produced over and under shotgun. if you compare the two shotgun you will find that Baikal is basically a modified (or improved) form of the Superposed shotgun. certain parts were modified to make them easier to produce or simpler in function and we all know that "the simplest solution is often the best the solution".\n\nhas anyone noticed why Browning resorted to mechanical trigger system in their latest Superposed based offering Browning 725? did I mention that Baikal also has mechanical trigger. I am really not implying anything, just asking a simple question. :)\n\nnow, coming to Hatsan. its built on Beretta action. very good and highly refined action which is  not only difficult to manufacture but also depends on many parts that are hand fitted and require a greater degree of fine tuning such as inertia trigger system. this is where the dichotomy lies. some say a budget O/U shotgun manufacturer can do a similar level of fine tuning and attention to detail as a high end shotgun manufacturer whereas other say that a budget shotgun O/U manufacturer can never invest the huge amount of resources involved in fine tuning a shotgun to such degree. they also say that a budget O/U manufacturer cannot afford to put that much attention to detail otherwise the huge cost jump would simply push their product out of the "budget" bracket and into the high end O/U shotgun bracket where nothing is ignored. in this bracket, they have to compete with the big dogs. where manufacturing flaws are not forgiven as honest mistakes but penalized for not doing the right job.\n\nthink about it? which school of thought do you belong to?\n\nRegards.\n\nnow thats history. whereas Hatsan which[/QUOTE]\n\nVery impressive detailed comparison sir.

Clays guns are heavier by design. A target gun is heavier to  help reduce the felt recoil of shooting a couple of hundred rounds or  more in a day. Field guns are lighter so they can be carried all day  long and not wear you down. Odds are you will not be shooting a couple  of hunderd rounds hunting in a day. \r\nThe thing to do is find a good gun that fits your needs and budget. I  have hunted with my Browning GTI before but it does get heavy at the  end of the day. The benifit is that I have shot it thousands of times  low gun during clays, so shooting live birds hunting makes it seem  almost second nature. I found myself having to wait so I did not shoot  the bird too close.  \r\n\r\nFind a quality gun that offers the features you need and try it for a  season. You may find you want a second gun for hunting or a clays only  gun. And everyone here knows you can never own too many shotguns!

If the gun is badly balanced and not according to an individual&#8217;s personal preferences/physique, lesser weight will rather create more problems in field. I am pretty fond of upland hunting myself and my first passion is partridge (always) though I have done some decent duck and geese shooting too&#8230;&#8230;Qs is: Will a 7.6-7.75 lbs gun (hunting model above) Versus 7.9 lbs gun (sporting model above) make hell of a difference in field (upland in specific) ? Is this difference tooo much to matter? As per feedback from hunters, the Sporting model of Baikal O/U is heard to be real good at partridges &#8230; and I am forwarding that feedbk from some die-hard partridge hunters from Pindi and Attock region whom I know. I held both the guns myself, and Sporting model was my 1st choice. The extra features were a plus too.\r\n\r\nSo&#8230;..it is not that complex a Qs. Solution is simply holding BOTH guns in market, and handling them yourself to find  which is more comfortable to swing, well balanced AND comes right-on! \r\n\r\nI again repeat: 7.6 - 7.75 lbs Versus 7.9 lbs is no big issue to matter in upland. Handling and gunfit etc are more important aspects that will knock more birds down. I would also suggest to buy any two (IC,LM,M) after market (preferably extended type) chokes to make better even patterns with Baikal & a good quality front bead (pref ivory color 0.125&#8221;-0.156&#8221; dia). These things matter a lot too. \r\n\r\nI have used following  guns extensively: the real heavy Remington 1100, the ideal weight Beretta A303 field, slightly heavy Beretta A303 Sporting and the ideal weight Beretta AL91 Teknys Stncoat mobil&#8230;..(by ideal weight I mean 7 lbs i.e. my preferred ideal weight for shotguns), and I can vouch for the fact that weight does not matter as much as the gun&#8217;s HANDLING & more importantly GUN-FIT. If these are spot-on according to your physique and preferences, you can literally &#8216;smoke&#8217; birds in field with some decent practice.', 1, 0, '110.36.200.15', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

Baikal IZH-27 "hunting":\n\nTried and tested. built tough and ready to withstand field abuse. long standing history of reliability and durability. very good choice for a budget field shotgun. good balance and handling.\n\n2. Baikal IZH-27 "Sporting":\n\nmechanically similar to IZH-27 "hunting" therefore all good traits of the hunting model are also present in this shotgun. as a bonus, with sporting shotgun one gets some other enhancements which are very useful in sports shooting. now these benefits have an associated cost which must be paid the user/ower in terms of weight. ofcourse, "sporting" model is heavier compared to "hunting" model and does not come with sling attachments that aid during long walks in hunting. however one must understand that this disadvantage pays for itself in the terms of the comfort and advantage that one gets in sports shooting.\n\nif you are not interested in sports shooting then I really do not see a reason why you should go for a sporting model shotgun. simple!\n\n3. Hatsan Optime O/U shotgun:\n\nwell....looks like a quality shotgun. however one cannot say anything conclusive about this shotgun as there is not much of a history behind it.\n\n4. interesting point to wonder and kill a few million brain cells over:\n\nBaikal IZH-27 is being manufactured and marketed since 1973. it is essentially built on a design that dates back to 1931 in the form of Browning Superposed which was designed to be a first mass produced over and under shotgun. if you compare the two shotgun you will find that Baikal is basically a modified (or improved) form of the Superposed shotgun. certain parts were modified to make them easier to produce or simpler in function and we all know that "the simplest solution is often the best the solution".\n\nhas anyone noticed why Browning resorted to mechanical trigger system in their latest Superposed based offering Browning 725? did I mention that Baikal also has mechanical trigger. I am really not implying anything, just asking a simple question. :)\n\nnow, coming to Hatsan. its built on Beretta action. very good and highly refined action which is  not only difficult to manufacture but also depends on many parts that are hand fitted and require a greater degree of fine tuning such as inertia trigger system. this is where the dichotomy lies. some say a budget O/U shotgun manufacturer can do a similar level of fine tuning and attention to detail as a high end shotgun manufacturer whereas other say that a budget shotgun O/U manufacturer can never invest the huge amount of resources involved in fine tuning a shotgun to such degree. they also say that a budget O/U manufacturer cannot afford to put that much attention to detail otherwise the huge cost jump would simply push their product out of the "budget" bracket and into the high end O/U shotgun bracket where nothing is ignored. in this bracket, they have to compete with the big dogs. where manufacturing flaws are not forgiven as honest mistakes but penalized for not doing the right job.\n\nthink about it? which school of thought do you belong to?\n\nRegards.\n\nnow thats history. whereas Hatsan which[/QUOTE]\n\nTHANX bro , did not understand the last sentence :smile: "now thats history. whereas Hatsan which"\nkindly  add a brief conclusion as well ..................... thanx\n                          regards...........', 1, 0, '111.68.102.26', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

In my profession i have to get about 15 NOCs from different Govt. Dept. despite of paying all the taxes and fulfilling all the requirements I am forced to pay Kharcha Pani. So I negotiate with them. \nMy advice, Do all the maths on this business, Make a project feasibility if its attractive then invest in it and go for your own license at every cost(Provided the case that you have sufficient investment), if you share license with another importer you won''t be able to compete in the market and you will always be dependent on some other importer. There are no fix rates for KHARCHA PANI so always use your contacts and then negotiate with them, they will lower the cost. Never show them that you are very interested to do this business. Let them know that if the Kharcha Pani is too high you will not go for it and forget about this business. It always works for me when dealing with Govt officials. My guess, this business requires between 10 Million to 20 Million of investment.

If it took twelve balls to make a pound, the firearm was a "12 bore."  It wasn''t a very precise system, but it was simple (by British standards, anyway) and adequate for the time. Later, after rifled barrels became popular, manufacturers started referring to the diameter in decimal inches.  This was originally the "lands", or high spots in the rifling, and was easily measured.  Later, they began using the diameter across the bottom of the rifling, called the "grooves."  But since rifling varied in depth depending on the type of the rifling and who was doing the work, the modern method is to ignore the barrel and refer to the bullet diameter.  That''s why a .303 British bullet is now a .311" diameter... even though it''s still the same size. The European method of referring to cartridges is by diameter, length, and rim type.  A 7x57 is a rimless 7mm Mauser, a 7x57R is a rimmed 7mm Mauser, for example.  This is a very imprecise system, since there can be many different cartridges of the same diameter and length that do not interchange, by case taper, shoulder configuration, or pressure rating.  The usual method in the British Commonwealth and USA is to give each cartridge a unique name to specifically identify the cartridge.  This sometimes results in things like the .460 Rowland, which has the same bullet diameter as the .45 ACP, which is actually .451, not .45... well, if it was easy anyone could do it. It''s also not unusual for a cartridge to have more than one name.  A European might refer to a "7.62x63mm" cartridge.  He would have a very hard time finding any in the USA, where the manufacturer calls it ".30-06".  The US government used to refer to it as the ".30 Army", but now refers to it as "M2", since they have a new .30 caliber cartridge, which they refer to as 7.62x51 to differentiate it from both the .30-06 and the previous .30 Army, now referred to as .30-40 Krag...

I was comparing its introductory price of 100K vs the introductory price of Scorpion (40K). [B]Now I wonder Caracal''s price fell from 100K+ to below 70K whereas Scorpion''s price rose from 40K to 55K.[/B]\n\nRegards.[/QUOTE]\n\nBeloved 12G, I respectfully disagree. You''re wrong. And willfully! Lolz!\n\nCaracal''s price has not changed much, if you measure it out rightly. The 100K deal was mine and today it''s for 70-75k''s as most common price, few exceptions excluded due to personal relationships. But a Magazine and a year''s limited warranty is missing from the initially proposed 100K package, both of which would amount to min 20-25K''s combined, magazine alone worth some 7-10K''s. Hence, it''s almost status quo, just a different impression, or at the max a 10-15K''s drop, if measured rightly. But then, anything new always has it''s "novelty tag" attached and is slightly up in the beginning.\n\nStoeger Cougar initially was purchased by many at 80K''s, even more. That its standing at 55-60k''s today does not mean the handgun is inferior or anything, it'' s just more common, demand/ supply at equilibrium.\n\nAs far as the CZ 999 is concerned, it''s a nice handgun, but would drop dead if they increased the prices just a tad more, coz the average man doesn''t know anything about it''s traits, 15 mtrs groupings, precision shooting qualities, etc, nor cares, yet certainly does care about the general impression that you get, means, bulk/ rugged looking piece of hardware/poor finish, Serb origin, etc, which nobody would like to pay anything in excess of 55- 60K''s for.\n\nI am humbly of the opinion that CZ 999 should not have been priced anything more than a Chinese NP 22, HP77B, etc, means 35-40K''s, since they''re Sig Clones as well, and speak[I] almost[/I] same manufacture quality. I feel at 60K''s, it''s one [B]rip off.[/B]\n\n [COLOR=#ff0000]The common man doesn''t even know much about true CZ''s, leave alone a Serbian CZ 999. Just ask some of our most senior members here, inclusive of myself, if we knew anything much about the popular CZ-75 platform in the pre-PakGuns days. \n[/COLOR]\nBut I know, you''ll never agree to these perimeters of measuring things up - [I]and willfully[/I], lolz!\n\n\nRegards.', 1, 1, '182.177.17.175', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

Before that i had a Beretta 92F local which stuck during firing of initial 5 rounds. So i went for Stoeger then. I fired almost 30 rounds at a distance of 20m. Following are my observations regarding this handgun: -\n[LIST]\n[*][B][U]Appearance & Size [/U]. [/B]Well it looks good. Very graceful infact. Due to shorter size than Beretta, u can easily carry and the most best thing is that it best fits in a medium sized hand due to its fine grips. I must say a very well balanced gun that u can aim at the target with ease.\n[*][B][U]Accuracy[/U].[/B] The man behind the gun matters a lot even u take the highest degree of accurate weapon. As i have just fired 30 rounds that too from the distance of 20m, and to me the 3 dots were new and initially i could not align perfectly. What i noticed that u have to keep the front sight dot half the way down to two rear sight dots to fire exactly where u wanted to fire. No doubt about the accuracy of this gun. I ill soon upload other pics next week Inshallah with better results.\n[*][B][U]Security and Ruggedness[/U].[/B] No doubt about the firing pin locking mechanism. The barrel rather the whole gun with Matt finish is rugged enough for long life. It is a good choice for those who want to keep the hand gun for life time. Just with good care, i can bet on its longer life than other handguns. The sliding and the other mechanism is made more secure to prevent any accidental firing or any injury due to malfunctioning.\n[*][B][U]Firing Experience[/U]. [/B]The Handgun behaved very well during firing. It went so smooth that one would love to fire with this handgun. As far as i am concerned, i love this gun and recommend others to go for that as their first choice.\n[/LIST]\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]9526[/ATTACH][ATTACH=CONFIG]9527[/ATTACH][ATTACH=CONFIG]9528[/ATTACH][ATTACH=CONFIG]9529[/ATTACH][ATTACH=CONFIG]9530[/ATTACH][ATTACH=CONFIG]9531[/ATTACH]', 1, 0, '175.107.3.122', 0, 1, 6, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

The cartridge was introduced in 1962 by Vern O’Brien[2] it offered an easy case conversion and good ballistics but could not compete against the .17 Remington. The name Mach IV comes from the claim that bullets can reach 4000 ft/s,(wow) despite this being only about Mach 3.5. Due to the relatively small case capacity, even small variations in powder of 0.5 gr (0.032 g) can lead to the difference between a safe and dangerously over pressure load. The .17 Mach IV became very popular with varmint hunters,   CHECK THE VELOCITY MAN\r\n\r\nThe .17 Remington Fireball was created in 2007 by Remington Arms Company as a response to the popular wildcat round, the .17 Mach IV. Factory loads drive a 20 grain (1.3 g) bullet around 4,000 ft/s (1,219 m/s). Velocity is close to the .17 Remington but with significantly less powder, and therefore less heat and fouling. Both are important issues to high-volume shooters such as varmint hunters.\r\n\r\n\r\n.17 Hornady Magnum Rimfire, commonly known as the .17 HMR, is a rimfire rifle cartridge developed by the ammunition company Hornady in 2002. It descended from the .22 Magnum by necking down the .22 Magnum case to take a .17 caliber (4.5 mm) bullet, and it is more costly to shoot than traditional .22 caliber rimfire cartridges. Commonly loaded with a 17 grain (1.1 g) bullet, it can deliver muzzle velocities in excess of 2550 ft/s (775 m/s).\r\n\r\n[url]http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrb56yCCqnY[/url]', 1, 1, '182.177.91.152', 0, 1, 3, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

I myself tried this tactic once but it didn''t worked as those decoying started to land on the other side of my decoys despite of the fact that there was a landing zone left and eventually the shots were not on as they should have been..Looking at your pictures, I assume that this is rigorously followed in case you are hunting in real shallow waters/marshes or in case of rivers where you have several branches of water around with "Baraitas" in abundance...

Remember to keep your finger off the trigger (start getting in the habit now to keep your trigger finger along the frame just above the trigger/ trigger guard. Next you will use your weak hand to grip finish your grip. I won''t take the time to explain this part - Our instructors will explain and demonstrate the grip to each student and make adjustments as you shoot.\n\n[COLOR=#0000ff][I][B]Breath Control:[/B][/I][/COLOR] Breath control is required to  minimize body movement which in turn reduces handgun movement. For target shooting it is recommended that you take a breath between shots - let out enough air to be comfortable and then shoot. Now for self-defense or tactical situations you will later need to learn to control your breathing while performing tactical movement and shooting. Ninja Stuff, Cool! That comes in later classes.\n\n[I][B][COLOR=#0000ff]Sight Alignment:[/COLOR][/B][/I] Proper sight alignment is the relationship of the front and rear sights. To properly align the two sights the top of the front sight is even with the top of the rear sight - the front sight must be centered in the notch of the rear sight (see illustration). Proper sight alignment is key to accurate shooting. Any misalignment of the front sight with the rear sight will cause inaccuracies of your shot placement. Our instructors will work with you during the range time to further discuss and demonstrate proper sight alignment. You will aim with your dominant eye when shooting a handgun. Just because you are right handed it does not mean that you are right eyed dominant. Our instructors will show you a easy test to determine your dominant eye. \n\n[I][B][COLOR=#0000ff]Trigger Squeeze:[/COLOR][/B][/I] Trigger squeeze is exactly that, you squeeze the trigger back in order to shoot the handgun - you do not pull or jerk the trigger back. The trigger must be squeezed straight back in a smooth continuous motion. \n\n[I][COLOR=#0000ff][B]Follow Through:[/B][/COLOR][/I] Continuing to apply all of the shooting fundamentals throughout the delivery of the shot.\n\n[QUOTE][B]Trigger Squeeze and sight alignment are considered to be the two most important factors in accurate shooting The other four fundamentals all combine to assist in achieving proper sight alignment and trigger squeeze. All the fundamentals must be properly performed every time in order to shoot the pistol accurately.[/B][/QUOTE]', 1, 0, '115.186.68.129', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

At the same time, one big advantage of 7x57 is price of bullet in market and availablilty, with the three bullets: 139 grains S&B Chzek bullet (Sellior & Bellot), 145 grains Winchester Power Point, 140 grains federal PSP ... all great bullets in 7x57 and readily available too, Federal being the best and slightly short in market always. \r\n\r\nSo...calibre and bullet ... both are critical....depends which bullet with a certain calibre a shooter is using or intending to use.', 1, 0, '110.36.200.15', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

HAPE remains the major cause of death related to high-altitude exposure with a high mortality in absence of adequate emergency treatment\r\n\r\nSymptomsPhysiological and symptomatic changes often vary according to the altitude involved.[2]\r\n\r\nThe Lake Louise Consensus Definition for High Altitude Pulmonary Edema has set widely-used criteria for defining HAPE symptoms: [3][4]\r\n\r\nSymptoms: at least two of:\r\n\r\nDifficulty in breathing (dyspnea) at rest \r\nCough \r\nWeakness or decreased exercise performance \r\nChest tightness or congestion \r\nSigns: at least two of:\r\n\r\nCrackles or wheezing (while breathing) in at least one lung field \r\nCentral cyanosis (blue skin color) \r\nTachypnea (rapid shallow breathing) \r\nTachycardia (rapid heartrate) \r\nIntermediate Altitudes (1500-2500 m or 4900-8200 feet) \r\nClinical symptoms are unlikely. Blood oxygen levels remain >90%.\r\n\r\nHigh Altitude (2500-3500 m or 8200-11500 feet) \r\nClinical symptoms are common and may develop after 2-3 days. Blood oxygen levels may drop below 90% or lower during exercise. Prior acclimation will decrease the severity of the symptoms.\r\n\r\nExtreme Altitude (>5800 m or 19000 feet) \r\nBlood oxygen levels are <90%, even at rest. Progressive deterioration may occur despite acclimation.\r\n\r\n[edit] CausesThe initial cause of HAPE is a shortage of oxygen which is caused by the lower air pressure at high altitudes.[1][5] The mechanisms by which this shortage of oxygen causes HAPE are poorly understood, but two processes are believed to be important:\r\n\r\nIncreased pulmonary arterial and capillary pressures (pulmonary hypertension) secondary to hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction.[6] \r\nAn idiopathic non-inflammatory increase in the permeability of the vascular endothelium.[7] \r\nAlthough higher pulmonary arterial pressures are associated with the development of HAPE, the presence of pulmonary hypertension may not in itself be sufficient to explain the development of edema: severe pulmonary hypertension can exist in the absence of clinical HAPE in subjects at high altitude.[8]\r\n\r\nIncidenceThe incidence of clinical HAPE in unacclimatized travelers exposed to high altitude (~4,000 m or 13,000 ft) appears to be less than 1%.[citation needed] The U.S. Army Pike''s Peak Research Laboratory has exposed sea-level-resident volunteers rapidly and directly to high altitude; during 30 years of research involving about 300 volunteers (and over 100 staff members), only three have been evacuated with suspected HAPE.\r\n\r\nPredisposing factorsIndividual susceptibility to HAPE is difficult to predict. The most reliable risk factor is previous susceptibility to HAPE, and there is likely to be a genetic basis to this condition, perhaps involving the gene for angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE).[citation needed] Recently, scientists have found the similarities between low amounts of 2,3-BPG (also known as 2,3-DPG) with the occurrence of HAPE at high altitudes.\r\n\r\n[edit] ResearchIn order to help understand the factors that make some individuals susceptible to HAPE, the International HAPE Database was set up in 2004.[9] Individuals who have previously suffered from HAPE can register with this confidential database in order to help researchers study the condition.\r\n\r\n[edit] TreatmentThe standard and most important treatment is to descend to lower altitude as quickly as possible, preferably by at least 1000 metres.[1][10] Oxygen should also be given if possible. Symptoms tend to quickly improve with descent, but less severe symptoms may continue for several days. The standard drug treatments for which there is strong clinical evidence are dexamethasone.[11] and nifedipine[12] Phosphodiesterase inhibitors such as tadalafil are also effective[11] but may worsen the headache of mountain sickness.', 1, 1, '119.154.65.135', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

HAPE remains the major cause of death related to high-altitude exposure with a high mortality in absence of adequate emergency treatment\n\nSymptomsPhysiological and symptomatic changes often vary according to the altitude involved.[2]\n\nThe Lake Louise Consensus Definition for High Altitude Pulmonary Edema has set widely-used criteria for defining HAPE symptoms: [3][4]\n\nSymptoms: at least two of:\n\nDifficulty in breathing (dyspnea) at rest \nCough \nWeakness or decreased exercise performance \nChest tightness or congestion \nSigns: at least two of:\n\nCrackles or wheezing (while breathing) in at least one lung field \nCentral cyanosis (blue skin color) \nTachypnea (rapid shallow breathing) \nTachycardia (rapid heartrate) \nIntermediate Altitudes (1500-2500 m or 4900-8200 feet) \nClinical symptoms are unlikely. Blood oxygen levels remain >90%.\n\nHigh Altitude (2500-3500 m or 8200-11500 feet) \nClinical symptoms are common and may develop after 2-3 days. Blood oxygen levels may drop below 90% or lower during exercise. Prior acclimation will decrease the severity of the symptoms.\n\nExtreme Altitude (>5800 m or 19000 feet) \nBlood oxygen levels are <90%, even at rest. Progressive deterioration may occur despite acclimation.\n\n[edit] CausesThe initial cause of HAPE is a shortage of oxygen which is caused by the lower air pressure at high altitudes.[1][5] The mechanisms by which this shortage of oxygen causes HAPE are poorly understood, but two processes are believed to be important:\n\nIncreased pulmonary arterial and capillary pressures (pulmonary hypertension) secondary to hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction.[6] \nAn idiopathic non-inflammatory increase in the permeability of the vascular endothelium.[7] \nAlthough higher pulmonary arterial pressures are associated with the development of HAPE, the presence of pulmonary hypertension may not in itself be sufficient to explain the development of edema: severe pulmonary hypertension can exist in the absence of clinical HAPE in subjects at high altitude.[8]\n\nIncidenceThe incidence of clinical HAPE in unacclimatized travelers exposed to high altitude (~4,000 m or 13,000 ft) appears to be less than 1%.[citation needed] The U.S. Army Pike''s Peak Research Laboratory has exposed sea-level-resident volunteers rapidly and directly to high altitude; during 30 years of research involving about 300 volunteers (and over 100 staff members), only three have been evacuated with suspected HAPE.\n\nPredisposing factorsIndividual susceptibility to HAPE is difficult to predict. The most reliable risk factor is previous susceptibility to HAPE, and there is likely to be a genetic basis to this condition, perhaps involving the gene for angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE).[citation needed] Recently, scientists have found the similarities between low amounts of 2,3-BPG (also known as 2,3-DPG) with the occurrence of HAPE at high altitudes.\n\n[edit] ResearchIn order to help understand the factors that make some individuals susceptible to HAPE, the International HAPE Database was set up in 2004.[9] Individuals who have previously suffered from HAPE can register with this confidential database in order to help researchers study the condition.\n\n[edit] TreatmentThe standard and most important treatment is to descend to lower altitude as quickly as possible, preferably by at least 1000 metres.[1][10] Oxygen should also be given if possible. Symptoms tend to quickly improve with descent, but less severe symptoms may continue for several days. The standard drug treatments for which there is strong clinical evidence are dexamethasone.[11] and nifedipine[12] Phosphodiesterase inhibitors such as tadalafil are also effective[11] but may worsen the headache of mountain sickness.[/QUOTE]\nSorry Bro, but I don''t see the relevance here.

Probably influenced by the writings of Hermann Helmholtz, it was invented by American ophthalmologist Adelbert Ames, Jr. in 1934, and constructed in the following year.\r\n\r\nAn Ames room is constructed so that from the front it appears to be an ordinary cubic-shaped room, with a back wall and two side walls parallel to each other and perpendicular to the horizontally level floor and ceiling. However, this is a trick of perspective and the true shape of the room is trapezoidal: the walls are slanted and the ceiling and floor are at an incline, and the right corner is much closer to the front-positioned observer than the left corner (or vice versa). (See overhead view diagram to the right)\r\n\r\nAs a result of the optical illusion, a person standing in one corner appears to the observer to be a giant, while a person standing in the other corner appears to be a dwarf. The illusion is so convincing that a person walking back and forth from the left corner to the right corner appears to grow or shrink.\r\n\r\nStudies have shown that the illusion can be created without using walls and a ceiling; it is sufficient to create an apparent horizon (which in reality will not be horizontal) against an appropriate background, and the eye relies on the apparent relative height of an object above that horizon.', 1, 1, '119.154.65.135', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

(260062, 8645, 0, 'Enigmatic Desires', 430, 'Partial market Survey - Lucky Star', 1333956262, 'Brief survey\r\n\r\nAfter I got my pistol licence from mega arms (after a 6 week wait)  I decided to conduct a survey of the different dealers in the market. \r\n\r\nFirst port of call\r\n\r\nMega arms:\r\n\r\nThe Proprietor Mr. Danish is an amiable fellow. So amiable in fact that in trying to convince me to buy a Taurus PT 709 local clone. He even pressed the gun to my shoulder and pressed the trigger.\r\n\r\nAs regards the clone, it was quite simply the best one I have ever seen. No exaggeration. The packaging : Original cardboard box and thick light blue plastic wrap were pureTaurus. The weapon itself was quite unlike any other clone/knock off I ever handled\r\n\r\nHe even offered to open her up an let me take a sneak peak in her innards. But I was more excited by his offer to let me try her out at his shooting range above his show room.  I bought a few rounds and popped them off.  She recoiled like a she doggy in heat. But since I have never fired an original 709 I cant compare. Besides that the decocker/manual safety were both far easier on the hand then even a CF 98. \r\nI was impressed. Even more so by the prize tag. Rs. 30,000/- Danish sat me down and told me in as sincere a tone as any dealer can get. \r\n\r\n“This is the weapon I use for SD myself.. Look, a showroom full of imported weaponry  and I stil use this only. Buy it because I am telling you to do so.. U will never go wrong with it. “Trust me brother and you don’t even need to do the rounds of the market.  Just buy it!\r\n\r\nOstensibly, it was manufactured by Danish arms company (No relation) However since DAC did not use their brand name but rather preferred the legend “Made in Brazil” I was not impressed.  He said “In weddings I have fired hundreds of rounds from this weapon” (No he was not interested in Newton’s Law of Universal Gravitation) \r\n\r\nHe charged me Rs. 17k per licence. I only wanted one for a pistol, but got saddled with a shotgun one as well.  He had promised a discount on the second licence. But kind of decided it won’t be worth his while to give me one. Since he claimed that now licences are worth Rs. 20K each.  Since I am on the verge of losing my job I have no inclination of getting a shotgun which I don’t need anyway. So the licence is lying in his showroom. He did save me a trip to the national bank though and got both the licences stamped. \r\n\r\nDid I have a good experience? Compared to other dealers definitely! \r\n\r\nVerdict: My shoulder is intact and I got to fire a weapon that I won’t normally touch (Local clones sporting foreign brands are not exactly at the top of my priority list) \r\n\r\nMy next port of call was TNT arms next to Baluchistan traders, Lucky star area. \r\nThis fine gentle man when I walked into his shop with my brand new licence looked me up and down and asked me if I am just going to look or am I going to buy. He said he is not going to bother opening cartons of his wares until and unless I make a commitment to buy beforehand! \r\n\r\nVerdict: Maybe he was having a bad hair day… \r\n\r\nAfter that it was Moon star arms. \r\nThe individual showed me a few local TTs ranging from 7 to 9.5k. When I asked him the reason behind the price range (They all looked the same to me) he said ‘Quality’.  When I persisted he was slightly irritated “Brother, if one is more expensive than the other its obvious its higher quality” (sigh) I really felt silly for trying to argue with such unassailable logic…  I told him about Pak guns and he was like business is difficult enough in the real world now you people have to start opening up a new front in the computer world…. \r\nI really wanted to see his famous moon star  9mm berretta clones. But he showed me just about everything but those. They were woth 20k btw.. No discount possible\r\nVerdict: I am sure he likes me too as long as I don’t talk bout computers and his famous 9mm berretta clone. (Or ask for nasty things like discounts and differences in quality, Since it’s a factory outlet the “D” word does not apply even when other dealers in the market are offering his products at the same price)\r\nA word of advice: Don’t EVER tell him other dealers are offering at prices lower than him. He really won’t like you if you do so. \r\n\r\nThen I visited his brother’s shot in the same lane. Haji something or other. \r\nI have already purchased from him before. The man showed me his wares, all local clones. 9mms and .30 bores. But when I told him my purpose is serious SD. He looked me in the eye and told me quietly that I should not buy a local clone if I am buying for SD. Only for fun \r\n\r\nVerdict: Great place to buy, if one were to buy for ‘fun’ (Once I figure out whatever that means) \r\n\r\nOn to jawed Armoury: \r\nHe had been watching me plodding all over the street so I decided to grace him with a visit. \r\nWhile I was going through his wares a man walks in with the look of a constipated kid. “Please do-you-have-allama.32 pistol” When the shop keeper said no he literally scratched his head “look I am going crazy looking for it can you at least tell me the price. Once again the monosyllabic no. and the poor ‘llama hunter’ went out still muttering bout how he is going crazy looking for his beloved ‘llama’  (No pun intended) The shop keeper gave me his best  I-get-all-kinds-look and told me to stay away from local guns. He did have some really, really neat local shotguns with drum mags. However I had been admonished from buying those so I left. \r\n\r\nVerdict: A ''No'' nonsense individual who believes in monosyllables when confronted by heartbroken gun lovers. If you have a deep craving for a .32 Llama he is definitely not your man!\r\n\r\nThen on to Saddar armoury. \r\nHe repeated the ‘Say no to (local) guns mantra. He told me that only Cougher has a rotating barrel mechanism. And anyone who says that the CF 98 has one is just plain wrong. When I tried to convince him otherwise he offered me a free CF 98 brand new if I can find a rotary barrel CF. It had to be a Norinco stamped one since Entercons are no longer available.\r\n\r\nVerdict: I left with visions of a brand new CF gracing my hip (free of cost of course)\r\n\r\nSummary: Dealers are a breed apart and they also have pretty good memories. Most of em remembered me from last year as the window-shopping-dude. I think I need to look for horizons other than Lucky star.', 1, 1, '221.120.193.186', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

Point shooting seems the best way to work this beast as it doesn''t have a stock, and the sights are not optimal for a handgun.

Next time I''ll try it out to about 100 yards which is the limits of the pit I was shooting out.\r\n\r\nEnd results?

Take away everything related to guns for a second.\r\n\r\nA moving object has kinetic energy... when an object contacts another object and slows down it transfers that energy into the other object(basic theory of physics energy cannot be created or destroyed) \r\nSo now... You take a water jug, place a pencil standing up, touching it, and flick the other end... the energy of your flick is transfered into the jug, into the water, out of the jug, and knocks the pencil over... Hydrostatic shock, the water is not moving(static) but transfers the energy in a form of a shockwave into the pencil.\r\n\r\nNow apply it to guns, hit a watermelon with a rifle...it blows out the sides in addition to a exit hole... the shockwave of the bullet suddenly hitting a liquid medium(watermelon internals) transfers energy through it until it blows the skin out on the watermelon, releasing all the energy which intern throws the flesh out of the watermelon.... hydrostatic shock.\r\n\r\nAnd.. on another point which I typically hear, pistol bullets don''t create hydrostatic shock.. I believe this is a false statement... based on what I stated about transfer of energy, yes they do, BUT!!! they do not necessarily have enough energy to create ENOUGH hydrostatic shock to destroy tissue/only move it aside(temporary cavity)\r\n\r\n:)\r\n\r\nshocking isnt it ?', 1, 0, '119.154.187.139', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

I''d like to start by explaining what SDASS stands for, it''s short for Special Defense And Security Shotgun. Which is an appropriate description of this shotgun. \n\nIt is a 7 + 1 pump action shotgun. The finish is excellent and the compact model comes with a fixed pistol grip as well as a folding stock. It''s lightweight and fits in your hands and shoulder nicely. The pump action is a little rough but solid. A plus point of buying a FABARM shotgun is that they usually come with their patented Tri-Bore barrel. At first I thought that was mostly a gimmic to sell their weapons but FABARM really have something going with that technology and it has become a unique selling point for them. Instead of long explanations of the tech, the Tri Bore translates into lesser/softer recoil, tighter shot patterns/ closer groupings and deeper shot penetration. At about 50 feet the shot was grouped in an area about twice the diameter of a CD/DVD / smaller than a football. \n\nThe barrel tech seems good as I rapid fired 7 rounds and the barrel was hot to touch but still could be held by hand.   \n\nThe recoil is excellent, the Tribore design helps and the rubber padded folding stock really acts as a shock absorber. Infact \nthe recoil was noticeably lesser even when compared to a Winchester Defender 1300 which was being fired side by side and is one of the best shotguns of all time. \n      \nI bought my SDASS a year ago for Rs. 70,000 from Lahore which is a very fair price for an Italian made shotgun in Pakistan.\n\nAnother thing I would like to mention is that it looks simply breathtaking while being fired at night. The sound is great as well, deep and very .12 gauge but just seeing the gun fire in darkness is a treat in itself. \n\nI liked it so much that my brother bought one for himself as well. Highly Recommended for under 80 K!\n\n\n\nHere are some pictures of SDASS and some weblinks.\n\n[IMG]http://i262.photobucket.com/albums/ii99/AbbasMalik/Fabarm1.jpg[/IMG]\n\n[IMG]http://i262.photobucket.com/albums/ii99/AbbasMalik/Fabarm2.jpg[/IMG]\n\n[IMG]http://i262.photobucket.com/albums/ii99/AbbasMalik/Fabarm3.jpg[/IMG]\n\n[IMG]http://i262.photobucket.com/albums/ii99/AbbasMalik/Fabarm4.jpg[/IMG]\n\n[IMG]http://i262.photobucket.com/albums/ii99/AbbasMalik/Fabarm5.jpg[/IMG]\n\n\n[URL]http://www.fabarm.com/products-sdass-compact.htm[/URL]\n\n\nOh and here''s Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie using it in Mr and Mrs Smith ;) (House shoot out scene) \n\n[IMG]http://www.imfdb.org/images/d/dd/Mr_and_Mrs_Smith_29-1-.jpg[/IMG]salam \n              kindly give the adress and phone# from where i can purchase sdass', 1, 0, '182.183.212.95', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

As an all around shooter, the SAM is a good pistol, but if I were going to use it for compition, I would opt for the used Springfield.The Twin Pines model is a simple, old-style 1911 pistol. The markings on the slide made no reference to the model name, but the slide did display a bold insigne featuring a large cannon and the words Rock Island Armory. I was impressed by its clean edges and evenly applied finish. The heavy wood grips were very tasteful. They were smooth rather than checkered, clearly displaying the attractive wood pattern. The sights were a low-mount design, as found on the original Browning. When sighting on a target, I found them easily. Cocking serrations appeared on the rear of the slide, and vertical lines were cut into the flat mainspring housing. A beavertail grip safety was included, but it was narrow at the tang. The Twin Pines also lacks other niceties found on modern pistols, including a skeletonized hammer and trigger, both of which decrease lock time and, as a result, cycling speed.

Take away everything related to guns for a second.\r\n\r\nA moving object has kinetic energy... when an object contacts another object and slows down it transfers that energy into the other object(basic theory of physics energy cannot be created or destroyed) \r\nSo now... You take a water jug, place a pencil standing up, touching it, and flick the other end... the energy of your flick is transfered into the jug, into the water, out of the jug, and knocks the pencil over... Hydrostatic shock, the water is not moving(static) but transfers the energy in a form of a shockwave into the pencil.\r\n\r\nNow apply it to guns, hit a watermelon with a rifle...it blows out the sides in addition to a exit hole... the shockwave of the bullet suddenly hitting a liquid medium(watermelon internals) transfers energy through it until it blows the skin out on the watermelon, releasing all the energy which intern throws the flesh out of the watermelon.... hydrostatic shock.\r\n\r\nAnd.. on another point which I typically hear, pistol bullets don''t create hydrostatic shock.. I believe this is a false statement... based on what I stated about transfer of energy, yes they do, BUT!!! they do not necessarily have enough energy to create ENOUGH hydrostatic shock to destroy tissue/only move it aside(temporary cavity)\r\n\r\n:)\r\n\r\nshocking isnt it ?[/QUOTE]\r\n\r\n[b] Interesting indeed rather then shocking. !

Introduced at the latest IWA expo in Nuremberg, Germany, this standard .9x19mm-Parabellum semi-automatic handgun is a prototype coming from a factory called "Daudsons Armoury", known as DSA, and located in Peshawar, Pakistan (see them at: [URL]http://www.daudsons.org/);[/URL] despite of its location, and the nature of the products displayed on its website, DSA operates with newest, state-of-the-art CNC machineries, and doesn''t manufactures only civilian weapons but it''s also a HUGE Pakistani defense contractor: at the IDEAS 2002 asian defence expo, DSA introduced the "AGL-40", a reliable 40mm automatic, belt-fed grenade launcher that ressembles to a rogue copy of the US-made MK-19 (there''s a picture of the DSA AGL-40 at: [URL]http://www.pakdef.info/ideas2002/[/URL]). \n\n\nThe design of this "DSA-9" pistol is evidently ripped off from a notorious Austrian product engineered by a man called Gaston... in fact it is a knock-off from the GLOCK 19. It is a mix of several generations'' Glock models, the trigger guard is different, but the slide will be probably made of metal instead than polymer, at least when the gun will enter production.

Recoil should be understood in a practical way, theoretical recoil is one thing and FELT Recoil and recovery is an individual experience. How ever the following will help:\n1.One can not add weight or compensaters to SD guns, there fore one should choose lighter bullets in the caliber one is using , making sure it functions flawlessly. \n \n2.First of all strengthen your grip. Use a grip excerciser as often as you can , start by doing 25 reps at a time once a day and then increase the reps and the number of times. \n\n3.Do weight training with dumb bells and in a gym if possible, in a month or two your grip and arms would be strong enough to soak up recoil and your recovery will be fast and on target in shorter times progressively. \n\n4. Improve your stance. Keep your feet atleast as wide as your shoulders or a bit wider.\nCover your right hand  with your left hand and ensure you extend your arms straight, locking your shoulders and elbows. Push forward with your right hand and pull in with the left, this will form a shock/recoil absorbing arrangement.\nKeep both thumbs on one side and not touching the trigger finger.\nBend your knees slightly and ensure your hip joints are a bit forward of your heels.\nWear hearing protection and train regularly after getting fit.\nYou will be surprised at the amount of reduction in felt recoil and recovery by doing nothing to the gun but TUNNING yourself.

Recoil should be understood in a practical way, theoretical recoil is one thing and FELT Recoil and recovery is an individual experience. How ever the following will help:\n1.One can not add weight or compensaters to SD guns, there fore one should choose lighter bullets in the caliber one is using , making sure it functions flawlessly.\n\n2.First of all strengthen your grip. Use a grip excerciser as often as you can , start by doing 25 reps at a time once a day and then increase the reps and the number of times.\n\n3.Do weight training with dumb bells and in a gym if possible, in a month or two your grip and arms would be strong enough to soak up recoil and your recovery will be fast and on target in shorter times progressively.\n\n4. Improve your stance. Keep your feet atleast as wide as your shoulders or a bit wider.\nCover your right hand with your left hand and ensure you extend your arms straight, locking your shoulders and elbows. Push forward with your right hand and pull in with the left, this will form a shock/recoil absorbing arrangement.\nKeep both thumbs on one side and not touching the trigger finger.\nBend your knees slightly and ensure your hip joints are a bit forward of your heels.\nWear hearing protection and train regularly after getting fit.\nYou will be surprised at the amount of reduction in felt recoil and recovery by doing nothing to the gun but TUNNING yourself.

So ended my 53 year old relationship  with him. Cyril, his elder brother was my course mate when I joined  P.A.F Academy Risalpur in 1957. I recall, during one winter break,these  used to be pretty short, Cyril invited some course mates to spend the  break at his house. It was a big house. The “boys” bunked in a big sized  room with extra mattresses and comforters.That is when I met Cec. Cec  he remained to me always.My friends planned to go out,to proverbially  paint the town red. Cec asked me to stay back. Stay back I did  having immediately struck a cord with him.We went for a walk till we got  to a Church compound.Sitting on the steps of the main building, out  came a flask from his hip pocket. One swig and it was offered to me.That  was my first taste of scotch! Ofcourse drinks were not banned back  then.We  ended up at the Burt Institute where a dance competition was arranged.  Cec’s partner was already there. He was a great dancer, light on his  feet. They went on to win the first prize.\n\n\n That day was the start of a beautiful friendship!\n\n\nMost  know Cec. as a war hero. He was; especially the mission at Halwara in  1965. I would like to share here the events of that fateful day of 6th  September, 1965.  Prior to the 1965 war, PAF was operating in the Runn  of Kutch from Mauripur Air Base. The Air Force was convinced that war  with India was inevitable and therefore was prepared. We knew our  targets, our formation composition and from which field to operate. The  time over target (TOT) was simultaneous for all assigned targets. In 1964  I was posted Test Pilot and Quality Control Officer at Mauripur, thereby  posted out of No 14 Squadron. I was under the command of Officer  Commanding Maintenance Wing and not The O.C. Flying Wing. However, I  flew Runn of Kutch missions, whenever required and was to be attached to  32 Fighter Wing, Mauripur, in case of war. On the morning of 2nd  September, I was No. 3 in a 4 aircraft formation  lead by Shaheed ‘Butch’ Ahmed and reached Sargodha around 7 am.  I went back to Mauripur on the  5th of September and on the 6th morning took off from Mauripur under  the leadership of Sqn. Ldr. Azim Daudpota (Later Air Marshal Daudpota,  SJ) in a large formation which was to land at Risalewala and my assigned  target was IAF Base Halwara, whenever the strike was ordered by the Air  Staff. However, we were told to proceed to Sargodha where we parked the  aircraft (F-86''s) in the strike area pens.\n\n\n On the afternoon of 6th September,  preemptive strikes were ordered  as planned earlier. Here, I must mention that the Indian Army had  launched a massive attack, backed by Amour to capture Lahore and have a  drink in the evening at Punjab Club/Lahore Gymkhana. Our Army was not  prepared for such a massive onslaught. PAF had not planned for any  extensive Air Support for our Army in this sector but the very  sovereignty of Pakistan was at stake. The PAF, under the command of  dynamic leader like Air Marshal Nur Khan, was ordered to neutralize the  Indian Army designs. Despite our meager resources, our second to none  fighter pilots flew continuous mission the whole day.\n\n\n [URL="http://pakpotpourri2.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/group-picture.jpg"][IMG]http://pakpotpourri2.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/group-picture.jpg?w=530&h=417[/IMG][/URL]\n [I]No. 14 Squadron PAF Masroor!

Well past  the time that the aircraft should have taken off to strike Halwara, I  was told that I was required for briefing by Sqn. Ldr. Rafiqui for  the Halwara strike. Rafiqui Sahib was briefing, as he sat on the ground. Hardly  a few minutes had passed when Flt. Lt. Yunus Hussain walked in. He had  just come back from a mission from Lahore. Rafiqui Saieb asked me,  ‘Kazim, if you dont mind, let me take Yunus, he is my Flight Commander and  you follow in the 2nd wave”. So I got up and went for briefing of the  2nd wave of four that was to be lead by Sqn. Ldr. Moin ur Rab (Later Air  Vice Marshal,). We were briefed and were to fly the aircraft that had  been brought that morning from Mauripur. We were shocked to find that  they had neither been refueled nor rearmed!.\n\n In the meantime, some of the senior colleagues had approached the  Base Commander, (late) Air Commodore ‘Mitty’ Masud, HJ, to call off this  mission as it was too late and Halwara would be up in the air with all  their aircraft. It will be pertinent to mention here that on this day,  6th September, at around 1400hrs. we had sent an F-104 to Halwara to check out  the activity there and that would have warned them that something was  up. Additionally, other IAF Bases had already been struck therefore  there is no doubt that Halwara was ready to face a strike by PAF and  would not be taken by surprise like the other bases.\n\n\n Regarding calling off the mission, to the best of my knowledge, the  Base Commander had agreed and called Air Headquarters to permit  cancellation of mission by them. Certainly not the Air Chief, I am sure.  Rafiqui, the lion hearted , began his take off roll and during the take  off one formation member had a technical failure and was forced to  abort take off. That left three Sqn. Ldr. Rafiqui (leader), Flt. Lt. Cecil  (No.2) and Flt. Lt. Yunus Hussain (No.3). When this formation was heading  for Halwara, Sqn. Ldr. M.M. Alam was returning from a mission and he  called up on the radio and asked Rafiqui Sahib not to proceed as he had  spotted a large number of Indian fighter aircraft in the vicinity of  Halwara. But Rafiqui and his colleagues had already signed and  delivered a cheque in the name of their NATION where the amount column  had said, ”Up to and including My Life.”  Rafiqui, lovingly called "Raf"  by his mates, carried on  knowing full well what was the expected outcome. In the Air Combat of 3  vs innumerable, Yunus was shot down, Rafiqui shot down 2 before his  guns jammed and he handed over the lead to Cecil who shot down 3 and was overwhelmed, disengaged and used all the skill at his command to evade  the pursuing IAF Fighters and landed at Sargodha with the sun setting  on a day which we, the colleagues of  Shaheed Sqn. Ldr. Sarfraz Rafiqui,  HJ. Shaheed Flt. Lt. Yunus Hussain, SJ. and Gp. Capt. Cecil Chaudhry, SJ,  S.Bt. (RIP) will never ever forget.\n\n The evening of 6th September, 1965, was our Sham-e-Ghariban. Cecil  and I stood next to the mess swimming pool, which was as empty as our  hearts. The night was dark and quiet, the lights were dim and the  sadness was just so loud. We just just stood in silence. A silence that  spoke louder than words. Then Cec broke the wall of silence saying,   ”Why are they saying that my leader is alive?” I replied, “Cec, you  were there and you know the gloom in the heart of all pilots and men, a  bit of hope is required to let them sleep. We have to fight again, come  sun rise”.\n\n As I write this, a tribute to one of the bravest man I knew, and  all those who gave up their lives for our motherland, I reaffirm, that  the men of the Pak Armed Forces pledge their lives to the Nation.That blank  cheque the motherland can call upon any time, to deliver!', 1, 1, '111.68.105.241', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

Birds decoying right in front of hideout with low velocity, heedlessly and feeling unscarred. \n\n  Let me conclude the unattended query. \n\nFirst of all, i would like to mention that we have a good duck hunter around, needless to mention its &#8220;URIKA&#8221;, the best. \n\nI appreciate his good game spirit and nice bags continuously, my gratitude&#8217;s 2 him. I hope he will also bear a good experience towards wings game and his contribution will be an asset for us all. \n\nComing back to the subject question, let me explain my (personal) strategy with associate. I hope my personal experience needs some cushion of apologies by the critics.\n\n\nSince times, I have earned that decoying the birds is not adequate in hunting but their proper landing as gunners need is the key factor. Getting maximun number of birds from each flight makes the real difference otherwise everyone is equally good with guns.\n\nI have seen buddies spreading 100 decoys without any trajectory resulting minuscule number of ducks from each flight. One can succeed in decoying the birds into the spread but not at desired place nor within needed velocity and at right place. Sometime ducks lands ahead of decoys or unreachable areas. Shooting them result in just few birds or waste of a good flight. Its most often and those who are in duck shooting will agree.\n\nDynamics of decoy spread is little interesting, I never has any fixed shape in mind, its on spot decision always depending upon the birds approaching that day or the best in mind while its dark. Sometime, it needs to change your plan several times during the shortest possible time. \n\nRemember each decoy of the spread has its importance. Just holding decoys in numbers will never fruitful. Key factors to keep in mind is birds route and where u wants them to decoy. The place where you will get them. \n\nSetting decoying zone is known to every hunter and its common thing for every duck hunter but many factors involved which often ignored like birds approaching spread, wind direction, climate, mojo setting, hide setting, landing zone  bla Bla Bla. \n\nLet me share the crux of the decoy spread for me. \n\nHave you observed my spreads they are far different from orthodox spread, groups or specific landing zones. I have set route for birds to enter in between. The lines straighter and regardless of any fixed pattern like X, W, J or any other. I have confidence that the birds will decoys at the foremost trap set with a higher velocity and slow down and decrease height until it approaches the landing area and most often birds follow the instruction &#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;. Hahahahhaaha  \n\nTry to set the trap away from your den, let them fall under fixed route. Your guns will be empty for sure.\n\nRoute trajectory should be set against the wind always, regardless of everything.\n\nView should be clear for each decoy from the approaching area.\n\nEach decoy should have his separate place. A smallest spread can provide an excellent view following this instruction.\n\nBest Decoys should be at leading side where birds will decoy first.\n\nTrap should have set in a way that bird should not focus to your hideout while decoying.\n\nCalling should be fully controlled, decrease wile birds approaching you rather stop calling if you are sure they are coming at right place. Add a little feeding or single low quack if they erect.\n\nWe often set pattern of decoys in a shape that birds entering spread will see added decoys each moment. It means from one to many and a landing whole nearer to hideout. \n\nMost important is the wind factor at this particular time, lading zone should set in a way that the birds flight should directed towards your hide while reaching it. They must pass over the hideout when you start shooting. \n\nMojo&#8217;s play vital roles in wing shooting these days but often seen there adverse reaction too. \nIt&#8217;s a separate debate but in most cases set them in way that flight should reach them while just landing at them directing you otherwise get ready for bad result from each flight. Never set them in landing holes rather in the direction the birds should be insisted to into landing zone from your planed area where guns waiting them.\n\nIt&#8217;s a little laborious discussion but if one could get even a single thing which results his success will be an honor for me.\n\n\nThis was all experience of decoys deployment while we setting our trap without any \nhesitations. However, people are much more experienced here share their own. \nPlease no arguments as its my personal query asked by H.G. no debate in favor or against please&#8230;..  \n\n\nLove u all', 1, 1, '117.20.22.131', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

But also let me bring in your kind notice, that MoI, months back sent letter to All the Home-Secretaries (of all the four consitutional provinces) and Chief Commissioner ICt (who is himself having power of Home Secy / CS of the Capital Administration), empowering them validation of their province''s license to All-Pakistan. In every province, the Section Officer (S.O Arms) is the competent authority to validate the licences for All-Pakistan. Unfortunately, due to some unofficial reasons, the CC Islamabad didn''t excercise the powers for a single time. I personally met him, as having long family terms with him, regarding the issue. He said that they are soon going to hand over their licences to NADRA too (almost very soon in a month or two) and then they would declare all licences as All-Pakistan against a separate fee. In the other case, he said, if they couldn''t make-up with NADRA, still they would start granting and Validating licences as ALL-PAKISTAN, after May-June, INSHA ALLAH.', 1, 1, '182.177.67.4', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

Camping next to your vehicle?\nWhat is the intended duration  and purpose of camping out?\nThe answers to these questions are a must before I can be of any help. For back packing up in the northern areas a 2 or three men tent which weighs around 2.2 KG is required, it should be fire retardent and breathable ,otherwise your life would be miserable as water from your own bodies and clothing will condense on the inner roof and drip on you all night, you will be wet and cold. For temperatures lower than 5 degrees C you have to get a breath able Gore tex inner tent, these are available abroad or at the Expedition shops in Gilgit and Skardu, these are very expansive abroad but mountaineers sell or gift these to the porters and you can buy one from 10 to 20000/-.\nFor higher temperatures ordinary parachute cloth tents are ok but come wet weather the moisture inside will be too much to breath and every thing will get wet from the moisture given off by the body.\nAgain these parachute type tents must have a porous inner with (Jali ) type large patches to let moisture go away. \nAll tents are highly INFLAMMABLE and a lot of dangerous accidents take place due to negligence. In any case fires are lit around camps and some of our brothers are unfortunately suffering from the smoking habbit.\nCanvas tents are only good for camping next to the vehicle as these are heavy.\n The breathable Gore tex tents become warm with body heat as it lets out all the moisture but traps hot air and makes you comfortable. An insect proof mesh is a must and one can regulate temperature by opening or closing zippers. The floor should be sturdy but not heavy and the poles are flexible carbon fiber or kevlar re enforced, the pegs are plastic for use in snow and aluminum for soft ground.\nVango, Northface, Karrimor and numerous other companies specialise in very expansive but fantastic tents worth their weight in gold in the wilderness when it rains and snows and the temperatures get as low minus 40 degrees celsius.\nIn hot weather one requires shade, insect proof mesh and not much more.

(262098, 3069, 261908, 'Hunting_Gem', 7161, '', 1334742859, '@ Prince..Thanks for the comprehensive reply Prince, nice to see you after a while!!\n \nThe detailed statement has left some queries in my mind which I’ll be posting point wise below, anticipating some further guidance from you. May be I’ll sound a bit dull or blazed out even. However, please note that these questions are raised solely with the intention of learning the art. There is absolutely no offense or argumentation..\n \n\n[LIST=1]\n[*]My first question is relevant to Mojo placement. What I got from your statement is to place them right next to your hide just before the declared Landing area. Of course one has to deploy the decoys in form of a straight line starting from the farthest point from your hide, with the intention that ducks will start losing height and velocity once they reach them and by the time they cross it and reach the landing area, what they’ll see is a landing mojo right in front of them which not only will tempt them to land in your designated zone but also it will help them to keep the emphasis on your decoy spread and not the hide….Right??\n[/LIST]\n \nHowever, I have seen people placing Mojo’s in relatively deep water right next to the decoys which will be approached by the incoming birds at very first instance. Of course they have their own theory to it that a landing Mojo at that place will help to minimize the height and speed of ducks coming towards you, and they will be at their slowest as they reach the striking zone. Please advise your take on that?? May be this has something to do with the location at which you are hunting or something else, your comments will be a lot helpful of course..\n \n\n[LIST=1]\n[*]What is the ideal number of decoys to be used in your opinion, of course you are right in saying that hundreds of them can be used without having adequate results…Also, should this vary as per the hunting location or type of location e.g. rivers or small ponds or shallow “Chumbs”\n[/LIST]\n \n\n[LIST=1]\n[*]One of the most important point that I came across is “landing zone should set in a way that the birds flight should be directed towards your hide while reaching it. They must pass over the hideout when you start shooting” I am sure this will be very helpful in my future outings as people generally tend to make their hides just at the corner or “Noki” of the baraita without giving much consideration to the direction of wind or incoming birds. What I am getting is try and even shift the hide as per the wind direction and decoys employed to ensure that their chests should be pointing towards you at the time you pull the trigger..Right??\n[/LIST]\n \nHowever, I am a bit confused by a picture of yours which is there in my first/original post where you have set the decoys in a slightly curved line (the one in which we can see the hills in the background). As it is only offering one side view as per my observation which I guess is the Left side of your hide, you must have noticed the movement from LEFT to RIGHT at that point of time. Now if we consider this, your landing area should have been right in front of the hide and incoming ducks will not cross over your hide unless you have some wide water spread on your right….. It’s just an assumption on the basis of what I see in order to understand the concept, shall be grateful if you can shed some light on the complete picture or post it if you are having it with you.\n \n\n[LIST=1]\n[*]One more thing, I am yet to shoot a mallard at a river site as they just don’t give you a chance when in flock, as most of the other ducks like pintails, pochards and gadwalls do. The most the’ll do is to pass/cross over your head at a height which is out of range. You must have hunted several in these kind of situations, is there anything special about it like decoy settings, types of decoys used, hide formulation, calling etc.\n[/LIST]\n \nLooking forward to have your valuable comments…Cheers!!!!\n \n [ATTACH=CONFIG]9893[/ATTACH]', 1, 1, '61.5.152.186', 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

I was working on a project regarding the PAF''s role in the ''65 War and Mr. Chaudhry was gracious enough to grant me an interview.\n\nI had initially planned the interview to be an hour long, but the man was an absolute treasure trove to knowledge, and the next I knew we had been talking & chatting for four hours straight! He spoke on everything; how he joined the PAF, his deep friendship with Sqn. Ldr. Rafiqui (he almost broke down while recounting the moment over Halwara when he realized that Sqn. Ldr. Rafiqui had made the ultimate sacrifice), his experiences in both the Wars, his views on the IAF, opinions on the current political and socio-econimic condition of Pakistan, his favorite books, cars, etc.\n\nI''d like to retell the most interesting story he told me. Some time after the ''71 War, Mr. Chaudhry was sent to Iraq on deputation as an instructor. The IAF had also sent a group of instructors. Upon landing, him & his wife were invited to a dinner reception for all the new instructors (both Pakistani & Indian) hosted by the C-in-C of the Iraq Air Force. That evening, at the dinner reception, while talking to a group of Iraqi officers, somebody tapped him on the shoulder. He turned around and saw an IAF officer standing before him, smiling. The IAF officer asked if he was Cecil Chaudhry. Upon confirmation, the IAF officer broke into a grin, offered his hand and introduced himself as A. R. Gandhi (forgive me, I forgot what Mr. Gandhi''s rank was at the time). Mr. Chaudhry shook his hand and asked how Mr. Gandhi knew him. The latter''s reply stunned Mr. Chaudhry. [B]"You see, Sir,"[/B] began Mr. Gandhi, [B]"you shot me down over Halwara!"[/B] He was then introduced to Mr. Gandhi''s wife, who quipped cheerfully, "Thank you for not killing my husband!" Both Mr. Chaudhry & Mr. Gandhi became life-long friends. Mr. Gandhi later went on to become C-inC IAF!\n\nI will not profess to knowing Mr. Cecil Chaudhry personally. I will, however, admit to what a great honour it is for me to have spent time in the company of such a great man.\n\nI once read an epitaph, written for Werner Voss (a German WWI ace who, with 58 kills, was killed in action in 1917 at the age of 20).

There are lots of associate who are far experienced and their expert opinion may add some knowledge to novice like me also.\n\nFor you perusal please:- \n\n4 &#8211; Ideal number of decoys varies according to situation always. For example, widespread open water may need 5 dozen or more decoys sometime. \n\nUsually 3 dozen decoys are more than enough in most situations. They may work more than 100, if properly placed. As we discussed in above simply try to set the pattern in a way that each decoy should have its own appearance while ducks approaching them. \n\nIn marshes, always place groups of decoys and open lading zone nearer 2 u. These groups some time placed at 40 yards to make them visual in dense marshes by birds passing over head. These groups should set in a ways that no adequate landing zone should left around them as an option to decoy landing birds. Landing zone should open near you and insisting birds to sit there. \n\nWind factor will be again vital here, otherwise ducks will cross you with greater speed and shooting may result in loss of many birds in the marshes or koondar. However, it inevitable, you always suffer a good number of ducks especially winger.\n\nUsually, mojo cannot be places at such places due to deep water or bogging but mojo is not that necessary in marshes where birds expected to stay. Your call will do the trick, as soon as birds crosses your spread call them with single quacks or feeding chuckle. Never call birds that are eager to enjoy your guns i.e. in marshes usually your call works at a unbelievable height and birds will respond to your call with closed wings often and reach you like a rocket. \n\nTry never shot highly declining birds, swinging down barrels never results too good. Let them encircle your trap and enjoy shooting.\n\nThese are personal experiences / judgments please, open for debate always.\n\nAs you said u r know to H1, feel free the meet sometime.

Superb.\n\nI liked your unbiased opinions, and it''s my pleasure to have been of assistance to convince you into a great buy. Caracal handguns speak quality.\n\nLet me just come to some main points:\n\n1) The recoil reduction as if compared to the Duty is not only due to the added 95 grams. It''s the ergonomics, gripping comfort and lower bore axis combined, and course the slightly added weight also.\n\n2) The slide lock problem is strange. Try Denovo bro''s prescription and feed back here. \n\n3) The longer trigger reset is now confirmed to be Caracal F specific. This is not so with the C models. They''re perfect. Try shooting a full mag of rapids as fast as you possibly can and video clip it here for comparison to the 15 shots string with the C in my clip. This will confirm the trigger reset delay in the F model, if any.\n\n4) The slide catch release is indeed hard. I agree. Try oiling this mechanism a bit, also from the inside.\n\nIn any case, and wishing you the best of joy with your F, I cannot withhold that my personal choice would have been in the favor of the C model, which is available with traditional sights.

Read a lot of reviews on this gun from this forum and others, some folks on youtube also say that its better then Glock and that it has an excellent trigger comparing to Glocks and that its at par with Walther PPQ. Ak47 bro, a senior member and a seasoned gun enthusiast thinks a world of this gun. So had to see whats all the fuss is about. No doubt after reading all this and watching all the videos on youtube, this gun caught my attention and this itch had to be scratched. But it also meant that i had to give up my Duty in the process. After alot of discussion with Ak47 bro and watching 1000 rounds endourance test by Abaas bhai i decided to go with it. So when i heard that Caracals are available in Lahore i went to Lahore and got this gun. I bought it from PARA for 75k. other dealers were willing to even come down from this price but i got a very good deal at Para by selling my Duty and getting this gun. The first moment you hold a Caracals in your hand you cant let them go. They are very comfortable and the grip is awsome. The C model felt better in my hand then F but i didnt like the Quick Sight system. Sorry Ak47 bhai i really tried ;). Besides i always like full frame guns. The Straight Eight sights also need getting use too. You guys will see in my shooting Pics. Here are some thing i like and dont like about this gun when comparing it with Duty. I dont like the finish on the Slide, its shiny and smooth and its very slippery when you have oiled the gun or ur hands a sweaty. I liked the finish of Duty very much and after 600+ rounds fired no scratches or any sign of wear. But i lets see what happens with Caracal. I like the polymer on this gun, its much better then Cz''s polymer. I doesnt flex when mag is removed and you grip tight or simply its more sturdy and comfortable. \r\nCaracal has a lower bore axis even then the Cz and therefore the recoil is less and the gun is easy to control. I''m comparing it with duty guys, and its my opinion. So relax! The felt recoil also be the case that Caracal F is heavier then Duty and also bigger so hard to conceal. Duty is 700 and Caracal F is 790grams when Duty is 770. Even caracal f is bigger and heavier, surprisingly it has a slimmer profile. Caracal also has more fire power 18 rounds vs 16. Trigger of Caracal is definitely a winner, but it needs getting use too. \r\n\r\nTecnical Specifications:-\r\n\r\nSlide length                                                              178mm\r\nBarrel length                                                             104mm\r\nHeight                                                                      135mm   \r\nWidth                                                                       28mm\r\nWeight                                                                     790 g\r\nCaliber                                                                     9mm\r\nMagazine Capacity                                                     18\r\nGrip Frame                                                               Synthetic\r\nTrigger System                                                         Short Double Action\r\nTrigger weight                                                          2.2 kg\r\n(constant)\r\n\r\nTrigger travel                                                           8mm\r\n(Constant)\r\n\r\nInternal Safety (trigger,                                             3\r\ndrop and firing pin)\r\n\r\nOptional Manual Safety                                              1\r\nCocking Idicator                                                       1\r\nMagazine Catch                                                        Ambiextrous\r\n\r\nThe Box and contents:\r\n\r\nThe box is better made then a Cz''s, you only get the gun along with two mags and a user manual.

Superb.\n\nI liked your unbiased opinions, and it''s my pleasure to have been of assistance to convince you into a great buy. Caracal handguns speak quality.\n\nLet me just come to some main points:\n\n1) The recoil reduction as if compared to the Duty is not only due to the added 95 grams. It''s the ergonomics, gripping comfort and lower bore axis combined, and course the slightly added weight also.\n\n2) The slide lock problem is strange. Try Denovo bro''s prescription and feed back here. \n\n3) The longer trigger reset is now confirmed to be Caracal F specific. This is not so with the C models. They''re perfect. Try shooting a full mag of rapids as fast as you possibly can and video clip it here for comparison to the 15 shots string with the C in my clip. This will confirm the trigger reset delay in the F model, if any.\n\n4) The slide catch release is indeed hard. I agree. Try oiling this mechanism a bit, also from the inside.\n\nIn any case, and wishing you the best of joy with your F, I cannot withhold that my personal choice would have been in the favor of the C model, which is available with traditional sights.

Now that the price has crashed(good for consumers), it will take time to recapture the demand since mentally we all feel that the weapon is bad since price has crashed yet it may not be the case.
