For a variety of reasons, leading being the most number of loads available in 30 06 than any other known caliber in the world, for hunting purposes, 30 06 wins.\n\nNow, if it comes to accuracy then 308 and 7.62 x 51 (NATO) (remember they both are not the same, there are differences though small) are far more accurate than 30 06 as far as snipping is concerned. Following link is just one of the so many saying so\n\n[url]http://www.snipercountry.com/Articles/AccuracyFacts.asp[/url]\n\nAs far as issue of availibilty of 308 rifles is concerned then those who want to keep the rifles for hunting actually prefer 30 06 (for reasons of loads), .270 (flatter trajectory), .300 win mag, 7 mm Mag and so on. Those who want to keep a rifle for SD have no love for either of these including 308 and prefer auto / semi auto on PB License. So in both the cases 308 does not appear prominently. And ther are very few who go snipping and it is only this lot 308 which prefers 308. Aforementioned in view there is a shortage basing on demand and supply rule. And it is not only here in Pakistan, I am searching for a 308 rifle since long and I have tasked my friend in RSA as well, who also says that 270 and 30 06 are available (preowned) in abundance but 308 is a scarcely fpound caliber. In Pakistan also 7.62 x 51 is only manufactured by POF Wah. They also do not manufacture 308, as far as my knowledge goes. 308 is a very powerful round and shot placement is of extreme importance in this case.

Most likely you''ll be issued a computerized DN, prior to the final license, which the dealer will stamp and endorse with particulars of your purchase, then return to Nadra and have your license issued with the weapon as per dealer endorsement.\n\nYet, as mentioned above, too problematic for weapons change.

(88521, ' I want to add some new info which i read and was quite interesting abt the 1911 why it is the best purchase for us..\n\n 	\nTaurus''s PT 1911: A true Testament To The Grand Old 1911\n\nAll parts on the PT 1911 are manufactured by Taurus, including the magazines and the custom-style accessories, and they are specific Taurus configurations and not copies of any other brand-name designs. (Of course, all popular Model 1911 accessories, such as beavertail safeties, triggers, hammers, etc., are very similar in appearance.) Even the Heinie sights on the guns are actually fabricated by Taurus, under license and according to Heinie''s strict specifications. Most of the small parts are manufactured through metal injection molding (MIM), which is a very precise, cost-effective process growing in widespread use throughout the entire world of precision metal parts fabrication in many high-tech industries. Taurus has become a national leader in MIM technology, and OEMs a large number of parts for other manufacturers throughout the firearms industry.\n\nIt is important to remember that in spite of the PT 1911 being an "all-Taurus" product, it is nonetheless a true-dimension Model 1911 pistol in all specifications--which means that a shooter can replace any of the gun''s accessories or components with any other Model 1911 aftermarket parts for which he has particular preference with only the minor fittings or adjustments normally required for installation. At the same time, however, Taurus spokesmen observe that one of the main reasons they believe the performance of the PT 1911 outstrips similarly featured pistols that cost much more is that other manufacturers assemble their "loaded" guns with off-the-shelf parts from various sources without the unified design and quality-control coordination that makes the PT 1911 a truly integrated product.\n\nPut simply, with the PT 1911 the basic gun and all the bells and whistles were designed, manufactured, and assembled under the same direction under the same roof. It makes a difference. Or as Taurus Vice President Bob Morrison wryly observed when I asked him about parts compatibility, "Sure, the other stuff will fit. But if you have a nicely equipped Mercedes, why would you want to switch its drive shaft with a part from Acme Auto?"\n\nA Real Shooter\nWith all this pedigree, it''s almost anticlimactic to say how the PT 1911 shoots--but it shoots well. Face it; the Model 1911 pistol is such a time-proven design, and all of its manufacturing idiosyncrasies have been worked out for so long, that a gunmaker would have to be really bad to screw one up. I had the opportunity to run five varied commercial .45 ACP loads through the preproduction review sample. Thanks to the Heinie sights and a crisp 3.25-pound trigger pull, my first full-magazine familiarization runs fired offhand at 50 feet with Federal''s Personal Defense load printed at about 2.5 inches, which is certainly what I''d expect from any tightly fitted and full-featured Model 1911 pistol. The overall average for all five loads from benchrest at 25 yards was essentially the same.\n\nAll of which leaves us with the question that was on the mind of everyone who saw or heard of the PT 1911 at last January''s S.H.O.T. Show: With its hand-fitted assembly, custom features, and long list of premium-design accessories, how can Taurus possibly afford to sell the PT 1911 at such a low cost? I asked Morrison exactly that question. His answer was thought provoking.\n\nHow''d they know what to do? Easy--Bob Morrison, President of Taurus USA is a former VP of Colt. Yeah, that Colt. Bob knows 1911s and Bob knows what the market wants. The market wants good quality, full-equipped 1911s at an affordable price. Guess what Taurus delivered?\n[b]For Complete article read the source and it is everything and inch abt 1911[/b] \nSource:\n[url]http://www.shootingtimes.com/handgun_reviews/pt_080505/index.html[/url]\n[url]http://www.shootingtimes.com/handgun_reviews/pt_080505/index1.html[/url]', ''),

Now houses a craft or gift friends and family pistol may still be far away from us, then enjoy the first look at the art of craft and technical bar pistol. \n\n    [b]Understand the process Pistol [/b]\n\n\n    Regardless of shape or internal structure, process pistols and military and police pistol have a lot in common because the process is mostly military and police pistol with a pistol for improving the re-creation of the prototype. But their purpose is to carry out their duties. Process pistol is mainly used for art appreciation and collection, generally do not have lethal. Military and police with a pistol used in combat, counter-terrorism and anti-riot. Therefore, the decision of the processes used pistols and military and police with a pistol in the manufacturing and processing, there are many different, process pistol is the pursuit of perfection the art, multi-use hand-carved production and an all-digital processing, and decorative techniques are also rich and colorful, Such as ivory carvings, gold inlay, gold-plated, metal sculpture, inlaid precious stones and so on, are very exquisite craftsmanship. Mainly from the military and police with a pistol lethality, accuracy, reliability, etc. considered by mechanical processing and digital processing technology-based, appearance starting from practical, focusing on ergonomics in order to meet the requirements of combat targets. \n\n\n\n    Process pistol has a long history in foreign countries is the weapon of art and an integral part of the collection, most of them made reference to the historical name of the gun, looks beautiful, exquisite workmanship, reproduced at the time of the scientific and technological level and cultural and artistic style of weapons abroad, many well-known museums are collections there are famous hand-made craft master gun, big gun show in the exhibition is also a single Pi You pocket-sized weapons, for enthusiasts and collectors to exchange, the United States set up a pocket-sized weapons collection and production association. Fans in some countries have their own unique style of production and collection. Such as Germany fans favorite contemporary works, England fans are biased towards the works of classical style \n\n\n\n    [b]Process pistol generally fall into three categories.[/b] \n\n    A category is genuine as the prototype, the internal structure and the same as the prototype gun, according to a 1:1 ratio of refining. Such as the famous 64-type pistol pistols have a variety of processes. Projectiles themselves generally plated 24K gold, set with precious stones, and decorated with classical Chinese Cloisonne flowers and birds, ladies, folk tales and other patterns. Ceremony as the country once it had to go abroad. \n\n    The second category is reduced proportion of pocket-sized according to the original gun craft gun, some parts can all be activities in Dynamic Process guns, its structure and genuine, just a reduced size, the proportion of mostly 1:2-1:4. Some parts can be either static craft activities, guns, mainly used for viewing, the proportion of mostly 1:2-1:6. \n\n    The third category is based on military and police with a pistol gun technology for the ontology. It has all the features of a pistol, but the appearance of the surface treatment using different methods, with artistic, but do not appear bedecked in jewelry, both ornamental and practical. Our country has just launched CF98 is a type of product. \n\n\n\n    [b]Beautiful and practical CF98 [/b]\n\n    At present, although some local areas in the Middle East are still fighting, but peace has become the main theme of world development, pistol military value decreased, and more is seen as a symbol of status and power, collecting fine craft pistols has become to many military Interests or collectors desire, CF98 series of craft pistol (hereinafter referred to as CF98) is to expand foreign markets to meet customer needs more developed. \n\n    Rifle is a 9-mm pistol CF98 based on the re-creation, and in with the characteristics of a military pistol at the same time, but also has a very high artistic quality. It was inspired by 64-style gift craft gun, the gun in the past, single-mode technology has been improved, using a variety of technology tools, developed a variety of craft pistol. \n\n    Gold-type appearance with decorative excellent plating 24K gold, reflects the entire gun distinguished, stylish, elegant quality.

This chrome-plated high chemical stability, resistance to sulfide, organic acid corrosion, salt spray test in the atmosphere and the corrosion resistance than the black surface treatment (chemical oxidation of iron and steel materials, is usually concentrated in a thermal oxidizer carried out in alkaline solution, so that workpiece surface generates a layer of uniform dark blue to black magnetic iron oxide conversion coating, Therefore, steel is also called the chemical oxidation process as "blue" or "black"), a high 4-5 times; hardness is high (usually 500-600HV0.1), reached the hardness of hardened steel, and the friction coefficient low wear resistance. \n\n    QPQ Salt-bath complex known as QPQ-type processing technology, is a new surface hardening modification of fused metal salts, usually the film thickness of 3-8 microns deep black, with fixed gloss, high hardness of the treated metal with minimal distortion. This film not only looks beautiful, but also has excellent corrosion resistance. 45 # steel by QPQ treatment, in the atmosphere and salt spray test the corrosion resistance than the black surface treatment for more than 70 times higher than 16 times higher than chrome, stainless steel is also higher than five times. Its wear resistance is also higher than normal heat treatment several times 3000 made life test shot, the The movement of firearms are not part of a "rub white" phenomenon. \n\n    High Phosphorus Electroless Nickel Plating High Phosphorus Ni + closed treatment, coating and meticulous smooth, gentle tones that people will not feel tired after watching eye.

This isn''t bad.  Since I started reloading, I shoot a lot more for the same amount of money.  Last year I shot 10,000 rounds.  Many competitve shooters shoot more than that.  Some ten times more.\n\nImagine the cost of 10,000 rounds at store prices- if you buy in bulk you can get 1000r nds for $360 US.  That''s $3,600.00 for 10,000 rounds fired.  If you buy by the box of 50, it''s typically around $20 US per 50 rnd box, that''s $4,000.00 for 10,000 rnds.\n\nI can reload a single round for about $ 0.08.  My 10,000 rnds cost me only $ 800.00.  Or about 1/4 (or less) the cost.  I get to shoot 4 times as much if I had bought commercially.  Related to the cost of a Glock $550 US.  I could afford to blow up and replace 5 Glocks and I would still have saved money and still shot 10,000 rounds. (It would simply be sin to destroy 5 Glocks so stupidly)\n\nRelated to Glocks and reloaded ammo, Glock don''t have a fully supported chamber and that chamber will fail (kaboom) when you shoot an sufficiently overcharged round.  The shooter made the mistake of shooting a reloaded round he didn''t personally reload.  This is dangerous no matter what gun you shoot.\n\nWhen one gets good enough, and becomes sponsored then they shoot even cheaper- if Precision Delta sponsors you, you may get all your bullets for free.  If you get sponsored by a brass manufacture, powder or primer manufacturer, then you may get those for free as well.  So yes, we do want to shoot near to free and some shooters manage to do so.\n\nAlso, reloading allows me to tweek the cartridge.  More recoil is harder to shoot fast.  My sport recognizes that and rewards hotter cartridges with more points.  But, it also requires that I have a cartridge that is of minimum power factor.  A smart competitor wants a round that makes the minimum required power for the maximum point scoring.  \n\nFactory cartirdges are more powerful than I need.  So I produce a round that is exactly what I want- one that allows me to shoot faster while still shooting a very lethal round.', ''),

(88616, ' Thanks Steve, as usual detailed and very informative. Yeah, you guyz really manage shooting "free" bro, and course there''s nothing wrong with the reloading if you know the stuff and how to use it.\n\nNow, you''re quite experienced and got an impressive shooting history behind you of 10K rounds a year or so, and sure you know how to deal with it. And with shooting in such larger scale proportions, sure there''ll be plenty of savings for you also.\n\nHere the common man rarely uses his gun, unless in a SD situation or for some celebration occasions! We have very small number of ranges for the enthusiasts and sports shooters, though course, as you know, many of our PG members do shoot a lot, but perhaps not that much that reloading could be of any major gain/savings. Neither do we have the stuff available commercially.\n\nYet, for coming back to the topic, about the Glock Kaboom, tell me Steve, honestly, do you guyz really rate the Glock to any significant level? I feel NO! Heck, over here it''s one highly desirable and boast-able item most people can only dream of!\n\nI''m surprised to see from your post that kabooms are quite normal with the Glock [i]due to partially supported chamber only[/i].

(88652, ' [quote=Munir]What Sir Skeeter 60 suggests is ofcourse the right path. A 1" group is very demanding. But as all such ways are boring to us mortals I suggest a compromise.\nHow about a 50:50 division of the total bullets to be fired that day. 50% the boring way first, trying to get the best possible groups with no time limits. For starters it can be as little as 30%. AND then we go to the fun part of it. Blazing away with the remaining 50 to 70%. But please do look closely at the targets shot at in two different ways.\nThe ''fun'' part must never be missing from shooting sessions. \nBut gradually (and imperceptibly) the focus of fun will start shifting. Believe me it will not be long before hitting a ''10'' would be more fun than going through a magazine in auto mode. Don''t believe me? Just try the stint out for a couple of months. \n\nNow I have no solution for ''dry firing''. The dry fire is soooooooo dry (drier than driest of -----) it really demands a very high level of motivation. It is very important but what should one do about it. \n\nRegards,\nMunir.[/quote]\n\n++1++ Muneer Sahab You said it, I could not have  expressed it in such a convincing manner. \nThe 10 remains the elusive objective. After training for some time one realizes that burning ammo in a frenzy without a goal to achieve is only making nice holes in your pocket without any benefits.  \nA bullet must only be fired with a specific target and a goal/points to be achieved, this will be the best teaching process in itself.  After one is confident in deliberate shooting then one can start shooting 5 shots in 20 seconds then 10 seconds and then 6 seconds and so on.\nShooting at ranges of ten meters is a help but one must shoot at 25 m after a satisfactory level of shooting is achieved', ''),

Those hitting below is bad trigger control (flinching)\n\n\n[img]http://i206.photobucket.com/albums/bb136/sualeh/Guns/DSCN5310.jpg[/img]\nAnother 20 rounds of same ammo, fired from same distance. \n\n\n[img]http://i206.photobucket.com/albums/bb136/sualeh/Guns/DSCN5222.jpg[/img]\nRapid Fire from 25 M, 18 rounds of Chinese Blue Box\n\n\n[img]http://i206.photobucket.com/albums/bb136/sualeh/Guns/DSCN5263-1.jpg[/img]\nAnother attempt from 25 m with POF2Z ammo. Tgt has a bull of 4 cm diameter (1.6 inches) and line to line distance is 2 cm (0.8 inches)\n[b]\nObservations[/b]\n-  [b]There has not been a single stoppage in first 300 rounds. It ate every thing flawlessly[/b] \n-  CZ999 has a very mild recoil, one of the best that I have seen. \n-  The gun is damn accurate as you can see in the results. Bullets going away are my fault :(\n-  Trigger is ok, but not outstanding at the moment. It may further improve when I reach 1000 rounds with this gun. Trigger of CF98 greatly improved after roughly 1000 rounds. \n-  Very easy to field strip and equally simple to assemble. You cant go wrong with it. \n-  Though I have been carrying it in the shoulder holster and denovo sahib could not make out that I am carrying a gun   when I visited him, its not an ideal gun for carry. Too heavy. \n-  The magazine, though looks cheapish, is quite solid in my view. I stripped it and found the parts well made, far better than Chinese magazines. \n-  I have so far not faced any issues with this handgun except that its a bit heavy. But that all solidly made guns are I believe :)\n\n[b]Conclusion[/b]\nIts a quality gun indeed and will last you life time I believe.  We are getting it cheap in Pakistan because of certain import issues which you all know, otherwise by no means its less than any 500-700 $ handgun that you see on the internet.  :)\n\nregards', ''),

(88717, 'Review: CBC Single Barrel Shotgun (Brazil) Here comes a forgotten beauty right out of the box. yes it is a break barrel single barrel 12 gauge made in Brazil by CBC with a 3 inch chamber, 32" Barrel. The great thing about this single barrel is that doesn''t feels a single barrel. the barrel release is located near the trigger guard. the gun is an external hammer. But this is the softest ever external hammer that i have seen so far. the mechanism of the external hammer is not that of the traditional single barrels. usually one has to pull back the hammer in order to load the gun but for this gun you need to push it down. the other safety feature for this gun is that if u accidentally release the hammer before loading it the gun wont fire as the hammer doesn''t hits the fire pin unless the trigger is pressed. the butt stock finish is really great. the fore grip is also a master piece. though it has a barrel of 32 inch but it never seems too long. the gun is designed in a XL category, meaning that when the barrel is 32" the size of the butt stock and the size of fore grip is designed to match that of the barrel. nothing looks ugly on this gun. for a price tag of Rs 17,000 its not a bad deal at all. though of of fashion but it is out class gun. the trigger, trigger guard and the barrel opener are all made of plastic. the quality of the plastic is good. the gun barrel is has a slight reddish finish. above all the gun is proof house tested. the ejector is not at all a problem in fact it is a pleasure. if one has his hand well settled with the gun then the bird never gets away from you. The fore grip has a spring lock that can be removed by simply pulling it.  the recoil is average and the gun is quite lighter.\n[url=http://www.postimage.org/image.php?v=Ts2oxBA][img]http://s2.postimage.org/2oxBA.jpg[/img][/url]\n\n[url=http://www.postimage.org/image.php?v=gx1_u3J][img]http://s1.postimage.org/1_u3J.jpg[/img][/url]\n\n[url=http://www.postimage.org/image.php?v=aVtuRM9][img]http://s4.postimage.org/tuRM9.jpg[/img][/url]', ''),

The target bull is 4 cm diameter (1.6 inches) and distance between subsequent lines is 2 cm (0.8 inch). In the beginning the gun was consistently shooting short for the range though line was ok. \n[img]http://i206.photobucket.com/albums/bb136/sualeh/Guns/DSCN5258.jpg[/img]\n[b]Distance 15 M[/b]. Ammo POF2Z, fired 24 rounds. Adjusted the sight after first few shots and voila :D. You can see a big hole just below the bull (and bull in this target is smaller than the standard bull). \n\n[img]http://i206.photobucket.com/albums/bb136/sualeh/Guns/DSCN5217.jpg[/img]\n[b]Rapid fire from 25 m[/b].

Fired 10 rounds each from Taurus PT99 and CZ999 Scorpion (CZ99 bullets marked in blue circles). PT99 seems to be comfortably winning at 25 m, hitting the bull on many occasions (the difference was not much at 15 m).\n\n[b]OBSERVATIONS[/b]\n-  [b]Not even a single stoppage in over 300 rounds.[/b]\n-  Very less recoil. \n-  Very accurate. Adjustable sights give a tremendous advantage of zeroing the handgun. Moreover, less width of front size tip assists in accurate aiming. \n-  The grip is just ok, could have been better. \n-  For its size (which is quite large), the gun has surprisingly less weight. The frame is made of very light alloy. (CZ999 scorpion and PT99 has almost same weight but a huge difference in size). \n-  Convenient field stripping and assembling, noting technical about it. \n-  Due to its size, the gun is not suitable for carrying. Not a gun for someone who has to keep only one gun for SD and is in habit of carrying it on person also. \n-  A very suitable gun for range and competition shooting in this price range.\n-  Magazines are of good quality. \n\n[b]CONCLUSION[/b]\nIf you need a gun for target shooting, this is an excellent choice in this price range. If you are looking for an SD gun which would be carried also, look for something else. This gun has not been made for that purpose probably. (No problems, however, for personals from LEAs for carrying the gun with uniform using belt or thigh holster). \n\nThe above views are based on firing just 300 rounds (which in my view are not enough to have indepth practical knowledge of a weapon) and are by no means an expert''s comment on PT99. \n\nFinally, I loved shooting with it on the range and love looking at it in my room :D\nregards', ''),

In my view there could be two reasons for it. One, bad trigger control, ie, pressing the trigger a little hard (this is for shooting below). For shooting consistently on the left, I think again bad trigger control. Too much of finger on the trigger, ie, instead of pressing the trigger with distal pad, I think I am still pressing it with the first joint unintentionally. \n\nNow you can conveniently ask that if I knew all this than why didn''t I correct myself :rolleyes:.

Cleaning from the breech side is best done course with the barrel out and gun stripped, which I personally only do after exhaustive shooting.

I believe they''re basically a cleaning item only for the careless shooter who rarely cleans his weapons, used or not used, not even caring for routine maintenance. Otherwise, for a caring owner, I believe they''re mainly extra items in the cleaning kit.\n\nFinally, about Den bro''s gun, sorry I couldn''t quite spot the spots!

Heck, it must have been [i]rigorous[/i] cleaning if so! Den bro, it''s only a barrel, dear, be tender! ;)\n\nFinally, my own  assessment, this wouldn''t affect your shooting at all, can''t say about [i]marginal[/i] accuracy deviation, yet you''re right, how much can it deviate anyhow, shooting already from a 3.25 incher!\n\nFrom Taurus bro''s notion above, it however seems we should inspect the weapons better at times of purchase, though at the stores in those moments, one is more thrilled about bagging up and getting back home fast!\n\nIn any case, bro, sleep well, 98% of shooters wouldn''t even have noticed this minor thing and would just have kept shooting it for ages!

These come easily to mind:\n\nGlock\nSpringfield XD\nSmith & Wesson Sigma\nSmith & Wesson M&P\nRuger SR9\nRuger P97\nKahr\nKeltec\nTaurus 24/7\n\nWhen I google "polymer framers pistols" I learned I had forgot about the H&K P2000, Sig Sauer Sig Pro, Steyr, and learned that Beretta, CZ and IMI all have polymer framed pistols.\n\nOk, the list is getting too long.\n\nI have fired a whole bunch of the Glocks and owned 2 (17,19) and possessed a 17 for about 6 months.\nI have fired the Ruger SR9 and P97.\nI have fired the Springfield XD.\nI have fired the Smith & Wesson Sigma and M&P\nI have owned and fired a Kahr and Keltec.\nI have check out the 24/7, don''t recall if I shot it.\nI have fired a few H&Ks, I am certain one must have been polymer.\nI have fired a Steyr.\nI have shot steel Sig Sauer but not polymer.\nI have fired a metal CZ but not polymer.\nI have never fired an IMI.\nI have fired a metal framed Beretta but not polymer.\n\n[u][b]So, with that up front I would still probably buy the Glock first.[/b][/u]  I like the gun, it''s simple design, it''s dependability and accuracy.  It has a decent array of aftermarket parts available to suit the user''s needs or tastes.\n\nThe M&P would be second,\nThe XD would be third, however...\n\nThe CZ so impressed me I would seek out their polymer pistol before buying the M&P or Ruger.  It could out do the Glock.\n\nH&K and Sig are very well made fire arms and I would never discourage or disparage their products.  If you choose one, you''ve made a good choice.\n\nI would never buy a Ruger P97 or Smith&Wesson Sigma.\n\nI have no strong opinions about the rest.  I was impressed by the Taurus 24/7.  The Steyr was OK, the Kahr was insanely accurate, but the Kahr and Keltec have much too heavy and long trigger pulls for my tastes.', ''),
(88763, ' Thanks all for sympathetic words and advises, so lessons learnt today,\n\n1) dont rush while buying a new weapon, inspect it carefully. Try to disassemble it to have a closer look for the obevious deffects before paying for the weapon.\n\n2) Its always better & safe to approach the barrel from breach/chamber whether its assembled or dis-assembled, whether you are trying to insert a round or the cleaning rod, be safe never face the barrel from the side it shoots projectile out :)\n\n3) Always keep good gun loving/caring friends in hand and pakguns is the best place for that pupose :)\n\nSo brothers am relaxed now and will sleep tight ...

Well, I too do not want to be discrediting the Glock at all, course a man-made item is subject to occasional failures, and you''re right, what''s more popular, also gets more attention in case of such rare failures like with these Glock kabooms.\n\nActually, what I really believed that with the vast variety of guns at your disposal over there, the Glock would not have been the absolute first line choice, when other options like the HK''s and Sig''s were before you, perhaps not even much higher in prices.\nHere, while the Glock prices are already high, the HK''s and Sigs still go for double the prices of Glocks, even more.\n\nAnyhow, nice hearing from you and thanks for obliging above. :)', ''),

(88801, ' Looking at the pictures, I have two conclusions (from the pictures I can''t judge the depth of that dent)\n1- This dented/eaten up is on the land of the rifling, only two reason can cause this kind of chipped/dent inside the barrel, i) this portion remain rusty for a long time i.e. before you bought the gun and when your fired some rounds and cleaned the barrel, the damage is exposed.\n2-  A hard metal jacket i.e. steel jacket type round (usually most local refilled are hard jacket) fired and when the slug moved through the barrel, due to grooving in the process on the metal jacket cause a steel buildup on the slug and due to rapid movement it hardened and scratched the barrel when the buildup was enough.\n\nTo my experience, the cleaning rod can''t cause this kind of damage unless you intentionally hammer it in the barrel (as the \nbarrel inside is too hard for cleaning rod to be chip off), most damage a cleaning rod can do is only insignificantly scratch/\nmark the surface only, if the damage is somewhat deep, it is not due to cleaning, this is my opinion.\n\nBottom line is, as 12gauge told you, it can only effect the accuracy and there are very very low chance of accident if the damage is not too deep.', ''),

However, target or competition shooting is different and our shooting expert Skeeter60 sahib advocates shooting from 25 yds. \n\nAfter carrying out shooting practice as advised by Skeeter60 sahib in Competitive Shooting thread, I have realised that I used to waste lot of ammo in firing without a plan / purpose, just for the hack of it.

Baikal M446 Viking\n2. CZ 999 Scorpion\n3. Taurus PT 92 / 99 \n4. Tanfoglio Viper\n5. Sarsilmaz Klinic 2000\n6. Canik 55 Piranha\n7. Zigana S\n\nAs far as I know, all above pistols meet your criteria except the magazine capacity of +15 rounds. In this regard I would suggest that you keep the reliability, accuracy and ruggedness at the foremost criterion. There is no point in buying a problematic / inferior handgun with a capacity of say 18 rounds because high capacity magazines are available for almost every handgun. Otherwise also, 15 or 17 or 18 rounds does not make much of difference, practically speaking. So IMHO, go for a good quality pistol and buy an extra high capacity mag with it, if you feel its really required. Happy buying bro. :)\n\nBTW: When I bought my Taurus PT99, it originally came with two mags, 15 & 17. I got the 17 rd mag replaced with 15 round mag because it made the grip better when I held the pistol in my hand. So I preferred better grip over two extra rounds. But this priority will differ from person to person. \nregards', ''),

Fired 20 rounds. \n\nExpert comments, Sir :)[/quote]\n\nYou are improving rapidly. Right now your goal should be smaller and smaller groups. I appreciate your dedication, when one has a fire burning in his heart to be a good shot, nothing can stop him. I see the spark in you. Like I said earlier the aiming point for training should not be small even at 10 or 15 m your aiming point should be at least 5 inches or so in diameter. You see you have to focus on the front sight and keep it generally in the center of the blurred aiming point, keeping  the sight dead center of the aiming point is relatively very less important, what is important is positive trigger control and getting surprise breaks with the fullest concentration on the front sight. A small aiming point produces stress on the shooter forcing him to try and center on the small point which is difficult and the shooter ends up snatching or jerking the trigger. If you subtend your index finger of a fully extended hand you will notice that your finger is covering more than a foot or so of the target at 25ms so a slight misalignment  of the sight in relation to the target appears un necessarily large where as in fact it may produce a shot only a half centimeter from the centre. How ever it is easier said than done, one has to convince himself/herself that never mind the little wobble and little off center point of aim it is concentration and surprise trigger release which are important.\nI will take the oppurtunity to introduce to some more finer details;\n\nMINIMUM ARC of MOVEMENT\nWhen one raises his weapon and commences the aiming process, the sights wobble quite a bit and then settle down after 2 or 3 seconds and the wobble is much less; and depending on ones physical / aerobic condition the sights again start wobbling a bit more around the aiming point after 8 seconds or so. \nThis period between the  the 3rd and the 8th seconds or so is the minimum arc of movement. Shots fired in this time tend to be your better shots.\n\nCONCENTRATION\nYou should be fiercely focused on the front sight, you should able to see\n scratches or dust particle on the front sight, you should be able to see the fired case being ejected and smoke coming out the barrel. If you are not seeing these your focus is in- complete. It takes a lot of practice and very few people can maintain a complete concentration for more than 10 seconds at a time after which the concentration starts to waver, try threading a needle several times and you will understand. \n\nFOLLOW THROUGH\n You must  maintain this for a couple of seconds after the shot is released ( fired ) and remain in the stance; this  is known as follow through and will prevent you from reducing concentration or relaxing some muscle of your body just before the shot is fired. While playing tennis, hockey or cricket you must have noticed how the path of the ball is changed with the bat or hockey or raquettes movement after the ball is hit . Restart the aiming process by deep breathing three or four times before you raise your gun again.     \nBREATH CONTROL\nYou must deeply inhale and exhale before getting ready to shoot as this will purge your lungs of carbon dioxide, you will need a lot of fresh air as you will be holding your breath, and I am told when you are concentrating and also holding your breath your eyes and brain consume oxygen very rapidly.\nAfter deep breathing a few times take a deep breath and release some what ever makes you comfortable and your holding of breath and raising of gun should be done in one go so that precious oxygen is not consumed earlier. \nBreathe again at least 2 or three seconds after the shot is released and never before. In case you are firing a RAPID FIRE string you DO NOT BREATH between shots.\nTRIGGER CONTROL\nThe trigger must be squeezed with a positive, smooth and courageous flow, irrespective of the sights position on the target.\nIf you will the trigger by thinking the sights are dead center  your  shot will be thrown off. The trigger must be boldly squeezed and the shot fired between your minimum arc of movement that is between 3 and 8 seconds, your concentration will be very good and breath control excellent, the more you delay; the breath control will dwindle and your brain and lungs crying for oxygen will make you commit mistakes and  your minimum arc of movement will also increase.\nThese are techniques for championship shooting and when one masters these basic techniques one improves combat and fun shooting in a very large measure.\nIf it is not too boring or does help I will  go into other finer aspects and love to see shooters posting tight groups at 25 m with target grade weapons and ammo. Best of luck', ''),

The point I want to make is that the same facility is not available in PT92 (it has fixed sights). Therefore, if one is looking for a range gun, he should go for PT 99 and not for PT92 which has factory adjusted fixed sights, which may not be as per the liking of the firer. :)\n\nIn fact in firing an NIB gun, I found CZ999 Scorpion more accurate than Taurus PT99  :).', ''),

Same kind of large and "balanced" frame do we find with the 1911 model, which, in cal .45 also is one precision gun, though the heavy recoil is for the more experienced shooter to properly control. Both are classical models, indeed and will for sure last another century, perhaps.', ''),

[b]When a loaded magazine is left inside the weapon for more than a few days, the top round of ammunition tends to become deformed from having the magazine spring squeeze it against the closed bolt. This can cause a failure to feed if a loaded magazine is left in the weapon for an extended period of time.[/b]\n\nDen, feel you were right yesterday bro!

In the balance section if you compare with the pistols yes being long barreled its "barrel heavy " but its very different & pleasant shooting this beast than a pistol.\n\nc) As I wrote above it very managable no problem shooting without any support, even single handed shooting is nothing sort of dificult. You can shoot it as many ways as you can shoot a 9mm pistol.\n\nd) Ammo is available (in Lahore atleast :) ) price starts from Rs.65 for Phillipine FMJ ball to Rs.250+ for US JHP''s/heavier grain bullets.\n\n.357mag round produces big deafening bang, quite a muzzel flash and you feel the gases escaping from cylender right on your face, this is the best part I like this gun for as this really makes you feel shooting some beast :)', ''),

If you experienced the hair burning when you accidentally get too close to the fire, ever you seen the black residue? rarely, because the hairs have very negligible difference in melting and boiling(evaporating) point, it evaporates at the same time it melts. So is in the laser applications, laser rises the temperature so quick and so high that it result the melting and evaporation at the same time in general terms.(thats why the cooling system are used with the lasers). But again it depends on the power and usage of the laser.\n\nOn the other hand, if you want to process some thing with [b]"effected surrounding area"[/b], it is kinda personal choice. ;)', ''),

(89023, ' i just read this article on a 1911 forum and found it quite interesting \n\nThere is nothing wrong with Norinco 1911''s you can be sure of that. Here is a copy of a post from a friend of mine who is an engineer in Ottawa that will give you some idea of the quality of the steel in Norincos.\n\n"Allright, well let me first start by explaining a few things about steel in general, including Ordnance grades of steel. Hardness does not necessarily equate to brittleness, that is a function of heat treating and alloy. Even softer steels can crack and be brittle, it''s a matter of how the internal stresses are relieved, or not, by annealing and hardening processes, as well as upon carbon on other constituent elements found in the steel.\n\nAlso should mention, I''m comparing apples to apples, so only the CroMo Colt is being compared to the CroMo Norinco here. The stainless guns have their own quirks (like spalling problems, corrosion resistance benefits, etc.)\n\nIn layman''s terms, the more important characteristics to crafting firearms is the toughness of the steel and modulous of elasticity of the steel. You want steel that is ductile enough to flex at the microscopic level and return to its original shape but hard enough to have good wear resistance and, in higher end guns, be able to take and keep the desired finish without dinging up too easily.\n\nNow if we want to talk about relative hardness of steels, Norincos are made from a different steel formulation than Colts are. Comparing Rockwell hardnesses really won''t tell you much, but as a general observation, on average the Norincos are at least 30% harder on the surface than most other 1911''s, including the Colt. This does not mean they are more brittle - it means that the alloy used to Make the Norincos (5100 tool steel*) results in a much harder surface when heat treated than does the Colt alloy (4140 Ordnance grade tool steel*).\n\n*Although the exact alloy formulations are "industrial secrets", destructive testing done in the USA by the DCM (circa 1997) determined that Colt uses 4140 and the Chinese formulation used in 1911''s and M14S receivers is an exact match to AISI 5100 series steel.\n\nPerhaps this is the time to mention something else about Colts. Colt does not use the same alloy today it used in WW2 and earlier. In WW1, the guns were not even given what we think of today as "heat treating". Those older guns were only spot-treated at high stress areas and today have a rather high incidence of slide cracking using full factory loads due to a number of factors, including metal fatigue, crack propagation, creep, etc. coupled with the fact that vast portions of the slide and frame have no treatment at all. That being said, the steel is very ductile and in the event of failure, it should just bend and crack - not fracture like a grenade. A good thing, but at the same time - these babies should be collected and admired more than turned into a range marathon pistol!\n\nI could get further into heat treating, including annealing, case hardening, gas carburizing, cyanide dips, etc. and the resulting pearlitic and/or martensitic grain structures, but frankly, unless you work in a foundry or have a mechanical engineering degree and understanding of materials science, it would be way too far over everyone''s head so I''ll try to keep this explanation understandable for the average fellow \n\nNow for a short note on Chinese steel "quality". The Chinese are as advanced as we are in Steel production. Is Chicom steel of poorer quality on average on a gross domestic production basis? Yes, absolutely. This is because the majority of China''s manufacturing is devoted to the Wal-Marts of the world at a very low price point, so cheaper steels are generally produced and used for those products. The steel used in their weapons, however, is every bit as up to snuff as North American steel is.\n\nSo now we get into the 5100 alloy Norinco 1911 in particular. 5100 is an EXCELLENT receiver material. It hardens very well on the surface but maintains an adequately ductile core. This gives great wear resistance and great resistance to plastic deformation (deformation that causes the parts to permanently deform or warp). The one achilles heel to 5100 series alloys is that they are notoriously hard to machine. Norinco, I suspect, machines their parts with carbide cutters prior to heat treating. On a finished gun the only way you''re going to cut it with HSS mill bits is if you spot-anneal the steel with a torch first. Most smiths have to buy carbide mill bits to work the steel, and even then there''s a very high tool wear rate. This is probably why so few smiths will do Novak cuts to a Norinco slide - they probably only have HSS tooling!\n\n5100 alloy is, most probably, the alloy most manufacturers WOULD chose to build receivers if tool bits were cheap and labor costs were low. It really does have better end-product properties than 4140 steel does, and it''s also easier to smelt at the steel mill and forges beautifully. Virtually all Cro-Mo guns made in the west that aren''t cast, however, are made of 4140 or other 4100 series alloys. 4140 is an entirely adequate steel for use in guns, it also wears tools at a much slower rate and can still be machined easily after hardening. The Chinese are fortunate in that they make many of the tool steel bits on the market (cheap supply) and lobor costs are very low. This makes 5100 steel actually cheaper for them to use b/c of the lower costs associated with making the steel stock. \n\nAll this to say, you can complain about the design, fit, finish, and economics of a Norinco 1911. But frankly, trashing the steel is a bigotted and unfounded arguement based on ignorance and reliance on the Go-USA writings of most internet experts "\n\nI hope this gives you a better perspective of the Norinco 1911.\n__________________', ''),

It can happen as quickly as 50 rounds in your case.\nThere are 3 ways to correct this:\n\nUse Hoppe Copper solvent, soak barrel for as long as a day, max a week. It is the slowest of all and might not work in some cases. It is the easiest way too.\n\nGet your barrel lapped. Fire lapping or home lapping. For home lapping, Steel wool fine one, as can be seen here in Pak available as utensil cleaner scrubber, can be attached with a cleaning brush utilizing Hoppe Copper solvent as a helper to polish out the bore by repititive storkes (breech side) may take hours until success. Fire Lapping? dont know, you have to ask dealers in Lahore Neela Gumbad Market.. The Pathans especially. I am cent percent sure fire lapping is done here.\n\nThe most quickie of all, is Outers Foul Out Bore Cleaning System you can order on  MidwayUSA under $30 (utilizing brushes and copper + lead solvents) Or the other as best as, option is Wipe-Out Bore Cleaning Foam(Brushless Foaming) under $15. \n\nYou can order them straightaway on the internet and will give you the best shot.', ''),

Does it feel everytime the same when you sqeeze it?[/color]\n\n[b]Honestly did not notice any difference in trigger behavior or pull, it feels same after 300 rounds as it was on 1st.

Feed ramp is specially polished with mirror finish and is same although I use copper brush for cleaning but that finish still standing scratch less.

Round strips very clean and enters the chamber without a micro mm wobble, thanks to mirror polished feed ramp.\nTried chambering the round as you said but did not notice anything out of timing or balance.\n[/b]', ''),

I guess sometimes (and for somethings) you have to see it with your own eyes to become a believer.\n\nKindly accept my apology for not believing you earlier and engaging in a nonsense argument in order to prove my point which was totally wrong to begin with.

(89316, ' An old man using a walking stick is a commom sight. It assists him in keeping balance and avoiding pain. For all friends who like outdoor activity, this very stick can do wonders. I usually carry one when I am not carrying a gun. I have collected about twenty points in favour of the stick. Others may comment on them and add more of their ideas.\n\nUsefulness of using a walking Stick\n\n\n1.	Crossing Nullahs and obstacles by increasing your length of tread. You can step further and securely with a stick .\n2.	Support for hands and improves blood circulation to hands during walk.\n3.	Climbing trees and getting down from trees by providing a support against the trunk and allowing one to reach a higher branch to go up.\n4.	Climbing uphill and going downhill is easy with a stick to support you.\n5.	Clearing brush and thorns to make a passage.\n6.	As a weapon against a wide range of threats.\n7.	Scare away and defence against dogs\n8.	Catch snakes live for study and release.\n9.	Climb walls which are higher for you to negotiate otherwise.\n10.	Investigate holes and explore if any dangerous thing is hiding.\n11.	Break fruit from trees and bushes.\n12.	Relieve weight off legs upto 20 % when you push the stick on the ground with you hands to coordinate with forward movement while walking and climbing a hill.\n13.	Confidence is boosted and you walk boldly.\n14.	Break acasia sticks (kikar miswaq) without injury to your hands from thorns.\n15.	Support to absorb shock if foot gets twisted on uneven ground saving joints from rupture, pain and injury.\n16.	Exploring depth of water\n17.	To make a spear for fishing with a pocket knife.\n18.	With a string and a loop it gives extended reach for a variety of situations.\n19.	Keep your balance while wading in water, uneven or slippery ground and slush\n20.	Gun rest for shooting.\n21.	Try using two sticks together. It gives you the quadruped advantage while climbing or descending, more stability and better weight distribution.\n22.	Makes walking possible even when foot, knee or leg paining due to injury.\n23.	All the above in addition to the traditional role of providing support for old people who find it difficult to walk without it.\nRecommended length for a person is upto chest level. About four feet for 5 and 1/2 foot person.\nMateial for stick in order of priority\n1. Kao ( local name for wild olive)\n2. Cane\n3. Bamboo\n4. Others', ''),

(89329, ' @PsiFactor\n@A.Abbas\nSir I have fired more than 1500 rounds with my CF98 and another 300-400 with CF98s of my friends :) Despite a very light trigger, one gets used to it and there is no problem. But I personally feel that trigger of my CF98 has smoothed a lot after having fired so much from it. Trigger of a newer CF 98 may be a little bit harder.\n\n What I was actually hinting at was that if one has fired a lot from other weapons which have a harder trigger than CF 98 and all of a suddenly picks up a CF98 and starts firing with it, there are chances of surprise shot in the beginning though it will be ok after a while. Secondly, while practicing fire during forward move or while running, chances of surprise shots with CF 98 are always there and it has happened with me many a times. \n\nConversely, as pointed out by Abbas sahib, light trigger of CF98 is a great advantage during rapid fire. In my rating, CF 98 is a very good handgun for rapid fire. \n\nIMO therefore, light trigger of CF98 is not a problem as such, however, one needs to be aware of it specially after firing some other handgun. :)\nregards', ''),

Any view on this? :)[/quote]\n\nGilani Sir, thanks for giving me the opportunity to explain this a little bit in detail. \n\nThe stance that I''ve developed for my satisfaction and comfort primarily revolves around accuracy. How it works is that in order to be accurate one must definitely learn how to control the recoil. In a tactical situation where you have to put rounds effectively and accurately at your target, you will not get the chance to take controlled and timed shots with long intervals. You would have to put the maximum amount of rounds at your target in as little time as possible. What happens is that when you''re shooting in a rapid manner, the barrel tends to lift and automatically change the position of your line of fire and the point is to stay focused on your line of fire. If you''re able to control your recoil, not only will the weapon come back to its original position where you intend it to be, your shots will be more accurate because you''ll develop an automatic mechanism where your hands, your grip and your pistol will start working together and not individually. Your concentration will remain on the target and not on your grip, pistol or recoil. \n\nOne more thing is your grip which should be used while firing in this position. The base grip as you can see (The left hand being at the very bottom of the pistol grip) helps minimize recoil even further. Such a grip is usually preferred when firing bigger calibers such as .45, .38, .357 and .44. But what I''ve realized is that it works even better when used with a 9mm. I''ve held a pistol like that since I was a kid and maybe that''s why I feel comfortable this way, but the reality is that by using the perfect stance for yourself and a base grip, a 9mm shoots fantastically with very little recoil to worry about. \n\nAnd it makes things very accurate as well. I suggested this grip to SlayerJatt a few weeks back when he was having some troubles with his accuracy and line of sight. As soon as he changed his grip and used the one I use, he started hitting the target accurately and even managed to put 2 shots right near the bull in 5 shots. \n\nThe other advantage of my stance cannot be explained here as a "Certain" type of discussion is strictly banned on the forum. :) Maybe in person? \n\nIn the end, speaking of shotguns, this stance also helps develop total confidence in your 12 gauge which by nature, is a very powerful caliber. The benefit you receive while using this stance as a Shotgunner is that your feet stay firm on the ground and there''s less chance of you taking a step back because of the recoil. Once again, in a tactical situation when you''re armed with a shotgun, you should be in total charge of your weapon and the only movement which should occur while firing a 12 gauge, should stay within your upper body (Torso) and arms. \n\nHope that makes sense as its nothing out of a text book. :)', ''),

(89538, ' Here you go\n\n[quote=shahsaeen]An air rifle is a big package of fun if used wisely. I will not recommend giving it to youngsters until they develop a sense of responsibilty and maturity of thinking.\n\nWhat i mean is that one has to treat it with respect just like anyother firearm. If you dont treat it with respect it can cause you and your loved ones around you irreparable harm.\n\nWhile handling it make sure the safety is always ON only just before you shoot turn it OFF, Never point it at anyone or anything that you dont want to shoot at even if it is empty, while loading keep your finger away from the trigger and safety ON otherwise if fired in that position the barrel can hit you with tremendous force in the face or if you happen to put your finger at the break point (where the barrel breaks from the frame) can result in cut fingers. \n\nI am right handed, to load i place the Buttplate at my hip region and with gun pointed at an angle to my body using my left hand (grasping the solid end of the frame, no where near the trigger) and the Safety ON. I then grasp the end of the barrel with my right hand and load it. Then i put the pellet in using my right hand and then return the barrel to the earlier position again using right hand. All this time the gun is held solidly against my body with my left hand. In this position if the gun was to fire my right hand would have controlled the barrel hitting my face and during this entire action my fingers are no where near the breaking part that might have caused them to be cut in two.\n\nNow that the gun is loaded always point it in a direction where if the pellet was to be fired no harm would be done. You have to make a habit of using your brain quite often. You have to think each time before shooting at an intended target. You have to always plan for what if the pellet does not hit the target and what will happen if it hits the target. You should know ahead of taking your shot what will happen. For example when i shoot i look at what is behind the target (a mud wall or a concrete wall or a brick wall or a tree or a bush, a rubber tire) these are just a few examples and all will give different results like the mud wall will absorb the pellet in itself, the concrete wall will cause it to ricochet at tremendous speed, the brick wall will cause less speed ricochet, a tree if it is hard wood will cause tremendous high speed ricochet, a bush will let the pellet pass (now what is behind the bush?), a rubber tire will again cause high speed ricochet. \n\nNow with the speed and type of ricochet expected we will have to predict the angle of deflection. It is just like putting a ball in a hole at a game of pool or snooker. Remember Newtons law every action has an equal and opposite reaction. For example you hit a concrete wall at an angle of 45 degree from the left side it will deflect the pellet with speed towards the right at an angle of 45 degree. So you understand if you fire at the wall standing in front of it the pellet will come flying towards you (what if it hits you in the eye?).\n\nAllah swt has given you only one set of eyes so always wear eye protection. Not the ordinary glasses but polycarbon glasses. They are tough and will not shatter they are also used in bullet proof glass as layers. I got mine from Shaheen traders for Rs.1,500.\n\nAlso always make sure the people around you know you are shooting and ask them to move over if you feel the pellet can come there way.\n\nNow i hope you understand why this low powered air rifle when compared to gamo shadow is best for use inside home, and in city. The limit of ricochet can be judged and the possibility of overkill minimised. Overkill is if the pellet does not hit the target it can travel at lethal speed and hit something behind it like a man passing on the road. Or the pellet can pass right through the targets body and hit something behind again at lethal speeds.\n\nNow if i had the same gun in .17 caliber instead of .22 the pellet would have generated more speed therefore the possibility of high speed ricochets and overkill would have been more.\n\nAlso .22 is more suitable for hunting because .17 pellet is only useful if you make a head shot. if you take a body shot the pellet will either pass through and the animal will run away or if you are lucky the pellet will hit a bone. With .22 a head shot will work and the body shot will put the animal in a state of shock and you will have time to put another pellet into it. Also it will penetrate and stay inside the body of the victim.\n\nANOTHER IMPORTANT THING LEAD IS POISONOUS, can cause CANCER and IMPOTENCY. Do not touch your face or eat anything while shooting with your hands. Always wash them thoroughly after shooting.[/quote]\n\n\nLink :  [url]http://www.pakguns.com/forum/viewtopic.php?pid=62367#p62367[/url]\n\n\n\nPlease note that the third para above comprehensively addresses the risk of fingers getting cut as mentioned in earlier posts above.', ''),

(89554, ' I was writing on EAR PROTECTION and found this already covered here. I want to emphasize the importance of using ear protection for firing a rifle or pistol as it causes permanent and irreversible damage to the ears. The defence forces do provide for protection of soldiers, but as mentioned the macho effect rules, and protection is ignored, having disasterous consequences. Ear plugs are the simplest method of protection and easy to use and carry. Ear muffs come next. If these are not available, use a roll of cotton rolled tight according to size of ear. Using some vaseline with the cotton gives better protection.\n     Ear plugs were hard to find here but are now available in large quantities and at very reasonable price at METRO Lahore.

Please dont mind the incompleteness of my input, if there remains any :)\n-  I bought mine from a shop which is next to next to PARA in Lahore (Sorry, cant remember the name). I paid 2600 and that I think was the lowest price offered. \n-  Please do inspect the sights and other body parts. These guns did have QC issues. First two guns that I inspected had deformed sight (yes, in an NIB gun). The third gun was ok.\n-  There is no place to check the gun by firing a pallet. I had to dry fire it, keeping the muzzle towards ground and just estimate the power; not a sure method though. I am not aware if there is any place on the roof of the plaza where one can test the air rifle for power and accuracy.  \n-  I bought a tesco scope and probably 8 pack of Afghani Diabolo pallets (100 per box). Pallet box was Rs 75 each, scope was 1500. Could not find Gamo Magnum pallets though Gamo match were available in Rs 250 (200 pallets). The performance and power of Afghani pallets is fairly good. So far, my son has been able to hit three ghugis and all three went down in a second (he has missed many though :))\n\nThe other difficult process was zeroing the scope. Initially it was hitting about a meter away and I had to play a lot with the adjustment screws. Once zeroed, the gun was quite accurate. \n\nI hope I have not missed anything. If there is anything else, I will be glad to answer \nHappy buying :)', ''),

(89629, ' Today i looked around the marketplace for a low priced high power air rifle. I looked at the B3-1 but found it lacking in terms of safety. I could not convince myself to buy it.\n\nFirst the air rifle does not have any safety lock mechanism. Second you put your finger in harms way everytime you load the pellet. Third the mechanism is held in place by some tooth like rail inside the steel cylinder (what if it wears off with time and when you realize this has happened you would have already lost part of your finger).\n\nTherefore i settled for a well finished local made break barrel air rifle. I did not get the sargodha made as it lacked rear sight adjustment from right to left i must say it was powerful but perfect zeroing can be a problem for shots going a little right or left.\n\nAgain the break barrel does not have a safety lock mechanism but what is the worst that can happen the barrel hitting you in the face. I find a bloody face better than a finger cut in two. The china B3-1 is like having a snake as a pet one wrong move and you will regret it.\n\nUsing an air rifle is full of excitement once you start it is hard to stop (hunting or target practice) you get tired at one time or loose your concentration. Therefore it is not good to leave your fingers safety in hands of LADY LUCK.\n\nThe choice is yours.', ''),

(89722, ' @Faheem.........Thanks bro, you''re welcome. :)\n\nWell, I think, unless your friend raises his budget, the CF-98 would be the preferred choice. Btw, speaking of Akdal, on my recent visit to Lahore, I came across the MKA 1919 shotgun. I''m still quite inclined towards it, it''s priced at 90K there, but a phone call today to Buksh Ellahi kind of "dampened" my desire for it, since they plainly said they don''t buy any more items from [b]Akdal[/b] coz the "Ghost", despite of good and appealing looks was a total failure amongst customers!\n\nI, somehow, am of the opinion that Akdal firm only focuses on the "appearance" of their items, less about the functional use of them! Visibly the Akdal MKA 1919 is one wonder-piece, you may assess it from an independent thread by me, but despite of hectic surfing since past few days, have still not come across ONE review of it worldwide! Enough about Akdal, they got a lot to make good for in order to gain back market confidence.\n\n@Acidzero8..........Bro, hope you''re clear too now! All "Tr''s" are basically the same, may have been improved by now, but I feel they have basically lost the market over here.\n\nI personally believe, as SA bro also remarks, Stoeger is THE choice in Turkish handguns.

The small scope has been mounhted very low in the barrel to minimize effect of trajectory.

Hope i will get away with my skepticism about the  NIB accuracy of this gun. Sir, anything that flys out of the black at 15M cannot be put in the account of the gun. Accuracy of the firearm or the ammo is measured by the size of the group fired through the gun. If we want to compare a group of 7" with another group of 5 1/2" at 15M, in my opinion we must be short of data to draw conclusions.

I''ve always insisted upon "never buy a budget firearm with eyes closed". always check each and every part, always check and ensure that all parts that fit together offer a perfect or a near perfect fit and specially check the "zero" of the rib with the receiver.\n\nAnyways, a small misalignment of the rib with the receiver is pretty acceptable (+- 1mm to 1.5mm)as we are talking about a budget gun. if they start giving you everything perfect then it wont remain a budget gun. on a similar note, you cannot expect a perfect budget product. heck! its a budget-buy so some sort of a compromise is always in order (or given).\n\nAnother thing we must understand before judging Russian firearms quality is that they allow 5% manufacturing tolerance which is a pretty huge figure for any firearms manufacturing industry. reason is that Russians strongly believe in RELIABILITY/DURABILITY of firearms and are always more than willing to sacrifice FINISH/LOOKS for the sake of those two highly sought after features.\n\nbottom line is that you can always expect misaligned ribs on Baikal shotguns. to be honest I''ve even seen misaligned ribs on some of the more expensive brands of shotguns. a little bit of misalignment is always forgivable if you understand that you are getting other things in that same package that are far more beneficial.\n\nnow how do we go about it. a friend at my club complained about the same thing and found that a fiber-optic bead totally solves this problem. u''ll focus more on the bead and less on the rib. that is the actual objective to begin with. the rib only guides the eye to the front bead and should only look like a dim grey line/shadow chasing the front bead (shooter''s perspective). so it shouldn''t bother you in aiming but for some reason if it does, you can always install a fiber-optic bead on it.\n\nRegards.', ''),

Anyhow, the business at hand is to compare two different looking but actually the same gun by the same company.\nBasically, in semiauto shotguns this is the most successful (number of sales and satisfied users all over the world confirm this statement) semiauto shotgun ever made. These guns(Urika 2 gold and teknys stonecoat gold field) are basically same in working. These are based on AL391 platform. This is a problem free platform. Although, Bretta is on the spree of introducing new platforms like SV10 in O/U and now A400 for the semiauto segment. If you can hold your self from buying(that in your case is sometimes quite difficult) we can have another great gun for comparison Beretta A400 Xplore Unico.\n\nFor these guns, here is my input:\n\n1- Both guns are same in working having same platform.\n2- Both guns are same in purpose i.e for upland hunting.\n3- Both guns have highest finish in respective finish class i.e Urika and Teknys.\n4- As it is said "Beauty lies in the eyes of beholder" , so, everyone will have one''s own darling, but my vote goes in the favour of the stonecoat gold.\n5- Beretta markets Teknys gold as a premium gun over Urika gold.\n6- Teknys Stonecoat is better protected against corrosion having special treatment.\n\nFinally, about the problems with the stonecoat coating of the Teknys. I have a Teknys Stonecoat Gold for last three years and felt no problem in working or the finish.\n\nBeretta A400 Xplore Unico.\n\n[url=http://www.postimage.org/image.php?v=gxl2kM0][img]http://s1.postimage.org/l2kM0.jpg[/img][/url]', ''),

(90024, ' [quote=12gauge][b]for those who think turkey was chosen on account of lower labor/production costs.[/b]\n\nmy dear friends, first and foremost rule of outsourcing, never ever drop the name. ever wondered why beretta is made in italy/usa but not in turkey. beretta owns the stoeger plant, and it stops there. stoeger plant manages/makes money/generates profit and returns it back to beretta, thats it folks, that it.\n\none more thing: beretta also owns benelli. are you guyz following me?, when KFC owns Dhaba Fried Chicken in Pakistan it doesnt mean that Dhaba friend chicken will now produce KFC quality chicken. its absurd. from strictly economics point of view, trust me, i''ve studied economics all my life, what beretta did with stoeger is not outsourcing, it simply bought a cheaper company to capture the low end of the shotgun market.\n\nabout turkey making parts for beretta/benelli and other huge names: well lemme tell u this, Service cheetah shoes are exported to UK at 60 pounds a pair. u get the same shoes here at 1000 rupees a pair. both are totally different in quality and there is a strict factory monitoring that the export quality dont endup in local market. what i mean is that in obligatory contracts, where large sums of money and hell of a law suits are involved quality is totally different and does not/should not match in-house brand production.\n\n[b]for those who think turkish guns are more durable than Russian[/b]\n\nthere was a test in Italy sometimes back, I dont have the video anymore. search the internet and u''ll find it. in that test, they tried several brands of european and american shotguns, they fired the individual shotguns to point of failure. guess which one came on top?\nit was the ugly russian tank, Baikal. Beretta, Remington, Winchester and many others failed at less than 20,000. in case of a Baikal, the test was stopped cause they couldnt destroy the gun even at 50,000 rounds. dont even ask me about turkish guns, they all failed at less than 10K rounds.\n\n[b]for those who think turkish guns are made as per european standards[/b]\n\nIts quiet funny, do u know turkey is not even a signatory to CIP. their guns arent even proof tested,   still they write "barrel tested at 1200 psi" on their barrels when there is not even a single proofing house in whole of turkey. CIP are the foremost, infact the only comprehensive gun safety standards in europe and turkey isnt a signatory to it but yet they are made as per european standards, who are they kidding?\n\n[b]About Baikal[/b]\n\nRussia is a signatory to CIP. their barrels are proof marked, CIP proofing tests are carried at Izsmash/Izhvesh (execuse my spelling) proofing house which is the largest in Europe. Just look at their barrels and u''ll see the insignia of the proofing house. on Baikal its an arrow inside a triangle, its stamped on every baikal barrel wether its a semi auto or over and under. Tulas are also proofed at Tula Proofing house.\n\nits an absolute shame when people compare Russian guns to Turkish. Turkish gunmaker rip-off customers by giving them better finish, better looks, better handling, lighter weight and customers go crazy, its even more shameful how dealers have turned the masses blind by flashing their eyed with shiny shotguns.\n\n[b]remember: all that gliters is not gold[/b]\n\nRegards.\n\np.s. if anybody feels like discussing the durablity comparison of Russian and Turkish shotguns, i''m available and can talk all day. I''m can even compare the guns mechanically.[/quote]\nhi i like the way you describe the facts \nkindly explain different  and which is better between over and under and repeater thanks', ''),

(159690, 'Review: The Small Wonder CZ RAMI (Lots of Pictures); Review: The Small Wonder CZ RAMI; I would like to start off by saying that the CZ Rami is the simply the best sub compact the world has ever seen. I adore it, love it and sleep with it under my pillow.\n\nI had been looking for a subcompact for quite a while and the only decent option that I had was the Glock26 which I was reluctant to purchase because of the idiotic price of 350k. Then the Rami came along and ''shot'' the 26 a new one. \n\nThis gun is simply marvelous, it is solid, well finished and a joy to handle. I bought the D version which comes with a decocker and Tritium night sights. The magazine holds 10 rounds and with 1 in the chamber, the gun carries 11. It comes with a firing pin block and the trigger is above average. Barrel length is 3 inches and the Rami weighs 695g which is about 140g heavier than the Glock 26. The pistol is DA/SA.\n\nShooting the Rami is a real pleasure, the felt recoil is quite low for a gun with a 3 inch barrel, the rubber grips feel great and shooting it even with the two and a half finger grip is very comfortable. \n\nAs for accuracy, within the first 50 rounds I shot a two inch group at 10 M. That is just phenomenal for a sub compact. I was so amazed that I forgot about the review and started a one on one competition with it and the Canik 55. At 15 M I shot a 3.5 inch group with the Canik and a 3 inch one with the Rami ! I was almost embarrassed to be shooting better on a gun I had not even fired 100 shots on compared to one (with a 4.7 inch barrel) that I shot 6000+ on.\n\nThen I started to torture test it with limp wrists, rapid fires, loose grip, double taps, dirty ammo etc. It passed all with flying colors, NO FTE''s or FTF. \n\nI fired a total of 300 rounds though it of all kinds of ammo and it ate up everything flawlessly. My main concern was that since this is a subcompact and meant for self defense carry, compatibility with all kinds of HP ammo was a must. I am happy to report that it shot every variety of HP''s I fed it reliably.\n\nThe Rami is a wonderful wonderful piece and I would also like to say while Glocks are great friends, CZ''s are simply life long love affairs. Get one.\n\n\n[IMG]http://i262.photobucket.com/albums/ii99/AbbasMalik/Rami6.jpg[/IMG]\n\n[IMG]http://i262.photobucket.com/albums/ii99/AbbasMalik/Rami1.jpg[/IMG]\n\n[IMG]http://i262.photobucket.com/albums/ii99/AbbasMalik/Rami2.jpg[/IMG]\n\n[IMG]http://i262.photobucket.com/albums/ii99/AbbasMalik/Rami3.jpg[/IMG]\n\n[IMG]http://i262.photobucket.com/albums/ii99/AbbasMalik/Rami4.jpg[/IMG]\n\n[IMG]http://i262.photobucket.com/albums/ii99/AbbasMalik/Rami5.jpg[/IMG]\n\n[IMG]http://i262.photobucket.com/albums/ii99/AbbasMalik/Rami7.jpg[/IMG]', 'Review: The Small Wonder CZ RAMI'),

(159689, 'Review of CZ 75 Tactial Sports by Skeeter60; Review of CZ 75 Tactial Sports; CZ Tactical Sport\n\nThis gun is primarily designed for IPSC and speed and practical shooting matches.\nIt has a barrel length of 5.4 inches, it has very good match type sights which can be drift adjusted for windage.  The elevation can be changed by changing the front sight if the point of impact needs  to be lowered (Needs a gunsmith who knows what he is doing) If the point of impact has to be raised then carefully filling the front sight a little at a time will do it. \nThis type of sight is fool proof and adjustable sights on match guns of 9mm or bigger calibers sometimes fail because of heavy and sustained use of full power rounds.\nThe trigger is Single Action only and set at under  1000 grammes, it is adjustable for back lash and free play and to some extent the weight of pull and sear engagement, one screw is visible on the trigger and the other is visible after removing the slide.\nIt is extremely accurate; how ever I am taking some time to become fully used to the trigger which is light and very good; it has some creep but I hope it goes away with use other wise I will try to polish some trigger parts which is a job only for those who know what is to be done. The trigger parts are case hardened and under the hard skin these are soft; therefore only polishing with a stone or a 1000 grit paper with oil on it should be used.\nI do not consider it a carry gun, because of its Size, Weight and light Trigger; how ever for Match Shooting it is wonderful.\n\n[IMG]http://i262.photobucket.com/albums/ii99/AbbasMalik/TS2.jpg[/IMG]\n\n[IMG]http://i262.photobucket.com/albums/ii99/AbbasMalik/TS1.jpg[/IMG]', 'Review of CZ 75 Tactial Sports'),

Anyhow, the business at hand is to compare two different looking but actually the same gun by the same company.\nBasically, in semiauto shotguns this is the most successful (number of sales and satisfied users all over the world confirm this statement) semiauto shotgun ever made. These guns(Urika 2 gold and teknys stonecoat gold field) are basically same in working. These are based on AL391 platform. This is a problem free platform. Although, Bretta is on the spree of introducing new platforms like SV10 in O/U and now A400 for the semiauto segment. If you can hold your self from buying(that in your case is sometimes quite difficult) we can have another great gun for comparison Beretta A400 Xplore Unico.\n\nFor these guns, here is my input:\n\n1- Both guns are same in working having same platform.\n2- Both guns are same in purpose i.e for upland hunting.\n3- Both guns have highest finish in respective finish class i.e Urika and Teknys.\n4- As it is said "Beauty lies in the eyes of beholder" , so, everyone will have one''s own darling, but my vote goes in the favour of the stonecoat gold.\n5- Beretta markets Teknys gold as a premium gun over Urika gold.\n6- Teknys Stonecoat is better protected against corrosion having special treatment.\n\nFinally, about the problems with the stonecoat coating of the Teknys. I have a Teknys Stonecoat Gold for last three years and felt no problem in working or the finish.\n\nBeretta A400 Xplore Unico.\n\n[url=http://www.postimage.org/image.php?v=gxl2kM0][img]http://s1.postimage.org/l2kM0.jpg[/img][/url][/quote]\n\n@h jamshad sahab after buying abbas shotgun partidges hunt may start at klr khar and khushab area next comming season:)', ''),

Recently I had a TT custom made in Stainless steel ( [url]http://www.pakguns.com/forum/viewtopic.php?id=3805[/url] ) and now wanted to experience the different variants available in our market.  \n\nThe most commonly available ones are:\n\n1). Local (Price range 6k to 15k)\n\n2). Chinese (16k to 30k)\n\n3). Serbian (25k - 33k)\n\n\nHaving placed all side by side I can honestly say there is no comparison in Fit and Finish of the Serbian Zastava with the Chinese or Local offerings. The Zastava is as well finished a TT as they come. The M57 has no external safety but does have a magazine disconnect, the parts are well put together and I did not need tools to disassemble it. The trigger is crisp, mags hold 9 rounds and the longer grip makes for a more comfortable fit in my hands. \n\nBelow are some pictures, I will post the range review after the weekend InshAllah.\n\n\nBtw I got tired of taking Studio type pictures, these pics were taken in a light mood and focus on the TT sterotype. Hope you guys enjoy them.\n\n[img]http://i262.photobucket.com/albums/ii99/AbbasMalik/ZastavaTT0_resize.jpg[/img]\n\n[img]http://i262.photobucket.com/albums/ii99/AbbasMalik/ZastavaTT1_resize.jpg[/img]\n\n[img]http://i262.photobucket.com/albums/ii99/AbbasMalik/ZastavaTT2_resize.jpg[/img]\n\n[img]http://i262.photobucket.com/albums/ii99/AbbasMalik/ZastavaTT5_resize.jpg[/img]\n\n[img]http://i262.photobucket.com/albums/ii99/AbbasMalik/ZastavaTT4_resize.jpg[/img]\n\n[b]\nThe Three most popular items in Pakistan :D[/b]\n\n[img]http://i262.photobucket.com/albums/ii99/AbbasMalik/ZastavaTT8_resize.jpg[/img]\n\n[img]http://i262.photobucket.com/albums/ii99/AbbasMalik/ZastavaTT6_resize.jpg[/img]', ''),

This is a much smaller target than the standard one (cant take a large size printout from my computer). \n[url=http://www.postimage.org/image.php?v=aVQ_AfS][img]http://s4.postimage.org/Q_AfS.jpg[/img][/url]\n[url=http://www.postimage.org/image.php?v=Pq6banS][img]http://s3.postimage.org/6banS.jpg[/img][/url]\n\nI normally dont fire a handgun from 50 M. Just wanted to check my pistol''s accuracy (and off course own skill also) from slightly longer range (50 M). Fired 10 shots each from Taurus PT99 and CZ999 Scorpion from 50 M. Here is the result :)\n\n[url=http://www.postimage.org/image.php?v=TsqoK4S][img]http://s2.postimage.org/qoK4S.jpg[/img][/url]\n[b]Distance 50 M[/b], Ammo POF2Z. The bullets encircled in red have been fired with Taurus PT99 where as bullets without a circle have been fired from CZ999 Scorpion. You can see the bullets sprayed all over the target but still staying within 32 cm (9.1 incehes) circle. All bullets of PT99 hitting the target but no group formed. 2 bullets of CZ999 hitting inside 6 cm circle and only one bullet hitting outside the 16 cm (6.4 inches) circle, again no group formed. One bullet missed the target completely which certainly is my fault. \n\n[url=http://www.postimage.org/image.php?v=Tsqph_S][img]http://s2.postimage.org/qph_S.jpg[/img][/url]\nSame target. Pic taken from a different angle.\n\n[url=http://www.postimage.org/image.php?v=TsqpOqJ][img]http://s2.postimage.org/qpOqJ.jpg[/img][/url]\n[b]Distance 25 M[/b], Ammo POF2Z, 20 rounds fired with CZ999 Scorpion in a set of 10 each. Ist 10 rounds encircled in red. Bulk of the bullets hitting within 8 cm  (3.2 inches) circle, few bullets however going on the left. \n\n[url=http://www.postimage.org/image.php?v=Pq672Z0][img]http://s3.postimage.org/672Z0.jpg[/img][/url]\nSame target.

Ist 10 rounds encircled in red. Bulk of the bullets hitting inside or just close to 6 cm (2.4 inches) circle but two bullets, one on the top and the other on the bottom of the target just flying away and spoiling the whole effort.

(90419, ' Dear Gilani, your shooting is good, keeping in view the weapon you are using. You should not expect it to shoot better than 4 to 5 inch groups at 25m.\n MASTER EYE.\n If you keep both eyes open and smartly raise your right hand and cover an object at some distance from you  with  your index finger. Then keep your finger there  and close your left eye, if your index finger is still covering the object your master eye is the right eye.\nIf when you close your left eye,  you find the object not covered then close your right eye and see if your finger  is covering the object ; if it is, then in this case your left eye is the dominant or master eye.\nRepeat this simple test two or three times to confirm.\nUsually RIGHT  handed people have their RIGHT  master or dominant eye. How ever there are people who are right handed but their dominant eye is the left eye, this condition is known as ipsi lateral eye sight and they have to either convert to left handed shooting or cover their dominant eye with a patch or wear glasses with the appropriate eye glass  opaque.\nIn our society we find very few people who are left handed as since child hood left handed children are forced to do things with their right hands . Shot gun shooting is a real pain for the ipsi lateral shooters how ever pistol and rifle shooting has means to correct the condition.\nReflex shooting a pistol in a life threatening situation the dominant eye will take over no matter what.\nPeople must train with the same hand as the dominant eye.\nGilani I hope i am able to explain the issue', ''),

For cleaning the firing pin channel used a plastic straw (that comes with juices or cold drinks etc) to blow from the face after putting some cleaner on.\n\nKept the piece in standing position (face up) for about 10 minutes, blew it using all the strength of my (well abused) lungs & electric blow dryer, wiped everything clean with  cloth, jolted the piece 2-3 times cleaned with cloth again and piece was ready to be lubricated.\nLubricated with gun lubricant, putting drops to each & every spring, moving part, hammer, hammer catch, firing pin spring that means lot of lubrication to the whole mechanism, used cloth to reach the narrow areas making sure nothing is left oil-less :) \nCleaned oil from the areas suppose to touch wood (of stock), assembled the gun and went to try it :) below are the photos after cleaning,\n\n\n\n[URL="http://www.postimage.org/image.php?v=gxrbPN9"][IMG]http://s1.postimage.org/rbPN9.jpg[/IMG][/URL]\n\n[URL="http://www.postimage.org/image.php?v=gxrbShi"][IMG]http://s1.postimage.org/rbShi.jpg[/IMG][/URL]\n\n[URL="http://www.postimage.org/image.php?v=gxrbXgA"][IMG]http://s1.postimage.org/rbXgA.jpg[/IMG][/URL]\n\n[URL="http://www.postimage.org/image.php?v=gxrc1fS"][IMG]http://s1.postimage.org/rc1fS.jpg[/IMG][/URL]\n\n[URL="http://www.postimage.org/image.php?v=gxrc3L0"][IMG]http://s1.postimage.org/rc3L0.jpg[/IMG][/URL]\n\n[URL="http://www.postimage.org/image.php?v=gxrc8Ki"][IMG]http://s1.postimage.org/rc8Ki.jpg[/IMG][/URL]\n\n[URL="http://www.postimage.org/image.php?v=gxrcber"][IMG]http://s1.postimage.org/rcber.jpg[/IMG][/URL]\n\n\nChecked the gun shooting total 15 cartridges (5 from over & 10 from under barrel) no problem of any sort :) but feeling sorry for the flying eagle got killed in the course of this testing & excitement  :(', ''),

The fact is, anything would work till the time one is practicing regularly. If there is a significant gap in practice (which comes every now and then), all learning seems to be undone and one goes back to square 1, ie, his natural instincts. Now, my right eye has gone a little weak due to which I face problems in these adjustments. However, one can find solutions always if the nature of problem is well understood. \nThanks and regards', ''),

(90502, ' Took the M57 to the range today and fired about 100 rounds. It was quite a different experience from firing 9mm''s. A little more kick and lot more noise. \n\nI did not experience any misfires and the gun is generally comfortable to shoot, it''s decently accurate as well. I did face some feeding problems initially but that was cured with loading the magazines a little more carefully. The rounds have to be facing up, if the projectile end is facing down then they will not feed properly.  Generally tapping the magazines lightly on a hard surface after loading (much like smokers do before opening a pack) corrects the stack alignment. Regardless I did not have to take the magazine out or anything except rack the slide, so it''s not a major issue and overall the pistol is reliable. \n\nThe surprising fact was the case ejection, cases were flying 20 or 30 feet away from where I was standing. Excellent ejection and working flawlessly. The strikes on the primers were solid and centered. The 9 round mag cap makes the grip a little longer and making it easier to hold. The pistol itself much like the 1911 has a slim profile and natural pointability. The trigger is better than average and I think it will get better with use. \n\nHave to say that the .30 is as ''badtameez'' a round as they come. After firing 100 rounds of it I couldn''t shoot anything 9mm at 15m. Below is today''s target, shot at 10M.  I did not really change targets today as I was concentrating more on testing the pistol for reliability rather than accuracy. After today''s shooting session I think after 300 rounds the pistol will not disappoint in both departments. \n\n\n[b]The first mag of 9 shots.[/b]\n\n[img]http://i262.photobucket.com/albums/ii99/AbbasMalik/ZastavaFirstMag.jpg[/img]\n\n\n[b]The Target after 75 rounds, two mags on rapid as well[/b]\n\n[img]http://i262.photobucket.com/albums/ii99/AbbasMalik/ZastavaFinalTarget.jpg[/img]\n\n\n[b]Primer Strikes[/b]\n\n[img]http://i262.photobucket.com/albums/ii99/AbbasMalik/ZastavaStrike.jpg[/img]', ''),

(90696, ' Salams, today I had a chance to do a quick review of the Norinco NP 44 which is a Chinese clone of the 1911. I''m surprised no one has reviewed it at PakGuns as yet, I only took a casual look at it to add to what I thought was a previously existing review. \n\nThe gun itself is of average build quality, heavy and thick. It is chambered for .45 ACP and holds 14 rounds, while that may sound like a lot of power, the added magazine capacity takes away from the 1911 what was it''s amazing natural pointability and easy to grasp thin grip. The double stack makes the grip annoying ''phat'' so much so that I could not reach the slide realize with my thumb ! The back sight is good but the front sight is a little thin making one strain to align the sights.\n\nI shot a couple of rounds though it and firing and ejection was okay, felt slightly more recoil than the Taurus 1911 which was surprising since this is the heavier gun. The safety is ambidextrous but not comfortable at all to operate, it does move up to lock the slide but does not click into place immediately the way it should, requires some force. This will result in mistakes and accidents with it as users will think the safety is on whereas it will only be half way. Safe to fire however works fine and can be easily done using downward movement of the thumb. The grip safety also seemed a little iffy. \n\nNorinco has drilled holes in the trigger to perhaps make it lighter, which is amusing because that would have made little difference to an already heavy gun. The trigger is average and will take 2/3 shots to get used to. The pistol itself is decently accurate. \n\nBelow are some quick pictures I took at the range, I was also shooting my Taurus 1911 today so could make a fair comparison.\n\nThank you very much to [b]Omer[/b] for lending me his gun. \n\n[img]http://i262.photobucket.com/albums/ii99/AbbasMalik/NP44.jpg[/img]\n\n[img]http://i262.photobucket.com/albums/ii99/AbbasMalik/NP441.jpg[/img]\n\n[img]http://i262.photobucket.com/albums/ii99/AbbasMalik/NP442.jpg[/img]\n\n[img]http://i262.photobucket.com/albums/ii99/AbbasMalik/NP443.jpg[/img]\n\n[img]http://i262.photobucket.com/albums/ii99/AbbasMalik/NP444.jpg[/img]\n[b]\nNotice the thickness of the magazine and grips in the next two pictures.[/b]\n\n[img]http://i262.photobucket.com/albums/ii99/AbbasMalik/NP445.jpg[/img]\n\n[img]http://i262.photobucket.com/albums/ii99/AbbasMalik/NP446.jpg[/img]\n\n[b]A couple of shots at 10 M.\n[/b]\n[img]http://i262.photobucket.com/albums/ii99/AbbasMalik/NP447.jpg[/img]', ''),

Thanks for sharing very practical tips, I am learning a lot from your posts. :)\n\nHaving said this, I would personally say that any alteration in the original design must provide some significant advantage to the user and needless to say, must be flawlessly executed. You see, magazine is a very important part of a handgun and any problem in magazine, may be a very minor one, can have fatal consequences at that crucial time when you need the gun to function flawlessly. \n\n[b]I would therefore ask this question from everyone that what significant advantage are we getting by increasing the magazine capacity by 3 rounds? Is that advantage worth taking the risk of altering the original magazine of the handgun?[/b] \n\nPersonally speaking, my answer would be no. In 99% situations I think, 15 rounds would be enough and if at all there is a need to carry more ammo, extra magazine(s) is the answer which would straightaway increase the capacity by 15 rounds with each extra magazine. I would therefore not like to change any original mechanism of the handgun at the cost of something which has limited significance. This, however, is my personal view. Others can share there views on this  :) \nregards', ''),

(90879, ' The NP44 is an average pistol in my opinion, I think it''s more of a Hybrid experiment rather than anything else. Living in Pakistan .45 cal cheap handguns are an oxymoron since the .45 round itself sells for Rs. 70 +. That means in less than 700 shots you spend more on ammo than the gun itself is worth. Ofcourse anyone not fond of firing and only using it for home defense might find it useful to have 14 rounds of .45 in hand. The only problem is occasional shooters keep the same handgun for home defense and carry. Carrying the NP44 requires that you have a healthy breakfast in the morning before you leave home :)\n\nI have a personal preference for the Taurus 1911 as I think it''s better than any other 1911 variant under 300 K or 1000 USD. I had many opportunities to change my Taurus with a Colt or Remington made 1911 and I did not even think about it. I believe the only comparable and better pieces 1911''s are customs jobs and made and tuned by companies such as Para ordinance, Kimber, Les Baer etc. InshAllah soon HJ will be getting a high quality 1911, then we''ll be able to see what a high quality 1911 really is. \n\nGuns should be judged on their finish and performance rather than what is written on the slide.

(91006, ' Since long I had known that I am a right hander with a left master eye but it never bothered me much because I was generally shooting ok. In fact a couple of times I tried to change my firing hand but after a half hearted effort, left it as a bad job. I was never into competitive shooting and was happy in breaking a few bricks & bottles and rapid firing 15 bullets in 6 or 7 seconds and spraying them all over the target or making a 4 inch group from 100 M with rifle G3 which would fetch me full marks. That was good enough for me.  \n\nRecently, when I started shooting on proper match targets, I realised that I have problems being consistent and in hitting the bull. I sought advice from the experts and was lucky to find top experts, specially Skeeter60 sahib who finally advised me to change my shooting hand. The same advise was given to me by Denovo87 and Malik1 sahib also but I had somewhat brushed it aside by saying that I cant change my shooting hand in this age :|\n\nWhen Skeeter60 sahib said that I must give it a try than I finally decided to change my firing hand. Made up my mind and went to the the range. First shot from 15 M was in the bull, that gave me confidence. Fired another four and this was the result ......\n[url=http://www.postimage.org/image.php?v=TsBFKVJ][img]http://s2.postimage.org/BFKVJ.jpg[/img][/url]\n\nExuberant, fired another five shots and again, I was quite ok...........  \n[url=http://www.postimage.org/image.php?v=aV2SwsA][img]http://s4.postimage.org/2SwsA.jpg[/img][/url]\n\nThis is the closeup of the same fire \n[url=http://www.postimage.org/image.php?v=Pqio3i9][img]http://s3.postimage.org/io3i9.jpg[/img][/url]\n\nFired another five and .................\n[url=http://www.postimage.org/image.php?v=TsBG8S9][img]http://s2.postimage.org/BG8S9.jpg[/img][/url]\n\nAnd finally, fired another five shots, making it a total of 20 bullets on the target. Overall, scored 186 / 200. This is how the target looked like ....................... \n\n[url=http://www.postimage.org/image.php?v=gxAv9kJ][img]http://s1.postimage.org/Av9kJ.jpg[/img][/url]\n \nNow this was absolutely marvelous. Felt quite happy and took out my NIB Norinco NP22 and fired 20 shot with it in 4 sets of 5 each, scoring 174 / 200. This is the target.............\n[url=http://www.postimage.org/image.php?v=gxAvZIJ][img]http://s1.postimage.org/AvZIJ.jpg[/img][/url]\n\nNP22 was not as accurate as CZ999 but still it was ok. Fired another 20............... some of the bullets going far off but few bullets making large holes in bull area\n[url=http://www.postimage.org/image.php?v=PqipwAr][img]http://s3.postimage.org/ipwAr.jpg[/img][/url]\n\n[b]So guys, after shooting for more than 25 years with right hand, I have change my firing hand today and I feel great about it.[/b] [url=http://www.mysmiley.net/free-confused-smileys.php][img]http://www.mysmiley.net/imgs/smile/happy/happy0005.gif[/img][/url] [url=http://www.mysmiley.net/free-confused-smileys.php][img]http://www.mysmiley.net/imgs/smile/happy/happy0005.gif[/img][/url]  [url=http://www.mysmiley.net/free-love-smileys.php][img]http://www.mysmiley.net/imgs/smile/jumping/jumping0036.gif[/img][/url]\n\nI understand that change of shooting hand means change of so many things. Its not just standing 15 M away from the target and firing with full concentration. It is much more than that and I will have to work hard to un-learn some of the things and than practice new ones . However, I am sure it would be ok. \n\nThanks a lot Skeeter60 sahib, Steven Cline and Hassan Jamshed sahib. Your guidance has been focused and easy to follow. Simply top of the line.', ''),

(I tried to overlap some pictures of relevant part to understand the functionality in single view and to minimize the over crowding)\n\n[b]1- Specifications of B3-2[/b]\n\nOverall Length = 40.5 in\nBarrel Length = 18 in (including pallet chamber)\nWeight = 2.8kg without scope\nPiston Stroke = 45mm (1.77in)\nPiston Diameter = 25mm (1in) Aprox (Cylinder outer Dia - wall thickness)\nUnable to measure the power of the Spring because it is too powerful for me to disassemble/remove and reassemble it without necessary tools.\n\n[b]2- Safety and Tests[/b]\n\nTrigger pull is blocked unless the cocking lever is 95% close (chamber 99% close)\n\nDrop tests from 4ft hight with gun cocked while i) cocking lever locked in position, ii) in 90% position, iii) in 50% position.(gun didn''t go off in all three positions).\n\nAlso shot the gun while cocking lever is not fully seated in the position (to check if you accidently get your hand or fingers between cocking lever and the barrel and guns go off), lever reamins in the position with some minor movement not enough strength/power or movement to cause any injury.\n\nFor simulation of wear (sort of) and trigger spring damage, I removed a pin which keeps the trigger in position (stops/limits the trigger pivotal movement) and tried to cock the gun, it don''t cock and goes off as soon as you take off your hand from the cocking lever. \nAnd it is my opinion/understanding that the gun will not lock with the damaged trigger spring and worn out locking mechanism. \n\n3- Muzzle velocity was not measured because unavailability of the necessary equipment for the moment (factory specs 600/650 fps)\n\nTo my understanding, the cocking system is simple as you can see in the pictures, trigger assembly consist of three parts, Trigger lever, Trigger spring and Piston Lock, in the cocking process the piston lock moves for approx 3mm with the piston and seats in the slot, the trigger spring push the lock in position and locks the trigger edge against the piston lock lever edge simultaneously, the locking slot on the piston slot and piston lock are shaped opposite with some angle and a hump on the piston lock acts as pivot (in my opinion this type of locking causes less wear on the part as compare to 90deg locking slot) and the trigger lock/release is also designed semi round (not sharp edges to wear or chipped easily), trigger pull pushes the piston lock forward, because of angular slot, the piston lock moves down simultaneously with forward movement and this releases the piston.\n\nConclusion/my Opinion on the safety .\nIn my opinion and few non technical tests I preformed, the gun is safe and not a finger slicer as feared by some members, but as for every powerful gun (fire arms or airgun) that can cause serious injuries, all necessary safety precaution must be practiced by every user as accident can happen and has happened with all safety systems in position and in my opinion it can be only and surely avoided by users caution not by the mechanical systems only.\n\n \nHere are some pictures\n[img]http://i931.photobucket.com/albums/ad156/abbas437/PakGuns/B3-2%20Airgun/assembeledanddisassembled.jpg[/img]\n\n[b]1- Weight and Length[/b]\n[img]http://i931.photobucket.com/albums/ad156/abbas437/PakGuns/B3-2%20Airgun/WEIGHT0.jpg[/img]\n[img]http://i931.photobucket.com/albums/ad156/abbas437/PakGuns/B3-2%20Airgun/LENGTH0e.jpg[/img]\n[img]http://i931.photobucket.com/albums/ad156/abbas437/PakGuns/B3-2%20Airgun/BARRELLENGTH0.jpg[/img]\n\n[b]2- Bore/Caliber[/b]\n[img]http://i931.photobucket.com/albums/ad156/abbas437/PakGuns/B3-2%20Airgun/CHAMBER0.jpg[/img]\n\n[b]3-Trigger, Cocking/locking system[/b]\n[img]http://i931.photobucket.com/albums/ad156/abbas437/PakGuns/B3-2%20Airgun/CLYNDERLOCK0.jpg[/img]\n\n[b]4- Trigger Pull Safety On and Off postion with the relevent cocking lever position[/b].\n[img]http://i931.photobucket.com/albums/ad156/abbas437/PakGuns/B3-2%20Airgun/LEVERPOSTRIGGERSAFE0.jpg[/img]\n[img]http://i931.photobucket.com/albums/ad156/abbas437/PakGuns/B3-2%20Airgun/TRIGGERACTIVE0.jpg[/img]\n\n[b]5- Piston stroke/displacement[/b]\n[img]http://i931.photobucket.com/albums/ad156/abbas437/PakGuns/B3-2%20Airgun/CLYNDERDISPLACMENT.jpg[/img]', ''),

I have no hunting or gun story to tell you but what I am about to tell you one day  might save  a life of your brother or your loved one.\n	Heart attack is the number one killer in the world. It can strike any time, any where \nand any one.\n\nSigns and symptoms of Heart Attack\n\n1.  Severe crushing chest pain. Pain is most severe and it is not like  any other pain. It feels like an elephant is sitting            the chest. The pain radiate to your left arm, neck, or jaw. The pain is prolonged and can be mistaken for heart burn.\n2.      Perfuse sweating, and impending doom.\n3.      Nausea or vomiting is common.\n4       Skin is often pale and cool to touch.\n5.      Heart beats faster, combines with anxiety  restlessness, and weakness.\n	You have one hour to reach the hospital. Cardinal rule is that all chest pain must be taken seriously. If not the victim goes into shock and will loose consciousness. The heart stops and breathing will stop in few moments too. This is the time to initiate  Cardio Pulmonary recitation otherwise called CPR. CPR is usually be done by a trained person. Actual CPR is sophisticated but is simple and needs training . Now what If such trained person is not available? \n	Here is simplify version of CPR.  If you find an already an unconscious person, then shake the person and  ask him if he is O.K. If no response, yell for help and tell the person to call an ambulance. ONLY ONE person must call for an ambulance otherwise everybody will be calling and that \nwill cause chaos. \n         YOU MUS STAY CALM at all times. Then lay the victim down on some firm surface. Place your ears close to the mouth of the victim and listens carefully see if the person is breathing. If not , put your mouth on the nose, closing the victim’s mouth with your hand and give two quick but forceful breath which must rise the victim’s chest. If chest does not rise tilt the neck backward and then try it again. Do not waist your time with breathing because person still has enough oxygen in the blood. \n Now put your ear at the chest and listen to the heart beat. Take your time to make sure that heart is beating, if not go to the next step.\nSit besides the victim on your knees, lean over the chest and , place one hand’s heal  just a little bit lower   than the nipples and place the other hand on the top of your hand. Begin pushing  1-½  inch  the chest ribs about 60 times per minute.   After every 10 compressions, return to hear breathing, no breathing then give one quick breath, return to compression. Continue CPR until you restore the breathing and the heart beats or the ambulance arrives and paramedics take over.  \n         Thousands of people are alive because someone performed CPR on them. My Plea to all Pakgun. members is to learn CPR and First Aids. I say this because nature of our activities demand such measures. If you can save just one person’s life then  you have just achieved the biggest task of your life and \nyou are a hero.\n\n\nP.S.

A tight group away from the point of aim, in my view, means two things. One, the firer has done well but there is a problem with the sights. Two, the firer has done the things right but his point of aim was a little off. If the problem is the first one (sights) than I would not prefer to use that gun, simply because with that gun there is a chance that despite doing everything right, I might still miss the target because of the gun :)\n\nBy the way, this was the only tight group that I made with NP22.

(91179, ' [quote=Gilani]Any freshwater angler around ?? :rolleyes:[/quote]\nIt seems there is none :(\n\n\nWas discussing my angling passion with Denovo sahib who asked me to post a few pics. Also, wanted to share something different which might change the taste. :)\nI understand there aren''t many anglers around therefore I will give the local and scientific name of the fish in the pic. What you see here is all fresh water fishing which is quite different from salt water fishing. Generally speaking, fish size in freshwater is much smaller as compared to saltwater, which implies that a 5 kg fish is just a routine catch in saltwater but a prized one in freshwater. Secondly, most fish in saltwater are carnivores whereas in freshwater 60-70 % fish are herbivores. Accordingly, the catching technique also differs. Well, here they are ............ :) \n\n[img]http://i206.photobucket.com/albums/bb136/sualeh/DSCN0029_145.jpg[/img]\nThis is the King of Pakistani freshwaters, the Golden Mahseer (Tor putitora). Known to be one of the hardest fighting freshwater fish in the world, its a prized catch for any angler. Alas, the king of freshwater is already an endangered specie in Pakistan. As a rule, I release all mahseer, regardless of the size. This one was too badly hooked and died immediately. Happens to be the only mahseer in last few years that I have brought home for eating, though I have caught many. \n\n[img]http://i206.photobucket.com/albums/bb136/sualeh/DSCN0030a.jpg[/img]\nA beautiful Brown Trout (Salmo truta fario) caught from Chakarkot Nullah , 60 km from Gilgit. Trout are renowned for their acrobatic fights and are un-undoubtedly the best tasting fish in Pakistan (only when consumed fresh)\n\n \n[img]http://i206.photobucket.com/albums/bb136/sualeh/DSCN2426.jpg[/img]\nA 3 kg Gulfaam (Cyprinus carpio carpio) caught from Mangla lake while fly fishing in Feb 2009. \n\n[img]http://i206.photobucket.com/albums/bb136/sualeh/DSCN2625.jpg[/img]\nMy sons are my fishing partners. Here is Zain with his biggest catch, a 5.25 kg Gulfaam. It was hooked, played and landed by him alone.\n\n[img]http://i206.photobucket.com/albums/bb136/sualeh/DSCN2764.jpg[/img]\nHaider with a 2.5 kg Singhara caught on a live bait (a live small fish tied to a hook)\n\n[img]http://i206.photobucket.com/albums/bb136/sualeh/Picture263.jpg[/img]\nMy youngest son catches a cute one like him\n\nLike hunting, angling also has its own ethics and norms which must not be violated by all mature anglers. Its not merely a meat collection activity (so should be all hunting trips). In this regard, one of the main differences in hunting and angling is that a hunter knows what he is shooting at and can make choice to shoot or not to shoot. An angler normally does not know what is inside water and therefore, many a fish that are not intended to be caught are hooked. As per angling ethics, all fish undergoing their breeding activity, all small size fish and all fish over the bag limit must be released back into the water. This is called Catch & Release or simply, C&R. In foreign countries, many locations are C&R only. \n\n[img]http://i206.photobucket.com/albums/bb136/sualeh/DSCN4054.jpg[/img]\nHere is a baby mahseer released to grow to full size\n\n[img]http://i206.photobucket.com/albums/bb136/sualeh/Picture006a.jpg[/img]\nAnd a 5 kg female rohu released during breeding season \n\n\n[img]http://i206.photobucket.com/albums/bb136/sualeh/Picture014.jpg[/img]\nKids are also to be taught to follow the same ethics\n\n[img]http://i206.photobucket.com/albums/bb136/sualeh/Picture237.jpg[/img]\nDuring fishing trips, there is enough of time to relax and ponder upon various issues in total solace\n\n[img]http://i206.photobucket.com/albums/bb136/sualeh/016.jpg[/img]\nKids can take along a book and study\n\n[img]http://i206.photobucket.com/albums/bb136/sualeh/Resizeoffisd006.jpg[/img]\nReady to be grilled :)\n\n[img]http://i206.photobucket.com/albums/bb136/sualeh/Resizeoffisd005.jpg[/img]\nHere it goes, 20 minutes and yummmmm.

I think that the most muzzle velocity one can get from a Chinese or Pakistani airgun in .22 caliber is 350 - 400 fps on consistent basis over 1000 shots.\n\nThe Chinese .22 B2-1 that I currently have has half the penetrating power that the Gamo Shadow (.22) has.

(91259, ' I congratulate you for introducing such an important subject to all who like to travel and explore the wilderness, and can be faced with situations where immediate medical help is not available. There are some observations which I would like to correct and give my version.\n1. CPR stands for Cardio Pulmonary Resuscitation.\n2. You NEVER close the mouth with your hand. You do Mouth to Mouth resuscitation by pumping your breath into his lungs and at the same time you close his nose with your two fingers if you do not have a nose clip. You NEVER TRY TO BLOW AIR INTO HIS NOSE. Please review you post so that viewers are not misled into a wrong action. (Put a light filter like muslin cloth or a handkerchief on the victims mouth to stop germs from flowing either way.)\n3. Before pumping air you have to open the air passage by tilting the head backwards. This is very important, otherwise the effort goes waste and air will not reach the lungs completely.\n4. After giving two breaths into the lungs, sit beside the patient to pump his chest as you have said, but you have to do 30 pumps or depressions and again give air twice by the mouth.\n5. If patient revives, go to the procedure listed below, otherwise keep repeating this procedure till the one of the following conditions are met\nFIRST: Victim is revived\nSECOND: Doctor arrives\nTHIRD: Victim is pronounced DEAD\nFOUR: You are tired. If another helper is at hand he can take over.\nThe reason for this  procedure is that without supply of oxygen to the brain, the victim will suffer brain death in 3 to 4 minutes. This pumping of air will ensure that some oxygen continues to reach his brain. If you are evacuating the victim to hospital on a stretcher, this procedure should continue.\nREVIVAL: As soon as the person revives and resumes breathing, never leave him in that condition. Turn him over to his side, and folding his upper leg, place it so that the inside of knee touches the ground. One arm to be folded under his head, like a pillow and the other placed forward resting on ground, so that this position is made stable. The victim is most likely to vomit after revival and in this position the vomit will flow out of the body. Otherwise if lying straight, the vomit will fill his mouth and get sucked into his lungs, thereby further complicating the situation.\nIn case where services of Rescue 1122 are available, call them first giving them nature of casualty and location before proceeding with the procedure.\n            I have undergone a basic life support course with Rescue 1122. They are a dedicated lot doing a wonderful job, and always ready to help.   They also train volunteers in first aid and emergency life support.', ''),

(91296, ' [quote=Dr Hanif Malik] fish hunting is much easy then other but it is more boring when you spend many hours and final pack up with out single fish[/quote]\nDr sahib, Sir how it is easier than other hunting if one goes back without a single fish after many hours :)\n\nSecondly, I assume you actually mean [b]Angling[/b] and [b]not fish hunting[/b]. Let me define the two so that we are on one grid. \n\nFish hunting is basically hunting the fish (mainly for commercial purposes) through any means.  There are many methods but most common is by laying the nets in the water. Other methods which are getting popular nowadays are by poisoning the water and by giving high voltage electric shocks through high power generators. Both methods are quick and easy because in very less time, they not only kill all the fish in that area but also kill all other living things in the water. So one can collect the fish and let other dead things flow away. Certainly, entire ecosystem is destroyed in that area. This practice is illegal and highly un-ethical but unfortunately, is still going on un-abated. So basically in fish hunting, we are talking about meat collection in quickest possible time. \n\nAngling is a sport in which a person catches fish by using rod, reel and line. It is played under laid down rules and a set of ethics. An angler uses techniques which do not make the fish helpless but give it full chance to avoid the bait or breakaway if she can. Angler subdues a fish through his skill and takes home only that much which is within bag limits. If he hooks a juvenile (young fish) or a breeding fish or manages to catch more fish than what is required, he takes out the hook and releases the fish back into the water. [b]Meat collection is not the purpose in Angling.[/b] \n\nI am an angler and can only discuss those things with you that pertain to angling. As for your comment that it is boring, well Sir, the notion of boring and interesting differs from person to person. For some it may be very boring and for others it may be the best enjoyment in the world. :)\n\nNow Sir coming to your point of doing duck shooting and fishing together. It is possible but difficult. Both activities need total focus of hunter or angler. Division of effort at two places may result in neither being able to catch fish nor shoot ducks. You can do both on one day but not at one time. If you leave your fishing rods un-attended and go duck shooting, you might end up loosing your rod if the fish is a big one and most probably, fish will un-hook herself by the time you come back. So I would advise one activity at one time. What one can do is go duck shooting in the early morning and settle for angling afterwards.  \n\nFor angling, you would need a rod (starting from Rs 500 and going up to 2000 US $), a reel (again, starting at Rs 300-400 and going up to 1500 US $) and line (50-2000 Rs per roll) and few hooks that are cheap. For a starter, a reasonably good fishing set would cost around Rs 3000. But as one grows expert in angling, he shifts towards buying specialized equipment which costs more. Than for every technique, one needs a different kind of gear. Angling is a very specialised sport nowadays. I would suggest you visit some angling website (there are hundreds of them) and read a little about it, if you are really interested in venturing into this field. However, I will be glad to provide any assistance that I can. :)\n\nregards', ''),

The stance should be natural and should not take extra effort or attention of the firer. If you dont feel any strain and can tilt your head without any extra effort, go ahead. This is my view, however, experts can give their comments to clarify the issue. :)\n\nregards', ''),

This article was a crash course for those who are not familiar what to do in such life threatening situation. The actual training you and I went through took 8 hours theory plus practice. This is not possible to carry on via internet nor I wanted to train in this way. This article was based upon 911 Emergency telephone contact to the lay person who was calling for help. The steps were adopted from 911 operator or dispatcher manual in the USA.\n	Mouth to nose recitation carries less danger to the rescuer, also the air you breath into the nose do not leak to the stomach, plus it is easy and carry less danger to rescuer for contamination. I carry one way mouth peace mask which most of the people are not going to bother nor they carry 4X4 a peace of gauze to protect themselves.\n	My objective was to explain to lay people what to do if they are not trained in CPR. Further, my objective was to bring CPR and First Aid procedures to the attention of people like you who can help promote such procedures.\nYou are correct what have you stated. Once again, let me add I skipped many detail about the procedure which would have required on site training and that would have been beyond the scope of this article. \nThanks again.', ''),

For me, whether  it is angling or hunting, without following a set of ethics and without maintaining a balance, it soon turns into [b]zulm[/b]. Once in a blue moon, we all get a chance of a bounty hunt and on that day, we can catch / hunt as much as we want. That is the time when we need to exercise restraint on ourselves which in fact all mature hunters do. We should only take that much home which is reasonable. But unfortunately there is a large number of meat collectors around as well who claim to be hunters. If given an opportunity, they will kill everything in the area and feel very proud of it. IMHO therefore, everyone who carries a gun is not a hunter and similarly, every one who carries a fishing rod is not an angler.

They are decent enough performers for light use as I have personally never heard of anything going wrong with anyone''s Turk Shotgun. Talking of Germanica btw I once caught a shopkeeper try to selling two gun noobs a Germanica for a 115 K convincing them about it being made in ITALY under GERMAN supervision, I was shocked at how much he was trying to rip them off as that was clearly a Turkish import. Btw the original Germanicas were made in Italy under Germanica license before it was discontinued as a model. The Turks bought the failed label and stuck it on every half decent shotgun they manufactured.\n\nThe difference between about 95 % of Turkish imports is the accessories.

(91692, ' AoA Everybody\n\nAfter the "mag floor plate" episode, I was looking to take this whole customizing thing up a notch. so, the first thing that came to my head was customized grip panels. so after quiet a bit of research and pulling a lot of strings in the process, I got the grips made out of buffalo horn. believe me guyz, buffalo horn feels awesome in one''s hands. it has a very natural clinging feel to it. far better than cheap plastic (dead and lacking character) grips.\n\n[b]RIGHT GRIP[/b]\n[img]http://i998.photobucket.com/albums/af103/12gauge-pakguns/Image0167.jpg[/img]\n\n[b]LEFT GRIP[/b]\n[img]http://i998.photobucket.com/albums/af103/12gauge-pakguns/Image0166.jpg[/img]\n\n[b]RIGHT GRIP IN SUNLIGHT[/b]\n[img]http://i998.photobucket.com/albums/af103/12gauge-pakguns/Image0168.jpg[/img]\n\n[b]LEFT GRIP IN SUNLIGHT[/b]\n[img]http://i998.photobucket.com/albums/af103/12gauge-pakguns/Image0170.jpg[/img]\n\n[b]RIGHT GRIP CLOSEUP[/b]\n[img]http://i998.photobucket.com/albums/af103/12gauge-pakguns/Image0172.jpg[/img]\n\n[b]LEFT GRIP CLOSEUP[/b]\n[img]http://i998.photobucket.com/albums/af103/12gauge-pakguns/Image0171.jpg[/img]\n\n[b]Acknowledgement[/b]\n\n1. Mr. Hameed Chadda Sb. of News Stainless Industries. dont have words to express my gratitude as he totally diverted his workforce to do this grip making job which took 8 hours of hard manual work to complete. not to mention some of the guys were called in late to do the polishing.\n2. Denovo87 bhai for his company and expert advise (constant guidance would be more appropriate way of saying it) during the Wazirabad trip. without his help it would have been impossible for me.\n3. Moeen Bhai for his constant support and Ideas. without him, I simply cannot undertake such projects cause I know in a SHTF scenario, I can always run to him to get my A$$ out of trouble.\n4. Mr. Ashfaq of Stainless Industries, Wazirabad. the man who basically did all the work.\n\n[b]WHAT I''VE LEARNED:[/b]\n\n1. stag (deer horn) might look good but it has a hard feel to it. not worth pursuing in my humble opinion\n2. Camel bone also looks good and has a good feel to it. however to make extremely thin grips you run the risk of cracking or chipping it.\n3. buffalo horn is the best material for handgun grips. wow! it has a very natural clinging feel to it. not only you grip it, it also grips you back. very soft and leathery feel.\n4. the grain in bufflo horn grips look awesome in sunlight. it is sorta multicolored. very classy. and only works best when bought to a full shine using buffing machine.\n5. grip making is a P.I.A. job. took us 8 hours of grueling hard work. yes! me and Denovo Bhai were both knees deep in work too.\n6. CZ 999''s grips are extremely difficult to make. its not just a flat panel, its a functional part of the frame. its skeletonized and lots and lots of channels built under it to facilitate movement of springs and sprockets.  \n7.  customized grips totally change the characteristics of a handgun. i''m not talking about cosmetic changes. a good grip, a natural material grip, totally alters how you feel when you grip the handgun.\n8. custom grips are a must if you want to truly enjoy a handgun. plastic grips installed by the manufacturer are a P.O.S. they are only used because they are cheap to make and are quick to mass produce.\n\nRegards.', ''),

Thus overall 15K+40-50K!\n\nThe Baikal unfortunately is not available in 18" barrels, unless you literally "saw" it off, second the looks are not quite appealing.\n\nAs regards "robustness", well, for someone requiring it for security concerns, with occasional use only, I believe the Turk will still last long enough.\n\nHowever, I agree with you, if your primarily purpose is hunting, on rugged terrains, climate, excessive and regular shooting, sure the Baikal should be considered in that case. I believe Naveed had something on the lines in the preceding para in his mind, when he decided for a Turkish one. :)\n\nI''ve considered the Stoeger as well, they have excellent models, like the P-350, etc, even with "recoil absorbing" features in the butt-stocks, but of lately it wasn''t available neither here nor in Lahore, and I''d consider it for sure, only problem is they only come with fixed stocks. The security type they have to offer, is, for me, unfortunately pump-action only.\n\nAs regards the Hatsan Escort, pump or semi, well, indeed it''s one nice alternative, and I do still have it in my considerations as well, especially because it has 3"/76mm chamber and can therefore take the heavier loads, which the Germanica can''t, but then it doesn''t have any rails nor the finishing of this one, so, as you can see, it''s really a hard choice for most of us, we''ll get something in one type, also have to sacrifice another thing simultaneously. :)', ''),

Stick therefore to the Russian ones and Chinese as well, if available, for the more habitual use of slugs.\n\nWhy not use a good load of SG/LG, 00 Buckshots, etc, nice to the gun, nice to your shoulder, nice to the pocket as well! ;)', ''),

(91781, ' Dear Friends,\n\nI''m pleased to be back after a long absence of many months. As usual, I was busy traveling around & guiding expeditions & hunts & just returned home. \n\nI would like to share some new photos of my hunts and also paste some old photos for many new members who joined after I last removed my threads. \n\nKindly note, all the following hunts are legitimate hunts duly authorised by the Govt of Pakistan against hunting permits issued by the provincial wild life departments plus royalties & generous donations paid by our hunters to the local hunting communities. None of these animals were hunted by me, rather, all these trophies were shot by our esteemed foreign hunters.\n\nQuestions & comments are welcomed but please DO NOT use my photos without my permission !\n\nHave Fun !!!\n\n[img]http://i560.photobucket.com/albums/ss46/pakistanguides/himalayan_ibex_panorama_1.jpg[/img]\n\nHimalayan Ibex shot by my client Roberto Bicciochi in Ghulkin conservancy (Upper Gojal). Gun used was winchester 7MM Mag single shot at 300+ meters drilled right in the upper neck. \n\n[img]http://i560.photobucket.com/albums/ss46/pakistanguides/roberto_ibex_L1.jpg[/img]\n\nRoberto Bicciochi is 67 year old hunting guide from Italy who spends 10 months hunting around the world. This animal was shot at an altitude of 12800 feet above sea level by this amazing tough man. We left 02 AM and reached the habitat at 5PM (we continuously walked uphill for 15 hours). The hunt & photography was finished in about one hour and it took us seven hours to return to our base camp. This 22 hours of walking uphill & downhill was the longest ever in my hunting career.\n\n[img]http://i560.photobucket.com/albums/ss46/pakistanguides/blue_sheep_panorama_1.jpg[/img]\n\nBlue Sheep hunted by my client Scott Dee Headley in Arbab Purian in Shimshal Valley.\n\n[img]http://i560.photobucket.com/albums/ss46/pakistanguides/blue_sheep_hunt_shimshal_l2.jpg[/img]\n\nThis beautiful animal was initially shot but injured by Headley from just a short distance of 40 meters with Remington 700 using 30-06 caliber bullet of 150 grains at an altitude of over 16400 feet above sea level. Then our guides Shambi Khan & Chiragh Din had to chase this injured sheep on a very steep & rough mountain for over five hours and ultimately shot & recovered its body from an altitude of over 17200 feet above sea level and brought it down to the base camp at about 10:30 pm in freezing cold temperture. You can see how happy we are over the lost & found ordeal of our trophy !  \n\n[img]http://i560.photobucket.com/albums/ss46/pakistanguides/sindh_ibex_panorama_1.jpg[/img]\n\nSindh Ibex shot by my client Jim Shockey in Sumbak conservancy in Jamshoro.\n\n[img]http://i560.photobucket.com/albums/ss46/pakistanguides/jim_shockey_sindh_ibex_l1.jpg[/img]\n\nThis Sindh Ibex was taken by Jim Shockey from a distance of 250 meters while it was still running at top speed. Jim used a Thompson Center''s Muzzle Loader whose caliber was .50. A Muzzle Loader is an old style gun in which you have to insert gun powder from the top of the barrel, then push the powder with a long iron rod & then insert the lead shot & push it down again with the rod to compress it against the gun powder & only then you can shoot it. This means the hunter has only one shot & if he misses it he cannot catch the same animal as it takes a very long time to re load the gun. Jim Shockey always uses a Muzzle Loader for all his hunts (including elephants, lions, lepopards, hippos & other dangerous animals) & he has been rated as world''s number 1 Muxzzle Loader Hunter & I''m glad that he has chosen me as his sole outfitter in Pakistan.\n\n[img]http://i560.photobucket.com/albums/ss46/pakistanguides/punjab_urial_panorama_1.jpg[/img]\n\nPujab Urial shot by my client Corey Knowlton in Shah Kameer conservancy - Jehlum.\n\n[img]http://i560.photobucket.com/albums/ss46/pakistanguides/chris_corey_punjab_L2.jpg[/img]\n\nFrom early morning till late evening, we spent three days tramping the arid hills of Shah Kameer searching for a good trophy.

This ram turned out to be a new world record with extra thick horns. See the tips of both its horns have pierced almost over two inches \ninto his jaws & were bulging out from underneath the eyes. \n\n[img]http://i560.photobucket.com/albums/ss46/pakistanguides/Coreys_Big_Urial.jpg[/img]\n\nThis is the left horn ... you can see the tips burried deep into its jaw.\n\n[img]http://i560.photobucket.com/albums/ss46/pakistanguides/Blandford_Horn_1.jpg[/img]\n\nAnd this is its right horn ... also pierced into the jaw.\n\n[img]http://i560.photobucket.com/albums/ss46/pakistanguides/boar_hunt_panorama_1.jpg[/img]\n\nExtra big trophy harvested by my client Harry Fischer (this trophy measured 22.5 cms)\n\n[img]http://i560.photobucket.com/albums/ss46/pakistanguides/DSC02250-L.jpg[/img]\n\nFischer shot this Tusker with a Winchester 30-06 & is happy to display his trophies.

After the hunt, I thoroughly clean the blood & dirt ..etc on the hunted animal using a special wet tissue (it has some chemical which removes even dry blood). I also use hair brush & comb to give prominence to the skin & hair of the trophy plus I also use collapsable studio light reflectors and a very expensive light meter (Sekonic L-508) for the most accurate exposure of my photos & I always prefer to take the mean (average) of the incident light metering from my hand held light meter and the spot lit metering which is shown by my camera''s TTL (Thru The Lens) ... so its always a serious & cumbersome photo session, sometimes, in very difficult conditions & bad weather ... but the reward is always good.

The herd of Sindh Ibexes you see on this ridge are all genuine but the distant background has been zoomed in & the trophy which was shot by my hunter was from this lot & was shot right in front of this ridge but these animals are so used to human traffic in this area that they feel safer watching us from the top of these hills & normally they don''t get spooked ... untill shot !!!', ''),
(91938, ' @Abbas..........Plz Chief do share the location of above purchase, I find the prices pretty much favorable indeed. :)', ''),
(91939, ' AK47: Bro, it''s a pity, in Pakistan, the genuine hunters are deprived from enjoying their very RIGHT of subsidized hunts whereas, this right of the soil is acknowledged & excercised the world over. \nFor example, in Colorado, the natives can hunt the whitetail for peanuts (it''s just a few dollars) the residents of all other states (Yet Americans) have to pay more and all the foreigners have to pay in thousands. But in Pakistan if you are well connecte with the gaurdians of the wild life you can play hell with them but if you want to hunt the legal way within a reasonable cost ... You stand nowhere !!!\nThis nasty attitude provokes poaching & our Govt is very much responsible for this problem. However, having said, we also have to admit that our country is also infested with ruthless killers & meat collectors (U can''t call them hunters) who would shoot anything "that moves in the wild" so we do need strict laws to prevent such butchers to deplete our wild life. \nWith my little study & experience of big game trophy hunting I can now safely say that the only viable solution to make all ends meet & also quench the needs of many genuine hunters of Pakistan, the promotion of community based hunting programs all over Pakistan is the need of the day. These communities have proved themselves to be a real big success & with their help, hard work and persistence, now many of our species have started thriving by leaps & bounds ... whereas, they were almost driven to the verge of extinction ... just until a few years back. \nI''ll quote an example here. By mid 1980s the population of all species of Markhors, Urials & Ibex dropped to such a low level they were declared endangered (In Red Zone) by the WWF & IUCN but the local community based conservancies came forward, protected them & now they are thriving & their population have increased so much that Sindh Ibex & Himlayan Ibex are also being offered to Pakistani hunters. They are still very expensive, but if these communities will keep working I can assure you that one day (in next 3 to 4 years) these hunts will be available at very cheap rates due to one very simple reason ... more supply of animals ... cheaper hunts !', ''),
(91940, ' AK : Currently, Pakistanis can legally hunt two species ie: Sindh Ibex & Himalayan Ibex\nFor Sindh Ibex, any hunter holding the Sindhi Domicile has the privilege to hunt it at a subsidized rate of Rs 50,000/= Whereas, all non Sindhi hunters (Yet Pakistanis) may hunt the same @ RS 100,000/= This is exactly what''s been practiced in Colorado & I hope our other provinces will follow the same pattern. However, since the quota is just 10 animals and there are many hunters every year, the permits are sold out in a lucky draw in a fair & square manner in presence of everyone. \nI''m sure, as time passes & population of Ibexes grows, this price will definitely come down. For your information the hunting permit for foreigners is US$ 4500/= + other expenses (Which is approx Rs 400,000) so this indeed is a positive change & worth appreciation.\nSimilarly, the Himalayan Ibex (in Gilgit-Baltistan) is being sold out @ US$ 3000 to 3500 to foreigners whereas for Pakistanis it''s price is equivalent to US$ 1000 (paid in Pak Rs) however, as usual, since the quota is limited & there are more hunters, the guys at Gilgit Wild Life are smart so instead of disbursing these permits in lucky draws, they indulge the hunters in competitive bids and the permits are given to the highest bidders .... which is quite fair ! \nHaving said, once again... a time will come (in the very near future) when these hunts in Northern Pakistan will also be available at reasonable costs.', ''),

I''ve my doubts here, I must say.\n\nO.K for armed forces, perhaps most of us would still like to keep our things in "scratchless" conditions.\n\nOne possible solution to this problem, but only possible to handmade leather holsters, is to have the inner side thinly "foamed" with the type of foam used in lady bags, a very thin layer, indeed.\n\n Yet bear in mind, even those of you who have "foamed" gun boxes, the chemicals used in manufacturing of the foam itself [b]causes discoloring of the gun if unopened and un-vented for long time[/b]!\n\nBest solution to this is to extract the foam layer from the boxes and have it "covered" up in soft cotton in any desirable color/design, can even be found in "camo" design, and leave this for direct contact with the gun.\n\nAnyhow, would appreciate some more comments on the issue of Fobus holsters and scratches. :)', ''),

(91959, ' AoA Everybody\n\nthis practice of cleaning the barrel with hot water bath was widely practiced in the days when only the corrosive ammo was used in the firearms industry. hot water bath is very effective against the corrosive reside that literally eats the metal away. after hot water bath it is customary to use some sort of water displacing agent such as kerosene or diesel to remove any traces of water from the firearm.\n\nwith the advent of non corrosive ammo, this practice became obsolete.\n\nwhy hot water?\n\nwell.. the chief component of corrosive ammo is potassium chlorate which after oxidizing (burning) turns into potassium chloride which is a salt. itself it is harmless but it is severely hydroscopic. it absorbs hydrogen and oxygen from the air and creates a chemical reaction that rapidly rusts the steel.\n\nnow since it is hydroscopic, it absorbs moisture, loves water, that means totally soluble in water, the best way to remove it is to flush/dunk it in water. water will rapidly dissolve any traces of it.\n\nRegards.', ''),
(91960, ' 12 gauge very good info. \nAdd to it the mercuric chloride which is used in the cheap No 2 desi  primers and is extremely corrosive, this  is why the army used hot water and soap solution to clean weapons and barrels, the soapy water washes away the cloride as it disolves it. The water should be nearly boiling and finally a clear boiling water washing is necessary to clear the soap. Nearly boiling hot water is essential as the barrel and parts of the weapon dry out immediately with the residual heat as the water evaporates due to it. This practice was discontinued in 1970  as Mercuric primers were done away with and lead styphanate and lead azide  are now being used.    \nAfter washing with hot water use a good CLP, cleaner , preservative and lubricant to the weapon. With modern original primers this is not required', ''),
(91961, ' [quote=SAJJAD ALI]i think petrol would be the best opyion for cleaning the barrel or etc.because petrol avaporate in the air in few mintes[/quote]\n\n\nI beg to disagree. if you want to use a petroleum based solvent, the best is to use kerosene or diesel fuel. petrol evaporates too quickly to offer any decent solvency. \n\nkerosene is a good solvent with mild evaporation rate. diesel is better only (IMHO) if used as a sole cleaner as it leaves behind a little amount of lubrication and doesn''t leave the metal bone dry as kerosene does.\n\nRegards.', ''),

When you say NO SCRATCHES, buddy, I indeed do accept as NO SCRATCHES! :)\n\nActually as you for sure do know, these Fobus holsters have a "passive resting" type of lock system built in, as to prevent the gun from being drawn out of the holster by anyone else than yourself. The system as you do know requires a STRAIGHT and QUICK draw in one particular angle I believe, and that''s exactly what I was thinking, if went wrong repeatedly, may cause some scratching friction against the walls of the holster!\n\nYet, you''ve clarified, and even posted a picture of your nice gun and I stand further convinced now to go for this holster on Friday along with a gun for it in Lahore, my spark plugs and air-filter just both got cleaned this afternoon for the upcoming journey, and so has my sparring partner in Lahore, Naveed the Honest, been prepared over the phone today!

(92053, ' @AK47, brother and i mean it, i only meant well  and yes i do now know u better. :) i believe u wanna keep your new purchase a bit hushed up but if you were to let me know which one it is i could perhaps contribute much more. To be honest the glock finish is extremely tough both the slide and the polymer so what holds true for the glock might not hold for a blued gun or a finnish like the stoeger. I have a kydex holster for the stoeger as well but that does scratch although the holster is not fobus. I wish u best of luck with your purchases, and yes it does not hurt to test the gun with the holster a couple of times for peace of mind. I really take care of my guns as well so i know how it feels. :) \n\n\n@12gauge, please don''t be silly, u can ask all the questions u have. i have only used one uncle mikes kydex holster. But since it was a duty holster (a bit bulky) i passed it on. worked just fine though.\n\nThe finnish of the gun is definitely important in selecting a kydex holster, cause a "soft" gun finnish can scratch. Since kydex holsters are very model specific even a slight difference in gun size say a PT92 against a FS92 can cause problems. \n\nLeather holsters are generally more forgiving, though one lesson i learned and that too the hard way is if you use an incorrect combination of gun and holster the holster loses its fit forever. This is especially true for foreign made holsters which are normally honed right down to the minute curves of a slide/frame.\n\nYes i have shopped online from opticsplanet, Galco and Glockmeister, they all deliver. Fortunately we do get holsters in good supply in karachi so have bot a few here as well and also during my travels abroad. The blackhawk ones as mentioned by Malik Sahib  and Comp-tac are very good, and definitely recommended though both are unavailable in karachi AFAIK. In leather Milt sparks rules although very expensive and difficult to obtain as they have a lead time of 4 months (yeah thats right 4 months). I have a Galco one as well and am very satisfied. The yaqui slide belt holster is also a great holster which accomodates a number of guns. Let me know if you need any recommendations. \n\n\ncheers', ''),

Assembly and disassembly of NP22 is a simple affair, nothing complicated about it. Please note that the barrel of NP22 is not chrome plated from outside, though its chrome plated from inside. The machining and finish of handgun parts is of average quality, rather crude in case of some of the parts. But this is something akin to all Chinese handguns. \n[img]http://i206.photobucket.com/albums/bb136/sualeh/Guns/DSCN5469.jpg[/img]\n\nI have so far fired 150 rounds with this NP22 and another above 400 rounds with 3 other NP22s belonging to my friends. It’s a fairly accurate handgun. The pics that you see below are the best fire from this gun. On all other occasions, NP22 could not produce that good a result. Distance, ammo and other details are given on every target sheet. On all occasions, I fired with both hands in standing position. Here are some of the results.......\n\n[img]http://i206.photobucket.com/albums/bb136/sualeh/Guns/DSCN5505.jpg[/img]\n\nThese are the first 20 bullets fired from NIB NP22. The accuracy, as you can see, is pretty ok. Except two bullets, remaining 18 bullets making a group of 5.5 inches. The score was [b]159/200 (79.5%)[/b]. One bullet in 10, nine in 9, four in 8, three in 7, two in 6 and one in 3 (which is obviously my fault).\n\n[img]http://i206.photobucket.com/albums/bb136/sualeh/Guns/DSCN5536.jpg[/img]\n\nFired 20 bullets in four sets of 5 each. The fire was pretty accurate and I scored [b]181 / 200 (90.50 %)[/b] which is a good score from any handgun. \n\n[img]http://i206.photobucket.com/albums/bb136/sualeh/DSCN5538.jpg[/img]\n\nFired 40 bullets in eight sets of 5 each. Scored [b]335/400 (83.75%)[/b] which, keeping in mind the number of bullets, is not a bad fire at all. You can see the bullets literally pulverizing the bull and #9 circle. [b]The problem is that I have fired a lot with this handgun afterwards and have never been able to achieve such good results. All other results have been fairly good but nowhere close to these three occasions.[/b] (Probably I was in good form that day) :)  \n\n\n[img]http://i206.photobucket.com/albums/bb136/sualeh/Guns/DSCN5647.jpg[/img]\nTo check long range accuracy of the handgun, [b]fired 10 bullets from 40 meters[/b]. 8 bullets hit the 12.5 inches target, 2 bullets missed the target. Out of 8 bullets, 7 were on the right side and 1 on the left (which was firers fault). Just to check, fired 10 bullets on the same target from Taurus PT99 and it did well, scoring 79/100 from 40 meters (PT99 bullets are encircled in black and NP22 bullets are encircled in red. From long distance, NP22 displayed just reasonable accuracy. You can see it for yourself :)\n[img]http://i206.photobucket.com/albums/bb136/sualeh/Guns/DSCN5653.jpg[/img]   \n\n\n[b]Observation[/b]\n-	[b]Not even a single stoppage in 150 rounds. A reliable gun.[/b] \n-	[b]The gun is fairly accurate under normal coditions.[/b] However, accuracy is affected at longer ranges. \n-       Trigger is mediocre, has some play and breaks off inconsistently at times. There is surely room for further improvement. \n-       Reasonably good grip.\n-	Broad Glock like night sights.\n-	Strong frame and rugged body parts. A gun designed to last for a reasonably good time.  \n-       The finish of the gun is ok. There is however room for improvement.\n-       The magazine is well built and easily slides into the gun (unlike CF 98). \n-       Not a suitable gun for CC during summers. However, can be carried on person during winters. \n\nOverall, I would rate it as a reliable and fairly accurate gun in this price range. HP77B which is an almost identical handgun from China costs less nowadays and offers almost the same quality (so its a good buy nowadays). If one likes Sig P226 shape and is looking for balance of quality, reliability, accuracy and price, NP22 is one of the better options. The fact that its the official sidearm of Pakistan Army also adds to its valuue. Happy reading.  :)', '');

(92131, ' [b]COMPARATIVE REVIEW - CZ999 Scorpion vs NP22 vs CF98[/b]\n\nThe other day I was talking to 12guage, our PakGuns expert. He asked me to compare NP22 and CZ999 as both are absolutely similar looking pistols. And although there is not much of similarity between NP22 and CF98, we thought they also merit a comparison because CF98 is the most popular Chinese handgun on the forum.   \n\nHere are the specs, first NP22, than CZ999 Scorpion and CF98 on the extreme right  \n[b]Model             -       Norinco NP22            Zastava CZ999 Scorpion                            CF98[/b]\nCaliber		    -	9x19 Para                      9x19 para                                 9x19 para \nBarrel Length	-	112 mm                          108 mm                                   110 mm\nOverall Length	-	196 mm                          198 mm                                   190 mm\nHeight		    -	140 mm                           140 mm                                    135 mm\nWidth		    -	37 mm                             34 mm                                      35 mm\nWeight w/o mag-	780 gm                           840 gm                                     670 gm\nWeight with mag-	875 gm                           934 gm                                     760 gm\nTrigger pull DA	-	6-7.5 daN                       4.5 daN                                   Not known, but extremely light trigger\nTrigger pull SA	-	2-3 daN                          2 daN\n\nHere are few pics of all three handguns. Please note that CZ999, apart from having a far better finish, has only one lever working as both slide release lever and decocker whereas NP22 has a separate decocker and slide release lever. NP22 has accessory rails whereas CZ999 and CF98 do not have though accessory rail models are available in both handguns. NP22 shown in the pics below is NIB and has fired 150 rounds. CZ999 has fired over 500 rounds and CF98 shown below has fired over 1500 rounds. All have been fired by me.  \n[img]http://i206.photobucket.com/albums/bb136/sualeh/Guns/DSCN5490.jpg[/img]\n[img]http://i206.photobucket.com/albums/bb136/sualeh/Guns/DSCN5585.jpg[/img]\n[img]http://i206.photobucket.com/albums/bb136/sualeh/Guns/DSCN5588.jpg[/img]\n[img]http://i206.photobucket.com/albums/bb136/sualeh/Guns/DSCN5580.jpg[/img]\n\n\nThe barrels\n[img]http://i206.photobucket.com/albums/bb136/sualeh/Guns/DSCN5591.jpg[/img]\n[img]http://i206.photobucket.com/albums/bb136/sualeh/Guns/DSCN5589.jpg[/img]\nBoth barrels have similar mechanism. However, CZ999 has a full chrome lined barrel which is known to have a life of 200,000 bullets (one of the highest claimed by any manufacturer for any handgun). NP22 barrel is  chromelined only from inside. Please see the quality of machining in CZ999 barrel and the rough edges / crude machining on NP22 barrel.  \n\n[img]http://i206.photobucket.com/albums/bb136/sualeh/Guns/DSCN5595.jpg[/img]\nCZ999 slide on top, CF99 in the center and NP22 on the bottom. You can distinctly see that all parts in CZ999 are quality machined and constructed to last a long time. The recoil spring is threaded, much stronger than NP22 and CF98 spring. CZ999 slide is 2.5 mm thick whereas slides of both NP22 & CF98 are 2 mm thick. CF98 has a rotating barrel mechanism. \n\nFor me personally, [b]reliability, accuracy and ruggedness are three non-compromisable attributes of a handgun[/b]. Other attributes like finish and looks etc are of lesser importance and do not really effect the performance of a handgun. [b]A good handgun must ultimately do what it has been designed for, ie, fire accurately with no stoppages and should do it consistently for a long period of time. Lastly, it should be reasonably priced for a common joe.[/b]  These have been my basic parameter for comparing these guns. Accordingly, I have given more weightage to these aspects.  \n\n[b]ACCURACY (20)[/b]\nA gun must be accurate and if it is not, it does not qualify to be a good handgun, no matter what its finish, quality or bla bla bla capabilities might be. For being consistent and fair in this most important of the tests, I fired sets of 5 rounds from each gun from same distance with same ammo and under same conditions. The aiming point was kept constant for all handguns and no correction were applied to get closer to the bull. The details are given on each target sheet. Here are the results...........\n  \n[img]http://i206.photobucket.com/albums/bb136/sualeh/Guns/DSCN5543.jpg[/img]\n\nFired 10 rounds each from CZ999 and NP22 in sets of 5 each. CZ999 bullets have been encircled. [b]NP22 scores 76 / 100. CZ999 scores 81 / 100.[/b] \n\n\n[img]http://i206.photobucket.com/albums/bb136/sualeh/Guns/DSCN5541.jpg[/img]\n\nNP22 bullets have been encircled and is generally firing on the right but the group is ok. [b]NP22 scores 62/100, CZ999 81/100[/b]\n\n[img]http://i206.photobucket.com/albums/bb136/sualeh/Guns/DSCN5608.jpg[/img]\nFive bullets each from NP22 (encircled in black), CZ999 (encircled in red) and CF98. CZ999 is generally close to the bull, Np22 is again shooting on the right but making a tight group and CF98 is way over the top. [b]NP22 35/50 (70%), CZ999 45/50 (90%) and CF98 28/50 (56%)[/b]\n\n[img]http://i206.photobucket.com/albums/bb136/sualeh/Guns/DSCN5604.jpg[/img]\nFive bullets each from NP22 (encircled in black), CZ999 (encircled in red) and CF98 (not encircled). CZ999 shoots on slight left but is ok, NP22 is on the right again. CF98, three bullets are very good, one is way on the top and the fourth one missed the target completely. These two bullets were fired while I was still aiming and a very slight pressure on the trigger resulted in gun firing. [b]NP22 29/50 (58%), CZ999 39/50 (78%) and CF98 32/50 (64 %)[/b]\n\n[img]http://i206.photobucket.com/albums/bb136/sualeh/Guns/DSCN5627.jpg[/img]\nCant give the scores here because the target does not have standard measurements. However, you can clearly see that Taurus PT99 is the best closely followed by CZ999, NP22 is just ok and CF98 is quite ordinary. Two of the bullets from CF98 went outside the target and were again fired while I was still aiming. Thanks to extra light airgun like trigger of CF98.\nSeeing the above results, I rate CZ999 as the most accurate, followed by NP22 and CF98. [b]My grading would be CZ999 16/20, NP22 14/20 and CF98 12/20. [/b]\n\n\n[b]RELIABILITY  (20)[/b]\nI did not experience a single stoppage of any kind in both CZ999 (500+ rounds) and NP22 (125 rounds). In CF98, there have been around 20 failures to feed in 1500+ rounds which is not really alarming but once compared with CZ and NP, CF98 loses. All stoppages in CF98 have been failures to feed and mostly occurred with POF ammo. However, I have been firing the same ammo with other pistols also and hardly ever had any stoppages. I give 20/20 to CZ999, 19/20 to NP22 (only because it has fired less) and 15/20 to CF98. \n\n[b]PRICE (10)[/b]\nIn this department, CF98 wins all hands up. In my view, you can not find a better gun in 28 k. In this department, [b]CZ999 gets 6/10, NP22 7/10 and CF98 9/10.[/b] \n\n[b]BALANCE (10)[/b]\nCZ999 is the most well balanced out of all three, closely followed by NP22. Both have a nice grip and a good feel. CF98 is also quite well balanced but not equal to the other two. I give 7/10 to CZ999, 6.5/10 to NP22 and 6/10 to CF98. \n\n[b]FIELD STRIPPING (10)[/b]\nBoth CZ999 and NP22 have a very simple and quick field stripping procedure. CF98 is a little tricky and one needs to practice its stripping drills to achieve proficiency. Even after practice, I can field strip, clean and reassemble both CZ999 and NP22 in 1/4th of the time what I take for CF98. [b]In this area, I give 9/10 to both NP22 and CZ999 and 7/10 to CF98.[/b]\n\n\n[b]MAGAZINE[/b]\nA magazine is a very important part of a handgun. A faulty magazine means problems and lack of confidence in the handgun at the time of need. CZ999 and NP22 both have similar looking magazines which are crude in looks but solidly built (all steel) and I have so far not observed any problems with them. CF98, in my view, has very mediocre magazine. In fact that is one part of the gun which in my view needs definite improvement. First of all, it does not slide in smoothly and one has to either wrestle with it or press the magazine release catch to let it go smoothly. Secondly, I feel CF98 magazine has something to do with its FTF problems which I have experienced with all 5 CF98s that I have fired. Another thing about CF98 is that its extremely hard to take out the round if one wants to. Feeding in and feeding out bullets in CF98 mag is quite tough for the fingers :) [b]For magazine CZ999 and NP22 get 8/10 each and CF98 gets 6/10.[/b] \n\n[b]TRIGGER[/b]\nBad trigger control is one of the major reasons of inaccurate and inconsistent fire and a good trigger helps improving trigger control. Out of all, CZ999 has the best trigger, followed by NP22 which is not bad at all. CF98 has a very light trigger right from the start and after firing 1000-1500 rounds, it gets extremely light, resulting into un-intended discharge at time. Chances of un-intended discharge are far more if one fires CF98 along with other handguns which certainly would have a trigger heavier than CF98. That is perhaps the time one should change the trigger spring of CF98. You can see in the pics also that on many occasions I fired while I was still aiming and had slightly pressed the trigger while firing five bullets each from CZ999, NP22 and CF98 for comparison sake (And I am no novice in firing with CF98, have already fired over 2000 round with 5 different CF98s). [b]In trigger, CZ999 gets 8/10, NP22 gets 7/10 and CF98 5/10.[/b]       \n\n[b]FINISH AND LOOKS (10)[/b]\nThough it has no effect on the performance of a handgun, it does have an effect (of varying degrees) on the owner :). In looks and finish, CZ999 simply stands out. In first look, it looks like a top of the line quality handgun. Comparing between CF98 and NP22, IMO, CF98 has better finish and its parts are comparatively better machined / manufactured. [b]In finish and looks, CZ999 gets 9/10, NP22 6/10 and CF98 7/10.[/b]\n\nWhen I total up the points given in various aspects, the total comes to [b]CZ 999 Scorpion getting 83/100[/b], [b]NP22 scores 75.5/100[/b] and [b]CF98 gets 67/100[/b]. \n\nSo I can say that CZ999 is like VTI Oriel, NP22 is like Toyota XLI and CF98 is like say, Toyota XLI (but 2006 model). :)\n\nAll above opinion is based on my experience of firing and handling these handguns and by no means on some scientific laboratory tests. I am now fed up of writing and I am sure you would be fed up of reading, so please overlook if there are still any deficiencies. :)\n\nHappy reading', ''),

For every requirement, a bottom line is set below which a product will not be acceptable. Requirements for a handgun for example may include aspects like accuracy, reliability, ruggedness in field conditions, availability (specially if it is not a locally manufactured weapon), price etc etc. There could be many political reasons / compulsions as well for selecting a particular weapon which we may not discuss here. \n-  Each one of the above requirements is in fact a limitation. Developed countries normally have resources to overcome all or most of these limitations. For developing countries, it may be more of a compromise.  \n-  Therefore, a weapon selected by an army may not be the best available weapon in the market but the one that provides best balance between various user requirements, some of which are inversely proportional to each other. \n-  Moreover, NP22 is a copy of Sig P226 and CF98 is a locally manufactured weapon. There may be certain ego issues in inducting a clone as well. There could be many more reasons. \n\nHence this argument that so and so army has selected so and so weapon as its official side arms so that weapon is top of the line weapon, may not be true in all cases. Certainly that weapon will not be a trash because it does meet the bottom line of all requirements laid down by that army but may not be the best available weapon either. I hope I have not further confused the issue :)', ''),

With Glock those concerns are at rest as the 17 is quite capable of shooting tight groups till 25 M. \n\n@Gilani Great shooting as always. Looking forward to seeing you soon, why don''t you drive down for the competition on Saturday/Sunday. We''ll all be practicing and it would be good to have you with us.

At a recent Single Stack match I shot 4 out of 7 stages as well as the Master and Grand Master class shooters.  Then there were the other three stages when I did NOT shoot like a Master.

I am not that consistent yet.\n\nOn a plate rack I''ve seen the Masters and Grand Masters run 6 shots in low 2 seconds.

(looks pretty damn good for 103 years old.)\n\nNEW YORK — A famed strongman who once lifted 3,200 pounds at Coney Island during its heyday and was still bending quarters with his fingers at age 104 died Monday after he was hit by a minivan.\n\nJoe Rollino was struck as he crossed a major street in Brooklyn, and suffered a broken pelvis, head trauma and broken ribs. He died a few hours later at an area hospital.\n\nPolice said the driver was going the speed limit and had not been drinking. No criminality is suspected, but the driver was issued a summons for a defective horn.\n\nDuring his storied life, Rollino hobnobbed with Harry Houdini, watched Jack Dempsey knock out Jess Willard and was friendly with Mario Lanza. He even had a bit part in "On the Waterfront."\n\nRollino would have been 105 on March 19, and was the model of health, according to friends. A vegetarian for life, he didn''t drink or smoke, his friends said, and he exercised every day. He was a lifetime boxer and was part of the Oldetime Barbell and Strongmen, an organization of men who can still rip book binders at the seam.\n\nRetired New York Police Department detective Arthur Perry, who boxed in the New York City Golden Gloves in the mid-1960s, met Rollino at his birthday party in 2008 and didn''t believe Rollino was the celebrant — he looked too good for a centenarian.\n\n"It was astonishing, how he was smiled upon by nature," Perry said. "If you would''ve said to me he was 80, I''d have said he looked younger."\n\nA decorated World War II veteran, Rollino got his start as a strongman in the 1920s during the high point of the Coney Island carnival, and he billed himself as the "Strongest Man in the World."\n\nHe later made a living as a traveling boxer under the name Kid Dundee and fought in armories in cities around the country where boxing was forbidden.\n\nRollino said in 2008 that he was just simply born strong.\n\n"Fighters would hit me in the jaw and I''d just look at them. You couldn''t knock me out," he told writer Robert Mladinich in an interview for the boxing Web site The Sweet Science.\n\nMladinich said Rollino had a slew of followers who worshipped him. "He was instrumental in their positive development," he said. "He was an athletic mentor and a father figure to them."\n\nOne is 10-time Golden Glove winner Peter Spanakos, whose twin brother, Nick, roomed with Cassius Clay during the 1960 Olympics in Rome. The two met in the 1950s on the beach.\n\n"He''s a hero''s hero. We should celebrate him," Spanakos said. "A true patriot, an athlete''s athlete."\n\nAt Rollino''s birthday party last year, Spanakos gave him a quarter, and Rollino bent it between his fingers.\n\n"And you know what, he apologized. He said he used to be able to do it with a dime."', ''),

Moreover, I have hardly seen a CF98 magazine sliding in smoothly. One has to either apply some force or press the magazine release catch at the time of inserting the magazine. I really feel Cheng Feng need to improve the quality of magazine. \nAs for the model, I think there is only one model of CF98 available in the market. It comes with or without accessory rails. Are there any other models of CF98 also available? Please do share the information with us.

(92284, ' [quote=Skeeter60]Gillani sahab excellant reviews and photography, I learnt about these pistols from your review.\nI personally would not touch a pistol which has 20 stoppages in 1500 rds with even a barge pole  ( Bairy de wanj ) the military tests of the Beretta vs Sig had a single stoppage in perhaps 3000 rds if I am not wrong that also ammo related.\nA reliable pistol should have as few stoppages as possible and 1 or 2 in about 3000 rds is acceptable but nothing more . Of course cleaning after every 300 to 500 rds in between[/quote]\nAbsolutely agreed Sir. And that is one reason that I have stopped carrying CF98. The stoppage problem was more initially, it reduced considerably after firing 300-400 rounds but its still there. After every 100-200 bullets, there is one odd stoppage. And every time the nature of stoppage is same. The bullet is not fed straight into the chamber and resultantly, the slide does not complete its movement and gets jammed. One has to take out the magazine, clear the bullet and then continue. There has however never been any misfire or failure to eject. In my reckoning, it is a magazine flaw. I would welcome any expert views on it :)', ''),

On the two 25 meter targets your shot placement suggests you may be "heeling" the gun just a bit.  At 25 yards (and further) it would not take much to push the bullet.  A lot of your shots are high and right suggesting you may be anticipating the recoil and pushing with the heel of the hand.\n\nAt 40 M, the shoots are simply to the right.  This is often attributed to pressure from the thumbs.  The next time you shoot, pay special attention to your grip.  Look for a neutral grip with no pressure from the thumbs.  Heeling will manifest as slight change at your wrist.\n\nOr, it''s just the sights with some shooter error (we all have it) giving false impression.', ''),

I will however use CF98 for range practice. I am told that NP22 now costs 42 k. If that be the case I will pay a few thousand more and buy CZ999. But if NP22 costs something like 35 or 36 k (HP77B is selling in 31-34 k nowadays) and I cant afford CZ999, I will go for a NP22 ten out of ten times and prefer it over CF98 which costs around 30 k". If the decision is between buying a CF98 or a local clone (costing 20-22 k) or even a Taurus 24/7 (and all other Taurus striker fired pistols), I will always go for a CF98. \n\nThis is my personal view on the issue. :)', ''),

But I dont see a difference between this CF98 and mine except the colour of slide (I am not sure if it is a stainless steel slide or chromed slide but it looks beautiful). And as I said, the same model comes with accessory rails and also without accessory rails. I chose the one without accessory rails though the one with accessory rails was also available with the same dealer in the same price. What I meant was that presence or absence of an accessory rail does not make it a different model in my view. However, a SS slide surely does. \n\nAs for the experience of failures to feed, I have fired over 2000 bullets with 5 different CF98, around 1500 of them have been fired from this CF98 alone that you see in the pics. With all five, I experienced failures to feed though the number was not really alarming. Mostly the failures to feed were with POF ammo though there were a very few with Chinese ammo as well. The same POF ammo I have been firing with other guns like Beretta 92fs, CZ999 Scorpion, Taurus PT99, NP22, HP77B, Llama M82, Walther P38 and never had any problems, in fact not even a single FTF or FTE in well over 1000 bullets. So I cant say that there was a problem with the ammo. The only other guns with which I faced FTF and FTEs with POF ammo were Akdal Ghost and Taurus 24/7.

Absence of feed ramp on the barrel is an interesting observation. I can, however, see CF98''s feed ramp located on the connector seat (it houses the recoil spring guide and recoil spring and also connects with the rotating barrel). Though I am not an expert but as a layman, I can see that feed ramps of NP22 and CZ999 are far better made than CF98. \nAs for the magazine, I have always suspected that failures to feed in my CF98 have been due to magazine, may it be the magazine lips or the quality of follower spring.

They look to be about 12" apart (center to center) so that''s about 4" between the outside eddges of the plate.\n\nThe beauty of it is that you can choose to shoot it any way you stipulate.  In the Glock Shooting Sports Foundation (GSSF) the shooters start from ready position of elbows touching ribs, forearms parallel to the ground.\n\n[url]http://www.gssfonline.com/pdf/courses/GLOCKthePlates.pdf[/url]\n\nYou can start from holster or how ever else. \n\nYou can decide the distance you want.  Typically it''s 7 - 13 yards.\n\nI am always using my Kimber; so I shot it with a well built 1911 with 8 rnd magazines, sometimes with 9 rnds in the gun.\n\nSometimes the round count is limited to 10 in the gun, but if you have 1911s maybe you decree that no competitor has more than 8.  If you have revolvers, maybe it''s not more than 6 in the gun.\n\nTypically there is no set order. \n\nShooting sports typically create divisions to recognize that some guns give an advantage.  Compensated guns always go into a seperate class- usually along with optical sights (C-more, Red Dot, etc).  This makes lots of sense.   Revolvers also go into a seperate class since they usually have the lowest capacity.\n\nWith steel the only power factor mandated is that it knock over the steel.  You can shoot what ever caliber, weight and speed of bullet you want, but if the steel doesn''t fall over that''s just too bad, so sad, shoot it again.\n\nI am really excited to see you take an interest in this.

I have found out that there is no truth  in the stated fact that prices are going up because of export to Saudi Arabia and no supply to the local market.\n\nIt is just that the production of WAH is the same as before and the number of dealers have increased tremendously, so now WAH has set a quota system for distribution and the shops are getting their quota i.e fresh supply. ( which is now less than before )\n\nI went to lucky star to get a case of Shaheen # 4 and was quoted not less than Rs 1500 at every shop. Finally managed to get it for Rs. 20000/- (1250/- per box) from Huffaz Corporation.\n\nI think that they have started to earn their bread only through 12 bore cartridge sale and not from selling guns. They also are brainwashing us for their huge future profits by telling us that in some time the prices will jump to Rs. 1800/- or more per box.\n\nI would like to get your opinion on how to stop them from this practice because this is for sure that they are keeping huge profit margins than before because for a long time theses were sold for Rs. 300 per box. In that case they must be making Rs. 100 per box or so but now according to my understanding they are taking advantage of the situation created and making at least Rs. 600 per box which is unethical.\n\nBeing an MBA, i do understand the case of demand and supply but i don''t think that the current situation justifies that.', ''),

Still most of the bullets on the right. Scored 343 / 400 (85.75 %). \n\n[b]Skeeter60 sahib, Steven Cline[/b] Sorry for bombarding you with questions but I have quite a few today :)\nHow to get rid of the fliers. Obviously its lack of concentration. Could there be any other reason? Any tips to improve concentration?\nHow to check own performance during a practice session? Should it be done by seeing the score or the pattern of the groups? Any other guidelines to judge how have I done today?  \nThanks and regards', ''),

Once you are good in the 10 second series you can use the same pistol for the Olympic Rapid Fire, \nIn the Rapid Fire you have four series each of five shot strings which are fired in 8 seconds, 6 seconds and 4 seconds.\nYou have out grown the ability of your 9mm Pistols.

(92508, ' While we are discussing scopes I want to add one more thing, a Scope does not turn a weak shooter into a Marksman. It has much to do with trigger control and judging distance,reading  wind and a proper position.\nA scope only helps in selecting a vital point of aim resulting in fewer wounded animals.\n\nAlso I suggest, please  stay away from scopes with Bells and Whistles. There are scopes with coloured filters, with BDC or Bullet Drop Compensators, and illuminated reticles. These gimmiks are fine when you are using a $2200 Shmidt and Bender, a Ziess or a Leupold Mark 4 otherwise on cheaper scopes there are as many places to seep moisture into the scope and for the reticle to rattle  lose.\n\nAs a hunter you must know the  Point Blank Range of your Rifle /Bullet. A PBR is the distance at which you can shoot without having to compensate or hold over. If you are shooting a Sindh Ibex , the vital area is about a  20 inch circle in the chest cavity. That means if you are aiming in the centre you have  10 inches to cater for your bullet drop. If you are using any of the high velocity calibers and your Rifle is zeroed at 250 yards your bullet will not rise above 3 inches at a 100 yds and will be only about  5 to 6 inches low at 300 yds. ( I am giving approximate figures as these are Caliber and bullet specific ).\n\nIf you zeroe your Rifle keeping in view the maximum PBR relative to animal size you do not need  these  gizmos .\nIf you must shoot beyond three hundred then you can aim in the upper shoulder of the animal, never see light between the horizontal reticle and the shoulder of the animal or you will shoot high.\n\nIlluminated reticles give up when needed in the freezing cold of the Karakorams and Himalayas, when shooting Himalayan Ibex and when the cells leak ( they virtually do so right inside your scope) also when you aim at the animal the scope is not usable due to internal fogging caused by moisture entering the scope from any one of the several dials of the gizmos.\nIf you need your illuminated reticle it means  the light is low, please do not shoot as chances are you will lose the wounded animal as following it up late in the mountains is not psossible due to dropping temperature and lack of visibility.\nSame for urial as it will hide behid some rocks or bushes to be waisted in the dark.\nEven the night shooting with search lights ( I do not encourage it except for wild boar) the animal is lit with the spot light and one does not need an illuminated retical.\nWhen buying a scope or a binocular Keep it Simple and as expensive as you can afford. Never buy a binocular with a zoom, always divide the dia of the objective lens with the magnification of the Bino an ( 8 x 40 ) means the dia of the exit pupil is 5 mm and that you will be able to use it in low light as your  eye will dilate to about that much. If you are using a 10 x 25 the exit pupil would be only 2.5 and it will be a pain to use this bino in less than bright sun light. Most mountain animals move early in the morning just before sun light and on cloudy days.\nThere is much more on the subject and I have tried to explain as simply  as possible; as  a number of our members are younger hunters not yet aware of these things.\nYou must have seen the Rambo Knives with 10 inch blades and a saw for sawing wood and a fish hook in the grip and a compass and a match box in the grip. Have you tried to skin a deer with it or cut an apple or slit the throat of a partridge with it? If you have then you already know what I am trying to convey', ''),

Last time I met you was perhaps 23 or 22 years ago in Jhelum when many youngsters like me, who were there probably for PARA matches, had the honour to meet the national champion. \n\nAs for proper target shooting, in fact I started it just a couple of months back after going through this thread. I had been shooting pistols since long but never in a competition style on a proper target. All I would do was to fire a few shots on figure 2 target trying to stay as close to white chindi as possible and break a few bricks or bottles etc whenever we would have our RET practice day. Now after having fired on proper targets I think I am getting edicted to it.  No doubt it has a charm and a pleasure of its own. It would be an honour to get shooting tips from you :)\n\nregards', ''),

(92609, ' Earlier in my review I mentioned about the Taurus PT99 trigger that I was not very satisfied with it. It was a bit too hard and extra pressure on trigger would result in few odd fliers in every shootout though most fliers used to be my fault (lack of concentration). I oiled the trigger thoroughly and kept firing with it. Now after firing over 500 rounds, the trigger of my Taurus has greatly improved and has become sort of crisp, just the right pressure one would like to have. The accuracy has improved too, this is what I shot today with the improved trigger. :)\n[img]http://i206.photobucket.com/albums/bb136/sualeh/Guns/DSCN5716.jpg[/img]\nThe bull in the target is 2 cm radius (0.8 inches) with every circle 2 cm apart.

I had a Motorola walky-talky with me, which our host saw and told me that when everyone is in position he will give me the go ahead and I must fire the first shot, to which I agreed and was very excited. After getting in position, sure enough, I received the go head from host to fire the first shot. After about five minutes the host again called me and asked why am I not firing the shot, I replied that there is nothing coming here to fire at! on which the host said “fire in the air”, which I did. That was one of the worst duck shoot I ever had where the whole  party probably didn’t exceeded the score of 35. \n\nThe morale of the story is; if there are no ducks it doesn’t matter how good a shot you are, you can’t score “firing in the air”.', ''),

(92635, ' Budha Khan sahib, If I could, I would take out PT92 and PT99 from the list of Taurus pistols. Both these pistols, specially PT99 are so good that they can be easily compared with actual Beretta 92FS. In fact they are being manufactured on the same Beretta plant on which original 92fs were being manufactured. Even the staff was not change. Therefore, for me, Taurus PT92 and PT99 are the same pistol as Beretta 92Fs, just a different name. \n\nAs for the other pistols manufactured by Taurus (specially striker fired pistols), its a different story altogether. They have the reputation of being ammo sensitive, they have quality control issues etc etc. You see, many of us can not always afford to buy Federal or Hornady or Winchester or Cor-Bon ammo and mostly we would be using Chinese or POF ammo. [b]IMHO therefore, any pistol which has problems with POF or Chinese ammo is not a fit pistol to be bought in Pakistan[/b] (this is my personal view and I always keep it in mind while buying a pistol).\n\nAs for the performance of Taurus PT99 on Chinese and POF ammo, brother, I have fired more than 500 rounds with my Taurus PT99, both POF and Chinese. [b]Not even a single FTF or FTE. [/b]. Though I dont own PT92 but I can say with surety that same would be the case with PT92 also because the only difference between PT92 and PT99 is of sights (PT92 has fixed sights and PT99 has adjustable sights). So go ahead and buy a PT92 or PT99 (I would personally prefer PT99), there would be no ammo issues at all. With all other Taurus models, there is no guarantee. You may get a peace which is good and you may not be that lucky. \nBest of luck and regards.', ''),

With Thanks again to Naveed who worked hard for a full week prior to my visit, I chose below items for my SD requirements.\n\nThe[b] PT 145[/b] had long been on my mind, in that Denovo Sir and I both wanted something "powerful", yet concealable, simultaneously. Chief Sb suggested it as a consideration, with some positive words about his own one, so following Den''s honeymoon with his "Karishma", I too felt it was a reliably reviewed handgun that could serve my needs.\n\nAs far as the tactical shotgun is concerned, I must say my choice below was a total [b]U-turn[/b] in comparison to what I had contemplated prior to my visit. Naveed had reserved the semi-auto "Germanica" for me by two different dealers, and I was totally set out for it as such. Yet - call it "[i]love at first glance[/i]", or whatsoever - while looking around for some ammo, we came across this beauty, an [b]ultra short[/b] [b]Tomahawk SAC 2500[/b], that just somehow blew the minds out of me and I knew within seconds, that for this time around, it''s gonna be this thing I''d be taking along with me! \n\nBarrel length merely 14 inches, [b]35cms[/b] to be correct, 4+1 Pump-action, tactical rails, heat-shield, only slightly longer than my [b]forearm[/b], course it''s gonna be on my front seat! :P. @Lionheart, Nabeel ... ;).

Really?  Should have done this immediately.  The driver should have anticipated exactly their reaction.  They were four thugs driving in the slow lane to be @$$-hats.  They likely intentionally ignored the lights and honking.  They probably had a good laugh at the Toyota driver''s frustration and gloried in their ability to mess with that driver''s day.  Then they escalated it once they saw that the Toyota driver was a single male with females and children in the car.  They looked forward to beating him up and humilating him in front of those women and children.  \n\nWhen one encounters road rage like this you don''t stop driving until they have damaged your car to the point that it''s disabled.  While doing so you are using your car as your defensive weapon.  Once they have used their car as a weapon to that degree (your car is disabled) it''s time to use your gun to end that bastard, (you rrelative needs to get a gun and a license).  When you do use your gun you do so as fast and as brutally efficient as you can.  That ends most threats and sends a strong message to the other three.  You be ready to end the others as well.\n\nYour obligation is to remain as civilized as you can as long as you can, but when you must act un-civil, you be better at being un-civil than them.', ''),

But still one should be updated about the prices specially in our country u know prices keep on changing every now & then.........\n                  Looking forward to all the respectable members co-operation.... regards & best wishes..', '');

Feel confident with ur stoeger cougar. its one of the best hand guns...[/quote]\nBudha Khan sahib, I have been firing POF2Z from numerous handguns since more than two decades now without any problems. The only guns with which I had occasional problems with POF2Z were Akdal Ghost, Taurus 24/7 Pro and CF98. I have seldom experienced a jam in MP5 with POF2Z and I have fired many a thousand of rounds with it. What I mean to say is that POF2Z is a quality ammo. It is a little on the hotter side but that''s ok with most quality handguns. I agree with Dr Zakir and Sqnldr_Shariq sahib here that it must be a fake reloaded POF2Z ammo. \n\nViper218 bro, I think you should have confidence in both your Stoeger as well as POF2Z ammo. Just 2 stoppages could be because of variety of reasons and is nothing alarming if does not reoccur. Just make sure you are using original POF2Z. Do inspect the rounds before feeding in the magazine and I think there will be no more issues. Happy firing with your Stoeger :)', ''),

Then they escalated it once they saw that the Toyota driver was a single male with females and children in the car.  They looked forward to beating him up and humilating him in front of those women and children.  \n\nWhen one encounters road rage like this you don''t stop driving until they have damaged your car to the point that it''s disabled.  While doing so you are using your car as your defensive weapon.  Once they have used their car as a weapon to that degree (your car is disabled) it''s time to use your gun to end that bastard, (you rrelative needs to get a gun and a license).

We also use the same card boxes with the only difference that we use its reverse side (which is a little flatter and target paper can be easily gummed on to it) and put a couple of shoppers filled with sand in it. It not only makes it more stable but also stops the pallets from hitting the walls and damaging them.

"Grip- wise", to be honest, and this is no "new bride" flattery, but I''ve personally not had a better "feeling" with any gun so far, and I feel much better in "control" with this gun than with the Cougar in my medium sized hands, if not lower medium.\n\nAbbas encouraged Den and me pretty much for this gun, then Den encouraged me further with his buy, now let me encourage you, do GO for it, bro, it''s the caliber to have, if you want somthing different from the 9mm, I indeed had a very nice feeling this eve when shooting the virginity out of it! :)\n\nI must say, do for heck''s sake wear some ear protection using this caliber, it''s one big bang!\n\n@Ilyas........Thanks bro, but you got a very nice "Karena" too! ;)\n\n@Den...........With you Sir, I conclude this post, with a bit of firing review. Was in the village this eve and shot out both items. My impressions:\n\n [b]PT 145[/b]:\n\n Excellent and "crisper" trigger than the Stoeger for an instance. A great "punch" indeed, but I feel it''s a matter of time only, getting accustomed to this kind of a "kick". Shot modestly only, coz it wasn''t a planned shooting event, but still firing only 15 rounds so far, 10 Fmj''s in slow firing towards the ground, 5 hollow points in kind of rapid, no FTE''s/FTF"s, were all kind of enough to convince me of this gun. Btw, Naveed was on the other end of the phone that I kept in my pocket throughout all 15 shots, and thus he got kind of some "live" entertainment! ;) "Karishma" phone S**! :lol: \n\n I''m sure, it''s a keeper. And Den, I was quite much reluctant to taking more hollow point rounds in Lahore, though Ahsan Sb wanted me to take some 50-100 more, regret it now, it seems this babe swallows them up absolutely fine. As regards accuracy, I still can''t say, it was night-time shooting, no targets as such. Will post some more detailed review with more firing, sooner, Inshallah.\n\n[b]The SAC 2500[/b]:\n\nFirst of all, let me confide I''ve been moving around with this since yesterday, and when driving, I simply place it on my lap, then cover it up with my shirt (Shalwaar Kameez), and it''s all covered up, yet ready to be activated any given minute!\n\nExcellent "feeling" with firing it, recoil lower than expected, and quite controllable still with this short a barrel! Problem is just, it seems it''s kind of "ammo sensitive" to Shaheen at least, giving me an FTE on third shot, cartridge expanded beyond acceptable limits! Should perhaps have used the "Federal" ammo I got from Lahore. Otherwise a very fine weapon indeed, shall write up more on more shooting soon, Inshallah. :)', ''),

(92989, ' Jillani sahib, please be a little more specific with your requirement and you would hopefully get a much focused response from the members. Details like caliber, type of pistol and price range would help others to be more specific. Price variation in Glock (500-700 $) and Walther (600-900$) is not much but in Sig Sauer and S&W there is huge difference in prices depending upon the model. Like in US, Sig P250 may cost 600-700 $ whereas Sig P226 X6PPS costs 3000 $. Similar is the variation in S&W Sigma and S&W 1911 Target pistols.

No matter how good these pistols are, 160-175k is totally insane. People here are willing to pay\nalmost three times the price for Sigs, Glocks, HKs and Berettas only because there is export ban on supplying\nthese to Pakistan. Caracal has no such issue, therefore IMHO if they want to make it a success story here, they\nmust price it rationally because the buyers here, besides being aware are brand conscious as well. Many who can\nafford a 175k Caracal, would be more than willing to pay 225k for a Glock coz Caracal still is a newly introduced\nbrand and that too, from UAE. \n\nEven Taurus''s 24/7 was an award winning gun, but most of us here didn''t have any pleasant experience with it.', ''),

I have used both PT845 & PT1911 and I will simply put it in simple words that there is no comparison between these two... no doubt the 845 is double action,has second strick capability,has a manual safety that works as a decocker as well,has a magazine capacity of 12+1 in the chamber & has all the ambidextrious controls & is lighter in weight but after shooting 100 rounds through it & those 100 rounds were fired from 15 yards,I thought I was playing arround with a toy (three ftf,accuracy poor or I must say very poor as I was hitting almost a yard below the target & on quite a few occasions the bullet hit the ground as if I was giving bouncers to a batsman in a cricket match,the sound was also not solid & sought of shrill type). Ammo used was Armscor.45ACP.I thought that its only my 845 but a fellow collegue with his 845 had the same problems,even worse than me,seven ftf & the same results in the accuracy department.Together we went to the dealer the very next morning & got it changed with PT1911 & the moment I shot my first round I said ''wow'' now this is a real gun . Same place same distance & dead accurate.Then we increased the distance to 20 yards & same results.we were hitting standard sized bricks at 25 yards. The ammo used was the same Armscor.45ACP...100 rounds fired by each with zero problems... not even a single ftf or fte..  though a bit heavy but excellent recoil & much more powerful.. That night I slept in peace..:)8+1 capacity of .45ACP is more than enough in a reliable handgun than 12+1 in an unreliable one..

It may have the same problem... now kindly opine me that am i right or am i white  ?[/quote]\nBudha Khan sahib, its correct that PT917 is a generally similar looking design in a smaller size as PT92 or PT99 nevertheless, its a different pistol with different characteristics. IMHO, it wont be right to deduce that since a PT917 had problems therefore PT99 may also have problems since they are similar looking designs. Some of the members have reported problems in PT917 whereas few other members are quite satisfied with it. Against PT92 and PT99, we have so far not heard even a single complaint on this forum (I personally haven''t heard it outside this forum either).  \n\nSecondly, PT99/92 and Stoeger are both very fine pistols but in their own class. In my view, it is not justified to compare them as one is a large frame pistol with long barrel and is very reliable and accurate. The other is again a very reliable pistol but with medium/small frame and short barrel, is fairly good for conceal carry but falls short on accuracy. So both pistols have distinct advantages. If CC is the requirement, Stoeger wins and if accuracy is the requirement than Stoeger does not even come remotely close to PT99.  \n\nAs for PT917, it is neither very suitable for conceal carry because of its size / dimensions and nor has a long barrel / larger frame which could have given it the advantage of being more accurate. Its sensitivity to ammo has also been reported in certain cases. The only advantage is its huge mag capacity which in my view is hardly any advantage (If one cant do his job in 15 bullets, even 20 bullets wont help much). \n\n[b]IMHO therefore, the user has to clearly decide the purpose for which he needs a gun and accordingly make a choice.[/b] \n\nThe last thing is that stoppages can occur in any pistol due to multiple reasons. Unless full details are known, its difficult to correctly deduce whether its an ammo problem or a pistol flaw.\n\nregards and Happy buying :)', ''),

(93332, ' [b]Training our minds for happiness[/b] \na para from the book "The five secrets you must discover before you die" by JOHN IZZO\n\nWhen Don told me that ultimately your happiness was all “in\nyour head,” a light bulb began to fl icker. The idea that I could,\nat any given moment, simply choose contentment and gratitude\nwas radical and potentially life-changing. Don was not telling\nme that this was easy or that it would not require years of practice,\nonly that it was achievable. What the wise ones were telling\nme to do was to practice a kind of sweet surrender to life. It was\nnot the surrender of resignation, a mere begrudging acceptance\nof circumstances; what they were saying was that the power to\nfi nd happiness was within me, not without. They were telling\nme that if I practiced, I could choose contentment at any time.\nSlowly I began a few simple practices: waking up each morning\nand expressing gratitude, focusing on the good that happened\neach day before sleep, stopping the incessant worry about\nthe future (and practicing a gentle nudge back to the present\nmoment), and simply practicing breathing in the moments of\nmy life as if they were precious—as if they were numbered. I\nwish there were some mystical or magical formula to live the\nmoment, but what I learned from these teachers of life is that it\ntakes time and practice to learn this secret.\n\nMany people could remember things their parents or\ngrandparents had told them, things that were lost on them at\nthe time but that they now recognized to be true. Bill, now\nin his sixties, said that when he and his siblings were young,\nhis mother would come into their room and wake them up by\ndrawing open the curtains and saying “rise and shine, life is what\nyou make it.” Bill admitted that “at the time I hated it, but I\nthink it helped me because it was a constant reminder that life\nwas not what happened to you, it was how you reacted to it.”\nLiving the moment means choosing to be in a place of\ngratitude. These wise elders told us again and again that gratitude\nwas the source of fulfi llment. Many of them talked about\nbecoming more and more grateful as they aged and less focused\non what they did not have. Gratitude emerged not as a mere\nattitude but a core “life philosophy.”\n\nThere was a kind of grace these gifted people had about\ntheir lives that I believe to be part of the secret to happiness.\nThey had learned that each day all we can do is our very best.\nEach day we can wake up and choose to see life as a gift and\nto be fully present in that day. We cannot always control the\noutcome, but we can control our reactions. Each day we can\nbring all we have to that day, choosing to live it fully, seeing it\nas a great gift. Each day we can train our mind not to obsess on\nregret, nor to worry for tomorrow but to be in this present moment.\nEach day we can be grateful for what has happened that\nday. And we can choose not to judge our lives from moment to\nmoment (am I successful, happy, unhappy, a failure, good, bad)\nbut simply to live our life.\n\nSeveral years ago, I was giving a talk to a large audience,\nand there was a young man in his early thirties sitting right in the\ncenter of the auditorium in the fi rst row. All through my talk he\nlistened intently. He took a great many notes, he laughed loudly\nwhen something was humorous and cried openly when I told\na touching story. Occasionally he would nudge his neighbor to\nlisten more intently. After my talk he came up to speak with me,\nasking if I would sign a copy of one of my books. While I was\nsigning, he thanked me for my “great talk” but I said “no, I\nwant to thank you.”\n\nI continued: “You had such great energy, and all through\nmy talk I found myself getting energized just by looking at you.\nAnd there you were sitting right in the fi rst row.”\n“I learned that from my grandmother,” he said. “You see,\nwhen my grandmother died last year there were no tears of grief\nat her funeral. There was sadness and there was a great deal of\nlaughter, but when my grandmother died we knew there was\nnothing she had left off the table. She had taken everything life\nhad to give—every pleasure, every moment fully lived, every\nday she took all life had to give. And my grandmother had\ngiven everything there was to give—every kindness, every day\nshe gave all she had to give to the world. So I learned from\nwatching my grandmother that if you sit in the front row everywhere\nyou are, every day and in every moment, you will die\na happy person.”\n\nPerhaps each of us should begin our day the way Joel suggested.\nWhen we wake up, we say thank you for one more day\nand ask that we not waste it. When people meet us, we greet\nthem with an enthusiastic “I’m Here,” sending a prayer to our\nsubconscious of presence and gratitude. Whenever we fi nd our\nminds drifting to the regret of yesterday or the worry about\ntomorrow, we gently bring our mind into the present moment.\nAll during the day, we appreciate each small pleasure, as did\nJohn the “almost 94-year-old” painter, because it might be our\n\nlast. And at the end of the day, we’ll recount all the good things\nthat happened, however small, and ask for one more day.\nThe fourth secret is to live the moment.\nHere are some questions to think about each week to help you\n\nlive this secret:\n• Did I fully enjoy whatever I was doing this week or day?\nWas I really “here,” or did I just show up?\n• Did I take every pleasure that was available to me today/\nthis week (really smell the fl owers), and did I walk with\nawareness through my life or just run?\n• What am I grateful for about today/this week? Did I fi nd\nmyself saying “I would be happy if . . .”? Did I choose\ncontentment and happiness this week?\n• Did I live in the present today/this week, or did I let tomorrow\nor yesterday steal the day’s happiness?', ''),

When firing deliberately, aiming on a small target; There are two distinct stages and then just short of firing the clearing of the firing pin block is felt which kind of gives a creepy feel to the trigger but after that there is a complete surprise break which is conssistant.\nIn the DA/ SA when firing rapidly in one smooth pull one can not feel the creep as obviously. \n \nThe Sights\nBoth Front and Rear sights are drift adjustable.\nThe good news is these are Tritium and glow well in the dark, may not be as good as Trijicon but fare when you are not paying for these.

I fired  50 shots S&B and all 5 shot groups were in 1.25 to 1.5 inches hands not supported. I then fired a 20 shot group with all bullets landing in the 2 inch 10 ring which means center to center the 20 shot group was well inside 1.75 inches.\nI then fired 25 rds of FN ammo and again all shots were within 1.5 inches but the MPI dropped about 3/4s of an inch.\nIn the Rapid Fire mode the gun behaves well for its size and weight as it jumps up more than its bigger heavier cousins, how ever it is more control able than the Sig239, and imperceptibly the Glock 26 has little less jump but then in rapid fire the SA trigger of the CZ makes up.\nFinal Comments \nI have been carrying Glock17, 19 and 26 since 1984 and the only other gun I carried for SD was a CZ 75, and a Beretta 92 for an year or two. \nI am now sadly parting with the Glocks for the following reasons.\nThe CZs are just more accurate and  as  reliable, although a bit heavier.\nThe BIG REASON is PRICE in PAKISTAN.\nI get a $500 Glock for Rs 280,000/- and the $ 600 Rami for 95000/- in Pakistan. Only an insane person will go for any thing 3 times more expansive and much less accurate.\nI have started carrying my cute and accuracy champion RAMI ''D'' It is not only more accurate than any other pistols of its size, it challenges full sized pistols.\nThe Tac Sport costs $1350 and here 140,000/-, The CZ Czechmate costs nearly $4000/- let us hope we get it for about 250,000/ or so.\nI am not a sales director for CZ or Check Republic but the Dean of all pistoleros late  Colonel Jeff Cooper had declared the CZ 75 as the best hand gun ever made 35 years ago.\nI will post pictures of targets ,the pistol and muzzle velocities with various ammunition later\n\n[IMG]http://i262.photobucket.com/albums/ii99/AbbasMalik/Rami6.jpg[/IMG]\n\n[IMG]http://i262.photobucket.com/albums/ii99/AbbasMalik/Rami2.jpg[/IMG]\n\n[IMG]http://i262.photobucket.com/albums/ii99/AbbasMalik/Rami1.jpg[/IMG]\n\n[IMG]http://i262.photobucket.com/albums/ii99/AbbasMalik/Rami5.jpg[/IMG]\n\n[IMG]http://i262.photobucket.com/albums/ii99/AbbasMalik/Rami7.jpg[/IMG]', 'CZ Rami 2075 D Review'),

(630208, ' [QUOTE=shahroze;467955]I agree with the first bit, but Sir 100k for a semi auto .308 is unreal I think the rifle is justly priced the mp5 in my opinion should be for 65k and the mp4 should be below that.\nEven though these are of high quality matching H&K standards the cost to them is real low.[/QUOTE]\n\nWell brother you can disagree to the mentioned price but still I think even POF''s Semi auto should be less than this offered price. IMO.\n\n\n[QUOTE=Leon;467957]I am just sharing my thoughts:\n\nWe are criticizing prices but will anybody tell me that what substitutes do we have? When we are paying Rs. 45K for USD 100/- (this is landed cost not factory) Chinese pistol or Rs. 150K for USD 600/- (again landed cost) Chinese AR-15. Why cannot we pay Rs. 200K for a far more superior rifle of a far more superior caliber. Does any of us has some idea about price of nearest substitute? HK 762A2 costs around USD 4,000/- in USA. Now excluded the taxes there and include the taxes and dealer''s commission here or check with Majeed Sons. He is asking for Rs. 2.5 M for HK 556A2.\n\nThe issue here is not of price only. The availability of such products comes before price. We are unable to find a good bolt action rifle (i.e. Remington 700 or Winchester 70) in .308 Win at some reasonable (which BTW is Rs. 300K) price leave aside any good semi-auto Rifle.[/quote]\n\nBrother I agree that we are paying more than the worth the guns in many cases.. but I think that is primarily due to dealers'' margin and customs/taxes. If we omit these factors then I think we can surely get the imported guns quite cheap... like for example if we are allowed to import any gun from abroad, imagine what we will be paying for that if we omit customs/taxes and dealers'' margin....!!!!\n\nThat is the reason I say that the price of POF products should be lot less. Because,\n1. No dealer margin/commission\n2. No Imort Duty or customs'' charge\n\n\n[quote]It is demand and supply. They don''t need customers as they have many abroad. While you need a supplier and you don''t have any good supplier. Even Chinese and Russian supplier won''t sell you .308 win semi-auto rifle.[/quote]\n\nWell most likely its true.. but I expect better Pakistani/domestic customer friendly approach from POF. Specially when we see that POF''s MP5 pistol is selling in less price in US than it is offered in Pakistan (as per brother Skywalker''s post). And please remember that MP5 offered in US includes customs and export plus carriage costs and still that was offered in less price... isn''t this called ripping your prospective domestic customers? \n\n\n\n[QUOTE=hmd;467991]...[B]Seriously We are ready to pay 300k for Glock and over a million for an AR but not ready to pay 200k for Pak made riffle[/B][/quote]\n\nBrother, those who pay or can pay million for an AR would not have any serious concern over this price... because, \n\nFirst, they will not go for a semi auto, they pay million or more for auto versions and they will keep spending it no matter you offer them Semi Auto G3 or Semi auto AK47. \nSecondly, if any of them buy it, he will not put a second thought on the price... because for him its not a concern... he who can afford to spend a million or so on a gun can spend 200k lot easily for some other gun...\n\nSuch people are of a different class and brother personally, I don''t take them as a whole of our domestic market. I am talking about the majority and bulk of our gun lovers'', enthusiasts and prospective customers... They cannot expend such huge amounts for guns... and that is why I said that POF, as a Pakistani organisation, must rationalize the price for a common Pakistani customer. \n\n\n[quote]...As far army people getting it for cheaper price well they deserve to get it for free they earned it with their blood and guts we owe them more then just discount.[/quote]\n\n\nWell, I am not against that why MP5s were sold to Army personals so cheap... rather my point was that if MP5s can be sold so cheap to military personals than what crime did civilians commit they are being offered MP5s on such high prices...? Ok... don''t sell/offer at the same rate like Army officers but at least rationalize the price for civilians too... after all they are also citizens of this country and are filling the coffers of the country by their sweat.\n\n\n[quote]We start comparing our market prices with US prices keep in mind they have different rules and regulations so the comparison should not be there.[/QUOTE]\n\nDear brother with due respect, I don''t see what different or special rules we have that makes a local product expensive for domestic customers and cheaper for foreigners.... :confused:\n\n\nThis argument is only for conveying a point, no offence intended.\n\nRegards', ''),

I fully agree.\n\nI''m just of the opinion that it''s indeed a "combat" handgun, specifically for the "offensive" part of a combat, and in [i]anticipated[/i]/[i]deliberated[/i] combat situations the single action only feature should be the least of a problem, [b]coz you move around in a "combat mode"[/b] with anticipation of offence/counter offence. \n\nIn pure [b]defense[/b] situations, [b]unexpected assault situations[/b], especially when it involves an ORDINARY man, like yourself or me, I''m of the opinion that a gun with a loaded chamber, double action feature, is a better option, coz, in the heat of the moment, and in the panic of the situation, I''m really not in favor of apart from having to draw/aim/shoot also have to care to [b]remember[/b] that the hammer still isn''t pulled back! Bear in mind, your offender already has the advantage of the [i]surprise[/i] factor with him, and this is best outdone with a ready- to- fire gun, just out of the holster and duz!\n\nIn any case, however, I repeat, the 1911 is "Must Have" item as well, and I doubt a better looking/functioning gun will ever be produced again.\n\nBtw, thanks a lot for sharing the PT 845 experience with us, I''m really surprised it''s that bad.

Could you post some high resolution large size pics please. \n\nYou are right, over the years I have collected lot of angling gear and now I have a room full of it. I have separate sets for fly, lure and bait fishing. \n\nGear for mahseer depends on type of fishing that I do. \nWhile lure fishing, I generally use 10-15 lb rating spinning rod, sometimes when big size mahseer are reported, I use 20 lb rating spinning rod as well. Normally, I use 12 lb line and 15 lb line with heavy rods. I rarely use more than 15 lb line for spinning / lure fishing. \n\nFor baitfishing, I use 20-30 lb rating rod, a large size reel and 20-25 lb rating line.  \n\nWhen fly fishing for mahseer, I use 8 or 10 weight rod, large size streamer flies, weight forward floating line and 30 lb backing. \n\nPlease do post pics of your next trip to this area. What lure did you use. Spinners or spoons. I see you are using very heavy equipment which may not be ideal for spinning.

All over the world, farmers arrange hunts in order to rid this disease. A boar can destroy anything that comes in its path be it a vegetable, animal or a human. Their infestation is a threat to our Eco-system as well. \n\nLet''s spread knowledge and information about this particular kind of hunt.

The first time I saw this thing in real life it was and still is with an avid shooter who resides in Lahore about six years ago.  I then found out that only five peices were supposedly imported in Pak..  These guns are very rare even in US.  The second piece was located by a friend of mine in Karachi about four years ago, and he too still has it as he uses it for competition shooting.  I asked and both were unwilling to even loan the gun to me... I now see why.  This gun shoot soooooo well MashAllah.  I finally got hold of a gentleman visiting Pakistan from abroad who had purchased this (my piece) 92 CC and NEVER fired it.  He just purchased it and around that same time moved abroad.  This gentleman was in town - I happened to hear of him from a dealer - called him up and my search was over.  There are still one or two pieces out there but noone seems to know where they have ended up.\nThis piece is accurate due to two things: \n1.  There is a bushing at the muzzle end keeping alignment.\n2.  The extended barrel length also helps a lot though I am very much confident that even with the short barrel it will be accurate too due to the bushing system.', ''),

There was no one nearby to help him.\n      When he recovered sufficiently from the shock and pain, he picked up the gun and walked home. No doctor in Mastuj or Chitral could help him and he was advised to go to Peshawar. Being winter, the Lowari pass was closed. His father took him to Peshawar via Afghanistan, where he was operated and treated. Most of the remaining shot was removed and wound disinfected.

I bought my first 9mm around a month back. but after a couple of times i decided to keep the 9mm as a home defence weapon and carry the .32 as my primary weapon. again as one of you said, because of the lower recoil i  find it easier to come back to the the target for the next shot. plus its easier to conceal. .38 is mostly and i repeat mostly a size availble in compact guns, normally carrying 5-7 rounds. i have .32 CZ 83, its a sub compact gun and carries 15 rounds. plus i have had the exprience of using a .32 in an actual SD situtation with impressive results. so in my humble exprience i would give my vote to the .32 netime of the day.', ''),

The gun would be replaced, if it was faulty.\n\nAnyhow, they complied to their commitment, and I got my replacement with a fully satisfying NIB, at NO EXTRA COST. The second gun was tested out by Naveed and myself on the offshores of Lahore and performed beyond expectations with all kinds of loads, Cyprus, Federal, P.O.F. :)\n\n[b]BUT[/b], here is the [b]DILEMMA[/b]! Was the FIRST [b]gun[/b] faulty or the [b]ammo[/b] supplied with the sales by Sheikh Saleem [b]faulty[/b]?\n\nI checked the first two shells that I had fired few days back from my Tomahawk. They went off fine, and indeed were genuine P.O.F rounds. Strange enough, the 3rd cartridge that actually got [b]stuck[/b] in the barrel at third shot and caused me to have to visit Lahore again at unnecessarily added cost, was taken out of THE SAME BOX of No.4 P.O.F cartridges that I had bought from Sheikh Saleem with my gun, yet the HEAD-STAMP markings were quite DIFFERENT on this particular one!\n\nI just found about this now after my return and inspected all the cartridges in both the boxes supplied by Sheikh Saleem at the time of purchase of the Tomahawk.\n\n One box was a No.4 Shaheen, second box SG Shaheen. Note the following and be CAREFUL whenever you should buy new ammo! :mad:\n\nThe No.4 cartridges side by side, the left one being the GENUINE, also note the placement of the word "Shaheen" which is placed lower on the shell of the fake one:\n\n[url=http://www.postimage.org/image.php?v=TspMvdS][img]http://s2.postimage.org/pMvdS.jpg[/img][/url]\n\nAnd now to the HEAD-STAMP markings on these, the left one still being the genuine one:\n\n[url=http://www.postimage.org/image.php?v=TspMWFr][img]http://s2.postimage.org/pMWFr.jpg[/img][/url]\n\nFollow on now to the [b]SG[/b] shells: Note a clear Black writing on the genuine shell, a faded one on the fake:\n\n[url=http://www.postimage.org/image.php?v=TspNn60][img]http://s2.postimage.org/pNn60.jpg[/img][/url]\n\nAnd now on to the Head-stamp markings on both types, the clear and ''big lettered", both to the left side, being the genuine head-stamps, the "smaller" and unclear ones on the right side being the fake ones!:\n\n[url=http://www.postimage.org/image.php?v=TspPgPS][img]http://s2.postimage.org/pPgPS.jpg[/img][/url]\n\nNow, what went wrong, did the FIRST Tomahawk get a fair chance, before it was replaced? Second, there''s nothing strange nowadays in getting "Do Number" items in our country, but what strikes my mind madly is that this ammo was supplied by a dealer who also supplied me an imported gun to test it out on! :|\n\nFinally, he is a dealer on the main in LHR, adjacent to Buksh Ellahi and has quite some impressive items there on display, yet this monkey business! And heck I was made to travel back to LHR when I had the [b]scarcest[/b] of time to do so, leave alone the unnecessary cost involved, not to say tension of having a "faulty" new purchase, which perhaps wasn''t "faulty" at all! :mad: Pleased however to have a NIB now!\n\nMay I add that on counting, the boxes above were mixed with a [b]50/50[/b] ratio of fake/genuine shells!

Then we''ll all be clear, either one way or another.\n\nYet my above assertion was mainly due to 2 points:\n\n1) The gun caused FTE''s, both here and in Lahore, with [b]that[/b] specific shell.\n\n2) Even the gunsmith chap there, [b]at Sheikh Saleem[/b], who extracted the shell from the barrel plainly told me that it was a "Number 2" shell, the plastic casing of which had expanded beyond limits and gotten stuck. Naveed is witness to this.\n\nFinally, I just can''t understand why P.O.F would pack their boxes [b]with different cartridges[/b] within the SAME BOX!\n\nI mean, if the shells are from [b]different[/b] factories [b]within[/b] the P.O.F, and thus have different head-stamps as such, do they "mix" them up somewhere during the process, in some specific "ratio" before they start packing them up!!!!\n\nIn any case, however, I''ll visit their office soon and clarify all this, genuine or fake, whatsoever. :)', ''),

I insert the cartridge directly into the chamber... if it slides in by itself it is fine.. if it goes in halfway and you have to push it in with reasonable force.. it is a lemon and put it back.. generally 10 - 15 out of a box of SGs are not fitting easily into the chamber.. sometimes one needs a screwdriver to pull it out it is so tight..', ''),

(94143, ' [quote=Anthrax]Problem isn''t with the [b] Original [/b] ammunition but with cheap reloads and some over-hyped 9mm handguns.[/quote]\nI agree with Anthrax. POF makes quality ammo, there is just no doubt about it. Commercial reloads / fakes of any brand, if known, should not be used and can never be of same quality. Stoppages, however, can occur in the best of handguns due to a variety of reasons, many of which may not be due to the gun itself. The whole thing therefore needs to be investigated in detail before we brand a handgun as unreliable.  \n\nConversely, in my view, Cougar is a good handgun no doubt but its rating has been over exaggerated on this forum and it has been included amongst the best available guns in <100k price; which it is not. The uncompromisable capability that any handgun must possess is a combination of accuracy and reliability. A practical minded user may compromise a little on accuracy part of it (never on reliability), only when a particular handgun provides a significant advantage in some other area like size (conceal carry). We all know that Cougar is not a very accurate gun. Its size is small but not small enough to make it a good CC gun and its quite heavy too. Now there are issues related to reliability as well; about which IMO we still dont have enough evidence, however, sporadic incidents have been reported. Its not very cheap either. If this be the case, why do we rate it as one of the best available handguns?        \n\nI am not at all branding Cougar as a junk gun, I am just challenging its top status which in my view it does not deserve due to the reasons mentioned above :)', ''),

Being excited and without any training or supervision, he loaded the gun and cocked the hammer inside his house. Avoiding his father and brothers, he scaled the walls of his house to go out and shoot chakor. He lowered the gun ahead of him to get down from the wall and in one of the attempts the gun went off. There was no one nearby to help him.\n      When he recovered sufficiently from the shock and pain, he picked up the gun and walked home. No doctor in Mastuj or Chitral could help him and he was advised to go to Peshawar. Being winter, the Lowari pass was closed. His father took him to Peshawar via Afghanistan, where he was operated and treated. Most of the remaining shot was removed and wound disinfected.

(94185, ' In the mid 80''s a senior officer in Rawalpindi was called to attend a village Jirga to settle an outstanding and serious dispute. He had information that the opposite party were planning to kill him during this event, but honour bound he had to show his appearance. He arranged to import a bullet proof jacket for this event. The day was fast approaching, and the jacket was not reaching. Till the last day he kept expediting, but the jacket did not arrive. Finally when he left, he delegated responsibility that as soon as the jacket arrived, it was to be sent after him at top speed. That day the jacket did come, and by late night, it reached the officer in the village. Next day he wore it to the jirga. During the proceedings he was fired upon from many sides by a number of gunmen hidden in surrounding houses. Bleeding heavily he was evacuated to the hospital. All bullets aimed at his chest were stopped by the vest. His neck and lower body was injured. He survived, and the culprits were brought to book. In his remarks to his subordinate next day in hospital, he said, "Thank you for the prompt action. The jacket saved my life".', ''),

He had no education just  like Mikhail Kalashnikov, John M Browning and some other great gun inventors.\nI wish some one had helped him, there were other great craftsmen related to gun making like Chacha Sidique of Zhob Militia (late), Mistri Nur Ahmad  of Lahore (late) and Chacha  Kareem who is the only one living and in his late eighties, still working at Karachi.\nChacha Sadique was taken a prisoner of war in the battle of Mont Casino in Italy (2nd World War) while he was an eighteen year old apprentice armourer in the 4th Indian Division.\nThe Germans recognised his trade and genius;  trained and employed him in the Mauser Factory. \nI knew him as a young captain and he would make gun stocks and even actions and barrels with amazing precision, he knew the technical details and understood ballistics. I was too young and naive at that time to realise the true worth of his genius.  \nI only wish these great men had been formally trained and Baba Kamal  made guns in his own name but then he had to make a living making look alikes, the main beneficiaries of his art were those so called gentlemen who palmed off these fakes as the real guns to unsuspecting buyers in far off areas at exorbitant prices.\nMost English gun makers started as armourers and making guns at home/ workshops', ''),

(94279, ' I have a Golden Retriever and will post his pics soon', ''),
(94280, ' OK I am a guy who wants to buy a Cougar because a friend of mine said that its the best gun available. What questions should I ask myself before buying? In other words what ground facts I should consider before spending my hard earned money. Off course I am not a handgun designer and therefore, best I can do is to compare Cougar with other pistols available in the market in various common areas that can be checked by a common man like me. OK, here we go........... \n\n[b]First the price[/b]. Is Cougar a cheap gun? No its is not. It is one of the expensive guns in <70k guns category, available in Pakistan. A cougar costs around 53-58k. I am gonna ask myself that why not buy a CZ999 Scorpion in 45k, or Canik Piranha compact in 40k, or Tanfoglio Viper Compact in 48k, or NP22 / NP34 in 40k, or even CF98 in 30k? Or why not to spend another 5-7k and go for a Baikal? What extra advantage Cougar gives me if I spend 10 or 15 K more? But in the end I decide that regardless of the price, I am gonna buy a Stoeger Cougar. OK Done. \n\n[b]Second the accuracy[/b]. I will ask myself; is Cougar an accurate gun? Not bad but other guns like CZ999, Baikal, Tanfoglio Viper, Canik55 Piranha compact, NP22 etc are more accurate than Cougar. But I say Cougar has a smaller size so I will compromise a little on accuracy. OK, again done.  \n\n[b]Third comes the size[/b]. Is Cougar the most suitable gun for CC? No it is NOT. Taurus 111, Taurus PT145 etc are all much more concealable. Cougar is 7 inches long and weighs around 915 grams (which is quite a weight for a CC gun). In comparison, Canik Piranha C is 7.4 inches and weighs 770 grams, NP34 is 7.2 inches and weights 830 grams, CF98 is 7.6 inches long and weighs 760 grams,  Baikal is 7.9 inches long but weighs 830 grams etc etc. As you can see Stoeger does not have a clear advantage in this area as well. So I might think that if I really need a gun that I can hide while carrying, I should go for Taurus Millennium 111 or PT145. I compromised on accuracy because of the size but a 7 inch long heavy pistol I will probably not be able to conceal. Than why not to buy Baikal or CZ999 or Canki Piranha or NP34 or Taurus 909 which are all less than 8 inches but provide better accuracy and most of them are cheaper than Cougar. But I say Cougar is more reliable so I should go for it. OK done. \n\n[b]Last is reliability[/b]. Is Cougar a reliable pistol? Yes, it is fairly reliable but not the most reliable. Better than some of the Taurus models, but not better than Baikal or CZ999 or Piranha and few others which eat away every type of ammo and seldom stop. Agreed that just a few problems that have been reported against Cougar do not provide sufficient evidence to brand it as an unreliable gun but still, problem have been reported.  So I say that if Cougar has problems with POF ammo, I will stop using POF ammo because Cougar is a reliable gun. But I still buy a Cougar because I liked it. And there are so many things we do because we just like them  :)\n\n:) Bothers Sensei,  Aquarius and Faheem, :). No one is saying that Cougar is a junk gun and should not be bought. All I am saying is that Cougar is not a top of the line gun in this price range as we have perceived it to be. :)\n\nregards\n\nPS: I am certainly not on an anti-Cougar mission. Just wanted to share my personal point of view and put across a possible rational method of selecting a handgun (based on comparative ground facts) in front of new members who are seeking advice to buy a new gun (which may sometimes be their first gun) . As I already said, if one likes something and its legal, its good enough a reason to go for it :)', ''),

(94291, ' [quote=fahadkhalid]I find it quiet strange that come up with this question. the first thing is if you are using a pistol in an SD situtation then i presume the firing range is less 20 mtrs. At 20 mtrs you can stop anything using either a .32 or .38. it wudnt make much of a difference. I bought my first 9mm around a month back. but after a couple of times i decided to keep the 9mm as a home defence weapon and carry the .32 as my primary weapon. again as one of you said, because of the lower recoil i  find it easier to come back to the the target for the next shot. plus its easier to conceal. .38 is mostly and i repeat mostly a size availble in compact guns, normally carrying 5-7 rounds. i have .32 CZ 83, its a sub compact gun and carries 15 rounds. plus i have had the exprience of using a .32 in an actual SD situtation with impressive results. so in my humble exprience i would give my vote to the .32 netime of the day.[/quote]\n\n\nI assume sir, that the bullet/s was/were an effective man stopper', ''),

Here is today''s target at 15 M.\n\n[img]http://i262.photobucket.com/albums/ii99/AbbasMalik/Steoger_resize.jpg[/img]\n\nThe thing about the Stoeger is that due to the small barrel length it is a very unforgiving pistol to shooter error specially when the frame does not fit one''s hand properly. Double action pull is a little heavy, single action is fine. I like the fact that the trigger becomes free when the safety is on. Good value for money around 50 K if you want it as a carry piece. I would however still take the CZ999. Since both these pistols often compete for the 40-50 K price bracket I think some comparative pictures would be helpful for future purchasers. The CZ999 while only slightly larger with the same or lesser thickness offers much better range results. The trigger is also better.\n\n[img]http://i262.photobucket.com/albums/ii99/AbbasMalik/Stoe1_resize.jpg[/img]\n\n[img]http://i262.photobucket.com/albums/ii99/AbbasMalik/Stoe2_resize.jpg[/img]\n\n[img]http://i262.photobucket.com/albums/ii99/AbbasMalik/Stoe3_resize.jpg[/img]', ''),

As i too want every one around to have reviews about the very hand guns...I had had cz 999 scorpion, had been having it more than an year, no doubt its a  reliable, robost and combat pistol, feeds any ammo great, including the POF & Russian stuff but not really found it that accurate... Its trigger has more take up than more pistols and it spoils accuracy. also can''t be carried chambered as no safety or locking mechanism is there...To me it was not anything more than an average pistol...Now coming to Russian Guns/weapons... I was going to get a Baikal pistol when its price was 75k... my friend who was then along din''t opine for that and stopped me buying that... May Allah bless him as his opinion worked... Most of us have a very high opinion about Russian weapons and i myself have been using almost every sort of Russian weapons since child hood like TT 33 (soviet made) that i just traded off, Double barrel shot gun, Ak 47, both folding and Non folding, Baikal Shot gun that my friends own but what i wud say that Russian guns and hand guns can''t be compared even to the chinese weapons what to talk of other hi fi branded guns...Russians believe in quantity not in quality and they do exactly with their weapons... Baikal pistols were very much liked but soon it lost its reputation... Wud any one of u believe that a firing pin of a pistol is broken during firing... by looks most of baikal models are like no more than Darra made pistols...ugly, substandard pistol is this...About taurus i dont have personal experience but yes there is my observation as some of my budies had and still have taurus pistols... except pt 92/99 no 1 is much happy with taurus and in short taurus really doesn''t enjoy good reputation... as i once visited some international site; there it was mentioned that even pt 92''s barrel wiggles around... but since i saw Gilani bhai complimenting Taurus pt 99 I wud say its an exceptional model among all taurus models.... Of course Yes Canik is a nice pistol in all aspects... as its cheaper and better but still its not justified to compare a typical Turkish Pistol with Stoeger... We all know Stoeger Cougar is in actuality a Beretta Cougar... And its like we are getting Mercedes for the price of Corolla, Not!!!!!...    viper hand guns: Since i m hailing from Bannu, its a Gun culture... people here are fond of guns and believe in the philosophy of "lot of guns and more sons".  They spend so much on weapons but i seldomly see any one asking the dealers about Viper here. I saw Viper pistol some a year back with two of the dealers here...even the dealer was not recommending me that,also I din''t find it a very attractive peace. Nowadays even the dealers don''t keep Viper pistols on their shops ; not knowing much about Viper thats y won''t say any thing more than this.... [b]Chinese hand guns[/b]!!! I and most of the enthusiasts that i know have a very good experience about Chinese weapons... i have been having its tt pistols like model 54, Wynamex, Ak 47s both folding and that of Butt model, cf 98 & hp 77 b pistols, till date i experienced no mal functions, mis fires or any other lackness in any of the mentioned Chinese weapons.... We get Chinese weapons cheaper due to the Dumping policy that China follows and Since Pakistan is on good relations with China thats y  She has a lenient export policies towards us... in the last about Chinese pistols i ll say its kam kharch bala nasheen...(small cost great show)...', ''),

(630162, ' I am just sharing my thoughts:\r\n\r\nWe are criticizing prices but will anybody tell me that what substitutes do we have? When we are paying Rs. 45K for USD 100/- (this is landed cost not factory) Chinese pistol or Rs. 150K for USD 600/- (again landed cost) Chinese AR-15. Why cannot we pay Rs. 200K for a far more superior rifle of a far more superior caliber. Does any of us has some idea about price of nearest substitute? HK 762A2 costs around USD 4,000/- in USA. Now excluded the taxes there and include the taxes and dealer''s commission here or check with Majeed Sons. He is asking for Rs. 2.5 M for HK 556A2.\r\n\r\nThe issue here is not of price only. The availability of such products comes before price. We are unable to find a good bolt action rifle (i.e. Remington 700 or Winchester 70) in .308 Win at some reasonable (which BTW is Rs. 300K) price leave aside any good semi-auto Rifle.\r\n\r\nIt is demand and supply. They don''t need customers as they have many abroad. While you need a supplier and you don''t have any good supplier. Even Chinese and Russian supplier won''t sell you .308 win semi-auto rifle.\r\n\r\nAnyway, to me, we have a very narrow Window open to get these pistols and rifles especially 9mm POF PK pistols and .308 Win sporter rifles as this is definitely going to attract lot of hue and cry from so called liberal and anti-gun quarters. These fools don''t spare any chance to hit at Pak Army and this offer has given them a lot to speak. I am seeing roll back of this offer soon.

(94422, ' A article from Shooting times .\nA choice of six \nI chose six of the most popular .22LR rimfire subsonic ammunition available: Eley, Winchester, Remington, CCI, RWS and Lapua. \n\nFirst was the Eley Subs Xtra Plus, which has a newer, lighter wax lubricant covering. The bullet weighs 40.2 grains of hollowpoint design. This is intended to give superior stopping power. Its actual weight was 40.61 grains and it produced a velocity of 1,032fps and 95.1ft/lb. \n\nNext I tested the Winchester subsonic hollowpoints, which weighed a measured 40.3 grains and gave a 1,065fps and 101.5ft/lb. There is a slight lubricant on the surface and the biggest hollowpoint cavity of all the bullets tested. \n\nThe Remington is a relative newcomer in the subsonic rankings, weighing in at 38.7 grains, and is almost a clone of the Eley, except it is shorter and it has three lubricant bands rather than two. The velocity and energy figures over the chronograph were 1,029fps and 91ft/lb. \n\nThe CCI ammunition has a measured 39.8 grains lead hollowpoint small cavity bullet, very different from the old hollowpoint copper washed bullet. The newer variety was fast for a subsonic at 1,077fps with 102.5ft/lb over the chronograph because it has a lighter bullet. \n\nThe slowest velocity ammunition tested was the 40.3-grain RWS bullet with an average velocity of 991fps and an energy figure of 87.9ft/lb. This had a very thick wax coating and nice hollowpoint design of relatively soft lead when compared with the other bullet types. \n\nThe Lapua bullet has a good pedigree from the target circuit and its subsonic .22LR shot a consistent 1,071fps with resulting 101.4ft/lb energy from the 39.8-grain bullet. \n\nThe penetration test was very interesting. When performing this test, I questioned what I wanted from a subsonic round. Their primary use is to despatch game such as rabbits as humanely as possible, but still produce good exterior ballistics such as flat trajectory, accuracy and stopping power. \n\nAt the same time, I do not wish for over-penetration or carry over, where the bullet''s killing power is lost. I always look for an accurate, consistent bullet that expands and has maximum stoppage within the quarry if possible.', ''),

Once through the machine, you''ll be asked by ASF personnel to open you bag and show your license. Your gun serial number will be cross-checked with your license along with other details. The number of bullets being carried should be within the limit mentioned on your MOI license. Mind you, the bullets must be kept separately from the pistol and all the magz should be empty.\n\nThereafter, the ASF personnel will assign another personnel with you who will seal the bag/suitcase and make sure that you check-in your baggage in luggage and do not carry it in hand to the plane. Upon reaching your destination, an ASF personnel will already be there and will identify the suitcase at the luggage belt using the bag number which he already has and he''ll remain with you till the time you do not leave the airport building (to make sure you don''t take it out inside).\n\nThat''s pretty much it.

Mehran is four seater whereas corolla is also four seater\n4. another look: does corolla weigh three times as much as a mehran\n5. is corolla three times the size of a mehran\n\nofcourse No!. then why is it priced three times? cause for every unit of added comfort the associated costs increase exponentially not proportionally.\n\nRegards.', ''),

(94474, ' I agree with everyones point here.. to an extent everybody is right..\n\nStoeger Cougar has the same internal working as that of Px4 Storm.. There is no question in its reliability.\nI see 95% stoegers working great and only 5% or less with any xyz complaints. Again it is no big issue. NO ISSUE? why?... As best of the world pistols where QC is delivered with so much blood and sweat even do have LEMONS in them. e.g Sigs, Colts, Kimbers, S&Ws, Berettas, Springfields and Glocks. They all have occasional lemon in them. \nIMO there is nothing bad if we just found out that Stoeger has more LEMONS than say S&W, we cannot undermine the fact that Stoeger sells way cheaper than an S&W.\nAbout the viper218''s specific Stoger under discussion, I would be very reluctant to say that there is some thing wrong with it or even there it is a LEMON.. NO!! IT IS NOT probably (keeping in mind the amout of Viper218s usage and familiarity with it). All he needs to do is, break her in. Break in the Magazines with a couple of 100 rounds, as most low QC guns will get better after a good break in period. Before all that break in, thoroughly inspect magazines after complete stripping. Clean them of any oil/dirt/grease and keep them dry(not oiled) and check the spring follower for any irregularities. Check the magazine solely for spring tension vs. reliable push of rounds in upward direction(when they are double stacked - 6+). You can check it by loading it to the max and strip rounds one by one with your thumb to see if the Mag spring has uniform tension all its way up. Please concentrate on your magazine now to clear it first of any issues then come to POF ammo and last  to the pistol.\n\nAs for POF ammo, Skeeter sb''s mentioned it being berdan primed which is very true have been familiar with it since long. There is my experience of bad pieces in the lots, BUT I DO ADMIT they all fire and give NO ISSUES at all. My say is that, POF is good because it bangs all the time. The fact that BAD pieces are still there, one must not neglect that upon firing they always turned out to be berdan primed. I have always put it up with great confidence that Original POF ammo has a slight variation in their QC over time in different lots. AND they all are berdan primed and do fire well. Such defects which I am refering to are; 99% slight buldge in case or a bad crimp/seating of bullet (bullet base can be felt/seen on case wall in micro mm difference) and 1% PLAINLY RUPTURED CASING which I can testify too upon requirement.\n\nRegards.', ''),

Once through the machine, you''ll be asked by ASF personnel to open you bag and show your license. Your gun serial number will be cross-checked with your license along with other details. The number of bullets being carried should be within the limit mentioned on your MOI license. Mind you, the bullets must be kept separately from the pistol and all the magz should be empty.\n\nThereafter, the ASF personnel will assign another personnel with you who will seal the bag/suitcase and make sure that you check-in your baggage in luggage and do not carry it in hand to the plane. Upon reaching your destination, an ASF personnel will already be there and will identify the suitcase at the luggage belt using the bag number which he already has and he''ll remain with you till the time you do not leave the airport building (to make sure you don''t take it out inside).\n\nThat''s pretty much it.

Today again tried with single hand. The result was a little better though the hand is still shivering a lot and I am not really enjoying it. But would still keep trying this and after a few session, would move on to 25m.   \n\n\n[img]http://i206.photobucket.com/albums/bb136/sualeh/Guns/DSCN5751.jpg[/img]\nAs usual, fired 20 rounds in a set of 5 each with Single Hand. Two bullets, one on the top in 4 pt ring and the other not even on the target spoiled the whole effort. Should have crossed 170 if these two bullets had not gone so drastically wrong. Remaining bullets hit reasonably well. \n\n\n[img]http://i206.photobucket.com/albums/bb136/sualeh/Guns/DSCN5752.jpg[/img]\nSecond attempt. Scored better but I think previous fire was overall better, less the two bullets that went a long way  out. \n\n\n[img]http://i206.photobucket.com/albums/bb136/sualeh/Guns/DSCN5748.jpg[/img]\nJust to change taste, fired 20 bullets from 25M with both hands. Again, 4 fliers and could not even score that much that I usually do from 25M.', ''),

(94588, ' hmmmmm.......... this thread is getting interesting. But we must not lose focus of the discussion which is not to prove that Stoeger Cougar is a useless handgun by any means but to establish that Stoeger Cougar has been overrated on PG and is not [b]the best[/b] gun in <100 k range. \n\n[b]It appears to me that Beretta heritage of Stoeger Cougar is the most convincing argument in favour of Stoeger Cougar, no matter what the ground results might dictate.[/b] \n\n[b]In my view, heritage has its own place and value but a limited one.[/b] It''s just like that if a person keeps telling others again and again that my great great grandfather was a King of so and so and I come from a royal family. People might honour him for a while but a time would come when people would ask, "OK Sir that''s superb but we had enough of it; your great great grandfather must have been a king but lets talk about you. What are you" [b]So a sound heritage does give a kick start but finally, one has to prove himself in the arena.[/b] That was one angle. \n\nThe second angle to heritage thingy is that [b]all models of all famous brands are not always great[/b]. Every famous gun manufacturer has superb models, mediocre models as well as few failed models also. The superb models are manufactured for a long time generally. Examples are Beretta 92fs, Walther PPS, CZ75, Sig P226, Colt 1911 and so many other models which are being manufactured, with a little change only, since decades and decades. Then there are mediocre models which are manufactured for some time and than are discontinued. Beretta Cougar 8000 was one such mediocre model. If it were that superb, Beretta would have continued manufacturing it, even when the old plant was shifted to Turkey. Just like it did for  92fs, that even after shifting the old plant to Brazil, it still kept manufacturing 92fs and we all know that 92fs is still a best seller. PT92 and PT99 manufactured by Taurus on Beretta plant also became famous, not only because they had Beretta heritage but mainly because they proved themselves on ground on account of accuracy and reliability. So much for the Beretta heritage.......\n\nTherefore a common gun user like me may consider the heritage thing for a while but that''s it. [b]What actually I am gonna do is to take the gun to the range and fire with it. Do it again and again and again, under different conditions and test the weapon thoroughly and mercilessly, without getting impressed with its hasb nasab (heritage). If it delivers consistently, its a good weapon (no matter how inferior its heritage might be) and if does not deliver, it no good and a piece of junk (no matter how superior its heritage might be) and if it delivers well but not very consistently or delivers in a mediocre fashion than it''s a mediocre gun, a high average gun. [/b]In my view, Stoeger enjoys the last status. [b]So personally speaking, I would love to have a Stoeger Cougar, but as my 4th or 5th gun.[/b]       \n\n\n\n[quote=Budha Khan]...I had had cz 999 scorpion, had been having it more than an year, no doubt its a  reliable, robost and combat pistol, feeds any ammo great, including the POF & Russian stuff but not really found it that accurate... Its trigger has more take up than more pistols and it spoils accuracy. [/quote]\nBrother, I beg to disagree. I have seen at least five CZ999 firing and I also own one. Please go to CZ999 thread and see the range result pics posted by Abbas sahib, myself and 12guage. And this is the accuracy I am talking about.........\n[img]http://i206.photobucket.com/albums/bb136/sualeh/Guns/DSCN5521.jpg[/img]\n\nAnd this is the result CZ999 is capable of producing from 50 M, firing in standing position with both hands. The encircled bullets have been fired with Taurus PT99 and those without a circle with CZ999. I seriously doubt I would be able to hit anything like this with Stoeger Cougar from 50 M. Out of question. \n[img]http://i206.photobucket.com/albums/bb136/sualeh/Guns/DSCN5402-1.jpg[/img]\nCZ999 therefore is not an inaccurate weapon. \n\n[quote=Budha Khan]l...Now coming to Russian Guns/weapons... I was going to get a Baikal pistol when its price was 75k... my friend who was then along din''t opine for that and stopped me buying that... May Allah bless him as his opinion worked... Most of us have a very high opinion about Russian weapons and i myself have been using almost every sort of Russian weapons since child hood like TT 33 (soviet made) that i just traded off, Double barrel shot gun, Ak 47, both folding and Non folding, Baikal Shot gun that my friends own but what i wud say that Russian guns and hand guns can''t be compared even to the chinese weapons what to talk of other hi fi branded guns...Russians believe in quantity not in quality and they do exactly with their weapons... Baikal pistols were very much liked but soon it lost its reputation... Wud any one of u believe that a firing pin of a pistol is broken during firing... by looks most of baikal models are like no more than Darra made pistols...ugly, substandard pistol is this...[/quote]\nI would also ask the same question that our esteemed expert 12guage asked. How many hundreds of rounds have you fired with Baikal? (I have said hundreds of rounds because I believe its necessary to fire at least 300-400 rounds to form an opinion about a weapon). I agree when you field strip a M446 Viking, it looks ugly. This is mainly because it has been designed to fire 7N21 and 7N31 ammo which is a very hot load. Therefore, instead of a cute little breach, you find a big ugly one, instead of a symmetrical barrel, you find a barrel that is fatter both from breach and muzzle end etc etc. [b]In my opinion, Baikal is a top gun. Had it been manufactured by Beretta or S&W, we would have ran around and paid 200-250 k easily for it [/b](you know that heritage thingy almost blinds us). But to Viking''s bad luck, it has been manufactured in Russia and obviously cant get kind of media advertisement that even mediocre pistols from US or Italy would get.    \n\n\n[quote=Sensei]............brother Gilani simply need to realize the price of Berreta 92 FS and Taurus PT 92 or PT 99   the first one is still for nearly 200k or above,on the other hand PT 92 is only for 55k & we all know that PT 92 is the best of all Taurus handguns so one could ask that why shoud we pay 200k for berreta 92 if the taurus 92 is available just in 55k\nas both are very nice reliable and accurate guns so why this \nhuge difference is there, our reply would be it that one should pay 200k because that is a big name Berreta, it is made on higher standards with any superior quality material and etc etc\nis the price of berreta 92  justified? can we say PT 92 is an expensive gun? if no then why it is not as expensive as berreta as the factory of Berreta in Brazil was purchased by taurus and PT 92 is manufacturing right there with some MODIFICATIONS as it is claimed by Taurus and due to those modifications PT 92 becomes more accurate better and reliable if yes so then why this is available only for 55k ,is Berreta an over hyped gun??\nand if not so it is same happend to Cougar when it was Berreta \ncougar it was 200k or above we could only dream for it but now\nit is Stoeger cougar with no such MODIFICATIONS made same to\nsame as berreta on same machines with same darwings & with\nsame specifications that is actually a Berreta cougar thats why we believe this is the gun has worth of 200k available just in 50k is it not our good luck, comparing it with XYZ clones are not fair not the Cougar but these clones are expensive,apart from other comparisons which you mentioned the only Baikal MP 446  is an originally desigend gun could be compared with couger and the rest are way behined but yes CZ 999 could be better than cougar and it is just the matter of our preference  :cool:[/quote]\nJust a simple reply brother. After having fired well over 1000 rounds from Beretta 92fs and Taurus PT99 and PT92, I am of the view that Taurus PT99 is not far behind Beretta 92fs in accuracy, reliability and quality. [b]Therefore, if Beretta92fs costs 200k and PT99 costs 55k, than 10 out of 10 times I would prefer to buy a PT99 in 55k[/b] and spend remaining 145k for some other good purpose (may be buying another 2 handguns and few thousand rounds of ammo). But if Beretta cost 75k and PT99 costs 55k, I will buy a 92fs. I hope this clarifies my stand point :)\n\nregards to all', ''),

( i think the shooters on either side of the clone shooter are more at risk/ stress)\nI have found use of  real Berreta 92 FS  to have been discontinued by a group of  ( Hasas Idara ) after a very large number broke when extensively fired on the ranges. Surprisingly some had the locking lugs on the barrels shorn off. \nOthers had slides broken and cracked. I will soon post pictures, it will take me about two weeks though as I will have to drive two hundred KMs to take the pictures.\nThey have switched over to Sig 226 X 5 all steel[/quote]\n\nSir jee.. about the hassas idara''s experience with locking blocks of of this pistol.. sounds quite a common problem as it occured in 80''s too with the 92F with faulty slides. Slides were fixed then and never heard of 92F''s slide cracking or breaking then in US army. However the story of locking block is different. I have/had always believed that 92F is a very service able pistol with modular design in its locking action. The locking/swinging block, which takes most of the stress of recoil operation is a replaceable item rendering the pistol to fresh stock form. Unlike the JMB tilt barrel system, which dissipates the recoil forces over slide cutouts, barrel lugs and frame inserts more uniformly giving it a longer life, but does render the pistol more weak after say a long period. Stress can be seen in all components and that is why after extensive use, JMB deployed action pistols start cracking their steel frames e.g colt 1911, sig P226. You can find this over the internet as well.\nI always admired this design due to its modularity in its action, block gets replaced after 8-10k rounds and it is as good to go as new.\n\nRegards and Good morning', ''),

Insert the cleaning brush from the chamber, through the barrel, and out the muzzle. Withdraw once the whole brush has exited the muzzle side. Do not withdraw if the brush (or portion of it) is still inside the barrel. Clean this way a few times until all visible residue is removed.\n\n2. Push a wetted patch (wetted with Cleaning Solvent) from the chamber, through the barrel, and out the muzzle. Remove patch and withdraw cleaning rod. \n\n3. Push the bronze bristle-brass brush wetted with cleaning solvent from the chamber, through the barrel, and out the muzzle and pull back through the barrel completely.\n\n4. Push another wetted patch from the chamber, through the barrel, and out the muzzle. Remove patch and withdraw cleaning rod.\n\n5. Push the bronze bristle-brass brush wetted with cleaning solvent from the chamber, through the barrel, and out the muzzle and pull back through the barrel completely.\n\n6. Push another wetted patch from the chamber, through the barrel, and out the muzzle. Remove patch and withdraw cleaning rod.\n\n7. Let it soak for 20 minutes. While waiting rinse the bronze bristle-brass brush so solvent won''t eat away the brush.\n\n8. 20 minutes push another patch wetted with cleaning solvent from the chamber, through the barrel, and out the muzzle. Remove patch and withdraw cleaning rod. Inspect patch for copper fowling (blue-green coloration). If patch has significant blue-green coloration repeat steps 5 and 6 until minimal blue-green coloration appears on patch.\n\n9. Push a dry patch from the chamber, through the barrel, and out the muzzle. Remove patch and withdraw cleaning rod.\n\n10. Push another dry patch from the chamber, through the barrel, and out the muzzle. Remove patch and withdraw cleaning rod.\n\n11. Wipe muzzle end of barrel to remove remaining solvent. \n\n12. Apply one/two drops of Hoppes # 9 Lubricant Oil in selected places including where the slide moves over the frame, mag release button, slide locking block, mag release button and the trigger.\n\nFor further details, please refer our handgun cleaning threads in gun maintenance section and you''ll find alot of relevant useful information there.', ''),

(94771, ' This is a guide to help you select the best ammunition for your defensive firearm. Most of these opinions are based upon the work of Massad Ayoob, Evan Marshall and Ed Sanow, police officers who have extensively studied the issue of firearms, ammunition and stopping power. I refer all interested parties to the excellent series by Ayoob (''In the Gravest Extreme,''''Stressfire,'' ''The Semi-Automatic Pistol in Police Service and Self-Defense'', ''Stressfire II: Advanced Combat Shotgun'') and the comprehensive book ''Stopping Power'' by Marshall and Sanow.\n\nIn particular, it cannot be stressed too heavily that all gun owners should own a copy of ''In the Gravest Extreme'' and re-read it periodically. Once you have read it you will understand why. Buy it. (The Ayoob titles - and other items like Cor-Bon ammunition and Spyderco ''Clipit'' folding knives - are available mail order ($9.95@ and $3.95 shipping and handling) from "Police Bookshelf," P.O. Box 122, Concord NH 03302; telephone # 1-800-624-9049. American Express, VISA, Mastercard, and Discover cards gladly accepted. Order today - you will be grateful.)\n\nThese three policemen are the world''s foremost authorities on choosing ammunition for real-world defensive use. Their views are based on exhaustive review of thousands of police and civilian shooting incidents, autopsies, and ballistic tests.\n\nSome other authorities rely entirely on the latter (e.g. Dr. Martin Fackler, the FBI Wound Ballistics Lab, the National Institute of Justice Ballistic Research Laboratory) which is insufficient to make reliable predictions. Human beings react differently to being shot than gelatin, goats, or other test media, and bullets that perform spectacular feats in the laboratory sometimes give mediocre results on the street.\n\nA perfect example of this are the silly 1989-90 FBI tests which resulted in the FBI choosing the mediocre 10mm S&W Model 1076 and the 180 grain JHP round. For this reason, I have chosen to rely on Ayoob, Marshall, and Sanow when it comes to selecting my ammunition and strongly advise you do the same. What follows is essentially a distillation of their opinions. I urge you to research the sources listed for a more detailed discussion than is possible here.\n\nI cannot stress too heavily that the primary determinant of stopping power is BULLET PLACEMENT. A cool, deliberate marksman with a little .32 Walther PPK will beat a panicky, inaccurate man with a .357 Magnum or $1200 customized .45 auto every time. Whatever firearm and caliber you select, you must practice firing hundreds - thousands - of rounds in realistic defensive scenarios until you can confidently make disabling hits on your target. Tactics and marksmanship win gunfights - not having the latest ''wonder bullet'' in your gun.\n\nUnfortunately, I cannot teach you tactics in this short essay, only recommend proven ammunition. You MUST seek out competent training in tactics and marksmanship from a qualified instructor in your area. In the meanwhile, studying Ayoob''s great book ''Stressfire'' will get you off to an excellent start.\n\n[b]Self Defense Ammunition Generally[/b]\n\nAmerican ammunition is the best in the world. Stick to Federal, Cor-Bon, Hornady, Remington, Winchester or CCI ammunition. Some foreign stuff is pretty good (PMC, IMI-Samson, Fiocci), some foreign stuff is great (Dynamit-Nobel, Norma, GECO), some foreign stuff is practice-only junk (e.g. Wolf, CDM - Mexico, military surplus), but no foreign stuff is anywhere near as good as domestic ammunition when it comes to vanquishing hostile attackers. Buy American.\n\nNever use hand-loaded or re-loaded ammunition for self-defense! You may encounter some joker who says he can hand-load ammunition so powerful it will knock anything on two legs down for the count, but don''t buy it. This junk will either misfire or ruin your gun. Use only fresh factory-loaded cartridges, period. There are NO EXCEPTIONS to this rule: use factory-loaded cartridges only.\n\n[b]Handguns[/b]\n\nOne should carry only hollowpoint ammunition in a defensive handgun. Hollowpoint ammunition has much better stopping power than full metal jacket or round-nose lead, and stopping power is what you need when being assaulted.\n\nThe point is not to wound or kill the adversary: the point is to stop him in his tracks and make him cease attacking you. "Stopping power" (sometimes called "knock-down power") refers to a particular bullet''s ability to incapacitate an attacker - the greater that ability, the less chance that your attacker will be able to continue shooting, stabbing, or beating you after you have shot him.\n\nHandguns are not death-rays; despite what you see in the movies, the vast majority of people shot with handguns survive (over 80%). Handguns are weak compared to rifles and shotguns, and thus you want every edge you can get. Great ammunition is no more expensive than mediocre ammunition, so carry the best. Rifles and shotguns have stopping power to spare; handguns do not. Thus you must select your handgun load very carefully, and the detail of the handgun ammunition section reflects this.\n\nHollowpoint ammunition is NOT more lethal than ball (full metal jacket) ammunition. You may have seen media hype about "killer dum-dum bullets" but this is nonsense. Hollowpoint bullets usually expand and stop in the human body, and thus the attacker absorbs much more of the bullet''s kinetic energy than if the bullet had merely zipped through him and left two small holes. Hollowpoint ammunition is also safer for all parties concerned.\n\n* You are safer because your attacker is more likely to be incapacitated after one or two shots and thus unable to fire back, stab you, or whatever. The decreased likelihood of your attacker dying from hollowpoint bullets saves you the moral and legal complications and expense you will experience from killing a man.\n* Innocent bystanders are safer because hollowpoint bullets are less likely to exit the attacker''s body and go on to injure anyone else. The ricochet danger is also much lower than that of ball ammunition, and hollowpoint bullets are less likely to penetrate walls or doors and strike uninvolved third parties. Furthermore, if your foe is incapacitated quickly he won''t be spraying wild bullets around, endangering uninvolved third parties.\n* Lastly, your attacker is safer because he is far less likely to die from one or two hollowpoint bullets than the five or six round-nose slugs you would have had to fire to put him down. Most gunshot deaths occur from shock and loss of blood, and ball rounds tend to make entry and exit wounds, whereas hollowpoints go in and stay put. An attacker shot twice with ball ammo will probably have four holes in him rather than two, and is thus in far greater danger of death from blood loss. If you can avoid killing your attacker you should, for both moral and legal reasons.\n\nThere are some exceptions to the "carry only hollowpoints in a handgun" rule. Some older or cheaper automatic pistols, will jam with hollowpoint rounds. With these guns one must use ball rounds (or "full metal jacket" rounds - the terms are synonymous), and I specify "reliable with ball only" models by caliber. It is crucial for you to test your pistol to make certain it is reliable with specific loads - don''t rely on my advice. My life will never depend on the reliability of your handgun. Your life may.\n\n\n[b]Rifles[/b]\n\nGenerally speaking, fast expanding bullets are the best choice for rifles. Hollow point and plastic tipped bullets usually expand rapidly. Some soft-point designs are recommended, and these will be specified.\n\n[b]Shotguns[/b]\n\nUse buckshot. Slugs and birdshot are useful in some limited and uncommon situations.\n\nA Note On Exotic Ammunition\n\nThere are several exotic ammunition designs on the market today, such as the Glaser Safety Slug, Mag-Safe, GECO BAT 9mm, Thunderzap, et cetera. Generally speaking, I recommend that you avoid them. Exotic ammunition is expensive, inaccurate, and often unreliable. These rounds cost so much ($2-$4 each) that you will never practice with them and thus will not be certain of their reliability and accuracy in your gun. This is a big mistake: you should not carry a particular type of ammunition until you have fired at least 150 rounds through your semi-automatic gun to ensure reliable feeding (this doesn''t really apply to revolvers, but you should still fire the ammunition you intend to carry to assure yourself of its accuracy).\n\n''Glaser Safety Slugs'' are one exotic round I can fully recommend, but only for revolvers in a few scenarios. The Glaser is a proven man-stopper and has very good quality control, but may not feed or cycle reliably in your automatic pistol. Because you cannot afford to fire enough Glasers to establish that it feeds reliably in your pistol (i.e. 100 test-fire rounds will cost $300), I cannot recommend them for pistol owners (if you insist on Glasers, carry one in the chamber and load the magazine with a proven hollowpoint. Be aware, however, that the Glaser may not have the power to cycle your slide, and thus you may be carrying a single-shot gun. You can always cycle the slide manually, of course, but this takes time and both hands; two things you may not be able to spare when fighting for your life. The Walther PPK, H&K P7 series and SIG P230 are notorious for this failure-to-cycle problem with Glaser Safety Slugs).\n\nWith revolvers feeding is not an issue, of course, but there are other factors to consider. The Glaser is designed for easy break-up and minimal penetration, which is great for cutting down ricochet and over-penetration dangers but drastically limits its ability to penetrate light cover between you and your foe. A car window, hollow-core door, or even thick winter clothing between you and your assailant can cause the Glaser to disintegrate and leave him unharmed. Bad news for you....great news for him.\n\nThere are some situations where the Glaser is a good choice, however. I keep my bedside .357 revolver loaded with .38 Special+P Glasers because I live in a thin-walled apartment building and want to be able to put down an intruder rapidly without worrying about injuring my neighbors. I chose .38 over .357 Magnums because I am likely to be in a just-awakened daze and would rather not be blinded and disoriented by the flash, kick and blast of firing a .357 Magnum in a (probably darkened) room. You may have a similar situation (e.g. retail store defense) where injury to third parties is of concern, and you''ll likely be facing an assailant at extremely close range where the Glaser''s inaccuracy and inability to penetrate cover will not be drawbacks. In these narrowly defined scenarios, the Glaser is a good choice, but keep a couple of speedloaders of hollowpoints handy, just in case. I do.\n\nGlaser Safety Slugs are available in "Blue" or "Silver" versions. The latter are a little heavier for better penetration, but performance is similar. I would be happy with either, but Sanow prefers the Silver. It''s up to you.\n\nMag-Safes are imitations of Glasers, and I cannot recommend them due to poor quality control. Reliability is the number one requirement of a self-defense handgun, and Mag-Safes don''t make the grade.\n\nGECO "Blitz Action Trauma" or BAT 9mm rounds from Germany are a proven design. Called the "GECO Action Safety" in Europe, this is a high velocity (1400 feet per second) lightweight (86 grain) hollow bullet that has proven itself to be very reliable and successful on the street. I recommend them, but they are very tough to find. Save yourself the trouble and use a good American-made hollowpoint.\n\nOther exotics are best avoided. You may occasionally encounter "Thunderzaps," "Omni-Shocks," "Terminators," "Annihilators," "Kaswer Law Grabbers," and other such marginalia in gun shops. Stay away. If you want to gamble, go to an Indian reservation. Don''t gamble with your life, or the lives of others. Glasers and GECO 9mm BATs are the only proven exotics.\n\n[b]Terminology[/b]\n\nI have tried to keep specialized technical jargon to a minimum, but it will be helpful for you to understand a few terms and acronyms:\n\n- ''Ball'' is round-nosed metal jacketed ammunition. It is used for self-loading firearms like pistols. All military pistol and rifle ammunition uses full metal jacket bullets. Synonyms for ball include FMJ ("full metal jacket"), MC ("metal case") and TMJ ("totally metal jacketed," a term used only by the ammunition maker CCI). Ball rounds do not expand and are always the worst choice in a defensive round. The military uses ball because it feeds well (i.e. rarely jams), penetrates far, and the military is required to use ball under the Geneva Convention. Fortunately, you are free to choose better ammunition, and should use ball for practice only.\n\n- ''Wadcutters'' and ''semi-wadcutters'' are sharp-shouldered revolver bullets with an odd cylindrical appearance. True wadcutters are very weak rounds used for target shooting only. Unless you own a .38 or .357 revolver, forget about these.\n\n- ''Jacketed soft-points'' are jacketed bullets with exposed lead at the tip. These make poor defensive rounds for handguns but may be effective for rifles, due to the latter''s high velocity. Never use JSP rounds in a handgun for self-defense. Never.\n\n- ''Jacketed hollowpoints'' are the best choice for handguns and most rifles. JHP rounds have a hollow cavity in the nose and usually expand (and stop) in the body of your attacker, transferring all their kinetic energy for maximum stopping power. They are the safest and best bullets available. JHP bullets are always best for self-defense.\n\n-''Round-nose lead'' (or RNL) are generally revolver bullets without any metal jacket around the bullet. These are worthless for self-defense, and I don''t even use them at the range. If you come upon a bargain lot of RNL ammo, feel free to buy it for target practice. You will be scrubbing out your barel until the wee hours, however, as all-lead bullets scum up barrels something fierce. Use ''Flitz'' metal polish to scour out the grimy residue.\n\n\n[b]HANDGUN AMMUNITION BY CALIBER[/b]\n(Note: for an excellent and comprehensive look at the best handgun rounds by caliber, see the article ''What Are The Best Loads For Defense?'' by Ed Sanow in the July, 1995 issue of Petersen''s ''HANDGUNS'' magazine)\n\n[b].22 Long Rifle[/b]\n\nYou should really be using something bigger than a .22 for self-defense, but even a .22 beats nothing. There are some really nice .22 pocket autos, and they make a lot of sense for women reluctant to tote a bigger gun around. Choose any Federal, Remington, Winchester or CCI copper-plated 37 grain (or lighter) high velocity hollowpoint round. I recommend CCI "Stinger" 32-gr. or Remington "Yellow Jacket" 33-gr. hollowpoints, as they have been very reliable in my Beretta 21A and Walther TPH pistols and have the highest stopping power ratings.\n\nShoot a lot of rounds through your self-defense .22, the ammo is cheap and you want to be sure to pick a reliable round. If high-velocity solids don''t cycle reliably try standard-velocity. There is little difference in power but it may improve your gun''s reliability (e.g. Jennings J-22 pistols are more reliable with standard-velocity solids). Marksmanship is crucial with such a tiny gun, so practice drawing your .22 and firing it rapidly into a melon at ten feet or so. Also keep your .22 autoloader meticulously clean - these tiny guns cannot function reliably with much gunk in them. If you carry your .22 in a pocket, purse or ankle holster inspect it daily and brush off any dust or grit with an old toothbrush. Lubricate it properly, too. This is very important.\n\n[b].25 ACP (6.35mm)[/b]\n\nThe best .25 load is the Hornady 35-gr. XTP-HP round. If it jams, use any Federal, Remington, or Winchester 50 grain ball round. Winchester has an odd 45 gr. "Expanding Point" round that should be OK if it is reliable in your gun (it seems to work fine in Beretta 950 pistols, for example), but don''t expect any improvement in performance over the 50 grain ball rounds. The excellent Walther TPH .25 should be loaded with ball.\n\nThe Hornady 35 grain JHP should be considered only if it is 100% reliable in your pistol - fire 200 rounds through your gun to see. Ed Sanow recommends the MagSafe 22 grain "Defender" and Glaser 40 grain Safety Slug.\n\n[b].32 ACP (7.65 mm Browning, 7.65x17mm)[/b]\n\nUse the Winchester 60 gr. Silvertip Jacketed Hollow Point (X32ASHP) if it is reliable in your gun. I personally would only carry Silvertips in a Seecamp LWS .32. Most of the common .32 autos on the market are only reliable with 71 grain ball: Llama, Walther PP and PPK, Czech CZ-24 and CZ-70, Davis P-32, Colt Pocket Model, Mauser HSc, etc.\n\n[b].32 Smith & Wesson Long[/b]\n\nThe best defense load for this obsolescent revolver caliber is the Federal 98 gr. lead wadcutter (32LA). Shoot carefully.\n\n[b].32 H&R Magnum[/b]\n\nFederal 85 gr. Jacketed Hollow Point (C32HRB).\n\n[b]7.62x25mm (a.k.a. 7.63mm Mauser)[/b]\n\nIf you''re using this obsolescent communist caliber I can only assume that you have an old CZ-52 or Chinese Tokarev. Only 87 gr. ball ammo is available, so leave the cheap Chinese military stuff for practice and carry Fiocchi 7.63 Mauser ball in your gun.\n\n[b].380 ACP (9mm Short, 9x17mm, 9mm Kurz)[/b]\n\nNow we''re getting into some decent stopping power. The three or four best .380 JHP rounds have better stopping power than ANY bullet fired out of 2" barrel .38 Special snub-nose. All of the Big Five make good hollowpoints for this caliber. The Remington 88 grain JHP is the most reliably-feeding hollowpoint but slightly less effective than the Hydra-shok or Cor-Bon. Reliability is crucial, and thus you must test the rounds before carrying.\n\nI recommend the following two cartridges above all others:\n\n-Federal 90 gr. Hydra-shok (P380HS1 H) - the best standard-pressure .380 JHP load, period.\n-Cor-Bon 90 gr. JHP - the most powerful .380 hollowpoint, bar none.\n\nThese are the two best .380 loads, and I recommend them for these guns:\nSIG/Sauer P230, Beretta 84/85, Browning BDA, CZ-83, H&K P7K3, Walther PPK and PPK/s. The Russian, East German, Chinese and Bulgarian Makarov pistols are apparently perfectly reliable with the hot Cor-Bon, and the strong all-steel construction of these guns should stand up to an infinite amount of these potent rounds. I have heard that the Colt does also well with the hot Cor-Bon JHP, which you should definitely look into if you own a Colt .380. You have better stopping power than any .38 snub-nose revolver (the long-time favorite concealment sidearm) when you load your .380 with these two rounds.\n\nOther good .380 ACP jacketed hollowpoints:\n\n- Remington 102 gr. Golden Saber BJHP (GS380M) - Another excellent .380 load (the BJHP stands for "Brass Jacketed Hollow Point"), the heaviest one available. I prefer the Cor-Bon and Hydra-shok, but many (including Sanow) like this new Remington round for its deeper penetration. I''ll stick with the Cor-Bon and Hydra-shok, but the choice is yours.\n- CCI-Speer 90 gr. Gold Dot JHP A good all-around hollowpoint.\n- Remington 88 gr. JHP (R380AI): A good high-velocity hollowpoint that feeds well in: Colt Government Model .380, H&K HK4, Taurus PT-58, older PP and PPK, Bersa .380, Beretta 70s, Makarov and Hungarian FEG. These are all good guns that might choke on other hollowpoints but they will probably feed the Remington fine. This hollowpoint was redesigned in 1993 and gives excellent performance while retaining its rounded shape for positive feeding. If your .380 chokes on other JHP loads, try fifty rounds of the Remington 88 gr. through your gun and see if it improves.\n\n[b].380 ACP hollowpoints to avoid:[/b]\n\n-Winchester 85 gr Silvertip (X380ASHP) I really cannot recommend this weak and jam-prone round. It works reliably in a few modern European guns (e.g. SIG 230, Beretta 84F), but every load named above offers better performance. The Silvertip will likely jam in any American-made .380 automatic. Russian .380 Makarovs and PPK series guns may jam with the Silvertip, as well. The .380 Silvertip was once state-of-the-art, but has since been superceded by superior designs. It is also quite expensive. Look elsewhere.\n- PMC-Eldorado Starfire 95 gr. JHP This round is similarly weak and jam-prone.\n- Federal 90 gr. JHP (380BP) (see below)\n- Hornady 90 gr. XTP-HP (9010) Both the Federal 380BP and the Hornady XTP-HP never expand and may jam many guns due to their truncated-cone bullet nose profiles. Pass by these two.\n\n[b]95 gr ball:[/b]\n\nDavis P-380, Accu-Tek, EAA .380, Tanarmi, AMT/OMC/TDE "Back-Up," Heritage, FIE, Jennings, Bryco, Lorcin, Llama, or "other." Hollowpoints should never be used in these low-priced guns.\n\n[b]9mm Makarov (9x18mm)[/b]\n\n-Cor-Bon makes an excellent 95 grain JHP that is totally reliable in all East Bloc pistols.\n-Hornady offers a 95 grain JHP/XTP (#91002).\n\n[b].38 Special[/b]\n\nLoads for Full-Sized .38 Revolvers With 4" or Longer Barrels: The Numero Uno .38 Special defense load for your 4" barrel revolver is the Cor-Bon .38 Special+P 125 grain JHP. It is a very high-pressure load and should be used only in modern six-shot revolvers. It has less felt recoil and muzzle flip than the #2 choice, which follows. When I carry a 4" .38, I want it loaded with this cartridge.\n\nThe second-best choice is the .38 Special +P 158 grain lead semi-wadcutter hollowpoint (LSWCHP) available from Federal, CCI, Winchester and Remington. Ayoob has found the latter to have the greatest expansion, so I would choose Remington (catalog #R38S12). This unjacketed all-lead round (often called the "FBI load" or "Chicago load") is a proven manstopper when fired from a 4" barrel. Your fixed-sight .38 revolver it will usually shoot to point-of-aim with this load; lighter bullets will normally shoot low (some very low). All fixed-sight .38s are regulated at the factory to shoot accurately with standard velocity 158 grain bullets, as this was the weight of the long-time standard American and Canadian police load.\n\n* Federal makes the FBI load in their Nyclad line covered with a thin Nylon jacket to prevent leading (#P38G). This is now a police only load. The all-lead version is #38G.\n* CCI offers the famous FBI load in their economical aluminum-cased Blazer line (#3523). This is a bargain. What I really recommend, however, is that for practice you use the CCI Blazer 158 grain JACKETED hollowpoint (#3526) because it duplicates the ballistics and recoil of the FBI load without fouling your barrel with hard-to-scrub-out lead deposits. These are a bitch to clean (I use ''Flitz'' metal polish with good results. It will also remove unsightly "burn rings" from the cylinder face of your stainless-steel revolver).\n\nNote: .38 Special ammunition is loaded to two pressure levels: standard pressure and +P. Standard pressure loads may be used in any .38 Special revolver, but +P loads should be fired extensively only in steel-frame .38 Special revolvers. Firing a few (under fifty) +P loads in your aluminum-framed .38 Special revolver will not destroy it or cause it to explode, but will damage your aluminum-framed revolver if you fire more than a hundred rounds. The main problem with carrying +P .38 Special loads in an aluminum-framed .38 Special revolver is that the kick is nasty and slows repeat shots. Thus I recommend standard pressure ammunition for aluminum-framed .38 Special revolvers, as it is much easier to score fast hits.\n\nOther .38 Special Loads for Your 4" Barrel Revolver:\n\nIMI-Samson also offers a lightweight, very high pressure load, the 110 gr. +P+ JHP. This is said to be a ballistic duplicate of the law-enforcement-only "Treasury" load that T-men used to carry. Who cares? The Cor-Bon 125 gr. +P load is superior. And never use any 147 grain bullet in any caliber. They are cursed.\n\nAll major manufacturers catalog light .38 +P hollowpoints, from 95-129 grains. None of these are as successful as the Cor-Bon .38 Special +P 125 grain JHP or 158 grain +P LSWCHP, so why carry them? Light +P loads only make sense in a 2" barrel snub (more on this later). The Federal Hydra-shok and Winchester Silvertip may look cool, but the boring-looking Cor-Bon and FBI loads do the job in a 4" revolver. Stick with them.\n\nPMC makes a bizarre 66 grain tubular hollow bullet load. Some enthusiastic gun-shop salesman may try to sell it to you. Refuse politely. Also avoid the Remington 95 grain +P SJHP (R38S1) due to inadequate penetration.\n\nThe Glaser Safety Slug is a good choice for self-defense in a .38 revolver of any barrel length (see caveats under "exotic ammunition," above). It is crucial to keep the chambers and frame interior absolutely free of oil or solvents when carrying Glasers, as you don''t want any Breakfree CLP or Hoppe''s #9 solvent seeping into the primer pocket and deactivating the round. This is important for all rounds, of course, but the Glaser isn''t known for particularly good sealing against such mishaps. You may also want to consider carrying two Glasers as the first rounds to be fired, and JHP loads for the rest. This gives you a bit of insurance if your assailant tucks himself behind a sheet rock wall or doorway or some other flimsy cover that JHP rounds can blast through.\n\nA Special Note on Snub-Nose .38 Revolvers With 2" or 3" Barrels: The Cor-Bon .38 Special +P 125 grain JHP and 158 grain LSWCHP FBI load are not the best choice for 2" or 3" barrel revolvers. The short barrel does not provide enough velocity to ensure reliable expansion with these load, and the unpleasant and hard-to-control recoil hurts snub-nose accuracy (as well as your hand). Controllability is crucial, and I recommend non +P standard pressure loads, for the .38 snub-nose.\n\nGood +P choices for a steel-frame 2" .38 snub-nose revolver are:\n\n* Federal 125 grain +P Nyclad LSWHP (P38N) - my preferred .38 2" barrel snub-nose revolver load (a.k.a. the "Chief''s Special" load, now available only to the police).\n* Federal 129 grain +P Hydra-shok JHP (P38HS1)\n* Remington 125 grain +P Golden Saber HPJ (GS38SB)\n* Cor-Bon 110 grain +P JHP - I would recommend this high-pressure load only for the sturdy (and heavy) Ruger SP101 snub-nose .38 or .357 Magnum revolver.\n\nStandard Pressure (non +P) Loads.\n\nIf you carry an aluminum-frame snub nose .38 (e.g. S&W Model 38 Bodyguard, 642, 442, 37, or Colt Cobra) I urge you to carry a standard pressure (non +P) .38 round. The best standard pressure .38 load is the Federal 125 grain Nyclad lead hollowpoint (P38M). This P38M hollowpoint - known as the "Chief''s Special load" - was specifically designed to expand at lower velocities and is the industry leader in standard pressure .38 rounds. This load is now available to police departments only.\n\nAnother acceptable standard pressure .38 load is the Winchester Silvertip 110 grain JHP (X38S9HP). A third possibility is the Federal Low Recoil Personal Defense 110 grain Hydra-Shok JHP load (PD38HS3 H)\n\nNote well: if you have a J-frame Smith & Wesson snub-nose .38 (i.e. the five-shot Model 36/37 Chief''s Special, Model 38/49/649 Bodyguard, the 640/642/442/940 Centennial) you can greatly improve the controllability of your gun by installing Uncle Mike''s "Boot Grip." This is a $14 godsend. The skinny little wooden grips that come on these guns are worthless. Installing good grips does wonders for your ability to control your .38 snub-nose revolver in rapid fire for more hits.\n\n9mm Parabellum (9mm Luger,9x19mm, 9mm NATO, or simply "9mm")\n\nThis is unquestionably the world''s most popular pistol round. For this reason it has been the subject of a lot of experimentation, because 9mm ball - used by every army in the Western world - is a mediocre manstopper. Jacketed hollowpoints are a must if one wishes to rely on the 9mm as a defense round. Use ball ammo for practice only.\n\n9mm ammunition is available in two pressure levels: standard and "+P." The latter should only be used in newer guns (made since 1985 or so), and is best used sparingly. I will deal here with only commercially available ammunition: there are specialized loads available only to law enforcement personnel. Civilians should not worry, as there are commercial loads as good or better than anything restricted to law enforcement usage.\n\nI will now tell you the best 9mm Luger load for self-defense: it is the Cor-Bon 9mm 115 grain +P Jacketed Hollowpoint. This is the most powerful and street-proven manstopper available in this caliber. It is a high velocity (1340 fps) and high pressure round, and more effective than any load restricted to law enforcement use (such as the Federal 9BPLE).\n\nUnfortunately, it is also likely to jam many older guns. For this reason I add a table at the end of the 9mm section discussing round suitability for different guns. Modern hollowpoints may either (a) jam, or (b) be too powerful for some older guns. This load is suitable only for First Class pistols (see table).\n\nThe best standard pressure 9mm load is the Federal 115 grain JHP (9BP). Its effectiveness and accuracy make it the world standard. Buy several boxes. Other excellent standard pressure 9mm loads are the Winchester Silvertip 115 grain (X9MMSHP), and Federal 124 grain Hydra-shok (P9HS1).\n\nFor guns that may jam with the Cor-Bon or Federal 115 grain hollow-points, the Remington 115 grain +P JHP is a good choice (R9MM6). For older guns I would use the Remington standard pressure 115 gr. JHP (R9MM1).\n\nNow it is time to impart some crucial information: NEVER use 147 grain ammo in a 9mm pistol! There was a stupid fad for 147 grain hollowpoints a few years ago, and many were suckered into buying these weak, worthless and malfunction-prone rounds. I don''t care what you''ve heard: never use any 9mm hollowpoint heavier than 125 grains. 147 grain hollowpoints often jam in many popular 9mm guns like the Browning Hi-Power, SIG, Beretta 92, S&W and Glock. Ignore the gun magazine hype and stick to what works. If you want to gamble, go to Reno. Don''t gamble with your life. 147 grain ammo sucks.\n\nBad 9mm Loads to avoid (and certainly NEVER carry). Numbers given:\n\nFederal Gold Medal 9mm 147 grain JHP (9MS)\nFederal Hydra-Shok 9mm 147 grain JHP (P9HS2)\nWinchester 147 grain 9mm Silvertip Subsonic JHP (X9MMST147)\nWinchester 147 grain 9mm Super-X Subsonic (XSUB9MM)\nRemington 147 grain 9mm JHP (R9MM8)\nRemington 147 grain 9mm Golden Saber JHP (GS9MMC)\nRemington 140 grain 9mm JHP (R9MM7)\nRemington 88 grain 9mm JHP (R9MM5) This bullet is far too light.\nCCI Lawman 147 grain 9mm PHP "Plated Hollow Point" (3619)\n\nTable Of 9mm Pistols.\n\n(Note: just because your pistol appears in Class 3, say, doesn''t mean it is unreliable: it may indeed feed hollowpoints. But you must fire at least 200 rounds of your chosen JHP carry load to determine if your pistol will feed them properly. I have placed pistols in each category according to reputation and experience. These are only meant as guidelines - your pistol may feed JHP rounds better - or worse - than this table indicates)\n\nFirst Class pistols are ultra-reliable and high-quality new guns than can feed any hollowpoint and tolerate +P loads with no problems: SIG/Sauer P220 series. Czech CZ75 and CZ85. Walther P5, P5C, and P88. Heckler and Koch USP and P7 series. All Glocks. All Ruger 9mm pistols. Taurus PT-99, PT-92 and PT-92C. Steyr GB. Beretta 92 series. Browning BDM and Hi-Power (if it says "Portugal" on the slide). All Smith & Wessons with a four-digit model number (e.g. 5906, 3913, 6904, 5903) and the Smith & Wesson 900 series. Star M28, M30, M31, and all Firestars, Megastars, and Ultrastars.\n\nSecond Class pistols are high quality guns that may not feed all hollowpoints reliably. Remington 115 gr. hollowpoints are recommended for these guns: Smith & Wessons with two or three digit model numbers (e.g. 659, 39-2, 469, 59, 39). Heckler and Koch VP70 and P9S. Beretta "Brigadier" M1951 and the Egyptian copy, the Interarms "Helwan." Colt M2000 "All-American" (now discontinued, for good reason), Colt Series 70 Government Model, Series 70 Commander. Astra A-70, A-75 and A-100. AMT "On Duty." Daewoo. Bersa ''Thunder 9''. EAA Witness, and all other CZ-75 copies (e.g. Tanfoglio, Tanarmi, Springfield Armory P9). Taurus PT-908. Walther P4. Star BK, BKM, Model B and ''Super.'' Browning Hi-Powers without the word "Portugal" on the slide. Llama Model 82. IMI "Jericho" and "Kareen."\n\nThird Class pistols should generally be loaded with ball for best reliability - experiment with your gun extensively before carrying JHP: Walther P38, P4 or P1. Luger. Llama. Maverick. MKS Model JS. Intratec CAT-9, DC-9, KG-9, etc. SWD Cobray Model 11/9 and similar models. Scarab Scorpion. Kimel AP-9. Bryco Jennings Model 59. All KBI Hungarian pistols (e.g. GKK, PJ9C, P9HK and other "FEG" products). "Norinco" or "Sportarms" Chinese Tokarev pistols. Lahti. Radom. MAB P15 and Model 1950.\n\n.38 Super\n\nCor-Bon, Winchester and Remington all make good jacketed hollow-points in .38 Super. I like the Cor-Bon 115 and 124 grain hollowpoints the best. The Remington will feed more smoothly in many guns, however, especially Colts and Colt M1911A1 copies like the Springfield Armory and Auto-Ordnance. The Llama .38 Super tends to jam with anything except ball.\n\n.357 Magnum\n\nThe most effective handgun round on the market - regardless of caliber - is the Federal .357 Magnum 125 grain jacketed hollowpoint (357B). This load has more stopping power than any other handgun bullet (and this includes more powerful rounds like the .41 and .44 Magnums). I advise all experienced revolver men to carry the legendary Federal 357B in a .357 revolver, or the equally good Remington full-power 125 grain semi-jacketed hollowpoint (R357M1).\n\nThere is one caveat, however. The 357B and other full-power .357 Magnums have a lot of blast and kick. If you are not comfortable with the buck and roar of full-house .357 Magnums, I would strongly suggest that you use a lower-recoil round. Controllability is important, and you will be able to fire lower-recoil rounds more rapidly and accurately. All of these .357 loads have excellent stopping power, so don''t worry that you are giving up too much.\n\nIn descending order of severity of recoil (i.e. the Silvertip kicks the most) I recommend the Winchester Silvertip 145 grain JHP (X357SHP), The Remington Golden Saber 125 grain JHP (GS357MA), Federal 110 gr. JHP (357D), Remington Medium Velocity 125 grain Semi-Jacketed Hollowpoint (R357M11) and the Cor-Bon 110 grain JHP. The latter two are excellent rounds I strongly recommend for .357 Magnum 2.5" and 3" barrel snub-nose revolvers like the S&W Models 66, 19, 65, 13, the Colt King Cobra, the Ruger GP100 and especially the small-frame Ruger SP101. If you still find that your .357 kicks too much, carry the Cor-Bon .38 Special+P 110 grain JHP discussed above. Two or three hits with good .38+P slugs beat any number of misses with .357 slugs.\n\nNote well: if you are using the factory wood stocks on your S&W or Taurus .357 revolver, you should try a set of rubber replacement grips. Ruger and Colt .357 Magnums come factory-equipped with recoil-absorbing ergodynamic rubber grips, and I have no idea why S&W and Taurus continue to put wood grips on their .357 revolvers. The difference in control is enormous. Get some good, compact rubber grips from Uncle Mike''s or Pachmayr and slap them onto your .357 revolver ASAP. I used to cringe every time I fired a full-power load in my .357 Magnum snub-nose. Once I put some compact Pachmayr grips on it, however, I had no problem firing the 357B accurately and rapidly. These grips only cost twenty bucks. Buy some.)\n\nOther good .357 Magnum loads.\n\nThe 125 grain jacketed hollowpoints by Cor-Bon, Winchester, and CCI are all good stoppers. The CCI Blazer 125 grain jacketed hollow-point is a very good buy, both for practice and self-defense use. The 110 grain jacketed hollowpoints by Winchester, CCI and Remington are all good for use in snub-nose revolvers, or for those sensitive to recoil. You never go wrong with a 110-125 grain .357 jacketed hollowpoint from the Big Five. All are great stoppers.\n\nCrappy .357 Magnum loads you should not carry for self-defense.\n\nNever carry soft-points, semi-wadcutters, or any of the 158 grain or 180 grain jacketed hollowpoints - these are solely for hunting or target use. Stick to jacketed hollowpoints under 150 grains in weight. The heavier bullets kick heavily and will shoot high and confuse you. All-lead bullets are okay for practice but you will have to spend twice as long cleaning your gun.\n\n.357 SIG\n\nI am unsure what advantage this caliber is supposed to have over the .40 S&W, but it is a good stopper. .357 SIG ballistics are quite impressive. Suggested loads:\n\n-Federal 125 grain jacketed hollowpoint (P357S1)\n-Hornady 124 grain JHP/XTP (#9130)\n-Remington 125 grain JHP (R357S1).\n\n.40 Smith & Wesson\n\nThis caliber has established an excellent track record on the street. Smith & Wesson and Winchester really did their research when they invented the .40 S&W. Your choice comes down to either the 180 grain jacketed hollowpoints or the 135-155 grain jacketed hollowpoints by Cor-Bon, Winchester, Federal, CCI or Remington. All are good stoppers, but the lighter weight bullets have the best stopping power records on the streets.\n\nThe real-world shooting database clearly favors the lighter 135-155 gr. JHP loads. I personally would carry the potent Cor-Bon 135 or 150 grain jacketed hollowpoint or the Winchester Silvertip 155 grain jacketed hollowpoint (X40SWSTHP). The 135-155 grain JHP kicks less and has higher kinetic energy and stopping power than the 180 gr. JHP loads. The 135 gr. JHP appears to be a real stopper.\n\nIn short, you cannot go wrong with the .40 S&W - unless you carry ball. Choose a good hollowpoint and stick with it. Leave the ball for practice (the CCI Blazer 180 grain TMJ is a good inexpensive practice round).\n\n10mm Auto\n\nThe 10mm is not living up to expectations. It was thought to be the ne plus ultra of pistol rounds when introduced in the late 1980''s, but hasn''t turned out to be superior to the better 9mm, .40 S&W or .45 ACP jacketed hollowpoints. This isn''t to say that the 10mm Auto sucks - it is a fine stopper. It''s just that we hoped for so much more.\n\n10mm Auto ammunition is available in two power levels, "full-house" and "medium velocity," as used by the FBI (sometimes called "10mm Lite"). The "full-house" loads should be left for hunting use: they kick heavily, blow right through assailants, and are very hard on your gun. Stick to the medium velocity ammo. I would pick the Cor-Bon 135 grain Nosler JHP, Federal 155 grain JHP (10E), or Federal Hydra-shok 155 gr. JHP (P40HS2). The "FBI load" is the 180 grain subsonic JHP, and Federal, Winchester, and Remington all produce good ones. Take your pick, but you are silly to ignore the superior real-world performance of the lighter 135-155 grain jacketed hollowpoints.\n\nThe potent Winchester Silvertip 175 grain JHP (X10MMSTHP) is close in power to the "full-house" loads, and may be a good choice for an experienced shooter who is used to heavy recoil. I personally would only carry the Silvertip or "full-house" loads in the field, where I might have to shoot big, cranky animals that seem interested in munching on my bodily parts. In this role the 10mm auto excels.\n\n.41 Magnum\n\nThe best defense choice for this hard-kicking caliber is the Winchester Silvertip 175 grain JHP (X41MSTHP2). The Remington 170 grain Semi-Jacketed Hollowpoint (R41MG3) is also a good round.\n\n.44 Special\n\nBy far the best choice for your .44 Special revolver is the Cor-Bon 180 grain JHP. Glasers or the Winchester Silvertip 200 grain JHP (X44STHPS2) are also good rounds, particularly for any 5-shot .44 revolver.\n\n.44 Magnum\n\nThe blast and kick of this powerful caliber make it less than optimum for defense use, despite what you have seen in the movies. Cor-Bon''s 180 grain or Federal''s 180 grain (44B) medium-velocity JHP are the hands-down choices in this caliber. Glasers, the Winchester Silvertip 210 grain JHP (X44MSTHP2) or the Federal 240 grain Hydra-shok (P44HS1) are also acceptable choices.\n\n.45 ACP (occassionally called "11.43x23mm" by some silly Europeans)\n\nThe .45 ACP is a recognized manstopper, and there are many excellent loads in this caliber. Some of the best:\n\n- Federal 230 grain Hydrashok JHP (P45HS1): a great load, and my #1 choice. It gives the most stopping power in this potent caliber.\n- Federal 185 grain JHP (45C) another top-notch load from Federal. I would choose this round for a compact, short-barrelled .45 like the Colt Officer''s ACP or the S&W 4516. It has lighter recoil than the Hydrashok or CCI 200 JHP, and its higher velocity makes it more likely to expand out of a short 3.5" barrel.\n- Cor-Bon 185 grain Sierra JHP\n- CCI Lawman 200 gr. JHP (3965). a.k.a. the "Inspector" or "Flying Ashtray."\n- CCI Blazer 200 gr. JHP (3568). The "Flying Ashtray" in an economical aluminum case. Both of these CCI loads use a wide-mouth hollowpoint bullet that may jam some guns. It is 100% reliable in newer guns like the current production "enhanced" Colt 1911A1, the SIG/Sauer P220, Star M45 Firestar and Megastar, and all Smith & Wesson, Para-Ordnance, and Ruger .45 automatics and the Smith & Wesson Model 625 revolver. (Note well: if you are one of those knuckleheads who install light springs in your gun to get a lighter trigger pull you are asking for trouble. Never use CCI ammo in such a gun, as CCI uses especially hard primers and your hammer might not be able to detonate the round reliably, now that you have monkeyed with it.)\n- Remington 185 grain JHP (R45AP2). This is the best choice for older guns that may jam with other hollow-points. I would select this load for the Heckler and Koch P9S, Browning BDA, Springfield Armory, AMT and Thompson M1911A1, Llama, Star PD, etc.\n- Cor-Bon and Remington .45+P 185 grain JHP (R45AP6). These are very powerful and hard-kicking rounds best left to the experienced shooter. They are pretty hard on your gun, especially an aluminum-framed pistol like the SIG/Sauer P220 or Colt Lightweight Commander. If you are sufficiently expert to confidently carry the .45+P you certainly don''t need my advice on load selection. That being said, these +P rounds are second only to the famed Hydra-shok in stopping power. They really sledgehammer the bad guys down.\n\nOther good .45 ACP loads.\n\nThe Winchester Silvertip 185 grain JHP (X45ASHP2), CCI Gold Dot and Remington Golden Saber (GS45APB) are all good choices. If you like them, fine, but they have no edge over loads mentioned above. I say stick to the tried and true.\n\nBall.\n\nSave the 230 grain ball (FMJ) loads for practice; carry FMJ ammo only if you must because your gun jams with hollowpoints. The Llama, Federal Ordnance, AMT, and Auto-Ordnance M1911A1 copies often jam with anything except 230 grain ball. Never compromise when it comes to reliability: if your gun only feeds ball, then ball is what you carry.\n\n.45 Colt\n\nI hope your self-defense .45 Colt is a good double-action design like the Smith & Wesson Model 25 and not some single-action hunting gun. Load your revolver with the Cor-Bon 200 grain JHP. The Federal 225 gr. Lead Semi-Wadcutter Hollowpoint (45LCA) or Winchester 225 gr. Silvertip JHP (X45CSHP2) are also good.\n\n\n\nSHOTGUN AMMUNITION BY CALIBER (Gauge)\n\nThe shotgun is the ne plus ultra of manstoppers. No doubt you have heard a lot of nonsense about the lethality of "assault rifles" and "sub-machine guns" and the like. The fact is that the shotgun is the most effective firearm for short-range personal defense. For example: an Uzi or Heckler & Koch sub-machine gun has about 340 ft-lbs. of impact energy - a 12 gauge shotgun has 2500 to 3100 ft-lbs. of impact energy.\n\nThe shotgun is not a magic weapon that will slay all foes. Like all other guns, it must be aimed at a specific target. Buckshot loads will not "sweep" a room. "Close" still only counts in horseshoes. Aim your shotgun from the shoulder (like a rifle) if you intend to hit an aggressor.\n\nI invoke the Ascended Master, Massad Ayoob: "It is perhaps the most efficient close-range killing machine in the world''s arsenal of small arms." For a discussion of the shotgun''s strengths and weaknesses I refer all interested parties to Ayoob''s excellent and comprehensive book ''The Truth About Self-Protection'' (truly the best $8.95 investment you''ll ever make), which discusses every element of self-defense from locks, chemical sprays and alarms to defensive driving, firearms and defending yourself against dogs. A more in-depth treatment of the issue may be found in Ayoob''s book-length volume on shotgun technique, ''Stressfire II: Advanced Combat Shotgun''.\n\nA Note On Terminology\n\nShotgun ammunition falls into three general categories:\n\nBUCKSHOT - shell loaded with large-diameter lead balls (.24" and up) used for big game hunting and self-defense. The number of pellets in 12 gauge buck-shot varies from eight .36" balls in "000 buck" to 27 .24" pellets in "#4 buck". Buckshot ratings are archaic and hard to understand (as are shotgun specifications and ammunition in general), but thankfully there isn''t much you need to learn. Simply write down the recommended loads, walk into your local gunshop and announce your desired ammunition (note that "00" is pronounced "double ought" and "000" is pronounced "triple ought." Don''t say "zero zero" or "oh-oh-oh buckshot" in front of gunshop employees. Then practice with both your selected defense load and low-cost birdshot to fully familiarize yourself with the operation of your gun and its terminal performance (e.g. patterns at various distances, the startling effects of buckshot on ballistic melons).\n\nBIRDSHOT- small-diameter pellets used for bird hunting. Its stopping power is poor, except when used at very close range - out to 20-30 feet. For that reason it is not generally recommended, except for home defense use. \n\nSLUGS are solid lead bullets for shotgun use. These are big, heavy, fat hunks of soft lead that have enormous stopping power (e.g. a typical 12 gauge slug is .73" caliber and weighs 438 grains - a 9mm bullet is .355" and 115 grains). Slugs must be carefully aimed to be effective. It is important to remember, however, that shotguns must be aimed with shot, too. Do not for a minute think that you can simply point your shot-loaded shotgun at the foe and let loose. Shotguns must be skillfully aimed and fired just like hand-guns and rifles.\n\n.410 Gauge\n\nNone of the above really applies in this weak caliber. The .410 is only a half-way decent manstopper with slugs. Choose the Federal Classic (F412RS) or Winchester Super-X (X41RS5) 1/5 ounce (88 grain) hollowpoint slug. Never use birdshot. American Derringer Corp. has produced an odd buckshot load for the .410 (withthree 000 pellets), and I advise you to ignore it. Lose the .410 and buy a 20 gauge pump shotgun.\n\n20 Gauge\n\nThe 20 is an excellent self-defense caliber, particularly for those who dislike the recoil of the 12 gauge. I recommend the 20 gauge over the more popular 12 for home defense. Choose the 20 gauge 3" shell Federal "Classic" #2 buckshot (F207-2-5PK) with 18 pellets, or the Winchester "Double XX" Magnum #3 with 24 pellets (X203C3B). If your gun cannot accept 3" shells choose the Remington #3 with 20 pellets (SP20BK5PK-3). All of these loads provide definitive short-range stopping power.\n\nI specifically recommend the 20 gauge for women and recoil-sensitive men who dislike the blast and recoil of the 12 gauge. "Delivering roughly the ballistic force of two .44 Magnum rounds at once," comments the knowledgeable Ayoob, the 20 "delivers 75% of the lead for only 50-60% of the recoil". Many police departments have found their officers shoot much more accurately in realistic training exercises with the lighter-kicking but still potent 20 gauge.\n\nIf you are new to shotgunning and considering getting one for self-defense I strongly urge you to buy the reliable and reasonably-priced "Mossberg 500 Special Purpose" 18.5" barrel 20 gauge pump shotgun (catalog #50451). This tried-and-true workhorse is the standard shotgun of the U.S. Armed Forces and costs a little over $200. You''ll be much happier with the lighter-kicking 20 gauge than the 12 gauge version used by the military, and - most importantly - you''ll shoot the 20 more accurately and rapidly.\n\nFor an in-depth look at the 20-versus-12 gauge issue I recommend all shotgun owners (and potential shotgun owners) read ''Stressfire II: Advanced Combat Shotgun'' by Massad Ayoob. Perhaps I am beginning to sound like a broken record on the theme of Ayoob''s books, but once you''ve read them you''ll understand why I recommend them so highly (and repeatedly). Note: Ayoob dislikes the 20 gauge Remington 870 pump shotgun and recommends you choose the Mossberg 500 in 20 gauge for general self-defense and home-defense use. So do I.\n\nFor ultra-close range home defense birdshot will do the trick. Choose any #4, BB or larger high brass lead hunting load, and have the balance of the magazine filled with #3 buck in case the birdshot doesn''t put them down fast enough.\n\nAvoid slug use in 20 gauge; you are better off defending yourself with buckshot. If you must use slugs, pick the Dynamit/Nobel or Federal "Classic" (F203-RS) rifled slugs. Using slugs requires careful aiming and rifle sights: few 20 gauge shotguns have the latter.\n\n16 Gauge\n\nThe 16 has slipped in popularity with Americans. As a result, no shotguns made specifically for defense are available in 16. If you have a sporting 16, however, it can do double duty as a great defense gun. Choose the Federal "Classic" #1 (F164-1) or the Remington #1 (SP16BK-5PK) buckshot load.\n\n12 Gauge\n\nIf you simply want to know the best defense load, go out and buy: 12 gauge 2 3/4" shell 00 buckshot. You shall live happily ever after, as this is the most effective man-stopping firearm cartridge yet devised by man. I recommend the Federal "Classic" (F127-00), Winchester Super-X (X12RB5) or Remington Buckshot (SP12BK-5PK00) as the best double-ought buckshot defense rounds. One of these rounds is virtually equal to a nine-round burst from a submachine gun, with every round hitting.\n\nEffective shotgun technique, of course, requires that one hits with each shot. Don''t think that you can merely point the shotgun in the general direction of your attacker and let fly. Read Ayoob''s book ''Stressfire II: Advanced Combat Shotgun'' for the low-down on good shotgun skills and then practice, practice, practice.\n\nMany experienced shooters prefer #4 or #1 buckshot to 00. I really cannot argue, but Lt. Marshall is on record as stating that 00 is superior, both in penetration and stopping power. Good enough for me, but if you have a #4 or #1 buckshot jones, go ahead (Ayoob favors #1). Stay away from 2 3/4" Magnum or 3" Magnum loads, however - the brutal kick of these rounds makes them a bad choice, and you gain nothing in stopping power over the 2 3/4" standard loads. Controllability is important, and standard 12 gauge shells have quite enough kick as it is.\n\nA note on shotgun spread: firing your shotgun does not create a diabolical cone of doom destroying all in its path. If you have a typical defense or "riot" gun with an 18"-20" open-choked "cylinder" barrel, the pellets will spread out about 1" for every yard of range. This means that the spread of pellets fired across a large room (18'') will be 6" or so, a circle the size of a coffee cup saucer. At 50 feet, the spread will be the size of a large pizza (16"). Test-fire your shotgun at various ranges, using big white butcher paper targets to get an idea of the pattern you can expect. It is a common misconception that blasting at foes ten feet away will take out two or three of them. The spread at that range is just three inches, so you can see that I meant it when I said that the shotgun must be skillfully aimed and fired just like handguns and rifles. The shotgun is simply more likely to hit - and stop - the attacker.\n\nSlugs are potent manstoppers, but have limited application for self-defense. Slugs have ferocious recoil and often over-penetrate. There are special situations where slugs might be preferred over buckshot (e.g. road-blocks, barricaded foes), but if you are interested in such esoterica I again direct you to Ayoob''s masterful tome ''Stressfire II: Advanced Combat Shotgun''. This guide is for general civilian readers; policemen, soldiers, and gun enthusiasts should rely on Ayoob''s in-depth expertise.\n\nDon''t be a knucklehead. Stay away from weirdo rounds like rubber buckshot or neoprene slugs. These are riot-control rounds designed for massed police use against violent mobs. Don''t rely on such marginalia to save your life.\n\nTwo things to keep in mind about birdshot. The first is that birdshot is as lethal as buckshot at close range. Don''t believe for a second that you can just wound someone with birdshot and he''ll go on to live another day. If you aren''t justified in killing a man, you aren''t justified in wounding him, either. Never "shoot to wound." I once again direct you to read Ayoob''s ''In the Gravest Extreme'' and learn the truth.\n\nThe second thing is that birdshot makes a lot of sense for home defense. I keep my home-defense 12 gauge loaded with two #4 birdshot rounds followed by 00 buck. Birdshot is much less likely to penetrate thin interior walls and kill innocent people on the other side, and has lower recoil than buckshot for faster follow-up shots (I live in a thin-walled apartment house, however - if I lived in a solid house with a lot of land around, I would definitely choose buckshot instead). The stopping power of birdshot should not be under-estimated: at ranges out to thirty feet or so, birdshot is virtually a solid column of lead. Choose any #4 or BB high brass lead hunting load. I like the Federal "Classic Lead Hi-Brass" #4 birdshot (HI26-4) and Winchester "Super-X" #4 high brass birdshot (X12-4), but there is little difference between the various choices. Buy whichever you please. If you''re a bird hunter, use your favorite hunting shells as long as they are #6 or larger.\n\n10 Gauge\n\nYow. Load your 10 gauge with whatever the hell you want.\n\n\n\nRIFLE AMMUNITION BY CALIBER\n\nRifles aren''t a great choice for most self-defense applications. Quoth Ayoob: "The rifle is not well suited to the sudden, close-quarters deployment and maneuvering that is required of a defensive firearm. On the battlefield, yes. In civilian close combat, no way." Ayoob adds that "the rifle is too bulky for maneuvering through doors and hallways, too long to quickly and surreptitiously pick up when the attacker drops his guard, and too easy for the criminal to take away if the homeowner''s attention is diverted."\n\nThat being said, if all you have is a rifle then a rifle is what you use. Some liberal-infested cities ban handgun ownership (Chicago, New York, Detroit), so you are stuck using shotguns and rifles for home defense. Take some comfort from the fact that rifles have better stopping power, are a strong visual deterrent, and are much easier to hit with than any handgun. On a ranch or farm a rifle may be quite appropriate under certain circumstances today, just as it was on the frontier. Never use ball (FMJ) for self-defense in a rifle.\n\n.22 Long Rifle\n\nA good .22 autoloading, pump, or lever action rifle like the Ruger 10/22, Marlin Model 60, Remington Model 572, or Marlin Model 39 can do the job when nothing else is available. Use any high-velocity round (I like the CCI Stinger, Remington Yellow Jacket, or CCI "SGB" hunting load, #0058) and fire repeatedly. Multiple hits are crucial with a .22: shoot and shoot and shoot some more. Stay away from the after-market large-capacity magazines made by Ram-Line, Eagle, Hot Lips, etc: these plastic nightmares are unreliable, jam-prone and easily breakable.\n\n.22 Magnum (.22 WMR)\n\nAny jacketed hollowpoint. Try the Winchester Super-X 40 grain JHP, CCI ''Maxi-Mag'' 40 grain HP (0024), or whatever you prefer.\n\n.223 Remington (5.56x45mm NATO)\n\nThis is the standard NATO rifle round and one of the best choices for a self-defense rifle. Many top-notch rifles are (or were) available in this caliber: the Colt AR-15, Ruger Mini-14, Steyr AUG, FN FNC, et cetera.\n\nAll .223 hollowpoints are good stoppers. I really like the Federal 40 grain P223V high-velocity hollowpoint (formerly called the "Blitz" round). Marshall says this is the #1 urban defense load. It is lighter than other .223 bullets, however, so you''ll need to adjust your sights if you carry the P223V (it shoots lower than all other .223 loads).\n\nIf you want better penetration than the P223V offers, choose any good 55-69 grain hollowpoint from a big name manufacturer (I like Federal). Softpoints offer even greater penetration, probably more than you need.\n\nNote: older .223 guns with a 1 in 12" rifling twist shoot more accurately with 55 grain bullets (as they were designed for the old U.S. Army M193 ball round). Newer rifles with a faster 1 in 7" twist (this includes the AR-15A2 and nearly all European models) prefer the heavier 60-70 grain bullets (like the M855/SS109 ball round). Ruger Mini-14 rifles have a 1 in 10" twist and do well with either bullet weight. This is only important at longer ranges. Save the cheapo ball rounds for practice.\n\n7.62x39mm Soviet(7.62 mm Russian Short, 7.62 mm M43 Combloc)\n\nSome prefer this East Bloc cartridge to the .223 for defense use. It is an excellent round, most commonly used in SKS and AK-47 derived rifles, as well as the Ruger Mini-30. Use any 123-125 grain softpoint from Cor-Bon, Federal, Winchester, or Remington. PMC makes a good low-priced 125 grain softpoint (PMC762B) you might like if you have a lot of magazines to fill.\n\n.30 M1 Carbine\n\nNever use ball in your M1 for defense! .30 Carbine ball sucks, but .30 Carbine hollowpoints work very well. Buy the Winchester 110 grain Hollow Soft Point (X30M1) and forsake all others. I mean it.\n\n.30-30 Winchester\n\nThis hoary old round has survived so long for a simple reason: it works. Load your Winchester or Marlin .30-30 lever-action rifle with any hollowpoint - I recommend the Federal 125 grain (3030C). Leave the soft-points for hunting and practice.\n\n.308 Winchester (7.62x51mm NATO)\n\nThis is an excellent rifle cartridge, perhaps the best. Over-penetration is the biggest problem. Use fast opening bullets of 150 grains or less. The Nosler Ballistic Tip, Hornady V-Max, and Remington Accu-Tip are examples of quick-opening bullets that are available in several brands of factory loaded ammunition.\n\n9mm Parabellum\n\nGenerally the same as for pistols, above. Heckler & Koch, Uzi and Colt 9mm carbines will feed anything, so I recommend the Cor-Bon 115 or 124 grain +P JHP and Remington 115 grain jacketed hollow-points (R9MM1). Any reliable hollowpoint is a good choice in a 9mm carbine and the long barrel makes for high velocity and increased effectiveness.\n\n.30-06 Springfield\n\nThis excellent and time-proven cartridge has too many top-notch loads to list. Choose the same bullets mentioned in connection with the .308 Winchester (above).\n\n.357 Magnum\n\nFollow the guidelines for revolvers, above. The .357 makes an excellent carbine round for urban self-defense in Marlin or Winchester lever-action or Action Arms/Israeli Military Industries "Timber Wolf" .357 pump-action carbines.\n\n.44 Magnum\n\nPick any good hollowpoint, using the guidelines for revolvers (above). Don''t be tempted to use softpoints; these hunting rounds will blow right through your foe.', '');

Stoeger cougar  no doubt has no beretta logo on that but stoeger itself a big name,importers and manufacturers as well...whether any one agrees or not Stoeger Cougar is in actuality a beretta cougar... if some one says that its not that accurate then what about PX 4 and other compact sized pistols???!!! Why can we make an anti craft gun out of a compact sized pistol and any pistol is not more than a side arm...If some one really requires a long range pistol then 7.62mm and off course Five Seven HGS work,  i had cz 999 for more  than an year with me...i fired many rounds through it...can''t tell u the amout of fired rounds as i don''t keep the count...it cud fire any cartride so well...it was not the comparison of hgs of diff price range like cz for 45 k and hp 77b for 30 k... i just said that these both are clones of sig 226 and hp 77 b is a better clone than cz also for less price...Now i m having hp 77 b... i dont know y i prefer chinese weapons more than serbian... cud be the matter of personal choice... like i m having chinese and serbian tts both these days; also i had been having 4 russian tts at different times but i have more faith in chinese than any of those... well i might have under estimated the baikal pistols ...but the place where i hail from is a total gun culture...   baikal hand guns as well as taurus  including pt 92/99 have been totally rejected by every one here... People here love to have any sort of weapons... from pistols to heavy weapons like ak47/56/101, ak74,aks74u,  m16, ar15, LMGs etc etc and they are quite good at it, knowing their guns so well...So here i wud say majority is authority.... no other hand gun is that popular as Stoeger Cougar is...I simply love stoeger cougar not because i m having it btw its my 3rd stoeger pistol... whenever i sold stoeger for any other HG i had to repurchase no other hg except stoeger.... Dear 12 gauge i was not at all comparing semi auto with pump action, i was alike i sometimes back planed to have saiga shot gun;later i ve to drop the idea of having it as it was around 150 k n these days available in 85 k range but so far reviews i collected in my area were not really positive, since i already own a winchester pump action , it works & i m content with it... inspite of all this if some one wants me to have baikal shot gun or hg then i wud warmly n happily accept a gift...:D', ''),

This happens due to following reasons:\n\n-  Wear / damage to feed ramp after extensive use\n-  Surface of feed ramp becoming rough after extensive firing / use. \n-  Incorrect alignment of feed ramp with the chamber at the time of feeding because every time the barrel rotates in a way located in the connector and must get perfectly aligned with the feed ramp every time. \n-  Depositing of dirt / residue in the feed ramp while firing. \n\n[b]Because of any of above reasons, occasional failures to feed can occur in pistols like Stoeger Cougar and CF98.

(94924, ' Selecting one handgun out of above mentioned is no big deal especially for a no LE, no military or no para military type of person that you are. \n\nNever forget.. There is a military guy and there is a civilian guy. Two different breeds. \n\nLE and military people have requirements and specification sheets containing those requirements. A normal gun enthusiast at best may imitate those requirements but should never over look their practicality. Shooting a pistol for hobby, sports and SD/HD is one thing, and having it as a side arm is a total different concept. \n\nMilitary guys HAVE to use those selected pistols in their service which they even dont personally like enough, but they still use it as these weapons fulfill the role and requirement specification of that particular institute, which is the military.\nSo the military guy has to give up in personal preferences department, to say A LOT, just to be the military guy.. Bound and restricted in choice of weapons. Hope you get my point.\n\nCivilian guy gets all the fun. His life is colourful. Same applies in his gun hobby. There is no restrictions or go by the command thingy involved. He can have as many and as diverse of gun collection for his self. Even if he is a military guy and plans to collect and shoot weapons as a part time hobby, he has a plathora of choices to boot it in.\n\nMy friends, there are sometimes when civilian guy purchases a weapon for a specific need. Although those specific needs may not be very rigid and mandatory as requirement specs of a military organization, they tend to give him a few points on which he can accept or reject a specific model. e.g Barrel length, weight, round capacity etc\n\nNot to forget... weapon is a personal thing, endorsed by the license of an individual only. So it must be purchased with the priority of personal preference kept in mind. No doubt at times you need to mesh your personal preferences with your specific needs as well. It is all about it. Read below:\n\n\n[b]1- Personal preference and likeness[/b]\nBecause if you dont, you will never be as happy to have a weapon which is totally based on someone else''s opinion. e.g If you regard the opinion of wheel gun being more reliable than semi-auto.. simply take it. No remorse. \nIf you prefer the idea of high capacity, do count on it. \nYou like a beautful looking piece, go for it. \nAll these would give you a certain amount of reliability and dependability that would work for you. Stop too much imitation of SF or SAS commando (they are simply different breeds and not you). \nYou like .45 and feel more grandeur with it, pick a 45 bar none.\nYou like to use gun on targets more often, pick a 5 incher, hard to conceal and carry but not impossible. \nYou have a great grip and trigger, and you prefer it over the looks department, come one pick that one up.\n\n[b]2- Specific requirement of yours[/b]\ne.g you trasnfer cash from city to city, people know that you travel with money. A Vulnerable disposition. You are a public man as well. Your gun choice would be a short barrel, compact frame light weight pistol that you can carry all day properly concealed with great amount of ease and comfort.\nYou need to be in competition. Go for a competition gun, although they are ugly mostly but you need to be specific about the very requirement of yours.\nYour are a seasonal shooter, a practical sports shooter. Never forget the importance of a good crisp trigger and rightly meshed grip, longer sighting radius, 5 inch barrel etc\n\nIt is a give and take game, ONLY YOU are to decide it. Nothing is impossible in this game. If you need to conceal for self defense and at the same time feel good with your 5inch .45 only, do it. Bear the weight and have it all. On the other hand if you dont have such romantic type feelings about any specific gun, ideally take a .357mag snub wheel gun, a makarov etc\n\nSo start thinking... and lay your preferences down on a paper it would help you decide and keep a track of your findings.\n\nRegards', ''),

You can certainly walk up to a dealer who has an import license. Ask him to import it. \n\nAs a side note: Beretta has modified it''s Design to avoid breakage of the locking wings. They have modified the cornered wings to more rounded wings. The new Beretta Locking Blocks have been tested to withstand hard use of 40,000 to 50,000 rounds.

Stoeger is a small time turkish company that only specializes in making cougar 8000 and semi auto shotguns. the over and under shotguns are made in Brazil and not to be confused with Stoeger of Brazil.\n\none more quick fact: stoeger only makes frames, slides and other small parts on the Beretta machinery provided by beretta. the barrel is hammer forged at MKEK installation. whereas Zastava arms has its own hammer forging equipment. that equipment alone costs more than the total stoeger facility.\n\nanother quick fact: Zastava arms has a diversified product line from civilian arms to military firearms. Zastava arms also has a long history of producing quality and is a many times larger exporter of firearms and is many times a larger company when compared to stoeger industries.\n\nanother quick fact: Zastava CZ999 is not a clone of Sig, it just looks like one. even if we assume its a clone, then would you rather have a clone of a time proven design (Sig226) or a clone of short lived design (Beretta Cougar 8000). yes! it was very short lived. the only way to salvage the loss investment was to transfer the equipment to a no-name company to capture the low end market. dont take my word for it. google it. this history is all over the net.\n\nanother quick fact: CZ999 is produced by a company that produces firearms for an active military plus CZ999 is a standard military sidearm. now thats pedigree. whereas stoeger has no war/military portfolio. now should I be concerned about stoeger''s heritage?\n\nanother quick fact: CZ999 (presumably) is based on Sig design, now thats something. whereas Stoegar Cougar is based on Beretta Cougar. a design that ran for how many years before being dropped in the favor of PX storm? hint: less than 10 years. what does that tell ya?\n\nRegards.', ''),

(95026, ' Budha Khan sahib, we are all here to exchange knowledge, arn''t we. Gunning down other person''s point of view and proving him wrong is just not the purpose I believe. And I hope our discussion would also remain an exchange of knowledge (based on proven and tested ground facts) and we all in the end would stand more educated on the subject. :)\n\nAs Idrees Taj sahib very comprehensively explained, selection of a handgun for himself is really one''s personal matter because only that person knows his likings and limitations with regard to buying a particular handgun. Therefore, we should just discuss the capabilities of different handguns here, bringing out their strong and weak points in the light of proven ground experience. We should leave it up to the members to buy this or that gun, whichever they deem appropriate for themselves. All members are wise enough to make their own decision and so should they be. \n\nNow a few comments;   \n\n\n[quote=Budha Khan] ...but the place where i hail from is a total gun culture...   baikal hand guns as well as taurus  including pt 92/99 have been totally rejected by every one here... .... no other hand gun is that popular as Stoeger Cougar is...[/quote]\nI find this logic quite amusing. Beretta made 92fs during 70s and it became the best gun Beretta ever produced and one of the best guns ever produced in the world. The top army in the world adopted it as its official sidearm after carrying out a comprehensive trial with guns like Sig P226 and CZ75. Even after more than 30 years, 92fs still remains Beretta''s bestseller. \n\nBeretta also produced Cougar 8000 in 1994 (almost 20 years after 92fs) and it just proved out to be a mediocre gun, could not compete with other guns in the same size like Glock 19, Sig P229, HKP7, Colt Commander etc. Beretta discontinued manufacturing Cougar 8000 in 2003-2004. \n\nIn 2003-2004, Beretta shifted two of its plants. 92fs plant was shifted to Brazil, under Beretta''s management, and Taurus started producing PT92 and PT99 on it, copies of Beretta''s best ever gun. However, Beretta kept manufacturing 92fs in Italy on a newly installed plant, simply because it was a best seller. Taurus PT92 and PT99 also became best sellers because they were the copies of a very highly rated gun and more importantly, they were performing almost equally well and costed less than 92fs (In Pakistan only, in US Beretta 92fs and Taurus PT92 and PT99 more or less cost the same).  \n\nSecond plant was shifted to Turkey. Stoeger started producing Cougar on the plant. However, Beretta did not feel like continuing with Cougar 8000 in Italy and rather introduced a new pistol called PX4 Storm (which has many similarities with Cougar in fact but has a different name). Cougar 8000 was not selling that well so Beretta wanted to get rid of the name and find a new name which turned out to be PX4 Storm. \n\n[b]Now both the pistols are available in Pakistan, more or less in the same price. I find it very difficult to understand why Taurus PT92 and PT99, which is based on the best ever Beretta model and which has been manufactured on the same original Beretta plant, has been totally rejected by people of your area and why Stoeger Cougar, which is based on a mediocre Beretta model that was discontinued by Beretta itself, is the most popular handgun in your area? Any rationale or logic for this?[/b] \n\n[quote=Budha Khan]...i just say if some one goes for cz 999 than Stoeger only because of  5 k price difference then it wud be alike "penny wise pound fool"... [/quote]\nSir, personally speaking, [b]I wont go for CZ999 because of 5k price difference, I would go for it because I consider it a far more superior gun than Stoeger Cougar.[/b] Yes, if CZ999 is costing 45k and Cougar costs 30k and I am short of money than I may buy a Cougar, though HP77B, Zastava CZ70 and CF98 would be in strong competition. \n\n\n[quote=Budha Khan]...whether any one agrees or not Stoeger Cougar is in actuality a beretta cougar... if some one says that its not that accurate then what about PX 4 and other compact sized pistols???!!! Why can we make an anti craft gun out of a compact sized pistol and any pistol is not more than a side arm...If some one really requires a long range pistol then 7.62mm and off course Five Seven HGS work..........[/quote]\nYes no doubt Stoeger Cougar is Beretta Cougar 8000 which was just an ordinary Beretta pistol and faded away from the scene just like so many other other ordinary pistols made by many famous companies. And only a fool would expect a compact pistol to perform like an anti air craft gun. However, a normal person would have certainly liked his Beretta Cougar 8000 to perform like Glock 19, CZ75 Compact, CZ2025 Rami, Sig P229, HK P7, HK 2000 etc simply because they were pistols of more or less the same size and he was paying more or less the same price.   \n\n[quote=12gauge] Zastava arms has a diversified product line from civilian arms to military firearms. Zastava arms also has a long history of producing quality and is a many times larger exporter of firearms and is many times a larger company when compared to stoeger industries.[/quote]\nAbsolutely right. Zastava Arms (Carvena Zastava formerly) was established in 1853 and is known for making quality fire arms since more than a century. It was Zastava''s bad luck that after 1945 when this whole world changed, they found themselves locked behind the iron curtains. They kept producing weapons for their country''s army but could never get an access or media coverage in the world market. In my view, firearms from Eastern European countries (Czechoslovakia, Russia and Serbia) are of high quality but they have never been able to get kind of coverage in the media that their counterparts in the West get. We are lucky that we can buy these classy weapons cheap in Pakistan.  \n\n[quote=Aquarius]@12gauge... very nice input indeed but Beretta company stopped manufacturing of Cougar 8000 because they too wanted a gun with polymer frame therefore they switch over to px4 storm..& shifted the cougar factory to the new location(Turkey)..[/quote]\nSir, Beretta wanted a new name. Otherwise they had no problems in continuing with Cougar 8000 and yet introduce PX4 Storm at the same time. Had Cougar 8000 been bringing good business, Beretta would have never stopped producing it, just like it did for 92fs.\n\nthanks and regards', ''),

Part of the deal was that Beretta construct a Brazilian factory and use Brazilian labor. This they did, in the southwestern coastal city of Sao Paulo.

Taurus now owned everything that once belonged to Beretta, including drawings, tooling, machinery, and a very experienced work force. Taurus was in the pistol business, and immediately sought to improve on the Beretta design, resulting in the popular and acclaimed Taurus PT-92 and PT-99 9mm pistols."[/i]\nSource: [url]http://www.taurususa.com/history.cfm[/url]', ''),

(95055, ' @Budha Khan, Sensei and all stoeger lovers\n\nthe objective of this debate is not to prove that stoeger cougar is not a good weapon platform or its not a good design or its manufacturing is not what is called ideal.\n\nStoeger Cougar 8000 is not doubt a good design and quality firearm but when we start comparing a stoeger cougar 8000 to a similarly priced handgun such as CZ999, that is where we beg to disagree and part from the Stoeger lover crowd and start sounding a bit like a stoeger basher.\n\nagain! I must insist that we are not saying that a stoegar cougar is not a good handgun. all we are saying that "when compared to a similarly priced handgun, SC8000 offers nothing exceptional"\n\nLets compare a SC8000 to CZ999 or NP22 or Canik55 Piranha (I believe all these are somewhat similarly priced handguns) and see why SC8000 is nothing special.\n\nWHY:\n\n1. Stoeger Industries has no history (10 to 20 years counts for nothing in firearms business)\n2. Cougar 8000 design was very short lived and was discarded in less than 10 years after its inception. who cares about the reason or why it happened. bottom line is that it did happen. some of the best designs currently are all over 35 years and with one design almost touching 100 years.\n3. Even Stoeger Industries doesnt have the complete manufacturing facilities. the barrels are hammer forged by MKEK which provides similar services to almost all major firearms manufacturers in Turkey.\n4. the rotating lock mechanism employed in SC8000 is nothing new. and there must be a reason why 9 out every 10 handgun designs in the world doesnt employ rotating lock.\n5. Even in turkey, the SC8000 doesnt enjoy the status of best selling HG. the title is with Zigana.\n6. when compared to HG designs of similar price, SC8000 doesnt employ any time tested design such as 92 or p226 or cz75. thing with low budget firearms is that "proven design matters" alot. it compensates for any inherent manufacturing flaws and also compensates for any lack of testing/prototyping of an original design.\n7. Stoegar industries has no war or military portfolio. in my humble opinion, this matters a lot. you''ll find that all famous handguns have come out of manufacturing facilities that at some point had huge war/military backing. "war is the best teacher when it comes to refining the tools of war"\n8. SC8000 is not a military sidearm. it never had any military backing. even the Turkish opted for a Zigana when it came to their standard service sidearm. retrospectively speaking, all famous handguns of our time were employed by institutions of war at some point. glock, beretta, sig, hk, all have walked those lines before being labeled as the very best. in my opinion, this should be a major factor and should be considered before buying any HG.\n9. the rotating lock mechanism employed in SC8000 is nothing new and considered less than ideal for a "hell and back" reliable HG. though I must insist that it is known to be superior in terms of accuracy. but then again, SC8000 is not a target HG, its a combat HG. so, in my opinion, its claim for superior accuracy is sort of irrelevant.\n10. SC8000 when launched in Pakistan was priced over 100K then it fell to around 45K. this should be enough proof that this HG offers nothing exceptional. I know supply and demand phenomenon plays an important role here but heck! if it were that good, i''m sure demand would have definitely outpaced supply, pulling up the prices in the process. NO! demand pulls, supply pushes.\n\nnow if you take those 10 points that i''ve listed above and apply them to CZ 999 Scorpion, you''ll immediately know that it is a far superior handgun, atleast in most aspects (condition: only when similarly priced). sames goes for Canik55 piranha. it offers same manufacturing quality as SC8000 but offers one hell of a time proven (know for superior accuracy) HG design.\n\nso for simplification purposes i''ll list my preference (based on above mentioned 10 points):\n\n1. Baikal MP446 "Viking"\n2. CZ 999 "Scorpion"\n3. CF98 "chino mola jutt"\n\nmy preference in the 40-50K bracket:\n1. CZ 999 "Scorpion"\n2. Canik 55 "Piranha" (only cause its CZ75 by design)\n3. Stoegar Cougar 8000\n\nRegards.', ''),

(95074, ' Very interesting discussion is going on here. No doubt Stoeger Cougar 8000, Taurus PT 92/99, Baikal MP446 Viking and CZ 999 Scorpion are the best among the budget guns. Whatever we do we cannot prove any of the above guns as a junk. Remaining part is just a personal preference.....take any of these and you will not be wrong.\nAs a lot of history is being discussed here let me add something for Stoeger. Manufacturing facility in Turkey used to make excellent(because i own one :) ) replicas of Benelli shotguns in the name of Vursan. Stoeger was just a firm in US that use to import and sell weapons under its own name. This business was purchased by Sako, and Sako was taken over by Beretta and Stoeger went along. Beretta put Stoeger under its another subsidery Benelli. Beretta purchased Vursan and started manufecturing budget firearms here under the familiar (in US) name Stoeger. So, Stoeger enjoys a lot of knowledge of its big owners. Finally, Cougar was never a design or technical failure, rather it was a marketing failure. \n\nNow my own choice..........i will buy a Taurus PT 92, this is my preference. :) This dosen,t make Stoger Cougar, Baikal Viking or CZ Scorpion in any way, any of these an inferior gun.', ''),

(95080, ' @ Gilani: Sir as you said (Now both the pistols are available in Pakistan, more or less in the same price. I find it very difficult to understand why Taurus PT92 and PT99, which is based on the best ever Beretta model and which has been manufactured on the same original Beretta plant, has been totally rejected by people of your area and why Stoeger Cougar, which is based on a mediocre Beretta model that was discontinued by Beretta itself, is the most popular handgun in your area? Any rationale or logic for this?)\nNow I ask you the same very question that both these guns were made by Beretta... One technology has been left in Brazil for the production of PT92/99 & the other has been shifted to Turkey for production of Stoeger Cougar. Now how come you are in favour of PT92/99 & say that its an excellent pistol because its made by the same machinery as the 92fs, while Stoegar Cougar, which is also manufactured by the same very machinery as the beretta Cougar 8000 is not a good pistol....\n The fact is that back in the 90s, beretta developed the Cougar to compliment its 92series pistols which were being used (and still are) by the U.S military and other LEA. Its goal was to be a smaller,more compact & concealable pistol for undercover and security work & this pistol emerged as Cougar 8000. This probably would have been a winning design & marketing plan for them except for one thing and that was ''GLOCK''. About this time (late 90s) Glock was gaining by leaps & bounds into every agency and organisation with its polymer frame, that traditionally had used only metal frame pistols before.Unable to compete with Glocks momentum, beretta slowed down & eventually stopped & halted Cougar production and switched over to a new polymer framed pistol in the name of Px4 storm in order to compete with Glock & shifted the Cougar production to the new location(Turkey), in order to concentrate only on their polymer frame new model. Stoeger is not a mediocre pistol(according to you) by beretta by any mean, but the only drawback of the stoeger, is the lack of polymer frame....\nThis is just not my observation, but it has been discussed thoroughly on international forums & quite alot of references are there if you search it.........\nRegards........', ''),

Since you''ve owned a CZ 999 and for reliability issues (which u judged by only firing 200-300 rounds) and accuracy issues (which u judged by firing at ??? targets at 15-25 meters distance) you opted to change it with a SC8000, you must have known that already.\n\nRegards.\n\np.s. even the cosmetic appearance of CZ 999 is not without dimensional differences.', ''),

(95180, ' +1 to Dr. Zakir. I was going to suggest the same thing. \n\n@Obr The CZ83 is not a bad pistol by any means, it''s just that there are much better options available in the market. Pt 145 is ''the'' best option if you want power in a small package. There are also no reliability issues like the 24/7 and it performs rock solid. The ammo is however expensive if you want to use the same gun for recreational shooting. The Canik Compact is a good buy in 9mm, how ever it''s a bit bigger than the 145.\n\nIf you must go for .32 Caliber then I would suggest looking for a Walther PP or PPK, it has no comparison, and most other pistols chambered in .32 like the Mak and the CZ83 are more or less copies of it. Also the Walther has style, history, finish, popularity (Hey James Bond used it ;) ) on it''s side. I think it will also attain a collectors status within a few years if you plan to keep it for long.', ''),

(95190, ' [b]History''s Most Significant Repeating Handguns By David Tong[/b]\n \nI have decided to write this paper from a short review of the provenance of each handgun, it''s place in history due to its design, its widespread usage, and / or how it advanced the state of the art. A lofty goal, and probably there will be some dissention from equally informed armchair quarterbacks, though I hope that each of my choices will strike some chord with our readers.\n\n[b]6. The Colt Paterson Revolver[/b]\n\nSamuel Colt was an extraordinary marketer and salesman, but before he was known for that, he had whittled a model of probably the first successful repeating arm out of wood, in the 1820s. This model of a single action revolver featured the well-known cylinder, containing a powder charge and projectile in each of five chambers, and was the precursor to the famous Colt-Paterson of 1836. Of course, at this time this concept was for a muzzle-loaded black powder arm, and it wasn''t until after the Rollin White patent on a cylinder bored all the way through (purchased by Smith & Wesson) ran out in 1870 that the SA revolver achieved full fruition in the famous Single Action Army.\n\nLater, due to Yankee ingenuity, Colt was able to introduce the concept of mass production and interchangeable parts to the manufacture of firearms, allowing their construction by less skilled labor in great quantity. Sadly, at the time of this writing, it is seems unlikely that Colt as a company will ever again build revolvers, but that is another story best left to MBAs and accountants.\n\n[b]5. The Mauser C-96 "Broomhandle"[/b]\n\nThere were many inventors and designers working on a reliable semi-automatic pistol for short range personal defense, and the twin developments of smokeless powder that safely developed consistent high pressure, along with the copper gilding metal jacket, allowed for its development. This provided an 86 gr. RN-FMJ bullet at over 1400 FPS, a revelation compared to nearly all black powder bullets leaving their muzzles at under 1000 FPS, though this cartridge does not have a lot of "stopping power" as we understand this term today.\n\nPeter Paul Mauser, better known for his turnbolt rifle actions, came up with the earliest reliable semi-automatic pistol, capable of firing single shots with each pull of the trigger, without having to manually cock a hammer or stroke a trigger action. Probably more accurately described as a "self-loading" handgun, the Broomhandle took its nom de guerre from the somewhat awkward grip that looks and feels like the end of your household implement.\n\nThis pistol differed from the usual detachable box magazine pistol of today by being loaded with six to ten rounds via stripper clip into a fixed magazine that was forward of the trigger, from the top of the opened action just like the Mauser rifle. Famously, a certain Winston Churchill used the pistol in anger for the first recorded time during the Battle of Omdurman, just before the beginning of the 20th Century. This was, quite simply, the first semiautomatic pistol that worked.\n\n[b]4. The Smith & Wessoon ".357 Magnum"[/b]\n\nJust because the auto pistol guys had the advantages of smokeless powder and its ability to create safe working pressures and high velocity bullets flying downrange, didn''t mean the wheelgun guys didn''t want a piece of the action. Douglas B. Wesson at first took the company''s ".38-44 Outdoorsman Target Model" revolver out hunting with handloads exceeding the standard pressure .38 S&W Special round''s ballistics.\n\nIt was determined that the large "N" frame used for this revolver could be re-engineered to handle a higher pressure round safely, and to ensure that the new round would not be chambered in a .38 Special revolver, the cartridge case was lengthened 1/8" of an inch and christened the .357 Magnum.\n\nThe "Registered Model" revolver that was built to customer order started in the mid-1930s, during the height of the Depression. It sold well, despite a price about four times higher than a standard DA revolver of the era. After W.W. II, this and other Magnum revolvers were built on standard production lines, and included the famous .44 Remington Magnum of 1955, which was designed by Remington and introduced to the world by Smith & Wesson.\n\nThe rest is history, as it started the trend of ever-increasing bullet weights and velocities still going on to this day. Despite the actual "need" for such magnum revolvers, this was a watershed moment in the development of hunting handguns.\n\n[b]3. The Walther Model PP "Politzei Pistole"[/b]\n\nIn 1929, the German firm of Carl Walther Waffenfabrik of Zella-Mehlis, Thuringia, Germany came up with what most experts consider a safer semiautomatic pistol, that is, one that does not require the user to have (horrors!) a cocked hammer when drawn from a holster.\n\nThus, this rather low powered blowback operated handgun featured a trigger which offered an uncocked first shot, in the manner of a double action revolver, with subsequent shots fired by the conventional cocked hammer method upon recoil of the moving slide. Alternatively, Walther DA pistols may be thumb cocked for the first shot, also as per a DA revolver. A slew of similar, higher-powered pistols followed, first and possibly most notably the World War II-era P-38 from the same maker.\n\nThere are some who believe strongly that the heavier first shot trigger pull helps to reduce accidental discharges, since it takes both will and more effort to make the first shot occur. Some might disagree, but it also decreases first round hit probability due to the heavier first shot trigger pull, some 10-12 pounds, against a 1.5 pound pistol. Hence, it creates a situation where making the mechanism safer makes the (uncocked) pistol more difficult with which to hit the target with the first shot.\n\n[b]2. The Glock[/b]\n\nGaston Glock, as everyone now well knows, created the 9x19mm G-17 in 1984, and it furthered a trend started in military rifles to include composites or plastics in the fabrication of arms. However, the genius of the Glock design is that the polymer frame he used wasn''t simply providing a handgrip, as most of the rifles had, it was the lightweight and nearly recoil proof chassis that has taken the handgun world by storm, as it is less expensive to produce than a traditional machined steel pistol frame. Subsequent Glock pistols, using the same basic mechanism, have appeared in calibers .380 ACP, .357 SIG, .40 S&W, 10mm Auto, .45 Glock, and .45 ACP.\n\nHowever, the Glock also works pretty well in that it offers the drop safety of the double action automatic with a shorter, consistent trigger stroke. Its reliability under extreme conditions is legendary, and it also has the lowest part count of any major service handgun in the world today. It is thus a boon to accountants, armorers, police administrators, military services, cops, soldiers, and civilians who desire a high quality and reliable arm that lasts for decades of hard usage.\n\n[b]1. The John Browning / Colt Model 1911[/b]\n\nSome regular Guns and Shooting Online readers are no doubt familiar with my preference for this old, traditional pistol. Mr. Browning was a wizard, and with the creation of the 1911, he built the most enduring design of them all. The Colt 1911 has been admired and used for almost 100 years, while many of its contemporaries, such as the Luger, Walther P-38, and the Broomhandle Mauser, are collector''s items and museum pieces. In other words, they are history, while the 1911 is still making history.\n\nThis may annoy some people, who believe that only more modern arms have any relevance, yet it is the continued use of the 1911 by the FBI Hostage Rescue Team, LAPD SWAT, US Army Operational Detachment Delta, US Marine Corps Special Operations Detachment One, and more civilian target and combat competitors than any other design, should be the last word. Take a look at the sheer number of manufacturers building the grand old pistol (the Browning / Colt patents having long since expired) as another indicator of its place among its peers.\n\nThis pistol is the synthesis of disparate elements, including but not exhaustively: durability, simplicity, reliability, ergonomics, trigger pull quality, and stopping power, that has often been compared to, but rarely approximated, yet alone equaled. And none have been around longer. That''s why it''s number one.', ''),

Short range shooting(15M) at standard pistol targets(2" bull) dosent putt any of these guns to the test. [/quote]\nVery correct HJ sahib, most guns fire ok from 15M. It is at 25M distance when one starts seeing the actual results of a gun, that too if we are firing on a standard paper target. Due care must be taken not to change the point of aim while checking a weapon for accuracy and fire only one type of ammo at one time. Minimum of 5 bullets be fired at one time and the process be repeated at least 4 times. A number of such sessions be conducted from 15 M, 25M and if needed from 40-50 M as well. Results of all shooting practices be properly recorded, compared and analyzed. Only then we can reach a bare minimum level to comment on a particular weapon''s accuracy. For forming a reliable opinion, at least 300 rounds should be fired from the gun following a standard procedure. \n\nWhile testing a weapon for accuracy, one should preferably fire with an arm rest so that firer''s errors are minimised. Firing on bricks & bottles is of very limited use and does not really tell us about the consistency of a weapon. \n\nPS: Its interesting to know that a guy with Stoeger Cougar won the championship.

(95291, ' Nice discussion ... great piece of art everybody has shown literally.. \nI have 2 cents of mine that I would like to donate ...\n\nWhat exactly are we pointing to, because here I see two things, from the past discussions.\n\nCriteria 1- Comparing the pistols technical data, and specs. Comparing them like an individual entity having a live character, which is actually not a new thing too in the gun world and its not new in any gun community''s mind, like letting discuss there history/backgrounds, military usage etc. Then marking them with ranks. Rank1 Rank2 Rank3 and so on. Btw such ranks may vary among different gun communities. Believe me it has been done everywhere, gun enthusiast once in a while all do that. \n\nCriteria 2- Comparing pistols on the perceived value of the weapon. That is, how a weapon is categorized in your mind with respect to your perceived values of its usage. I mentioned this in my last post as "Personal preference/likeness and Specific requirement of yours". According to me I based my evaluation of a weapon in totally, from Criteria 2. According to this we mesh both Personal preferences and Specific requirement of ours, and play with some give and take to do this final evaluation. \n\nNOTE: Most of us who are discussing here are jumping like a foot ball between these above two points. They take one from  Criteria 1 and other from Criteria 2. So there are many different views scattered all over under these mixed criteria. Better set your self in a specific criteria first and then see your choice make over.\n\nMoreover, If we see through a specific criteria, then we will know how (as mentioned by HasanJamshad) the match winner came out to be a 3.6inch barrel over a distance of 15M and not a 5 incher. On machine rest, 5 inch barrel would remain more accurate even on longer distance with the correct load for the given rifling twist. It will show this fact no matter how many times you re-test it. By Criteria 1, a 5 incher is better than a 3.6incher technically. On the other hand, at 15M, 3.6 incher in ''Better Hands'' showed up gold position in the match. Here because machine rest wasn''t used rather a human/Person added to equation, hence Personal Preferences from the Criteria 2. Also Criteria 2 involves ''Requirement of yours'' thus for matches upto any distance to the target a 5 incher should be ideally preferred on 3.6 incher. As I previously mentioned, some ''Give and Take'' is done between Personal Preferences and Specific requirements, a person who would like to carry as well as do some casual target shooting will prefer a 4" barrel may be. \n\nAgain coming back to Criteria 1. a 5" barrel pistol will always remain superior to 4" and 3.6" both. Likewise a Sig Pistol is superior to Beretta in combat. A Colt 45acp is superior to Ruger in trigger. S&W revolver in large frame is superior to Taurus in durability and so on.\n\nSo I will request again to better set your self in a specific criteria first and then see your choice make over.\nDont forget to get your hands on choice 2 after you are finished with choice 1.. keep stoking your bank account for that matter... Good luck\n\nRegards.', ''),

Hitting a flying bird with airgun is not possible and shooting a sitting bird with a shotgun is a plain killing not a sport at all.\n\nBy the way I like hunting with airgun more than the shotgun as you have to look into trees, on wires, in the feild while roaming arround miles n miles instead of waiting birds to come flying to decoys and once bird is spotted getting closer with light steps, stooping down with the gun, trying to reach the bird from behind etc is quite thrilling.', ''),

The 9mm is a pea shooter infront of the mighty .45 but thats caliber talk and not relevent here.\n\nBTW its not a hybrid, its rather a copy of the PARA NITE TAC series. (its a 90% copy, leaving out the evolved extractor of the PARA pistols and other cosmetics)\n\nThe reason why the NP44 or or NITE TAC is so heavy is becoz of the ballistics involved when shooting a .45 cartrige. it generates so much power that the pistol needs to be weighty with a strong slide. \n\nI am a big big 1911 fan and after having kept a Berretta 92, Sig P226, Glock 17, Ruger etc, I just fell in love with the 1911 the first time I shot it. As abbas mentioned it is such a beautifull simple design, which is why it is still going strong even with the advent o the "Plastic tuperware guns" (sorry guys no offense to the glock lovers ;)) \n\nThe NP44 is no target quality match pistol. It is a true battle/combat pistol. and serves its role well. it is rugged and fugly, but its a real good pistol. and i believe that UTILITY SHOULD BE THE CRITERIA OF BEAUTY, not how ''cute'' a gun looks.  \n\nI beg to differ with Abbas regarding the safety switch. I feel it is adequetly tight and CLICKS INTO PLACE quite ok. \n\nThe down side is that the grip is no good for people with small hands. Personally for me its great. for every day carry its heavy and cumbersome and takes a little getting used to.\n\nJust thought I''d mention that the NITE TAC pistol was one of the top contenders of the JOINT COMBAT PISTOL PROGRAM. it was run by the US ARMY SPECIAL OPERATIONS COMMAND to find a new service pistol for the US forces and SPEC OPS units. the program had to be shut down because of unavailability of funds ( Yes guys, AMERICA is going bankrupt :lol: ) A large variety of .45 ACP pistols were entered into the competition.

Bullet weights are between 60 and 80 grains and diameter in .309". Velocity is 900 to 1000 feet per second. Energy is 110 to 130 foot pounds.\n\n.380 is also developed by John Browning properly named as 380 ACP and also 9mm browning/9mm Kurz/9mm Short. Bullet weights are between 80 to 100 grains and diameter is exact 9mm or .355". Case length is 17mm. Velocities are 900 to 1000 feet per second and energy level is 180 to 220 foot pounds.\n\n\n380acp vs 32acp ..  380 has a tad bit more weight in bullet as well as more diameter thus more energy/punch/momentum. Modern loadings are still being made for this round with improvisations. Both rounds are low powered, low recoil ammunition suitable for very small carry platforms. Beretta Tomcat .32 a famous gun indeed and so there are many models for 380acp as well. However today, many small snub nose wheel guns and compact pistols are available carrying 9mm or 45 and even 357mag giving us a no brainer situation over these less potent options. 32 and 380 both even dont require a proper recoil operation involving a locking system in a handgun. They even work well with simple blow back operation due to less chamber pressures developed by both of these cartridges.\n\nRegards', ''),

(95449, ' DISCLAIMER:  THE PROCESS I AM DESCRIBING BELOW IS PURELY FOR SAKE OF DISCUSSION AND 100% ACADEMIC IN NATURE I DON NOT CONDONE THE ACTIONS DESCRIBED AND DISCOURAGE ALL WHO READ THIS FROM INDULGING IN SUCH ACTIVITIES!!!!!!\n\n@ All\n\nSirs,\n\nI think i understand what has happened with our brother.  this is an old scam, here is how it works.  \n\n1.  They have someone who is either a officer who used to be the signing authority for issuing licenses or someone who has access to the stamps of such an ex officer of the licensing branch.  \n\n2.  through connections in the concerned department the get a blank book\n\n3.  the officer or person with access to the stamps fills out the license and then stamps it and signs it as he would have when he was on that post and using dates when he would have been on the job.  \n\n4.  Now the license has been issued, they then through a setup at the concerned police station have the station entry done in a date close to the issuing date.  \n\n5.  Then they have a dodgy dealer make an entry of a non existent weapon\n\n6.  then they have a set up at the post office through which they do back dated renewals to show that the license has been renewed regularly.  \n\nnow here comes the tricky part.  how to legitimize this license.  what these chaps do is have the same shop keeper remove the make believe weapon from the license and then submit it for a request for purchasing time.  this is done by most provincial home departments without a second glance (with a "service" charge of course).  this legitimizes the license because the current home department has allowed buying time on this license and therefore inadvertently acknowledged that it is indeed 100% genuine.  A new this time real weapon is then purchased through a reputed dealer (who most likely wont look into the license in much detail) they then have the DCO register the weapon.  now you have it again legitimized (the first time by the current home department and then by the current DCO).  and that my friends is how they do it.  I have seen this done, and no one ever gets in trouble but if the license holder were to be involved in a situation where his license would be scrutinized in enough detail it might come up that the license was a fake, however this can also be discounted because as we know in Pakistan record rooms often catch fire etc.  \n\nin closing i strongly recommend that you do as i advised earlier :D', ''),

At the same time we shouldn''t confuse open iron sights with the target sights. Target sights are not less helpful, if are not more helpful comparing any scopic sights. Scopes just inrease the visibility of the target without helping in other fundamentals of rifle shooting. Target sights increase the visibility of the taget without any magnification...yes....they do.\n\nCurrently the equipment that i own cannot be used in matches. Although, my Anschutz have same action/barrel/trigger and accuracy that is used in Olympics, but it dosent have sights and stock that is used there. For that i am going to purchase one more Anschutz that is truely a match rifle.\n\nComing back to the competition, the targets those are used in 50M rifle matches are not the one we use at LRC. Target for 50M prone/3 position matches has a bull(10) of 10.4mm and each next circle is obtained by adding 16mm in the previous circle(total size is 154.4mm....15cm.....6inch). \n\nFinally, why i am waisting time and money in shooting these hunting rifles on bigger targets using wrong sights????? Wel, it was not the day one from which i started shooting with a goal to be a marksman. This is a gradual shift from fun shooting/hunting towards competitive shooting. Now i am much aware of my goal and am trying to acheive it.', ''),

(95549, ' Salam, brothers in arms!\n\nI registered a while back but didn''t get around to introducing myself. In the meantime I did frequent the forums to partake of the sheer wealth of knowledge and information that they contain and the collective experience of you bros. This is EXACTLY the community I was looking for and sadly didn''t discover before.\n\nI have always had the utmost respect and affinity for all weapons as a means of promoting one''s security and well being. But for one reason or the other, all my life, I never considered myself in a position to acquire one. When late last year, while visiting my family in Lahore over Eid Ul Azha, our house in Isl was broken in and our valuables stolen, I was rudely woken to the fact that one must be proactive in the protection of their family and their property. And among other measures, my right to bear arms is part of that mindset. Especially in the events that followed with the police and the sheer effort it took just to register an FIR. Deterrence is IT! If one understands that the state and police are more engaged with fighting terrorism, then we realize that street crime is on the way up. Either way, it necessitates that I, as all responsible citizens, come to the forefront of defending myself and my community, in the reasonable framework of the law that affords me such rights. Kher, forgive my ramblings. But I truly feel myself in the company of family here, so dil ki baat...\n\nI don''t currently have a firearm, but that will change as soon as new N.P.B license apps start to be accepted. In the meantime I''ve spent free time for the past some months thoroughly reading on safety, maintenance, choice of weapons etc. I have my eye on acquiring a Stoeger Cougar chambered in 9mm inshallah. And soon a Hatsan Escort or Baikal.. er, pocket permitting :)\n\nFinally, this brings me to the most important thing I want to say. After thoroughly reading through quite a few topics on this forum, I feel truly lucky, proud and humbled at the same time to become a part of this community. Your kindness and sincerity in sharing knowledge and experience is extraordinary. And your sense of kinship and accommodating each others'' view points is remarkable. Honestly, it has started to seem to me that I''ve known you for a long time. I look forward to learning a lot from you and humbly giving my 2 cents in discussions..

My gun was made right infront of my eyes, they even threw in a 28inch hunting barrel with screw in chokes. lemme say it again: awesomely manufacturered thing.\n\nat the range:\n\nwell, i''m not much of a hunter but i''m totally into skeet. i''m gonna make it short by saying that i''ve personally fired 200 shots in a single sitting without giving the gun a single moment to cool down. and the gun functioned flawless. the barrel was so hot, u could probably light a cigar off it. but the thing just kept on kicking. it gets even more interesting, i thought why not get the barrel tested for surface flaws, u know, with my links it was easy to pull off, the barrel was tested using ultrasonic surface testing and eddy current testing. absolutely flawless after 200 rounds. boy!.\n\n200 rounds might not sound alot but remember it was 200 consecutive bangs in a single sitting. the only rest was involved when the tube magazine was being loaded for another round of punishment. note: there were no cleaning intervals, the barrel was not cleaned during the whole session.\n\nat my brother''s wedding:\n\nme and my cousin fired a total of 150 rounds of SG (00 buck shots). again, no intervals, no resting and cleaning the barrel. she was hot as hell but kept on kicking.\n\nabout the pattern:\n\ngot me a stats genius and we patterened the gun, well, pretty good (it met industry standards), i''m not gonna say awesome, but better than the turkish ones we bought along for comparison. i still have the results with me, and can post them too, both for the short/standard 22 inch barrel and for the custom/28 inch barrel. the stats guy even made me a complex equation by which i can tell where/how will be the pattern at any given distance and choke.\n\nas time passed:\n\nI got me many shotguns now, and now i''m also well experienced in turkish (sarsilmaz, hatsan, volcanic) and russian baikal mp 153.\n\nguess what: at my range, i''m the only guy with Daudson pump and guess what? my club members gladly ask for my gun when they forget to bring their foreign guns, knowing its performace and durability.\n\nand to date, i cannot even count the cartridges i''ve fired, to give an idea: i fire 200-300 rounds a month with my pump. my foreign semi autos are nothing more than cabinet queens now, they just sit and collect dust. I also give/lend them to friends i cannot trust with my precious daudsons pump.\n\nconclusion:\n\nForeign made guns are expensive and probably of higher quality and probably safer to use however my daudson is dirt cheap and definately safe to use. in a contest of "probably" vs "definately", "definately" wins hand down.\n\nRegards.\n\n[i]Last edited by 12gauge (09-05-2009 20:05:45)[/i]\n[/quote]\n\nI am totally sold on DSA pump action after reading our knowledgeable brother 12G''s post above.\n\nHowever, I am wondering that since Daudsons has now stopped manufacturing pump actions and have diverted their attention towards huge multi million dollar defence contracts, what problems can someone, who buys a DSA shooter now, face with respect to availability of after market parts or repairs, etc.', ''),

But if in any case you plan to go like general population here, here is an explanation below. Plz do confirm it from a reputed arms dealer for the fact that I might have missed one or two important things in it. That is mainly a generic overview of what is done here in our offices. \n\nBefore you purchase a new weapon\nFor that, the receipt of fictitious serial sold to you must be entered at DCO office and stamped from the city where dealer is located. It would then be stamped on your license too as your weapon for this particular license by DCO. Now you goto the same arms dealer. Ask him to buy back the fictitious SERIAL from you. He will stamp on a new page of license booklet, sign it and put date on it. Ask him to provide you with receipt also stamped and signed by both of you as a record of this.

They consist of Break Barrels like Gamo shadow 1k and diana mod 34, Side Levers like Diana/RWS mod 52 or 54 airking and also under levers  like TX200 underlever and Weihrauch HW97. Chinese versions are available to for side, under levers and break barrels.\n\nGas-Ram unlike Spring pistol are far more strong and reliable as well as durable. They have ability to be cocked and left over for long periods unlike springpiston rifles which will weak its springs and damage its cylinder or leak its washers. Good example of a famous gun can be quoted here like Beeman Crow Magnum or equavalent Weihrauch HW90.\n\nSimple Pneumatics have stroking handles that compresses air in cylinder on single or multiple strokes. Cross man Benjamin rifles are one good example. PCP guns have air cylinder to boot driving force for the pellet. They are far far more powerful than any other type of design and most costly as welll. They require SCUBA systems for refilling air and are very very refined air rifles. They have sort of regulators to control air discharge so you can change the FP(foot pounds) on the go and change range etc or for competition to deliver max accuracy with a specific pellet. Such guns cost as much as 600 to even 2000 dollars. Anshutz and Feinwerkbau are among the most pricey ones and other famous ones are Weihrauch, Air Arms, crossman benjamin, Air Force models, Walther, Career and Sumatra Rifles.\n\nAir rifles are classic beauties. They are very very fine rifles and art of shooting them has a great pleasure of its own kind.\n\nRegards', ''),

(95703, ' (topic continues) .. and how should they be overcome?\n\nLet me begin by saying that I am all FOR carrying a concealed handgun for personal, family, community protection. I recognize and am willing to study and practice properly and hard at both the mindset and best practices that come with carrying as such. This topic is actually started with this intention. It is opened so that friends who don''t carry or are on the fence about the subject because of problems faced while carrying can benefit from the experience of those who''ve bested these problems.\n\nSome questions that come to mind (such as how to carry concealed etc) are amply answered in other threads. Some others are:\n1- When you walk into banks or buildings and establishments (even the local McDonald''s) where you have to pass through metal detectors, what is the experience like? Naturally you present your weapon. Is there ever trouble with security? I know if you also present a valid license/144 permit there shouldn''t be a problem, but please enlighten us with experience on how best to declare that you''re carrying without causing panic among those around you at the time. What happens if the said place has a strict no weapons policy?\n\n2- In public places, especially during summers, when we don''t wear multiple layers of clothing, if your weapon is printing and people become aware of it, do they react to you? I especially mean in these days in Pakistan, where tragic street crime as well as terrorist incidents are so common that people are generally mistrustful of anyone they perceive as a threat. And a guy with a gun may freak people out\n\n3- If your workplace doesn''t allow being armed on premises, do you not carry at all or do you secure the weapon in your vehicle? or what do you do?\n\n4- If weapons are secured in cars, then during summers, the temperatures in closed cars reach insane heights. With live rounds in a firearm, is that a cause for concern? What should be done?\n\n5- Also while carrying in summers on your person, how do you protect the gun from your sweat and your body from constant rubbing of metal that might cause an infection. Especially in an under-arm holster\n\n6- Most importantly, since the above might just be silly or unimportant questions, what is the biggest problem you faced when you started carrying concealed? and how did you solve it?\n\nOther brothers who''re considering packing, please put in your questions as well. And our carrying friends, your actual experiences might answer more questions than are asked.\n\nFinally, I''ve searched before starting this thread. But if mods feel this isn''t appropriate as a topic of its own and there already is a discussion in this regard, then  please accept my apologies and point me in the right direction.', ''),

Lets see what you have to say on this.\n\nWe all discuss here about guns and everybody is putting up his own opinion or just quoting other''s opinions. \n\nWhat I did not like about zigana, well that is just with me. If you ask me I would tell, I dont like zigana''s rear sight placement as it is very odd looking to me(shorter sighting radius for a longer pistol?), Plastic grips are thickening the profile of pistol without any reason(not a functional characteristic is it?) well heard of select fire(full auto) capability in this item, I was thinking why it was named as Zigana Sports. It should rather have been Zigana SOCOM as sports pistol having an AUTO capability is just not a digestible item. About TT I think it has the weirdest of all sort of grips in handguns. Its angle is strange to me and also its structure. Today we all talk about guns ergonomics which were not bothered about in era of TT. It is a classic design and a WW insignia. I think that is the reason for your capacity question and the other reason being its caliber''s versatality rank, it has not been much enhanced in Capacity.(though Colt 1911 was enhanced and improvised alot). Yes I do mean about .30 that it is not very versatile round with a limited usability like I think there is of .44 Magnum even though .44 is a bit more versatile than .30 because of Sports Shooting.\n\nI''ll give you details on each aspect I touched.

(95726, ' i bought a taurus pt 909 for SD but after some days i realized the problems.first of all it''s hard to cc a medium frame pistol that is not slim line. it prints a lot in owb/iwb holsters and it''s too thick for comfortable carry. that can be overcome somewhat by buying 1 size more than your waist. a good holster is very important. shoulder holsters are totally inappropriate in summers and even in winters it''s inappropriate because, unlike europe and usa,it''s common to hug male colleagues and friends you meet and they can easily feel the metallic bulge under your arm. so i would recommend a slim pistol with a good holster for daily cc.\n\nfor other questions, banks have a policy to drop your weapon with bank security outside the bank premises so instead of leaving my expensive weapon with the guards i would prefer to leave it in the car.', ''),

Rather its an Italian designed by Beretta (the same design as Cougar 8000) & Beretta had acquired Stoeger industries in 2000 and placed them under thier joint venture company "Benelli" USA, where it remains to this day. They then shipped its manufacturing plant to Turkey for the manufacturing of Stoeger Cougar......

However there is .38 Special which is S&W proprietry cartridge and also very famous and similar to .357magnum in dimensions.\n\n.380 acp and Makarov (9x18mm) are ballistically on the same line of performance. Bullet weights, velocities and energies are roughly equal. The only main differences between these two nines are .380acp is truly a 9mm (.355") on the other hand Makarov 9x18mm bullet is .365" and also that it is an eastern communist bloc cartridge(other example is Tokarev round) used by military is simple blowback pistols and sub-guns. It too like .32acp and .380acp dont require locking mechanism in firearms to operate safely due to its lower chamber pressures. However please note that 9x18 Mak round cannot be used in 9x19 parabellum chamber and barrel due to dia difference between these two rounds.\n\nRegards.', ''),

(95832, ' AS.\n\nJust to add to your confusion dont forget about the bullet type as well. All too often I see people (without proper education) flaunt their knowledge on calibre / barrel usage. Please try and spend a few minutes at the firing range and through the NET to educate yourself about ''Ballistics'' the science behind bullet heads, bodies and charges. Have you ever wondered why the 7.62 / .308 NATO round is pretty much standard every where in the world?, why would you choose a hollow point bullet over a copper or steel jacketed round?\n\nThere is a marked difference between standard bullet head and say hollow point bullet head... in short the impact damage.\n\nThen you have the variable of ''load'' .. massive difference say between 28 grain and 48 grain etc etc .. In short this will provide velocity and obviously change impact as above.\n\nThe varying answers you will get are based upon very respectable opinion and viewpoints. However don''t forget that in this game there is ''no one answer''. Through practice and asessment at a personal level you will see results you are looking for. No point in trying to crack a walnut with a sledg hammmer, right !\n\nOn a personal level I prefer a .22LR rifle for almost all my hunting or small to medium size animals, shotguns for birds and general flying objects (clays included). I choose the .22LR with varying bullet types because the guns are incredibly light (you need that on a 30km hike) and the fact the ammo is cheap. Some maybe argue againt my choice but most animlas I hunt are small to medium, within 200 to 25 yards max and I prefer a humane single shot kill to a vital organ.\n\nA properly placed shot with virtually any calibre .22LR / 0.270 & above will do the damage you need in order to kill most animals (Maybe 0.270 for whitetail though). Make the calibre too big for instance and you will do more damage to the animal than required, I once split a rabbit in HALF! at 130 yards with a friends rifle .. I felt really bad as it was OVERKILL !\n\nThis may also answer another question, why do people reload their own bullets when commercially available ones are cheap. Simple answer is when you reload you are producing a very accurate bullet, you dont need 10 bullets to do the job 1 accurate shot can do. You will almost know the exact flight path of your head say at 100 yards through 1000 yards and adjust you angle (MOA) accordingly. I would prefer a better rifle / calibre over commercial availability as I can reload my own bulletc (its very easy n cheap process)\n\np.S Keep a decent calibre side arm ( 9mm or .30 ) for situation where you cant get your rifle off !, you may need short range stopping power for anything that jumps out at you.\n\nHappy hunting.', ''),

(95857, ' [quote=midreestaj]@Ahsan Tauheed bro keep it cool jigz. I am very interested to know by you, why chinese did not make a high capacity TT. + do also elaborate us on your findings about Zigana Pistol. Lets see what you have to say on this.\n\nWe all discuss here about guns and everybody is putting up his own opinion or just quoting other''s opinions. \n\nWhat I did not like about zigana, well that is just with me. If you ask me I would tell, I dont like zigana''s rear sight placement as it is very odd looking to me(shorter sighting radius for a longer pistol?), Plastic grips are thickening the profile of pistol without any reason(not a functional characteristic is it?) well heard of select fire(full auto) capability in this item, I was thinking why it was named as Zigana Sports. It should rather have been Zigana SOCOM as sports pistol having an AUTO capability is just not a digestible item. About TT I think it has the weirdest of all sort of grips in handguns. Its angle is strange to me and also its structure. Today we all talk about guns ergonomics which were not bothered about in era of TT. It is a classic design and a WW insignia. I think that is the reason for your capacity question and the other reason being its caliber''s versatality rank, it has not been much enhanced in Capacity.(though Colt 1911 was enhanced and improvised alot). Yes I do mean about .30 that it is not very versatile round with a limited usability like I think there is of .44 Magnum even though .44 is a bit more versatile than .30 because of Sports Shooting.\n\nI''ll give you details on each aspect I touched. Waiting for your opinions... \n\nRegards[/quote]\n\n\n\n\n@midreestaj! asalam o alikum bro, i already had told you that im not trying to insult you but i just wanted to let you realize that you can''t challenge a design of any pistol or rifle which is branded or produced by a well reputed company and country. I just wanted to share my research and practical experience but you had asked me to explain the reason about loving turkish zigana then i had commented, i just wanted to tell all my bros that i dont want to insult any one but had told to realize that no pistol''s design is bad because they are built to fire and they do so, except those Darra...... weapon as my bro mentioned already because they are not produced by measured design and on machineries so there finishing ends are sharp and not smooth mechanism inside also, they are aslo not sure shot. But turkish weapon is not made by any of these steps. Moreover Pakistan Ordinance Arms Factory is producing some serious kind of Weapons. Finally My question about .30 is because of the reason that it is a basic design to understand a handgun and very accurate and also most easy mechanism to understand and if u understand the handguns that much well then you can answer me i never wanted to insult you but challenged you not to make comments on any thing untill you are able to produce, repair and maintain it because we all guys pertains handguns and have some emotional attachments with it because it is like a second wife in our life and we keep it always with us and it gives us the passion and satisfaction that we are safe because of it and our courage, any way bro the answer of the question is that .30 is very powerfull caliber in a pistol that is why its handling is much difficult and that is why its round size is bigger then the other caliber of bullets and when they tried to enhanced its capacity of magazines then the round''s front side i dont know what we call it in english but in urdu we call it "Sikka" after 10 bullets are getting up side due to its size and when the "Sikka" side of bullets are not seated below in the magazines then they get stuck after every 2 t0 3 shots during recoil and if they enhance the width and deepness of their magazines it gets again stuck due to its high velocity during firing again bullets could not seated well in less space. But in rifle it is reverse beacause then you have got bigger design and bigger size of magazine. i hope that the way i had explained you the reason will be understood by you please. Hope you will not mind my talks and try to understand. Next time i will make you clear about Zigana''s Design they are master piece of great technology, but befor that want you to search Zigana-F on you tube and watch some videos of their performance and making please. \n\nOh in last that is also the main reason that darra''s pistols got stuck during firing because their design and magazines are not much capable of firing what they puts into it.\n\nThanks and regards \n\n@ Faheem bhai and my other bros i had never ever tries to insult him but wanted to let him realize that not to comments seriuosly without having prior information.\n\n@ Faheem bhai waiting for your answer please.', ''),

I find it hard to understand why some of the new members are getting so emotional about their guns. The same I experienced in the Stoeger thread where some of the members went emotional and at places sarcastic in the defence of their guns. Mr Ahsan must be a very experienced shooter but so are many of us having fired thousands of rounds with different pistols from different countries. So we discuss guns here to learn new things in a decent and rational manner. Any argument without facts is just wastage of time. When we say so and so gun is good and so and so gun is average and so and so gun is a flop than we must have technical and range results supporting our argument. That way it will benefit all of us, otherwise the whole thing might easily turn into a personal rift. The reply of Taj sahib in the above post is an example  how one should logically and rationally put forward his point of view. \n\nAll new members are most welcome to give their point of view as much as the old members are.

(95948, ' [quote=Denovo87]Congrats Steve, you made us all proud :)   More pics n vids of the action & targets alongwith breif story of the event :)[/quote]\n\n\nThank you all for the kind congratulations.\n\nI did not take any video or pictures at this match.  There were 5 stages, and all stages were 4 strings of fire of 5 to 7 shots.  For scoring purposes the slowest string was dropped from the tally and they added together the 3 fastest strings.\n\nThe shooter started with gun loaded at a low ready (pointed down at the ground at a 45 degree angle.  On start signal, shoot the stage.\n\nThe shortest stage was 5 steel plates.  But, there were three different levels of shooting so the gun moved more.\n\nOne of the best stages was called, "Best in Texas."  It''s much like a Bianchi plate rack but the steel plates are shaped like the State of Texas with a small stop plate.  This makes them a little harder to hit.  It also made for humorous comments like, "That guy is standing in San Antonio and can''t hit Texas."\n\nThe hardest stage was 6 very small steel plates shaped like a diamond, square, triangle, circle and two shaped like bowling pins.  They were only about 4 square inches or less 2" X 2" or 1" X 4".\n\nA very interesting stage were small plates protected by a steel no shoot barrier.  No matter whether you hit the steel plate or hit the barrier it rang like you hit steel (because you did), the plates were in staggerd collumns rising in front of you so you had to shoot up (as opposed to sideways) and in a zig-zag.  \n\nThere was one more stage with bowling pin, circle and octagon shapped plates set at a deceiving distance.  Right at the edge or feeling close but far enough that misses were quite possible at speed.\n\nI shot very well with no misses on steel, one shot, one clang.  I was using my Kimber .22 LR conversion kit on my Supermatch lower.  I took a file to an area on the slide which was dragging a bit and made it cycle much smoother which made it run much more reliably.  I was also shooting with new grips from VZgrips.\n\n[url]http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjG8UtLHN08[/url]\n\nI don''t have the scores yet.  But, I knew I shot well, the competition at the top of the .22 "Stock Auto" (no optical sights or compensators) was stiff.', ''),

Naturally you present your weapon. Is there ever trouble with security? I know if you also present a valid license/144 permit there shouldn''t be a problem, but please enlighten us with experience on how best to declare that you''re carrying without causing panic among those around you at the time. What happens if the said place has a strict no weapons policy?[/quote]\n\nEach person has his own ''threat assessment'' about different places s/he visits. While going to McDonalds, for instance, I might not feel the need to carry my handgun (HG) on my person, whereas, while officially visiting a supplier / vendor in an area known for law and order problems, I might decide to carry my HG even while entering the premises of the supplier. Same applies while checking in five/four star hotels and airports. While checking in hotels, whether PC or Marriott, it is best to declare before hand that you are carrying a weapon. If you are checking in, the hotel staff will most probably request you to have your HG kept in the hotel safe and give you a receipt for it. This is generally done in the presence of Hotel Manager, who is generally very cooperative and courteous in his dealing with you if you call him up before hand and let him know that you''ll be coming with your licensed weapon. Likewise, if I feel the dire need to take my weapon with me to a function being held within the premises of a hotel, then too I will declare before hand to the hotel security that I''m carrying a weapon. Then it is upto the hotel policy to either allow you to keep carrying your arm OR have it kept with them until to leave the hotel. Ideally, one should keep his/her weapon in the car while entering hotels for short period of time. That''s my take on it.\n\n[quote]2- In public places, especially during summers, when we don''t wear multiple layers of clothing, if your weapon is printing and people become aware of it, do they react to you? I especially mean in these days in Pakistan, where tragic street crime as well as terrorist incidents are so common that people are generally mistrustful of anyone they perceive as a threat. And a guy with a gun may freak people out[/quote]\n\nTheir reaction would be normal given our current LAO situation. Solution --> Carry a weapon in a manner which does not print.\n\n[quote]\n3- If your workplace doesn''t allow being armed on premises, do you not carry at all or do you secure the weapon in your vehicle? or what do you do?\n[/quote]\n\nKeep it in my car.\n\n[quote]\n4- If weapons are secured in cars, then during summers, the temperatures in closed cars reach insane heights. With live rounds in a firearm, is that a cause for concern? What should be done?[/quote]\n\nNo cause of concern as per senior learned members of this forum as well as some others too.\n\n[quote]\n5- Also while carrying in summers on your person, how do you protect the gun from your sweat and your body from constant rubbing of metal that might cause an infection. Especially in an under-arm holster[/quote]\n\nIWB holsters which cover your weapon properly, normally take care of skin contact issue.\n\n[quote]6- Most importantly, since the above might just be silly or unimportant questions, what is the biggest problem you faced when you started carrying concealed? and how did you solve it?[/quote]\n\nNo biggest problem as such, other than the initial edgy feeling which phases out soon. Currently, section 144 is imposed and irrespective of any permit, CCW on person is not allowed.', ''),
(96006, ' [quote=Skeeter60]Any  round cutting the line is considered a hit in the higher value ring.[/quote]\nabsolutely right Sir! I was also counting Gilani Sahab''s score and in the first target found the difference in totals.\n\nSir, now a question from you. "A PERFECTLY ZEROED" handgun. What does that phrase tell?\n\nI always thought a handgun would be perfectly zeroed if the zeroing is done from a benchrest with as minimal of variation of hold as possible. The most minimum to non-existant indeed.\n\nI also know zeroing varies with distance of target, internal/external ballistics of load, barrel etc. Now what I need to know is;\n\n1- does zeroing depend on stances? or Is there anything such as relative zeroing? i.e If a shooter has to compete off hand/standing he should zero the handgun in the same position. \nThis thing came in my mind from the experience of zeroing an air rifle at 25 yard. I found out if I used to zero it using a bench rest the values wouldnt hold so perfectly when after I shot the rifle in off hand. Infact to my understanding, due to variation in hold and technique when offhand shooting, I had to zero it again in the same position to get the best values that would work out in good groupings from off hand/standing shooting position. OR is it merely a call to improve the hold/technique?', ''),

(96029, ' [quote=Aquarius]Never heard of FTE problems with the Stoeger handguns before... If the problem was FTF (failure to fire) then one could suspect ammo problem, but FTE in this particular case arises suspicion on the gun...... Newlook bro: try chinese ammo next time as per Budha Khan,s bro advise & see the results.... if the problem still persists then your gun has some sought of problem......[/quote]\n\nBro Aquarious, I agree, as POF ammo is quite consistent and it just doesnt seem right to doubt 2Z ammo not providing enough thurst to cycle the action.\n\nFTE (Extract or Eject)? I assume it a [b]Failure to Extract[/b] then, this particular pistol, first of all should be given a good break in period. 300 rounds down the pipe or even 500.\n\nWhen above done, and still FTExtract error is observed, extractor tension must be checked. It should be tight enough to cling on the bullets base firmly. It shouldnt be over tight as this would cause problems too every now and then(break in period would normally correct this). Spring change can correct this issue.\n\nExtractor seating, i.e the extractor claw''s depth. If found not enough will require removal of extractor from the slide and bending it a few micro mm to resolve the issue. A gunsmith can be of valueable assistance here.\n\nIf we assume it as a [b]Failure to Eject[/b] then, I must say semi auto relies on recoil operation. This recoiling cartridge sends back the slide allowing the catching claw of extractor to assist in removing spent casing out of the chamber. When the slide retracts to the farthest point in cycling i,e backwards, the EJECTOR plays its role only then correctly. Which is to assist the spent casing, out of the straight rearward movement to an angled out side ways thurst. In this way round is ejected successfully. \nWhat can possible cause error in ejection, are mainly two things. One is under powered round not sending the slide to its most backward unlocking position. Second is improper GRIP. Because if we dont provide a firm launch platform for a recoil operation the slide wont come back completely. Limp wristing is one good example.\n\nThat is the whole recipe of reliability for this particular handgun. Readers please dont condemn the maker. It could be just a little quality control issue found this time or merely a variation in gripping by the operator or an underpowered ammo or a mixture of it who knows. Cougar is a cheap and a good great gun.\n\nRegards', ''),

(96036, ' [quote=PakistanGuides]AK : Currently, Pakistanis can legally hunt two species ie: Sindh Ibex & Himalayan Ibex\nFor Sindh Ibex, any hunter holding the Sindhi Domicile has the privilege to hunt it at a subsidized rate of Rs 50,000/= Whereas, all non Sindhi hunters (Yet Pakistanis) may hunt the same @ RS 100,000/= This is exactly what''s been practiced in Colorado & I hope our other provinces will follow the same pattern. However, since the quota is just 10 animals and there are many hunters every year, the permits are sold out in a lucky draw in a fair & square manner in presence of everyone. \nI''m sure, as time passes & population of Ibexes grows, this price will definitely come down. For your information the hunting permit for foreigners is US$ 4500/= + other expenses (Which is approx Rs 400,000) so this indeed is a positive change & worth appreciation.\nSimilarly, the Himalayan Ibex (in Gilgit-Baltistan) is being sold out @ US$ 3000 to 3500 to foreigners whereas for Pakistanis it''s price is equivalent to US$ 1000 (paid in Pak Rs) however, as usual, since the quota is limited & there are more hunters, the guys at Gilgit Wild Life are smart so instead of disbursing these permits in lucky draws, they indulge the hunters in competitive bids and the permits are given to the highest bidders .... which is quite fair ! \nHaving said, once again... a time will come (in the very near future) when these hunts in Northern Pakistan will also be available at reasonable costs.[/quote]\n\nI think it is still not a bad price for a trophy, if you hunt in any of the private ranches in US you''ll have to pay $2000 approx for a trophy (females are quite cheap though).', ''),

That is one most important thing we must consider If the weapon is meant to be used for protecting oneself. However there are other things like Durability, Capacity/firepower, Ergonomics etc which are of secondary importance but not the least to be said. Many top contending handguns are rejected on the basis of these secondary traits and ofcourse every weapon is designed to fire.\n\n\n[quote=Ahsan Tauheed] and when they tried to enhanced its capacity of magazines then the round''s front side i dont know what we call it in english but in urdu we call it "Sikka" after 10 bullets are getting up side due to its size and when the "Sikka" side of bullets are not seated below in the magazines then they get stuck after every 2 t0 3 shots during recoil and if they enhance the width and deepness of their magazines it gets again stuck due to its high velocity during firing again bullets could not seated well in less space.[/quote]\nYou call Sikka as bullet. What you mentioned about the .30 rounds Sikkas facing upward is not due to recoil + a high capacity magazine. It can happen to 9mm handguns too. The reason is inconsistant tension in the magazine spring. Take example of a M4 carbine(very small and light weight weapon) firing long and thin(like .30) .223/5.56NATO rounds from DOUBLE STACK magazines on such a high cyling rates.\n\nRegards', ''),

the help of our esteem & beloved member "Naveed" bro, I manage to grab the last peice of this Sig+CZ hybrid.. without Naveed bro it would have been impossible because I searched the whole Peshawar market but couldn''t find one.. heard from someone its available in Lahore, so without wasting anytime I rang Naveed bro to find me one, because when it comes to Lahore nobody is as efficient as our dear Naveed bro & the very next day he told me that he searched the whole Nila Gumbat and only one (NIB) piece is left with Hira Arms.. I told him to grab it and the very next morning I was on my way to Lahore.. would love to stay there for some more time but couldn''t manage because of schedule, so just went to Nila Gumbat, enter it on my License and returned the same day.. don''t forget that I was driving alone although had a company of my better half but she was afraid of driving on motorway which is far more easier than driving in busy Cities..

(96063, ' @ MIDREESTAJ\nWhen one fires a hand gun or a Rifle from a proper rest ( there are Machine Rests, there are support type rests ) the idea is to check the accuracy potential of a weapon. As in this case the human induced errors are minimal.\nAs far as Zeroing is concerned it must be done with the same grip and stance as when shooting in a Match.\nRemember the tightening or losening your grip, changing the point of contact of the distal pad of your trigger finger with the trigger, adjusting the pistols grip and even trigger weight will all change the zeroing at a range of 25m when shooting an accurate pistol with one hand on a match Target where  the difference will be very obvious.\nAs far as Rifles go, these are more forgiving but when the Range is longer or one is shooting 3 position Olympic match the same is true for these as well.\nRemember your  RIFLE BARREL MUST NOT TOUCH anything even if it touches a leaf your zeroing and accuracy will go out the window. When you rest a rifle, rest it on the stock with the forward hand under fore end resting on the support.\nYou can experiment with a .22 or an accurate air rifle and see what happens when you let the barrel touch or rest on some thing.\nI sometimes indulge in adding more than was asked for, but the idea is not to force my experience but to share most of it specially with the younger shooters who  will otherwise never find any help as we have very few  clubs and ranges and even fewer people with real practical experience and and training on the subject', ''),

(96241, ' @ Viking\n\nOut of the calibers you mentioned only the 270 and good old 30-06 are good for mountain big game you mentioned.\nThe reasons are the ranges can be from a 100 yds to well over 300 yds. The wind will be very strong in the mountains and the Himalayan Ibex and the Markhore need to be stopped before they climb a cliff or get into a cave to die undetected  as these are big and strong animals. So you need a flat trajectory, ability to deviate less from wind and enough bullet weight and energy to bring the animal down keep him anchored.\n243 loses energy beyond 200 yds and is very sensitive to wind, and is too small a caliber for markhore and Himalayan Ibex. The 308 is lethal but the trajectory does not make it an ideal long range HUNTING  caliber, unless one is equipped as a sniper and trained as one with a laser range finder, Compensating sniper scope and all; therefore withe normal hunting gear the following cailbers are ideal for the animals you mentioned and will not go wrong with any of these.\n\n7mm Magnum (Rem, and or Weatherby)\n270 win\n30-06\n280 Rem\n7 x 64 Brenneke\n300 Win Mag\n7 x 61 \n300 Weatherby Mag\nI have used all these to great effect and  I am a great lover of the 7mm Rem Magnum and the 30-06 (specially when hand loaded with 165 gr Nosler bullets )', ''),

This gives you a large variety of different ballistics that you can use for different game. \n\nMy vote is the .30-06.

May be it \ntouched the line of 10 or may be it did not. Only a harsh judge would give him 198/200. He shoots a S&W .22 LR revolver with\na 6" barrel.\n\nIn my opinion, it is an amazing result. I call it amazing because Dr. Nimar has very limited experience with this type of\nshooting. A shooter who can put 18 or 19 shots in 10 could do 20 also. It may happen any day, may be tomorrow.\nAnd do you know the secret behind it all. As someone suggested to him, he has put in a lot of dry fire practice with his\nGlock. The little black mark on one of the walls of his house would let out the secret.\n\nNow, as to the last question you have asked Skeeter60, one thing I would say right away is that Skeeter60 can put\nall 20 in 10 any day. No problems there. THIS IS NOT TO TAKE ANYTHING AWAY FROM DR. NIMAR! It shouldn''t bother him either as he knows where I rate him as a shooter. By the way, he is a great cook too.

(96606, ' By range we mean distance traveled by a bullet from point A to point B when fired, right? \n\nIn this case, two factors are important. Length of rifling (length of barrel) and the amount of HE in the cartridge. Factors like wind direction, wind speed and air density also matter to some extent. Calibre?? well I dont know how far it effects the range. Certainly, bigger the bullet dia, higher the air resistance and drag. But the amount of HE in the cartridge is also important.   7.62x25 mm cartridge has more range as compared to a 9x19 Parabellum, if fired from same size of barrel, because it has a smaller bullet and bigger cartridge case housing more HE. However, when compared with .357 Magnum which again is a 9 mm round, it does not enjoy that kind of an edge. \n\nMoreover, simple range and effective range of a handgun are two different things. What actually matters is the effective range, ie, at what distance a weapon is capable of firing with accuracy. :)', ''),

(96816, ' [b].22lr USAGE[/b]\n[img]http://img510.imageshack.us/img510/4039/22long22lr22winchesterm.jpg[/img]\nToday, .22 LR is mainly being used for hunting small pests, for sports shooting, for plinking, and for inexpensive training. The .22 LR is the choice for several ISSF shooting events: 50 metre rifle three positions, 50 metre rifle prone, 50 metre pistol, 25 metre pistol, 25 metre rapid fire pistol and 25 metre standard pistol; Bullseye, plus divisions of metallic silhouette and pin shooting, most high school, collegiate, Boy Scouts of America, Air Training Corps, Australian Army Cadets and 4H shooting events, and many others. Good quality .22 LR ammunition can be quite accurate. Its main advantages are low cost, low recoil, low noise and high accuracy-to-cost ratio. Its main disadvantage is its low power; it is better suited for use on small game and other small animals;[10] as a defensive cartridge, it is considered inadequate, though the small size allows very lightweight, easily concealable handguns which can be carried in circumstances where anything larger would be impractical. Despite their limitations, .22 LR pistols and rifles can be lethal and are often used for self defense simply because they are prevalent, inexpensive, and widely available to civilians.\nSemi-automatic rifles firing .22 LR cartridges often will work properly only when firing standard or high velocity .22 LR ammunition; subsonic rounds will often not cycle their actions properly. Bolt-action or lever-action rifles, however, can utilize any of the variants (high velocity to subsonic).\nThe tiny case of the .22 LR and the subsonic velocities (when using subsonic ammunition) make it well suited for use with a firearm suppressor (also known as silencers or sound moderators). The low volume of powder gases means that .22 LR suppressors are often no larger than a bull barrel; the Ruger 10/22 and Ruger MK II are common choices, because of their reliability and low cost, and the resulting product is often nearly indistinguishable from a bull barrel model (although weighing far less). Where firearm suppressors are only minimally restricted, a .22 LR firearm with a suppressor is often favored for plinking, as it does not require hearing protection or disturb the neighbors. Local government agencies sometimes use suppressed .22 LR weapons for animal control, since dangerous animals or pests can be dispatched in populated areas without causing undue alarm.\nThe .22 LR has also seen limited usage by police and military snipers. Its main advantage in this role is its low noise, but it is usually limited to urban operations because of its short range.[11][12]\nThe Israeli military used a suppressed .22 LR rifle in the 1990s for riot control and to "eliminate disturbing dogs prior to operations," though it is now used less often as it has been shown to be more lethal than previously suspected.[11] Some other examples include the use of suppressed High Standard HDM pistols by the American OSS, which was the predecessor organization of the CIA.[9]. Francis Gary Powers was issued a suppressed High Standard for the flight in which he was shot down. Suppressed Ruger MK II pistols are in current use by the US Navy SEALs.', ''),

Lights been out this night, from around 10-30 pm till 1.am, and just an hour ago, heard some shots from the neighborhood, took out the tomahawk from my bedside and was quickly out onto my front terrase within a minute or so, where in the darkness I observed one [b]fast[/b] running person across the street, some 50-60 yards away. Within a second or so, my attached flashlight was tracing him throughout his action, he didn''t stop! And there you go, I turned on the laser instantly, pointing straight before his feet, and heck, he not only stopped, but even yelled loudly "Khan Sahib, it''s me, Siddaqat"! Ha ha ha, it was our neighborhood Chowkidaar on night duty, running towards the spot of firing, which later appeared to have been started due to a car theft attempt!\n\nI let him go course, but moments after, shot out 3 fires from the Tomahawk, this time around with P.O.F SG, without any problems whatsoever, though I had my doubts on these due to over-expanding shells as per my initial experience, as you may remember, though those were No.4 P.O.F shells.\n\nAnyhow, apart from trouble-free shooting with the SG shells, learnt ONE important thing: The laser [b]DOES[/b] have an "intimidating" effect, indeed! The guy didn''t stop at the flashlight torch, but stopped fully at the red dot pointing at him! O.K I admit, being friendly to me and occasionally discussing weapons issue with me, he DID already know about my lasersights, but still, even if someone doesn''t know about the concept of laser aims, I believe a "red dot" [b]pointing towards the torso or down before the feet of anyone[/b] would indeed give him cause for a second thought, before he proceeds on with any undertaking, whatsoever! I suggest to have such tactical accessories mounted on HD weapons, coz on the SDW''s, it''s gonna inhibit ability to remain a CCW.

(630157, ' Brothers I am glad that majority of the members agreed that POF''s prices are excessive.\n\nNow, after this understanding, I share an idea. Hopefully it will have some impact on POF. I suggest that we email POF higher management on this unrealistic price demand. If we send them emails on large numbers and ask them to bring down prices to 70K maximum for MP5 and MP4 pistols and likewise 100K maximum for the POF semiauto rifle.\nI hope this will atleast make them realize of their fault. Specially keeping in view the POF chief''s recent statement. In which he regretted that he asked govt to let POF run on business footings but govt. running it as a govt organisation. So hopefully this email sending will help them rationalise the price.\n\n[QUOTE=Fraz;467887]IMHO we should stay away from POF products at this price, not because they are inferior or something but we need to tell the POF management that we are not dunces. We can do the math on what should be its price and they shouldn''t try to rip us off. If we refrain from the purchase we might be able to bring the prices down. They have not purchased any new machinery nor there was any R&D involved, then why this cost? The products are from their existing lineage which have been in production for quite sometime. \n\nDisclaimer.

If we want to hunt small game like rabits, ducks, squirrals etc we need a tight MPBR(Maximum Point Blank Range) of 1.5" keeping in mind the small size of the game. This sugegsts the range of the bullet upto 70-75YDS. If we want to try this on medium size game like fox, Jackal etc even then killing zone of these animals dosen''t permit a MPBR of more than 3". This restricts the hunting range upto 100Yds. So, trajectory of the bullet dosent look practical beyond 100Yds even we forget the hitting power of the bullet at that range. \nThis is my humble opinion and i am open to learn from friends.\nRegards:', ''),

If you don''t have a car then you check it in with the establishment''s desk, or you don''t carry that day.. \n\nI actually thought there''d be a lot of feedback on these questions. After all, if one makes his sidearm a part of his everyday life, it has got to have impact on what he does and where he goes and when he greets ppl. So there''d be interesting experiences to share. \n\nLike bro @OmKhan sahab related his experience above. It ''potentially'' indicates two things: 1- Maybe most normal everyday people don''t look for weapons carried by others, which means if one has a well concealed weapon, you''ll not challenge everyday people to assess you as a threat. For their benefit, that gives me confidence :) 2- Maybe people dealing with you are generally alright with you carrying a concealed weapon if, in person, even in a brief social or business encounter, you dont come across as someone to be considered a threat.

Yet, let it be said, once and for all, I wouldn''t have shot at anybody, no matter what, and maximum just some alarming shots, unless my personal property was trespassed upon, that too, only if serious danger had been involved. Yet, you''re absolutely right bro, "paisay poore ho gai hai" :lol: :lol:\n\n@Aquarius......Thanks bro.\n\n@Naveed........Yeah, Naveed, thanks God, the Tomahawk so far seems "non-sensitive" to P.O.F ammo, at least as far as the SG shell casing is concerned, heck I''ll never try out the No.4 again! It still remains a partial "mystery" to me, what actually happened to my first gun, was it the ammo, or the gun? In any case, thanks God it got replaced with a fully functioning one!\n\nBtw, the laser is still placed where it used to be, below the barrel and tube as on the pics posted, the picatinny is used for the Surefire, while the latest mount I got, somehow doesn''t fit right, simply because there is no space for it, it starts touching the pumping grip of the gun and anything installed there is bound to loosen up.

(97063, ' Budha khan sahib, PT99 is more accurate but bigger in size. Baikal is comparatively light and smaller in size. Both are very reliable guns and will never give any stoppage. Try both and buy which you feel fits better in your hand.  \n\nNow for PT99, its basically good for the range because of its adjustable sights. However, these sights are sometimes troublesome if the gun is being carried in the holster etc. So if you are looking for a range gun, go for PT99. But than it has to be carried to the range in the box and after firing, again put in the box. No holster use. If you intend carrying the gun, buy PT92 which is the same gun with fixed sights. \nPersonally speaking, I would like to have a Baikal M446 and PT92 for carrying and PT99 for the range, all three of them. :D \nregards', ''),

(97065, ' grin313 bro, as Aquarius mentioned the only difference in Yargin Pya and Viking is the frame. Internals are the same and one can see the same huge size breach and other things. So theoretically speaking, yes. But practically speaking, 7N21 and 7N31 is strictly a military ammo and can not be sold to anyone except Russian Army. Similarly Yargin Pya can also not be sold to civilians. So even if one has a Viking, he will probably never be firing 7N21 with it :)  However, the owner of a Viking is assured that he can fire any kind of +p or +p+ ammo in his gun and not worry about anything.', ''),

Anyhow its matter of choice, sometime, I felt pump is far better then repeater due to various reasons……………… Red duck is “Red Crested pochard” its bigger then Mallard and unlike other Pochards-ducks its too good in taste. This came back to Pakistan after several years gap, it was in good number for last two years but this year again no reports.

(97085, ' [quote=Gilani]Well I have been hearing very good things about local clones and Idrees Taj sahib posted a very comprehensive review of his local 92fs and in fact seeing the target results, I found his 92fs very accurate. But I did not have a very good experience while range testing three of these local clones in the last two months. All were 92fs clones and all were NIB. Had brilliant finish and I could not point any thing against the finish. The parts inside were though crudely manufactured. So far so good. \n\nHowever, the range tests were quite hopeless for all three of them. May be those that I tested were all lemons but too many lemons I suppose. There were frequent misfires and failure to feed (At an average 2 out of 20 rounds). \n\nIn my standard quick range test I fire while sitting on a chair and with my elbows resting on the table. The purpose is to know the actual performance of a handgun, minimising firer''s error. I fire 5 bullets from 10 M, mark them, then fire 5 bullets from 20 M, mark them as well and finally fire another 5 bullets from 30 M. I repeat this procedure twice. I use the standard pistol target with a 1 inch radius bull. Here is the result of Beretta 92fs clone of one of my friends which he bought last week in 16K. Horrible result on target. \n\n[img]http://i206.photobucket.com/albums/bb136/sualeh/Guns/DSCN5838.jpg[/img]\n\nGenerally, all good handguns score over 130 in this test. Here, I score a paltry 51 with this pistol. You can see that from 20 , the bullets went way off and 2 are not even on the target. From 30 M, I could not land a single bullet anywhere on the target. :o The recoil was too much as compared to actual 92fs. And most surprisingly, there were sparks coming out of the ejection slot because of which, I did not bother to repeat the test and only fired once. \n\nMore or less same was the case with the other two pistols also. [b]May be there are good ones out there as well and I tested the lemons but if the general standard is like this one, I wont recommend any one to trust these pistols for SD unless they have been thoroughly tested on the range by firing at least three hundred rounds.[/b][/quote]', ''),
(97086, ' @Budha Khan Sb, \nGilani Sb will tell you his preference later.. before that you must be already informed that MP446 and PT92 both are combat handguns, i.e delivers enough accuracy, tolerances, reliability and durability for the purpose. If you intend to carry the pistol, one of your deciding factor is weight and form factor. 446 is bit less bulky and feels lighter in this sense. PT92 protruding barrel if you like that in a carry gun? Any specific preferences of yours with respect to form and factor OR Aesthetics would count. \nNext thing is, how the gun shoots in your hands. You should have a thorough check on that. This will verify Grip, Pointability and Trigger preferences of yours. Shoot both. Play with the safeties. Draw fire and holster drills and you will see both pistols are different, catering needs of different people.', ''),

(97108, ' Yesterday I had my first experience with Haris Sb of Al-Haris Traders when I purchased an NIB Taurus PT 145 Pro from them. I was there with them for around half an hour and during this time had some chit chat with him. Main points of my experience are:\n\n- One of the better stocked (inventory-wise) dealers in Karachi. He charges the normal market price for items which are available every where, however, for items (variants) which only he has in his inventory, he charges some premium;\n\n- Most other dealers pick up stuff from their shop to sell it to their customers by adding their own margins of 2k to 5k. Even Pioneer''s Adeel brought the 145 piece from Al-Haris to show it to me and so did Badar Arms;\n\n- Keeping in view that one expects to earn a return on his investment and since he is holding on to exclusive items at his own cost as compared to other dealers, who simply go and bring those exclusive items from him (and few other dealers incl Tayabally), he (Haris) is in his right to charge a reasonable return on his investment. Take my example: I was looking for a two tone PT145. Almost every dealer was able to arrange an all black one in 62k, but no one had the two tone one. The two dealers (Pioneer and Badar) who could arrange it for me were asking 70k. I overheard that one of them was getting it from Al-Haris, so I went straight to him. There, after some negotiation I got it for 65k.\n\n- He was courteous in his dealing throughout the time I was there and so was his other staff. Brought down Armscor .45 rounds price to 80 which others were quoting at 100. \n\n- I didn''t like the first piece brought out for me (because of some marks due to repeated slide racking). He saw my expression and had another fresh piece brought out for me immediately. He told me of other options too in this size. He seemed to be well informed and updated regarding different product variants and their specs. We even discussed H&Ks lawsuit against German Sports Goods resulting in production discontinuation of GSG-5.\n\n[b]And then we discussed PakGuns[/b] :lol:\n\nWith a painful expression on his face, he told me he knew what Pakguns members thought about him and his establishment, (i.e., being over-expensive and rude attitude) however, he patiently tried to explain the above-mentioned return on investment point. He kept emphasizing that his customers have the peace of mind of getting only genuine products without any sort of do-numberi either in arms or in ammo. He also mentioned that only two / three dealers (including himself) have huge investment in their inventory and that on daily basis, a few hundred items of their (his, Tayabally''s, etc) inventory circulates in the market because other dealers come and pick them up to show it to their customers and return it at the end of the day. \n\nIn the end he asked me to come back in case of any problem and he''s there for after sales support, if needed.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\nOn a concluding note:\n\n- Karachi market prices are 15% - 20% higher than Lahore''s, be it for arms or ammo. Why? Haven''t been able to figure that out yet.\n\n- Within Karachi, if one wants to have peace of mind of getting genuine imported products AND if s/he is willing to pay around 5% extra for that peace, then there are a handful of dealers which one should touch, and Al-Haris, Tayabally, Elahi Bux and Pioneer are among such dealers. This is based on my personal experience and others may feel free to disagree with me.\n\nI give this dealer a 7.5 out of 10 (similar to what I would give Tayabally).', ''),

He had also ordered FIA to hold a probe into the scam.\n\nThe Supreme Court hearing a bail petition of an accused in the prohibited bore weapons licences scam wondered how outsiders managed to sneak into government offices to get involved into multi million cheat.\n\nA three-judge bench comprising Chief Justice Iftikhar Mohammad Chaudhry, Justice Chaudhry Ijaz Ahmed and Justice Ghulam Rabbani had taken up the bail petition of Shahzad Ahmed, a private vendor who used to supply stationeries and other data entry equipments to the interior ministry.\n\nThe Chief Justice during the hearing had lamented that those who should have been investigated had been released on bail and even the FIA did not approach courts for cancellation of the bails.\n\nAccused Shahzad is in jail while all the three accused from the Ministry of Interior including section officers Ali Abdullah Khalid, Dr Akhtar Ali Hakro and Malik Iftikhar had been granted bail.\n\nThe prosecution agency has now initiated the process for cancellation of the bail granted to the three officials.\n\nProceedings under the Removal from Service Ordinance 200 have also been initiated against them.\n\nThe minister for interior had also ordered an internal inquiry to determine the status of pending cases of licenses. During the course of investigations, the irregularities unearthed included issuing of arms licences without lawful authority and non-credit of licence fee to the public exchequer.\n\nIn the light of inquiry report and the recommendations of the standing committee of parliament, it has been ordered that arms licences issued against applications having valid authority be issued.\n\nIt was also decided in the meeting that one counter of Nadra will be set up in the Parliament House to facilitate parliamentarians.\n\nLicences will now be issued after lifting the ban by Nadra on behalf of the interior ministry, through an internationally recognised, fool-proof and auditable system.', ''),

Some how I prefer the Ruger  over it.\nThe 34 is accurate but is not in the class of X5 or X6 and the other match pistols.\n\nCZ 85 is a great pistol but if you are looking for a match pistol the CZ 75 based race gun or their match pistol is a class by itself and will compete with the X5 and  X6.\nyou can see the details on the CZ site', ''),

(97294, ' [b]INTRODUCTION[/b]\n\nWhile going through posts about different handgun, I always thought that in many cases, our opinions are biased about the handguns that we own or we have used. There is nothing wrong about it; it is but natural. However, at times the whole exercise of knowing about a weapon goes for a fix when someone doesn''t like a comment or view on one of his favourite handgun. This ignites a futile discussion and the [b]biggest sufferers are less experienced members who log on to this site for knowing authentic facts about the handguns they want to buy or use[/b]. The main reason for this is that most of us do not follow an objective method of reviewing a handgun and do not quantify our opinion. Comparative data is mostly not available and in the absence of objective facts and comparative data, the review mostly takes the shape of a personal opinion.  \n\nNow how to judge a weapon objectively. I have always believed that the final test of a weapon is its firing accuracy and reliability. If a weapon cant put the bullets at intended place and is prone to stoppages or is not rugged enough to bear the field conditions, its no good a weapon no matter what the brand or price. I AM SURE ALL WOULD APPRECIATE THAT ONE SHOULD NEVER COMPROMISE ON RELIABILITY. ON ACCURACY, ONE SHOULD AGAIN NEVER COMPROMISE UNLESS IT IS INTENDED TO KEEP A CONCEAL CARRY GUN. Even while buying a CC gun, one should keep in mind that it must meet 100% reliability and bare minimum accuracy requirements. Hence this thread. \n\nIn this thread, I would request everyone to post firing results of different handguns that we own or use. However, unless there are standard parameters to quantify the results, there is no use of such an exercise. I would therefore suggest a standard method which I have been following myself to check the accuracy of various handguns. [b]This, by no means is a comprehensive method but a quick and economical one.[/b]. Any suggestions to improve this method (while still keeping it economical) would be most welcome. MOST IMPORTANT THING TO REMEMBER IS THAT THIS IS THE TEST OF THE GUN AND NOT OF THE FIRER. \n\n[b]THE METHOD[/b]:\n\n1.  In order to minimise firer''s error, [b]handgun should preferably be fired from a bench.[/b] If a proper firing bench is not available, firer may rest his elbows on a table while himself sitting on a chair. \n\n2.  [b]A standard target[/b] with 1 inch radius bull (10 points) 2 inch radius 9 ring, 3 inch radius 8 ring, 4 inch radius 7 ring and so on, be used for firing. \n\n3.  One round of test fire should consist of [b]15 bullets, 5 fired from 10 M, another 5 from 20 M and another five from 30 M.[/b] The procedure should preferably be repeated twice, ie, total of 30 bullets. Two warmer rounds should be fired from the gun before starting test fire. This will make a total of 32 bullets for one handgun. \n\n4.  [b]Ammo should not be changed[/b] during the test. Moreover, magazine should be filled to max capacity, in order to check the performance of magazine and chances of failure to feed. \n\n5.  [b]Aiming point should be the center of the bull and must not be changed[/b] throughout the test even if a firer can clearly note bias of bullets on a particular side. ie, no adjustments should be done throughout the test. If guns has adjustable sights, they should be zeroed before the test but during the test, sights should not be adjusted. \n\n6.  Photos be taken after each test. \n\n7.  As the number of bullets fired in one go is 15, the test will have 150 points. Add 150 points of the second test and take and average / percentage. I suggest following grading;\n\n    -  [b]Exceptionally Accurate....................95% and above \n     -  Extremely Accurate........................90% - 94.9% \n     -  Very Accurate.................................85% to 89.9% \n     -  Accurate.........................................80% to 84.9% \n     -  Fairly Accurate................................75% to 79.9% \n     -  Moderately Accurate........................ 70% to 74.9%\n     -  Average..........................................60% to 69.9% \n     -  Just acceptable...............................50% to 59.9% \n     -  Inaccurate, should preferably not be bought.......45% to 49.9% \n     -  Junk, Dont buy it.............................44.9% and below[/b]\n\nI always thought that the scoring system of this accuracy test should not be just based on points scored on precision shooting target. The groups formed by the pistol should also be taken into account and should be added to overall score. I have therefore tried to give values to groups formed from 10, 20 and 30 M tests. I am going to amend all the previous results and add the points scored through the groups. It was pointed out by few senior members as well that group formed by a particular handgun should also have some waitage. For standardisation sake, I will be using following values:\n\n[u][b]Group from 10 M[/b][/u]\n-  1.5 inches or less............50 points\n-  1.6 to 2 inches...............45 \n-  2.1 to 2.5 inches............40\n-  2.6 to 3 inches..............35\n-  3.1 to 3.5 inches............30\n-  3.6 to 4 inches...............25\n-  4.1 to 4.5 inches............20\n-  4.6 to 5 inches...............15\n-  5.1 to 5.5 inches............10\n-  5.6 to 6 inces................5\n-  Over 6 inches................0\n\n[u][b]Group from 20 M[/b][/u]\n-  2 inches or less............50 points\n-  2.1 to 3 inches.............45 \n-  3.1 to 4 inches.............40\n-  4.1 to 5 inches.............35\n-  5.1 to 6 inches.............30\n-  6.1 to 7 inches.............25\n-  7.1 to 8 inches.............20\n-  8.1 to 9 inches.............15\n-  9.1 to 10 inches...........10\n-  10.1 to 11 inces............5\n-  Over 11 inches..............0\n\n[u][b]Group from 30 M[/b][/u]\n-  3 inches or less............50 points\n-  3.1 to 4 inches.............45 \n-  4.1 to 5 inches.............40\n-  5.1 to 6 inches.............35\n-  6.1 to 7 inches.............30\n-  7.1 to 8 inches.............25\n-  8.1 to 9 inches.............20\n-  9.1 to 10 inches...........15\n-  10.1 to 11 inches..........10\n-  11.1 to 12 inces............5\n-  Over 12 inches..............0\n\n8.  [b]MOST IMPORTANT THING TO REMEMBER IS THAT THIS IS THE TEST OF THE GUN AND NOT OF THE FIRER.[/b] So please don''t try to improve the result by making adjustmet. Just fire the gun as it is, adhering to standard parameters mentioned above. \n\n9.  Post the pics in the thread and wait for the comments :D\n\nI will start the thread by posting the test fire results of a few handguns. I am sure others would also add their pics following the standard procedure. After some time, we will have a good number of pics concerning different guns and a new user will be able to compare the results and at least have some objective input about one of the very important aspects of any handgun. \n\nThanks and regards\n\n=============================================================================================\n=============================================================================================\n\n[quote=Gilani][b][u]S U M M A R Y   OF   R E S U L T S   S O   F A R  : [color=red]Updated on Sep 6th, 2010[/color][/u][/b]\n\nI was just wondering that the size of this thread has gone quite enormous and it may be difficult for the members to go through all the pages and see the results of all handguns, when they want to draw a comparison. I have therefore summarized the performance of all handguns tested so far in this post. I have also categorized them as per their size / use. The purpose of doing this is that though all handguns are being tested using the same procedure, their accuracy results do not carry equal values in my view. For example, a score of 65% by a sub-compact gun may be far better than a score of 70% by a large frame gun. Mathematical values are good as they describe the results in tangible form but in the end, members should carry out their own analysis keeping in mind their own peculiar requirements for a handgun. Hope it helps  :) \n\n	\n[b][u][i][color=Red]LARGE FRAME HANDGUNS[/color][/i][/u][/b]\n\n	1.

So please don''t get carried away too much with the mathematics. If Handgun A is scoring 77.11 and handgun B is scoring 74.34 than it does not necessarily mean that handgun A is better. Perhaps both are of same category . If PT99 and CZ999 are on top of the list than it does not mean that these are two most accurate pistols around and are better than say Glock 17 or few other because these have scored better percentage.  However, it does mean that both of them are accurate handguns and can be trusted for accuracy :) \n\n3.  Few handguns have performed really bad. This again does not mean that all specimens of this brand would perform the same way. May be the one I tested was a lemon or its sights were way out. [b]But one thing is for sure; there is some serious problem somewhere.[/b] So please keep that handgun on your watch list and check it thoroughly before making a decision to buy it. \n\n4.  [b]Please do also understand my limitations as a human being.[/b] I will never be able to give a standard performance every time because it is humanly not possible; only machines can do it. Accordingly, the results may slightly vary for different handguns but not too much. \n\n5.  [b]This, by no means is a marketing campaign for a few handguns and a dumping campaign for the others.[/b] You may consult this as a reference but finally make your own decision while you are buying a handgun, keeping in mind your requirements and pocket. \n\n6.  Therefore, [b]these tests are not a most scientifically conducted final verdict on a particular handgun, however, they do provide a tangible basis for judging one of the most important characteristic of any handgun; its accuracy.[/b]  \n\n\n\nThanks and regards :)[/quote]\n\n=============================================================================================\n=============================================================================================', ''),

I find Skeeter60 Sb., an avid hunter and experienced shooter, skeptical. HJ, an accomplished rifleman with a strong technical base also sounds incredulous about the potency of .22LR.\nPersonally I am handicapped and can’t claim to belong to this league. I can only say that with a rifle I am a decent shot. But, I have seen some incredible shots being taken with a .22, even a flying kite was brought down, but these were all at the range of 60-80 meters, nothing beyond 100. EXCEPT for one shot!! I must here narrate the story of that ONE shot which may shed some light on the lethal range of a .22.\nThis shot was taken by a friend at a range of approximately 150 meters at least at something which was emitting highly offensive sounds during one of this winter’s night. The rifle was equipped with a scope. It was a case of ‘one shot-one kill.’ In the dead of the night, a shot rang out and the sounds abruptly ceased. It was only after a couple of days that the loudspeaker (of the marriage hall) was replaced and the sounds started again.\nNow that speaks out loud about the lethality and accuracy of a high velocity .22 round well beyond 100 meters.\nI often wonder what the ballisticians would say about the shot.

I checked both of them, disassembled both, checked out each and every part and specially the trigger on both to settle down with this pistol. Asking price was 63K settled on 57K + 3K for a cheap Laser module. This specific piece has date of birth printed on box sticker, 28/12/2009 which shows its only 3 months old.\n[url=http://www.postimage.org/image.php?v=TsivRh9][img]http://s2.postimage.org/ivRh9.jpg[/img][/url]\n[url=http://www.postimage.org/image.php?v=Tsiw0fJ][img]http://s2.postimage.org/iw0fJ.jpg[/img][/url]\n[url=http://www.postimage.org/image.php?v=Tsiw2KS][img]http://s2.postimage.org/iw2KS.jpg[/img][/url]\n[url=http://www.postimage.org/image.php?v=TsiwcJr][img]http://s2.postimage.org/iwcJr.jpg[/img][/url]\n[url=http://www.postimage.org/image.php?v=TsiwmI0][img]http://s2.postimage.org/iwmI0.jpg[/img][/url]\n[url=http://www.postimage.org/image.php?v=Tsiwubr][img]http://s2.postimage.org/iwubr.jpg[/img][/url]\n[url=http://www.postimage.org/image.php?v=TsiwzaJ][img]http://s2.postimage.org/iwzaJ.jpg[/img][/url]\n[url=http://www.postimage.org/image.php?v=TsiwEa0][img]http://s2.postimage.org/iwEa0.jpg[/img][/url]\n[url=http://www.postimage.org/image.php?v=TsivEOr][img]http://s2.postimage.org/ivEOr.jpg[/img][/url]\n[url=http://www.postimage.org/image.php?v=TsivMhS][img]http://s2.postimage.org/ivMhS.jpg[/img][/url]\n\n\n[b]Shopping Experience:[/b]\nIt was so so. I liked PARA''s attitude as they do let a customer field strip and inspect a weapon thoroughly including trigger inspection. But what went wrong was they first assured me for VISA transaction and later on when the deal was done they told me their VISA swapping machine was not responding. Any how I managed to pay them in cash with a cold grin on my face. More over, I met Abbas sb and Sohail sb at the shop with their Winchester 1300 and it was so nice meeting them both. \n\n\n[b]The choice make up:[/b]\nI wanted a Hi cap modern 9mm pistol with best of the features available in latest generation of handguns. I intend to carry every now and then and do some fun shoot and also mild to serious combat shooting practice with the new pistol. Wanted a grip of my preference and a nice trigger to count on. My barrel choice was 5" for some sports shooting and always prefered hammer over striker fired mechanism with grip/trigger combo on top priority. I did want a picattiny rail for some fun factor indeed.\n\n\n[b]The Final Contest:[/b]\nContestants in my game were Taurus 24/7 OSS DS, Baikal MP-446, and the last Taurus PT 809. Literally scanned through all options available under 80k and narrowed down my choice to above three candidates.\nDropped out MP-446 only beccause of its aesthetics which inclined me towards Taurus 809, then dropped out OSS on how its so famous and well reputed 24/7 Grips felt not so good in my hand. It felt bad to let go 5" barrel of OSS and durability of MP-446.\n\n\n\n[b]What I like in 800 series:[/b]\n\n[b]Trigger:[/b]\nI like the trigger. It came out as a top trigger in all 3 contestants. Crisp break felt like 4 to 5 pound in SA, however there is a free slack before that which is lengtheir than many good triggers in the pistol world. DA is very smooth and consistant pull but is heavy, felt around 10 to 11 pound. Now the best part is the trigger reset in SA mode. Reset is so small and close that it literally marvelled me. I can think of faster double taps and other drills in combat style shooting due to this feature which is so helpful in the sense. Please check this video to have the exact idea of the short reset trigger on this pistol: [url]http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cVuOhJjG5Bs[/url]\n[url=http://www.postimage.org/image.php?v=Tsiy8Xr][img]http://s2.postimage.org/iy8Xr.jpg[/img][/url]\n[url=http://www.postimage.org/image.php?v=Tsiy1t0][img]http://s2.postimage.org/iy1t0.jpg[/img][/url]\n\n\n[b]Grip:[/b]\nI must say for me it was the Top Grip of all pistols I have handled in my life. All of them. In my opinion, when looking for a handgun, look for fit first. We shoot handguns that fit us a lot better than ones that don''t. Resultingly it will automatically point better and you''ll be more accurate with it. When you get the right gun into your hands, you will know it. So did I and the best thing is this model comes with 2 extra backstraps. NIB it is fitted with the Medium backstrap which I changed to Large. There is also a Small one for smaller hands.\n[url=http://www.postimage.org/image.php?v=TsiyRR0][img]http://s2.postimage.org/iyRR0.jpg[/img][/url]\n[url=http://www.postimage.org/image.php?v=TsiyUl9][img]http://s2.postimage.org/iyUl9.jpg[/img][/url]\n\n\n[b]Sights:[/b]\nSights are 3-dot Novak type, white dot. Very visible and eye relaxing. They are dove tailed with the rare sight has a screw on it for windage adjustment only. I am satisfied with the feel of the sights as per my requirement and usage.\n[url=http://www.postimage.org/image.php?v=Pq6sgZJ][img]http://s3.postimage.org/6sgZJ.jpg[/img][/url]\n[url=http://www.postimage.org/image.php?v=Pq6sot9][img]http://s3.postimage.org/6sot9.jpg[/img][/url]\n[url=http://www.postimage.org/image.php?v=Pq6sDr0][img]http://s3.postimage.org/6sDr0.jpg[/img][/url]\n\n\n[b]Barrel and Recoil Spring:[/b]\nBarrel is Hammer Forged Stainless steel. Not Hard Chromed which is just as good if you get what I mean. Feed ramp is polished and shiny accompanied by the frame feeding lip which is also polished. Recoil Spring rod is PLASTIC, sorry to say that I always wanted metal guide rod but anyway. It is Seecamp style(Seecamp company fitted their pistols with this type for first time) dual-captured guide rod. I like it as it is known to take more stress with higher pressure ammo or by higher mileage. 4th Gen Glock also introduced this type of recoil spring assembly in I think G21 please correct me if I am worng.\n[url=http://www.postimage.org/image.php?v=gxk8VrJ][img]http://s1.postimage.org/k8VrJ.jpg[/img][/url]\n[url=http://www.postimage.org/image.php?v=gxk8XWS][img]http://s1.postimage.org/k8XWS.jpg[/img][/url]\n[url=http://www.postimage.org/image.php?v=gxk8_r0][img]http://s1.postimage.org/k8_r0.jpg[/img][/url]\n[url=http://www.postimage.org/image.php?v=gxk91W9][img]http://s1.postimage.org/k91W9.jpg[/img][/url]\n[url=http://www.postimage.org/image.php?v=gxk94qi][img]http://s1.postimage.org/k94qi.jpg[/img][/url]\n[url=http://www.postimage.org/image.php?v=TsiAE5r][img]http://s2.postimage.org/iAE5r.jpg[/img][/url]\n[url=http://www.postimage.org/image.php?v=TsiAVyr][img]http://s2.postimage.org/iAVyr.jpg[/img][/url]\n[url=http://www.postimage.org/image.php?v=aVLXWhS][img]http://s4.postimage.org/LXWhS.jpg[/img][/url]\n[url=http://www.postimage.org/image.php?v=aVLY7LA][img]http://s4.postimage.org/LY7LA.jpg[/img][/url]\n\n\n[b]Slide:[/b]\nSlide is Inox Matte finish as mentioned on the box sticker and is made from forged steel. Thanks it is provided with matte finish and not a shiny one otherwise I would prefer to go with the Black finish. I chose SS over Black mainly because of hot humid climate in our cities. SS is very much more resistant to scratches caused by mis handling or extensive holster use and also to the humidity changes. Slide is well finished I must say 90% for the finish quality of the slide, both external and internal.\n[url=http://www.postimage.org/image.php?v=TsiAGAA][img]http://s2.postimage.org/iAGAA.jpg[/img][/url]\n[url=http://www.postimage.org/image.php?v=TsiB4x0][img]http://s2.postimage.org/iB4x0.jpg[/img][/url]\n[url=http://www.postimage.org/image.php?v=TsiB9wi][img]http://s2.postimage.org/iB9wi.jpg[/img][/url]\n[url=http://www.postimage.org/image.php?v=TsiBg_J][img]http://s2.postimage.org/iBg_J.jpg[/img][/url]\n[url=http://www.postimage.org/image.php?v=TsiBl_0][img]http://s2.postimage.org/iBl_0.jpg[/img][/url]\n[url=http://www.postimage.org/image.php?v=TsiBysJ][img]http://s2.postimage.org/iBysJ.jpg[/img][/url]\n[url=http://www.postimage.org/image.php?v=TsiBFX9][img]http://s2.postimage.org/iBFX9.jpg[/img][/url]\n[url=http://www.postimage.org/image.php?v=TsiBUV0][img]http://s2.postimage.org/iBUV0.jpg[/img][/url]\n[url=http://www.postimage.org/image.php?v=TsiFgW9][img]http://s2.postimage.org/iFgW9.jpg[/img][/url]\n[url=http://www.postimage.org/image.php?v=TsiFvU0][img]http://s2.postimage.org/iFvU0.jpg[/img][/url]\n\n\n[b]Safeties:[/b]\nShe has it all. Can be carried cocked and locked (safety is flipped up). Safety parallel to slide is Ready position. Down is Decock. Safety lever is truely within the natural range of your thumb. I kind of loved playing with it up and down and that with a complete intact grip. You dont need to alter your hand grip to manipulate the safety lever and this has added a very nice and secure feel to the safety system. \n[url=http://www.postimage.org/image.php?v=TsiGWH9][img]http://s2.postimage.org/iGWH9.jpg[/img][/url]\n\n\n[b]Form and Factor:[/b]\nIt is a lighter gun weight wise @ 800 grams but not in competition with lighter pistols in the market. Weight balance is perfect and feels centered i.e not muzzle heavy. 17 round magazine capacity, 1-spare magazine with a Magazine Loader provided in the box. Size I must say is not optimum as a carry piece, moreover rails on the frame makes it harder to carry. But best thing is that I have decided that I will carry it. Pistol is completely ambidextrous, which ever lever or button is on right side is present on the left side as well.\n\n\n[b]Specifications:[/b]\n\nLet us have an overview of official 809 specs:\n\nCaliber 9 mm (9X19 NATO) \nAction Single and double action (SA/DA) \nCapacity 17 shots \nBarrel length 108.6 mm \nTotal length 197 mm \nTotal height 152 mm \nGrip width 29 mm (grip) and 36 mm (levers) \nDistance between sights 150 mm \nTrigger pull weight SA: (2.0 - 3.0)kg - DA: (4.0 - 6.0)kg \nWeight (w/empty magazine) 800 g \nSights Fixed,3 dots system - tritium (optional) \nMaterials Slide: carbon steel or stainless steel \nBarrel: stainless steel - Grip (frame): polymer \nSafety Devices Firing pin block \nManual safety & decocker - ambidextrous \nLoaded chamber indicator \nTaurus Security System \nSlide - finishing Tenifer, blue or stainless \nRifling 6 grooves, right hand \n\n\n[b]Laser Module:[/b]\nInitially I thought I did not have enough funds to purchase a Laser/torch module until I came across this cheaper than anything Laser for only 3K. Thing is a starter piece not for serious work though I doubt it would hold Zero perfectly. I did test it by jerking the pistol with it on the rails as hard as I could and did not see any change in aim. I''ll see how it performs later on actual firing sessions. It came with additional weaver mounts and fits on the rails using picattiny mounts. It''s model name is JG-5B Red laser with output of 5mW. I checked it in sunlight and it seemed very visible on sun lit wall.\n[url=http://www.postimage.org/image.php?v=TsiJAOJ][img]http://s2.postimage.org/iJAOJ.jpg[/img][/url]\n[url=http://www.postimage.org/image.php?v=TsiJgRA][img]http://s2.postimage.org/iJgRA.jpg[/img][/url]\n[url=http://www.postimage.org/image.php?v=TsiI_oA][img]http://s2.postimage.org/iI_oA.jpg[/img][/url]\n\n\n[b]Other Remarks:[/b]\nSlide to Polymer frame fitting is very loose. No big deal because slide has extremely rock solid fitting with steel inserts in the polymer frame. I tested it by violently jerking the pistol after removing magazines. No it does not rattle at all. Not by micro mm''s. Barrel fit is A+. Tried to move the barrel from muzzle end with locked breech, again great that it does not show any movements.\nI found this pistol very interesting as it has certain resemblances with many designs from other top handguns. For example, it field strips exactly like a Glock which I think is simplest on earth. Barrel Lugs and locking resembles that of a SIG P-series. Trigger system like 1911 on the grounds of Cocked and Locked carry and slide contours and distinctive lines like that of an HK. The grip, the backstrap and to some extent the form factor resembles FNP-9 pistol. This pistol is relitively new and doesn''t have all that huge track records but who ever has handled it has given thumbs up to the accuracy and reliability that it delivered.\n[url=http://www.postimage.org/image.php?v=gxkeCDi][img]http://s1.postimage.org/keCDi.jpg[/img][/url]\n[url=http://www.postimage.org/image.php?v=gxkev8S][img]http://s1.postimage.org/kev8S.jpg[/img][/url]\n[url=http://www.postimage.org/image.php?v=gxkesEJ][img]http://s1.postimage.org/kesEJ.jpg[/img][/url]\n\n\n[b]NOTE:[/b] Viewers can have a look on this really fantastic video of 809 E doing a high round count which I found on youtube: [url]http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w0LTeme0vuw[/url]\n\n\n[b]UPDATES (17th April, 2010):[/b]\nA Casual Range review of 809 out of the box...\nLink: [url]http://www.pakguns.com/forum/viewtopic.php?pid=116027#p116027[/url]\n\n\n[b]UPDATES (1st May, 2010):[/b]\nTaurus PT 809 9mm (2nd range review)\nLink: [url]http://www.pakguns.com/forum/viewtopic.php?pid=119625#p119625[/url]\n\nRegards.', ''),

(97366, 'Review: BRNO 7mm Rifle This Brno 7mm bolt action rifle made in Czechoslovakia was bought NIB in 1974. All the Mauser rifles are built like tanks and they can take a lot of abuse. This 7mm is an absolute joy to shoot and I am very comfortable with it as compared to its substitute calibers. It has an inner magazine of 5 rounds with thumb safety. Comes with a very light adjustable trigger for better accuracy. I don''t know why the 7mm always gets described as a weaker caliber. It has almost the power of a 270 with heavier and wider bullets, which amount to about the same killing power. Easy to mount any kind of scope on it, is light weight with a 23-1/2 inch barrel, 43 inch overall length. The Brno has excellent sights which has helped me shoot running bores at 70+ yards without scope. It has a smooth recoil.\n\nI have read many reviews in Pakistan that the 7mm has a bullet drop problem beyond 300metres. To this I always ask people about how many animals have they shot beyond that range and then none is the answer. The 300 meters drop problem also occurs when the bullet used exceeds 150 grains other wise it has a flat hit at 500 meters with less than 150 grain bullets. Majority of the animals like wild bore, deer, hog deer and others are shot in our part of the world at much closer distances than 300 meters. So why think of this beautiful caliber as rubbish and go for 243 or 270.\n\n[b]The 7x57 (7mm) Mauser is considered a weak caliber these days, but W.D.M.  Bell, using 175 grain solids, killed hundreds of elephants with the caliber in his time. [/b]\n\n\n[url=http://www.postimage.org/image.php?v=aVLY0h9][img]http://s4.postimage.org/LY0h9.jpg[/img][/url]\n\n[url=http://www.postimage.org/image.php?v=aVLZZ_i][img]http://s4.postimage.org/LZZ_i.jpg[/img][/url]\n\n[url=http://www.postimage.org/image.php?v=aVL_Pni][img]http://s4.postimage.org/L_Pni.jpg[/img][/url]\n\n[url=http://www.postimage.org/image.php?v=aVM0JKA][img]http://s4.postimage.org/M0JKA.jpg[/img][/url]\n\n[url=http://www.postimage.org/image.php?v=aVM1LBi][img]http://s4.postimage.org/M1LBi.jpg[/img][/url]\n\n[url=http://www.postimage.org/image.php?v=aVM2FYA][img]http://s4.postimage.org/M2FYA.jpg[/img][/url]\n\n[url=http://www.postimage.org/image.php?v=aVM45LJ][img]http://s4.postimage.org/M45LJ.jpg[/img][/url]\n\n[url=http://www.postimage.org/image.php?v=aVM4W8J][img]http://s4.postimage.org/M4W8J.jpg[/img][/url]\n\n[url=http://www.postimage.org/image.php?v=aVM5X_r][img]http://s4.postimage.org/M5X_r.jpg[/img][/url]\n\n[url=http://www.postimage.org/image.php?v=aVM6AUJ][img]http://s4.postimage.org/M6AUJ.jpg[/img][/url]\n\n\n\nAt close ranges the 7mm is much powerful than its competitors. I have shot many wild bores with my 7mm from 20 meters to 150 meters+ and you would be surprised to know that the bore dosen’t move from the impact place even if it takes a hit in the back with a 7mm bullet. Though the bore has to be finished later with a pistol but what I am trying to say is that the power of this caliber gives you the liberty of hitting any body part and not just the vital organs. In the picture below, the second bore from the left was shot with a 7mm bullet in the back and it could not move from that place as the bones of that area were smashed with the power of this bullet. \n\n\n[url=http://www.postimage.org/image.php?v=gxk73d0][img]http://s1.postimage.org/k73d0.jpg[/img][/url]\n\n\n[b]Ballistic performance[/b]\n\nBullet weight/type	                                     Velocity	                         Energy\n140 gr (9.1 g)  	                             2,800 ft/s (850 m/s)	                      2,437 ft•lbf \n\n150 gr (9.7 g)                       	             2,650 ft/s (810 m/s)	                      2,339 ft•lbf \n\n\n7mm bullet size comparison with .22lr\n\n[url=http://www.postimage.org/image.php?v=TsiWkZJ][img]http://s2.postimage.org/iWkZJ.jpg[/img][/url]\n\n\nKeeping in view its price of around 40k and the easy availability of the bullets, I would suggest it as an excellent buy.', ''),

(97391, ' Made a post on buying a used CF98 a few days back and got two replies before it was closed [url]http://www.pakguns.com/forum/viewtopic.php?id=4243[/url] . The replies suggested that I go for a new CF. The post was closed because I think it violated some rule, am not sure which one, however, my apologies to the Moderators for this misunderstanding. Anyways went to PARA located at Neela GUmbad since I had surveyed the market and found their prices to be the best and bought myself a brand new CF98. Un-boxing it was a treat, something which happened for the first time! The pistol cost me 28K. The pics are attached for the members to see and appreciate. De-flowering ceremony of the gun is scheduled 2-3 days form now. Cleaned the gun and oiled it yesterday. Yes, am very excited about it :-) The best  part was the fine treatment meted out by the PARA staff. These guys know how to treat their customers.

(97463, ' Doc. I mostly us modified or improved cylinder chocks on ducks.  My first choice always been improved cylinder in early season, there are several reasons to justify first we start game with quails and afterwards ducks. Starting duck mostly has no fat at their body plus size also at miniscule level, further, early ducks are easy to dodge and usually we shot them within 30 years. After December sometimes I change my chock to modified, if there are some chances to shoot passing ducks otherwise I feel happy with the same.\n\nAs far as cartridges are concern, my first choice is 6# since years. However, 8# is my favorite number over decoy spread especially SUPER is marvelous. Our recent shoot was a good bag and I used many 8 super successfully that day, but my mates were so annoyed that I am wounding ducks which are unrecoverable due to shorter pallets. Which was a genuine reason which I also observed and shifted to 6#? People often brag using smaller number cartridges but its real 6 & 8 number is good for any type of waterfowling. I hardly used 4# since years. Anyhow, recommended is 4# in duck shooting so dnt try to shift if u r happy with any of them.\n\nShot placement is a science which cannot be phrased, it’s a practice only. There are so many shooting styles and each one is scientifically proved fine. I believe in proper gun fit, means gun should be part of body. There are several steps involved like Length of pull, Cast off/On, Drop on comb, cheek on stock. BLA Bla Bla ……… I never give any lead to any flying bird ……. Do U Believe ?????????? …… Yes ……. I have swing action of shooting, in which there is no concept of lead………… Doc yaar, forget it and be happy what u r doing …………….. It’s a headache (FO)', ''),

Denovo Sir left from Sialkot a bit late, around 2.30 P.M to be correct, and therefore also reached here by me a bit late, yet as I had requested him, [i]just[/i] before it was totally dark, so we still managed a quick visit to my village, where after inspecting my new under-construction site, we proceeded to the "inevitable", some good deal of [b]FIRING[/b], with both types of weapons and ammo whatsoever! ;)\n\nThe Tomahawk was in action as well, and we observed one heck of a difference in both sound and recoil between the P.O.F S.G shells and Nicosian B.B, 34 Grs shells, heck the latter was quite a bang! The Tomahawk, Naveed bro, performed perfectly with both types of ammo!\n\nNext step was a dinner at famous local restaurant "Green Lagoon", where we had asked the waiter to provide us some "private" corner for the dinner, but since nothing like that was available on the spot, heck, Denovo Sir started teaching me the field-strip of the P.T 145, [b]right there on the table[/b], amidst a hall full of glaring looks! In a few attempts, I finally managed with his assistance to do it properly, though I must say, it''s not quite the same as field-stripping of a Stoeger/Beretta!\n\nWe followed up the dinner with tea-time gup-shup, back at my place, and then the whole night went guys with lots and lots of "weaponry" talk, and may I say here, apart from being the genius with weapons that Denovo Sir is, he''s one nice gentleman in the company whom, heck even dumb walls can burst into laughter! We slept nothing before 2.30 A.M! \n\nI even had the chance to play around with his beautiful Beretta Centurion, which I must say looks like one quality weapon, and it is!\n\nDenovo Sir graciously gifted my son with a MITRE football, and I must say it was a great relief to have "Billy-The-Kid" off the guns and onto the balls, at least temporarily! Btw Den, his first question next morning after your leave was simply" Baba, where is my Pakguns Uncle"!

But to draw a comparison, we all must follow the same procedure. Also, this is to be remembered that this is neither the test of a firer''s ability nor it is to prove a particular gun as good or bad. The purpose is to just educate each other in the light of ground results and know about one of the most important characteristics of a handgun. I understand that results would still differ slightly, depending upon the ability of a firer but this issue would be addressed when a number of results of one gun would be available to a viewer. The law of averages would finally do the talking. :)   \n\n[quote=Skeeter60]Kindly also mention the POF Mk 2z  genuine ammo is so wonderful as you are using it in all the guns and tell us if you ever faced any problem with any gun using it. It is absolutely fine and normal for use in any Pistol or Machine Pistol.[/quote]\nSir, like you, I am also using POF 2Z since many years in my handguns and there have been no problems with any handgun except Taurus 24/7, Akdal Ghost  and occasionally with CF98 and Stoeger Cougar. With pistols like Walther P38, Taurus PT 92 and 99, Beretta 92FS, CZ999 Scorpion, Norinco NP22, Llama M82, Baikal M446 Viking, HP77B, Glock 17, Glock 19 and few others that I don''t exactly recall, there have been no problems whatsoever. Its a fine quality reliable ammo.', ''),

Qabool Muhammad IV]1 The best colone of Italian version. [/quote]\nIn my view it''s a copy of one of the mediocre models manufactured by Beretta (Cougar 8000). Beretta stopped manufacturing Cougar 8000, [b]simply because it could not compete with contemporary small / medium frame guns like Glock 19, H&K P2000, H&K P7, CZ75 Compact, CZ75 P01, Walther P99 etc which provided better quality in more or less the same price.[/b] \n\n\n\n[quote=Dr. S. Qabool Muhammad IV]2 light weight. [/quote]\n[b]How?[/b] Stoeger Cougar weights around 910 grams which makes it one of the heavier pistols available in the market in small / medium frame. Pistols like Glock 19 (595 grams), PT145 (620 grams), Walther P99 (540 grams) and H&K 2000 (704 grams) weigh far lighter than a Cougar. [b]So Stoeger Cougar is not a light weight pistol by any means.[/b]  \n\n\n\n[quote=Dr. S. Qabool Muhammad IV]3 The best safety wise. [/quote]\nWell. Stoeger''s safety mechanism is good but nothing of a cutting edge thing. So many others (except Glock) also have similar or better safety mechanism. \n \n\n\n[quote=Dr. S. Qabool Muhammad IV]4 Easy to chamber. [/quote]\nYes it is. \n\n\n\n[quote=Dr. S. Qabool Muhammad IV]5 It is perctigeous to possess as it is regarded same as the bretta. [/quote]\nWell it may differ from person to person. For someone else, it may not be that prestigious to possess [b]a copy of a mediocre model of an outstanding company. [/b]\n \n\n\n[quote=Dr. S. Qabool Muhammad IV]6: Majority of professional favour this pistol. [/quote]\n[b]Which professionals?[/b]. Could you please be kind enough to mention a few Armies and LEAs who are using Stoeger Cougar? At least Turkish Army and LEAs are not using their local manufactured Stoeger and are more inclined towards Sarsilmaz and Zigana pistols and few others.  \n\n\n\n[quote=Dr. S. Qabool Muhammad IV]7 Very good in conceal carry.[/quote] \n[b]That is exactly what it is not.[/b] It was supposed to be a conceal carry pistol but could not come up to the standards. It is 177 mm long, quite thick at the grip portion and weighs 910 grams. On the contrary, Glock 26 (which in my view is a very good conceal carry pistol) is 160 mm long, just 30 mm in thickness and weighs just 560 grams. HK 2000SK is 163 mm long and weighs 680 grams, Taurus PT145 which measures just 153 mm and weighs 620 grams. etc etc So Stoeger Cougar is neither a full size pistol nor a conceal carry pistol. Its something in between. It certainly cant be termed as better than Glock 26, HK2000SK, Taurus Pt145 and many others in Coneal Carry aspect. AK 47 sahib has both Stoeger and PT145 and would be able to comment better which one is better in conceal carry and is it really comfortable to conceal carry a Stoeger. \n\n\n\n[quote=Dr. S.

(97654, ' Mitho bhai, [b] I compared Beretta Cougar 8000 with the likes of Glock 19, H&K 2000, H&K P7, CZ75B Compact, CZP01[/b] which were pistols in almost same size and price range available in European / US markets at that time (90s - early 2003).  All are from top weapon manufacturing companies, however, Beretta Cougar 8000 could not flourish as expected because it was in competition with these pistols at that time and was not found better than the above mentioned pistols. (I have not included Colts and kimbers and S&Ws and others of the same range in comparison because they had a higher price tag). [b]I did not compare Stoeger Cougar with the above mentioned guns simply because as you said, there is no comparison.[/b] Those guns are a different class.    \n\nAs for the price, I replied to a comment of Dr Qabool sahib which stated that Stoeger is light and good for conceal carry. Now here we are talking about a weapon capability whether its good or average or bad, in isolation. We are not talking about the price which is altogether a different issue. I would have accepted the argument if it was said that [b]" though Stoeger Cougar is not better than these guns in weight and conceal carry capability, however, out of available gun in Pakistan in <65K range, Stoeger Cougar is a better option"[/b]. :)\n\nNow the price. Let''s not talk of Pakistan prices for a moment. OK, Glock 19 is selling in US in +-550 $. Stoeger Cougar price as quoted on the Stoeger website is 465-499 $ for different models. So not much of a price difference outside Pakistan really. So outside Pakistan, Stoeger can be very much compared with Glock 19 from price bracket point of view. Now who would buy Stoeger Cougar instead of Glock 19? In Pakistan, it''s altogether a different issue. CZ999 sold in US as Charles Dally ZDA up to 585 $ which was equal to or in certain cases was more than the price of a normal Glock. In Pakistan, it is selling around 10-12 k cheaper than Stoeger Cougar. So prices in Pakistan are really no criterion in my view to judge the class of a weapon. Its all a matter of availability and import / export rules and duties.   \n\nLastly, [b]Glock 19 is an outstanding pistol but not a high end pistol[/b]. It falls in the category of medium priced pistols, and so is Stoeger Cougar. High end pistols are the likes of Wilson Combat, Ed Brown, Colt, Kimber, STI, S&W, Sig etc etc which are well over 1000 $ range and in many cases, touching a 3000 $ price tag. As I already said, prices in Pakistan are really no criteria to judge the class of a weapon. \n\nthanks and regards', ''),

(97677, ' Mitho bhai, I think I have not been able to make my point easily understandable. :) OK, let me try again. \n\n[b]When we discuss a particular characteristic or capability of a weapon, it is in isolation and on the basis of technical and ground facts only.[/b] \n\n[b]When we want to buy a weapon, the price comes in. So they are two very different things and we should not mix them up.[/b] \n\nWhat I am trying to say is that since Glock is 250K in Pakistan and Stoeger is 55K, we can''t say that Glock is very accurate because it is 250 k and Stoeger is not that accurate because it is 55k (itne paison me itne he accuracy milty hay :)) and CZ999 and Canik Piranha are not that good because they cost 45k and 40K respectively. For judging accuracy, we have to go to the range and fire the weapons on a proper target. The weapon which fires better is more accurate, regardless of its price and the weapon which does not fire well is not accurate, again regardless of its price. In the same manner, all other characteristics / capabilities of a weapon are tested, regardless of the price. So its more of a technical and practical thing. At the end of the day, we should have the knowledge of the actual performance of a weapon in tangible terms, off course regardless of the price. \n\nNow comes the second and important stage. Which weapon to buy? If we have good knowledge / knowhow of most commonly available weapons in the market, we would be in a much better condition to make a decision. This decision should mainly depend on three things; [b]how much can one afford, for what purpose weapon is required and personal liking / preference.[/b] Which one of these 3 is given more weightage  is a matter of personal preference. Sound practical and technical knowledge would certainly help us in making a correct decision and we would be able to correctly determine that what is the real worth of the weapons available in the market, what do I need (purpose) and how much I can afford.  \n\nI hope things are not further confused. :)\nregards', ''),

Sir would you please elaborate for a lay man on relation between head spacing and accurate loadings. Just out of curiosity I wanted to know it however no chances of me sitting and handloading soon. Thanks.[/quote]\n\n@Midrees Taj\n\nHead Space is something very different from bullet seating depth. The bullet seating depth is relative to the distance  of the bullet shank first contact point  from the rifling. \n \nTo make it simpler, how far the bullet travels on firing from the case mouth to the rifling (lands & grooves ) . It is determined by blackening the bullet with candle soot or when your wife is not looking with her eye brow pencil. \nYou seat the bullet in the case mouth so far  that the bullet just touches the rifling, this will be obvious with the four  shiny marks on the bullet where the  lands  contact the bullet. \nAt this point we turn the seating stem a quarter turn to seat the bullet 1/28 inches short of touching the rifling.\nIf the bullets are in contact with the rifling the pressure can and will go up due to resistance; but when there is a running start, the bullet is already in forward motion the pressure will not shoot up on contacting the rifling.\nWe also prefer this much gap to cater for variations in case  dimensions and dirt/grit or oil ect can prevent locking/chambering.\nIt has been experienced that the rifles usually shoot best with minimum allowable  distance between  the bullet and the rifling. There is a sweet spot how ever which you can only find by trial and error. If the distance is longer as in case of all factory rounds, which the manufacturer makes so that these chamber in all rifles with the shortest throat in mind , these bullets will not be at their best in long throated rifles. \n308 win is a small or short cartridge and heavy bullets are required by snipers for their better long range performance, the heavy bullets are also longer and bite into the case capacity which is already full of powder due to small case capacity; there fore most sniper rifles are  long throated and bullets seated according to each individual barrel only  will give optimum accuracy,\nHead Space \nIt is the distance from  that surface of the barrel or the chamber which prevents the cartridge case form moving further forward to the breach  fully closed and locked.\nThis is the most important dimension to ensure the safety of the shooter and integrity of the weapon.\nusually .002 to 006 is permissable to ensure smooth functioning and to cater for dirt and small variations possible in case to case. Any thing bigger than this will grow larger and larger on shooting ending into case failure and destruction of weapon and injury to shooter.\nThe head space points  for various case are as under;\nBelted Magnums on the Belt\nRimmed case on the rim\nPistol cases like 9mm and 45 on the mouth\n7.63  Tokarev on the shoulder\n7mm, 270, 30-06 on the shoulder\nI hope I have been able to be of some help', ''),

If less will put bullet forward in the throat, will require a high friction start thus excess pressure. I think even greater bullet depth will also exceed pressure, but can we provide lighter case mouth crimp to counter it?

(97748, ' @MIDREESTAj\nHead Space Consequences\nonce a rifle is fired the firing pin drives the case forward and then the the primer and powder are ignited, upon ignition the bullet begins to move forward and the pressure inside the case makes it expand and it sticks to the chamber walls with max pressure. This is known as Obturation.\nAs the bullet leaves the barrel the pressure begins to drop, and a another force known as Bolt Thrust comes into play, this is the reaction of the bullets action of departing the barrel, as the gas pressure drops a point is reached where the bolt thrust is stronger than the rapidly weakening force of obturation, at this point the case and the case head are hammered back onto the bolt face. If there is excessive Head Space the rear ward movement will accelerate to a point where it can shear off locking lugs and blow the rifle apart. By the way this will be the art work of only the remaining part of the gas pressure. Even when the lugs hold and the action does not fail a case separation can occur with a complete destruction of weapon and injury to the shooter.\nThat is why we hear the old adage never have oil in the chamber or fire an oily cartridge as it does not allow proper obturation.\nNow crimping. In a rifle the crimping has nothing to do with pressure as the rifle cartridge pressure is so high crimp or no crimp does not matter.\nMilitary cartridges and those for use in automatic weapons are crimped hard in a cannelure to make the round water proof and also to make it rigid for making it feed from belts and magazines in full auto weapons.\nHunting cartridges and specially precision rounds are never crimped as it ruins fine accuracy as the bullet is compressed and distorted. Also the case neck tension alone is fairly strong and water proof enough for non military applications. \nNow a request to you. While I admire your hunger for knowledge; please remember in the field of explosives and gunpowder there is only one mistake one can ever make.

What happens if the said place has a strict no weapons policy?[/quote]\n\nAns1. 90% times they fail to detect. For the rest I handover my weapon.\n\n[quote=Sonnenkind]\n2- In public places, especially during summers, when we don''t wear multiple layers of clothing, if your weapon is printing and people become aware of it, do they react to you? I especially mean in these days in Pakistan, where tragic street crime as well as terrorist incidents are so common that people are generally mistrustful of anyone they perceive as a threat.

The 9 mm only broke the brick on double shots.. while another brick on the same position was broken into pieces by a single shot of TT.

(97882, ' [b]Real meaning of peace[/b]\n\nThere once was a king who offered a prize to the artist who would paint the best picture of peace. Many artists tried. The king looked at all the pictures. But there were only two he really liked, and he had to choose between them. One picture was of a calm lake. The lake was a perfect mirror for peaceful towering mountains all around it. Overhead was a blue sky with fluffy white clouds. All who saw this picture thought that it was a perfect picture of peace.\n\nThe other picture had mountains, too. But these were rugged and bare. Above was an angry sky, from which rain fell and in which lightning played. Down the side of the mountain tumbled a foaming waterfall. This did not look peaceful at all. But when the king looked closely, he saw behind the waterfall a tiny bush growing in a crack in the rock. In the bush a mother bird had built her nest. There, in the midst of the rush of angry water, sat the mother bird on her nest - in perfect peace.\n\n[b]Which picture do you think won the prize? [/b]\n\nThe king chose the second picture. Do you know why? \n"Because," explained the king, "peace does not mean to be in a place where there is no noise, trouble, or hard work.\nPeace means to be in the midst of all those things and still be calm in your heart. That is the real meaning of peace."', ''),

(97925, ' @All\nThanks for your appreciative comments :)\n\n@Sqn Ldr Shariq.\nThanks for the comments Sir. Regarding inaccuracy of Norinco TT, I think with better sights and better trigger, it can be more accurate but not much. Local clones are mostly disappointing with regards to accuracy though some specially made ones are very good. I have noticed that nowadays, there is lot of emphasis on top quality finish in local weapons and not much attention is given to the internals. They have probably discovered that probably 90 % of buyers would buy a particular weapon after seeing the feel and finish. The finish of this clone was not far less than original Beretta I must say. But internals were quite ugly and crudely finished. \n\n@Omkhan\nSir, I wrote it in my comment that with a better trigger, Kanuni S can be more accurate, however, not much. And I dont think it would ever be able to compete Taurus PT99 which is entirely a different class. Kanuni S, in my view, is a reasonably good gun and that''s it. As for the sights, they are fixed and cannot be adjusted less by an expert gunsmith with proper gadgetry. So why to bother that much? Why not to a buy a gun which is accurate from the beginning. :) \n\n@Starfish\nThanks for your comments Sir. I think this thread should stay as an Handgun Accuracy thread because it focuses on only one aspect of a gun, though a vital one. When we are buying a gun however, there could be many other factors that one might like to consider which have not been included in this thread. :) \n\nregards', ''),

Our hosts (Ka_Khan and Ilyas) were most gracious and very hospitable. Thank you again.\n\nOn our first night in Peshawar they took us to a Chinese restaurant which had the largest variety of Chinese food I have ever seen in Pakistan, over 430 dishes ! I didn''t even realize they were that many in existence...\n\nThe next morning we got an early start and were invited to Sher Khan''s home for lunch and test firing their locally produced Glock and Beretta clones. Lunch was great and so was their hospitality unfortunately both the weapons were not what we were expecting. At dinner the next day in Isb Moeen asked me what I thought of the guns and I spent a moment trying to find the diplomatically correct word but his description of "Crap" fit the bill the best. \n\nAfter lunch and a shooting session we drove to Jamrood and Sitara Market. Except for auto weapons and antiques which I was not interested in, other firearms were overpriced by Lahore standards. Ammunition, knife''s, holster''s etc were reasonably priced. Point to note is that most holsters and knifes available there are Chinese copies of the originals.\n\nI''ll leave you guys with some more pictures.\n\n\n[b][img]http://i262.photobucket.com/albums/ii99/AbbasMalik/1-1.jpg[/img][/b]\n\n\n[b][img]http://i262.photobucket.com/albums/ii99/AbbasMalik/2-1.jpg[/img][/b]\n\n\n[b][img]http://i262.photobucket.com/albums/ii99/AbbasMalik/4-1.jpg[/img][/b]\n\n\n[b][img]http://i262.photobucket.com/albums/ii99/AbbasMalik/3-1.jpg[/img][/b]\n\n\n[b]Check out the smile on Taurus''s face, says it all !

(97982, ' [quote=Aquarius]@grin313 :bro, as Gilani sahib has mentioned it in some other thread as well, that the only difference in Yarygin Pya and Viking is the frame. Internals are the same and one can see the same huge size breach and other things. So theoretically speaking, yes. But practically speaking, 7N21 and 7N31 is strictly a military ammo and can not be sold to anyone except Russian Army. Similarly Yargin Pya can also not be sold to civilians. So even if one has a Viking, he will probably never be firing 7N21 with it   However, the owner of a Viking is assured that he can fire any kind of +p or +p+ ammo in his gun and not worry about anything.[/quote]\nAquarius bro thnx for the info. but i m somewat sceptical of its polymer. i do like its interiors and one cant avoid noticing its bulky breech. no doubt its barrel is made for some red hot ammo. but a HG is more of a harmonic pull between many parts. like a slide rail may seem insignificant. but it plays its role in absorbing the thrust. besides a good HG is one which experiences an equal amount of wear at all its points, thus its important for each part to be equally strong and durable. wid each bullet the gun looses its strenght and durability. the slide may loose its tightness over many thousand fires. the ejector claw wears away. so on so forth. \nthats wat seems to be missing in viking. its slide and barrel/breech are real tough but the frame doesnt seem to be compatible to go wid them. i may be totally wrong. only seniors can tell on this issue n i m looking forward to their comments. only time can test its real durability like many other russian babies.', ''),

Kahr''s corporate headquarters are located in Blauvelt, New York. Production and assembly operations are located in Worcester, Massachusetts, in the region commonly known as "Gun Valley."\nThe Kahr action is a Browning locked-breech design and has a striker-operated firing pin with a passive firing pin safety. It is a true hammerless action. When the trigger is pulled, the trigger bar begins to rotate the cocking cam. Having two lobes, the cocking cam simultaneously begins to draw the striker to the rear, compressing the spring behind it, while depressing and therefore deactivating the firing pin block. At the end of the trigger''s travel, the lobe contacting the striker slips off the striker and releases it, the other lobe has now completely depressed the firing pin block and permits the striker to travel forward and strike the primer. This single piece takes the place of more complicated and fragile designs employed in other pistols. It is similar in principle, though very different in execution, to the design on Glocks. It also allows the firing pin block to be located further to the rear of the slide and therefore further from possible contamination from combustion gases and fouling. For this innovation, Justin Moon was awarded one of the five patents he possesses on the Kahr pistol. This system is employed on all Kahr pistols regardless of frame material, size or caliber.\n[url=http://www.postimage.org/image.php?v=Tsru9kS][img]http://s2.postimage.org/ru9kS.jpg[/img][/url]\n\nYou will be surprised to know that Kahr pistols were used in these movies.\nKAHR K9\n"Baywatch"\n"Boston Public"\n"CSI"\n"Domestic Disturbance"\n"Double Take"\n"Face/Off"\n"Gigli"\n"The Invisible Man"\n"K-Pax"\n"Matchstick Men"\n"Nash Bridges"\n"NYPD Blue"\n"Profiler"\n"The Replacement Killers"\n"The Mexican"\n"US Marshals"', ''),

(98017, ' Just to Add a little more to the tipic:-\n\nTHE STOPPING POWER OF DIFFERENT HANDGUN CARTRIDGES\n\n\nGeneral Julian Hatcher, a noted forensic pathologist, in the early 1900’s developed a good formula to determine the theoretical stopping power of a firearm cartridge. His formula has withstood the test of time and validation from other studies and data related to stopping power.\n\n\nYou want a handgun cartridge that has a Hatcher value of over 50 for the most effective stopping power. Values over 55 have diminishing returns in that you don’t gain any significant increase in stopping power for the extra recoil and control you must cope with. Handgun cartridges that don’t make a value of at least 50, should not considered for self-defense. If the rating of your handgun cartridge is under 30, it only has about a 30% chance of producing a one shot stop. Hatcher Ratings of 30 to 49 raise a one shot stop to approximately a 50% chance. Ratings of 50 or higher produce a one shot stop about 90% of the time. \n\n\nHandgun Cartridge Type ..................... Hatcher Rating\n\n.45 ACP full metal jacket 230 grain .......... 49.1\n\n.45 ACP jacketed hollow point 230 grain ...... 60.7\n\n.44 Magnum full metal jacket 240 grain ....... 92.3\n\n*.44 Magnum lead wad cutter 240 grain ......... 136.8\n\n.44 Special full metal jacket 240 grain ...... 51.6\n\n*.44 Special lead wad cutter 240 grain ............. 76.5\n\n.41 Magnum full metal jacket 230 grain ............. 54\n\n*.41 Magnum lead wad cutter 230 grain .............. 80\n\n10 millimeter full metal jacket 180 grain .......... 50.3\n\n10 millimeter jacketed hollow point 180 grain ..62.1\n\n.40 S&W full metal jacket flat nose 180 grain ...... 53.4\n\n.40 S&W jacketed hollow point 180 grain ....... 59.4\n\n.38 Special full metal jacket 158 grain ...... 26.7\n\n*.38 Special lead wad cutter 158 grain ............. 39.7\n\n**.357 Magnum full metal jacket 158 grain ..... 32.7\n\n**.357 Magnum lead wad cutter 158 grain ............ 48.5\n\n.357 SIG full metal jacket 147 grain ................ 36.6\n\n.357 SIG jacketed hollow point 147 grain ..... 45.2\n\n9 millimeter full metal jacket 147 grain ............ 32.3\n\n9 millimeter jacketed hollow point 147 grain ... 39.9\n\n.380 Auto jacketed hollow point 95 grain ..... 18.3\n\n.32 Auto jacketed hollow point 71 grain ...... 11.1\n\n.25 Auto jacketed hollow point 50 grain ...... 3.7\n\n.22 Long Rifle jacketed hollow point 40 grain ... 4.2 \n\n\n* Jacketed hollow points will have the same rating as wad cutter bullets if the bullet hollow tip is greater than 1/2 of the caliber of the bullet.\n\n\n* .357 Magnum ratings are taken from a firearm with a 3 inch barrel.

(98018, ' Any functional handgun is better than no handgun at all. Some people talk about how good the 9 millimeter, .380 Auto, or .38 Special rounds are. If you have the choice of a better handgun for self protection, buy it. Be sure you have the heaviest grain bullet you can get. Make sure it is a functional hollow point in your handgun.\n\nAlso be sure to buy a quality handgun that will not jam on you in a situation where you need it.\n\nMost important is the need to train with your firearm of choice for self protection.

(98125, ' I would agree with TT33 an like to add a few points.\n\n1. Taurus pistols ar designed by non other than Berretta!! so one can safely say that their designs are sound and backed with a lot of experience. Their Berretta clones are ACTUALLY made in the same machinery that the Italians used for producing the famed 92 series of pistols. The Italians (Berretta) sold this machinary when the 92 series sales dropped(for many reasons) after they came up with other models like the PX storm.This does not mean that the machinery was faulty. They simply wanted to concentrate on marketting their newer models ( simple and basic marketting/manufacturing  business logic)this is common practice among many industries. Toyota did the same when we purchased the machinery to build the "Indus Model" while the Japenese went forward with the newer shaped models.\n\n2. Taurus pistols have recieved some bad rep becoz people say the slide cracks after firing a couple of 100 rounds. This is partially true as the incident has happened in the US as well as in Pakitan. \n\n3. The millinium models or the smallr frame pistols chambered for the .45 is definately always a challnge for the manufacturer. as i mentioned in another post that the .45 generates hell lot of pressure which is excrutiating for the small frame guns. that is why the metalurgy (the metal used and the treatmnt of the metal for increasing strength flexibility etc) must b vey very accurate to produce guns of small frames.\n\n4. Having said the above, any gun can malfunction as it is a machine, the TOP brands do alot of reseach to make their guns better and better to avoid such problems. EVEN THE FAMED BERRETTA 92 has had incidents of the slide cracking and even breaking and hitting the firer on the face!! A lot o Berrretta 92s wer recalled to fix this problem.\n\n5. NO, Taurus guns are not bad but obviosly cannot compete with SIG or Glock or SW. its like comparing a Honda Accord with a BMW (both are very good but one is excellent)\n\nregards, TYR...........', ''),

(you can check the prices on internet). What I mean to say is that difference in prices in Pakistan is not a correct criteria to judge the class / quality of a weapon.

And that is why I see so much of difference in Taurus PT92 / PT99 and other models. These two are world class pistols in my view and can be compared with any good quality handgun in 500 to 800 $ range (even the price of Taurus PT92 and Beretta 92FS is same outside Pakistan). \n\nI agree with brothers Sensei and Aquarius here that apart from PT92/99 and PT1911, other Taurus pistols and specially the striker fired Taurus models had mixed reviews.

(98155, ' Dear all;The steel used in steel ammo is actually very, very soft steel. Though it is not as soft as brass or aluminum, but almost always a lot softer than any weapon component it contacts. I have yet to see any genuine, documented extreme wear caused by this stuff as otherwise its manufacture would have been banned by Wolf and other manufacturers. The only Problem which if see, it is dirtier. One of the reasons is that when fired, the case pressure doesn''t cause the cartridge case to expand as much as brass or aluminum. Thus, there is a lot more powder blown back into the weapon, making it far dirtier than brass cases.\nBy the time any possible damage to your weapon would show-up, you probably would have saved enough in ammo costs to replace the damaged pistol, however in Pakistan this difference remains quite negligible so better stick to all time favorite BRASS.

Pictures are worth a thousand words so I''ll let them do the talking. \n\n\n[img]http://i262.photobucket.com/albums/ii99/AbbasMalik/Hptest1_resize.jpg[/img]\n\n[img]http://i262.photobucket.com/albums/ii99/AbbasMalik/Hptest2_resize.jpg[/img]\n\n[img]http://i262.photobucket.com/albums/ii99/AbbasMalik/Hptest3_resize.jpg[/img]\n\n[img]http://i262.photobucket.com/albums/ii99/AbbasMalik/Hptest4_resize.jpg[/img]\n\n[img]http://i262.photobucket.com/albums/ii99/AbbasMalik/Hptest5_resize.jpg[/img]\n\n[img]http://i262.photobucket.com/albums/ii99/AbbasMalik/Hptest6_resize.jpg[/img]\n\n[img]http://i262.photobucket.com/albums/ii99/AbbasMalik/Hptest7_resize.jpg[/img]\n\n\nThe good news is that in firing 125 + HP''s not one had a misfire or failure to feed. My method of testing was slow firing 5 rounds (5 in 10 seconds) to check for accuracy and then 10 in rapid fire mode (10 in 4 seconds) to check for reliability. All rounds in all three guns cycled flawlessly. \n\nThe results were a little surprising, the Armscor JHP''s worked best in my opinion. The kick and sound of these rounds were moderate (I quite liked it for easier reacquisition of target while rapid firing) and the expansion was the best and most consistent when compared to the Prvi offerings. Most of the 115 Grain Jhp''s failed to expand properly and were rather inadequate for the performance I was expecting. 124g seems to be the sweet spot for 9mm''s. \n\nThe Prvi 124g were a surprise as well as more than 50 % of the rounds fragmented upon impact in a shrapnel like fashion. Some failed to expand at all while in about 25 % of the cases expansion was what I was looking for. \n\nGiven the choice I would easily pick Armscor Jhp''s over the Prvi offerings.', ''),

And by sharing, I meant to be very provocative. \n\nSelection of a weapon like a handgun is a War of Mandatory Needs and Options. See.. after having seen gun buddies around you getting double minded and bogged down with less individual involvement in selection of handguns for themselves... I wanted and tried to stir it up. I believe a mind not gifted to discover truth but tenacious to hold it is better but even better a mind that discovers it and makes a choice out of all for itself. I tried to let you read my mind as when I was in process of acquiring a new handgun. I disclosed what I wanted VS. what was available. Tried to fit as many pictures as I could to cover all angles my eye got hold of. No doubt many angles are still there to be looked at by a gun enthusiast. Inshallah I will keep you guys posted on this pistol with its performance as soon as I get chances. No limit to that! \n\nDisclaimer: I hope every body has own requirements and preferences. Only that every individual needs to explore these just like I gave you my own example about how exactly ''I'' did it while you own yours. \n\n@Usama God knows how much of a leech I had to be to get a reasonable price.\n@Enigmatic Desires I didnt know you have same conclusions up your sleaves bro.

(98319, ' Great work Chief! \nEven though prvi failed to expand as much as the armscor rounds,I would not write them off. Hollow points always have a tradeoff between penetration and expansion. Looking at the armscor round and its deep and wide nose cavity, you can safely conclude that its towards the "expanding" side of the spectrum and would outperform prvi which has a much smaller cavity. On the other hand, I am sure prvi would outperform armscor if fired through car wind shields or doors etc. \nSo the final choice lies with the shooter and the situation one expects to use the rounds in making it very subjective. \nAt the same time, I can not discount for the inconsistent expansion of prvi rounds. What ever the expansion factor may be, it should be consistent nonetheless. \nSo I would agree with Abbas Bhai. Armscor is better at being hollow point than prvi. Prvi might shine in some situations but then again, you have FMJs for that :)', ''),

Only one child played on the disused track, the  rest on the operational track. \n\nThe train is coming, and you are just beside the track interchange. You can make the train change its course to the disused track and save most of the kids. However, that would also mean the lone child playing by the disused track would be sacrificed. Or would you rather let the train go its way?     \n\nLet''s take a pause to think what kind of decision we could make........ .......... \n\n\n\n\nScroll down \n\n. \n. \n. \n. \nScroll down \n\n. \n. \n. \n. \n\nScroll down further \n\n. \n. \n. \n. \n\n\nMost people might choose to divert the course of the train, and sacrifice only one child. You might think the same way, I guess. Exactly, to save most of the children at the expense of only one child was rational decision most people would make, morally and emotionally. But, have you ever thought that the child choosing to play on the disused track had in fact made the right decision to play at a safe place? \n\nNevertheless, he had to be sacrificed because of his ignorant friends who chose to play where the danger was.. This kind of dilemma happens around us everyday. In the office, community, in politics and especially in a democratic society, the minority is often sacrificed for the interest of the majority, no matter how foolish or ignorant the majority are, and how farsighted and knowledgeable the minority are. The child who chose not to play with the rest on the operational track was sidelined. And in the case he was sacrificed, no one would shed a tear for him. \n\nThe great critic Leo Velski Julian who told the story said he would not try to change the course of the train because he believed that the kids playing on the operational track should have known very well that track was still in use, and that they should have run away if they heard the train''s sirens.. If the train was diverted, that lone child would definitely die because he never thought the train could come over to that track! Moreover, that track was not in use probably because it was not safe. If the train was diverted to the track, we could put the lives of all passengers on board at stake! And in your attempt to save a few kids by sacrificing one child, you might end up sacrificing hundreds of people to save these few kids. \n\nWhile we are all aware that life is full of tough decisions that need to be   made, we may not realize that hasty decisions may not always be the right one.   \n\n''Remember that what''s right isn''t always popular... and what''s popular isn''t always right.''   \n\nEverybody makes mistakes; that''s why they put erasers on pencils.', ''),

(98399, ' grin313 brother. I am sorry for the late reply. Did not open this thread for sometime.\nI think Aquarius brother has amply explained the issues you wanted to discuss. Now as per Baikal website and literature, Viking is a civilian model of Yargin Pya and there is no difference between the two except of frame. From this and after seeing the extraordinarily strong construction of Viking in breach and barrels areas, we can assume that since Yargin Pya can fire 7N21/31 so Viking can also do the same. However, the description of Viking does not anywhere specifically mention that it is capable of firing 7N21. Probably the reason is that 7N21 is for the use of Russian Army only and can not be sold or exported in the civilian market. So we would probably never be able to know about the performance of Viking with 7N21 and we would always be firing normal 9mm ammo with our Vikings. For that purpose, I find Viking an absolutely reliable weapon which is capable of handling any hot load. \n\nAs for your fears about the life of polymer grips, though I have no scientific data available to me but on face of it, the frame of Viking looks strong. It has steel inserts at the right places where it engages with the slide. How will it perform after years of extensive use, I can not say. Only that person who owns Viking since last few years and has fired at least 3000 rounds with it can comment on this aspect with authenticity. \n\nGenerally speaking, Viking is a wonderful gun. Fires all types of ammo without any problem, has excellent trigger, very nice recoil and is quite accurate too. \n\nHope it helps. :) regards', ''),

(98423, ' Thats absolutely correct... PT92/99 is definitely the best model among the Taurus handguns & there is no doubt about it. Produced by the same machinery by which Beretta 92fs was produced for the Brazilian Military. Whenever the PT92 is discussed, the inevitable comparison to the current military M9/92fs come up. Which one is better..? Is the Beretta worth the extra money..? What is the difference in the two..?\nIn terms of fit and finish, Beretta wins. The brunitron finish is durable and in my opinion better looking than the blued Taurus. The Taurus''s Pt92/99 SS version is equal to Beretta 92fs Inox. A matter of personal preference about the manual safety situation. Some will prefer the frame mounted safety on the Taurus to the Beretta''s slide mounted decocking safety and I myself prefer the ones on the Taurus. The Beretta has a chrome lined barrel interior, which the Taurus does not (only for the blue version as the new SS versions have chromed barrels according to one of our senior members which is also a + point for Taurus) ... The trigger on the taurus is more curved and to me more comfortable than the Beretta. Is the beretta the better of the two...? Probably, but it may be that the Taurus is close enough in curtain things to make it a best buy for many. Personallly I prefer it to the Beretta 92fs.\nI will agree that the finish on the Beretta is made more refined, but when it comes to shooting rounds, reliability and accuracy, they seems neck to neck.\nI think much of the criticism comes from the other pistol product lines, that Taurus has produced......... :)', ''),

All legendary handguns like Colt 1911, Browning High Power, Luger, Walther P38, Beretta 92FS, SigP226, Sig P210, H&K P7, USP, TT-33, Makarov became legendary only after armies adopted them as their official sidearm.

Taurus has come a long way, specially with this 809 line. a wise choice indeed on your part. in my humble opinion, this particular model would definitely give other similarly priced guns a run for their money.\n\nHowever i''m confused over few things that u''ve mentioned. firstly, the trigger pull in SA and DA instead of a consistent single figure, is quoted by "a range of 2kg-4kg". meaning the trigger would be one hell of a tricky thing to master in this instance cause its not consistent and would require different levels of force in SA mode and similarly would require different level of force in DA mode as well. second dont you think that the trigger pull is on the higher side in both SA and DA. 2KG would be like 4.4lbs and 4KG would be 8.8lbs in SA. now with 6KG of 13.2lbs in DA, IMHO, it would require nothing short of a hydraulic press to operate such a trigger mechanism. there goes the double tapping idea out the window no matter how short the trigger reset is.\n\nsecond: the barrel length quoted by the company is 101.6mm or 4  inches whereas you said it 108mm. we are talking about pt809E right?\n\nthese are the few things that sorta concern me, otherwise no doubt, this probably is the best Taurus offering so far (IMHO) as long as they get the trigger issue solved.\n\nRegards.', ''),

I.e mixing two packs instead of one in the same amount of water.\n\n\nOur container held two liters of water and we mixed 10 packs of (80 g) into it. \n\n[img]http://i262.photobucket.com/albums/ii99/AbbasMalik/Jelly1_resize.jpg[/img]\n\n\nThe mix was slowly stirred over a light fire to ensure a proper mix.\n\n[img]http://i262.photobucket.com/albums/ii99/AbbasMalik/Jelly2_resize.jpg[/img]\n\n\nSkeeter Sahib checking for any unmixed concentrate.\n \n[img]http://i262.photobucket.com/albums/ii99/AbbasMalik/Jelly3_resize.jpg[/img]\n\n\nCooling off our Jelly as fast as possible.

[b]Personal preference is altogether a different thing and should not be brought in to consideration when commenting on the quality of a weapon.[/b] Comments concerning performance / quality of weapon can only be offered after one has fired that handgun and used it enough (not just 5 or 10 rounds), the gun has been exposed to field conditions and has been carried on person for sometime. \n\nJust for an example, personally I prefer the shape of 1911 over say the shape of Glock 17, however, when commenting on Glock 17''s performance I need to see that how accurate it was at the range, how did it respond to different ammos, how was the comfort or discomfort while carrying in holster, was the field stripping and cleaning convenient or problematic, is the gun rugged enough to take the abuse in the field etc etc. Now if Glock has performed well in these areas than I must finally comment that Glock is a good pistol, even if personally I dont like the shape of Glock 17. \n\nAnd similarly, if a 1911 from a particular manufacturer has not performed that well on the range, I must comment that these were the faults observed while testing this gun hence its not that good a pistol, even if I love the shape of a 1911. \n\nThat is why I was asking the respected members whether they have observed any flaws / problems with a 1911 in 9mm caliber when they fired it or it is just their personal preference which is not backed up by range experience. If it was the first case than I might reconsider buying a 1911 in 9mm, but if it is just their personal preference that it does not matter. \n\nregards', ''),

However, from 20 and 30 M, its a different story. Otherwise, I find it a very rugged and reliable pistol. Strongly manufactured and not even a single stoppage so far.

However, I have no experience on 1911 in 9mm caliber. Could someone share his experience as to why 1911 is not that good in 9 mm parabellum and what problems / defecencies  are generally observed.   \nthanks[/quote]\nGilani sahab, above and below mentioned comments on 1911 not being for 9mm are solely based on the .45acp concept which the gun was designed on. A Traditional design for launching 45acp. IMO, a combat handgun concept, launching 9mm from a low capacity magazine(where there is a plathora of better options available) and an all steel platform heavier than even a Beretta 92FS isn''t sounding that much efficient. If the Beretta wasnt designed around 9mm it could easily be the most over done and bulky pistol(where there is a plathora of better options available).\n\nHowever there is nothing wrong with 1911 in 9mm practically if you intend to shoot it. Logically the platform can even handle .357mag with a little beefed up lugs and bushings like we see a Coonan pistol based on 1911 design. More, it surely is going to give you a 3pound 1911 trigger and very low recoil given that Taurus has not gone out of specs. You will get a nice or even better gun you might appear in informal matches with.\nOn the other hand, ''Custom Job'' (Trigger, sights, magwells, recoil springs) option which really shines the 1911 platform dwindles over here in Pak.', ''),

Sir that is the most important question you asked which lately I''ve been asking my self just before the purchase believe me. OSS comes down in similarity with Springfield XD long slide(5" match barrel) and S&W M&P full size. Except for the Taurus ''Mega Lemon'' theory followed by the Big Bang theory(both are true however) it is one of the top latest handgun designs that fulfills the role of offensive deployment of handguns (just a term used to denote SOCOM specs). Numerous people have shot 10 to 15k rounds in practical matches and during range times with this pistol. They testify to its superb shooting traits and accuracy. However, I ''ve felt it is the same taurus pistols which are more to most of the times in hands of rookies especially who shoot it after shooting a SIG and claim it is not as accurate and the same person after a few range sessions can be heard loud about how accurate the pistol was after he got used to somewhat different trigger the 24/7 has. :) \nBro, one of my personally laid spec for sports shooting and informal target was 5" barrel. OSS has got one 5.25" Match Grade and I love it. The whole choice make over turned down when I evaluated the grip of this pistol. It did not suit the structure of my hand so well. Although it was better than most pistols I''ve held but the pointability was felt even better in 800 series grip. Now that is my hand which let me loose OSS but it is still on my wish list. I wish M&P had a reasonable price as along with OSS it is also on my wish list. Same wishful thinking for the Springfiled XD/m''s and the life goes on :)', ''),

(98697, ' ISLAMABAD – Investigations revealed on Thursday that the licence fee worth Rs 2 billion was never deposited to the account of Interior Ministry against issuance of the arms license between 2007-2009, which caused a huge loss to the national exchequer.\nIt is worth mentioned here that higher authorities of the Interior Ministry, on directives of the apex court, have formulated a ten-member committee to compile record of the arms licenses issued between 2007-2009.\nThe committee, during its preliminary investigations, found that the license fee worth Rs 2 billion against issuance of the large number of licences was never deposited to the Ministry’s account.\nAccording to top-level sources, higher authorities of the Interior Ministry has cancelled 914 licences after they were found bogus. It may be mentioned here that the committee has, so for, verified 1042 licenses and out of these it had found 914 as bogus.\nKeeping in view this percentage, one can guess that huge number of licences might be found bogus. Interestingly, 11 out of 914 bogus licences belong to a female Parliamentarian of a opposition party, sources said.\nAccording to a source privy to the latest development, the investigators have found during preliminary investigations that a large number of bank challan were found fake, as the arm licence fee was never deposited.\nThe sources further said four officials of the Interior Ministry were arrested on Thursday due to their alleged involvement in this scam. However, ‘TheNation’ could not get official version in these regards, as Spokesperson of the Ministry did attend the calls.\nAs the reports regarding cancellation of the arms licences has surfaced, a wave of fear and anger is likely to spread among many who might be deprived of their arms licences, if found illegal.\nIt is pertinent to note here that a list of another kind of beneficiaries was submitted to the National Assembly On January 25, 2010. It revealed that total 29,000 licenses of both prohibited and non-prohibited bore weapons were issued by the Interior Ministry since 2008 against rules and regulations.\nAs the list was made public last month, it exposed a large number of Parliamentarians and members of the Cabinet including the Interior Minister, who had issued 255 prohibited bore licenses to himself. The other members included Information Minister Qamar Zaman Kaira, who was granted over 130 arms licenses, Railway Minister Ghulam Billour 143 licenses, Minister of Power Raja Pervez Ashraf 69 licenses, Senator Rahat Hussain 85 licenses, MNA Rana Tanveer Hussain 59 licenses, MNA Malik Azmat 68 licenses, Tourism Minister Moulana Attaur Rehman 56 licenses, Defense Minister Choudhry Mukhtar 51 licenses, and scores of other ministers and Parliamentarians conveniently granted some 7200 prohibited bore licenses.\nAs the committee has taken up task to verify of the validity of licences issued from 2007 to 2009, a female MNA of opposition party is the first parliamentarian who was deprived of 11 licenses, as they were found bogus during initial investigations.\nThe sources told ‘TheNation’ on Thursday that the investigators were socked when they observed that 713 licenses of prohibited bore weapons were issued to four high and mighty individuals. However it was not confirmed officially as the Spokesperson of Interior Ministry did not attend the call till filing of this report. However, the sources did not disclose the names of those individuals. \n\n[url]http://www.nation.com.pk/pakistan-news-newspaper-daily-english-online/print/Regional/26-Mar-2010/Rs2b-fee-never-submitted-to-Ministrys-account[/url]', ''),

(98709, ' I got an honour to attend the yesterday''s experiment. If Abbas was experiment''s heart then Sir Skeeter were the brain. I saw at least five(5) inventions being made in as many minutes by sir Skeeter when the setup for the experiment was underway.\nI had few reservations about the safety measures taken at the sight. As following are almost a standard for such dangerous experiments:\n\n1- Jelly or any other subject is placed in a place fully covered(except one side) with sand bags or bullet proof glass so that bullet stays inside if it over panitrate or ricochet.\n2- Gun is clamped on a rest centered with the subject as there is very little margin of error(considering the small size of the subject). A little deviation in the angle and bullet will may exit from any side after very little panitration spoiling the whole effort.\n3- Shooter and the other participants stay behind a bullet proof glass or any other suitable shelter to avoid any accident.\n4- A certain density of the jelly is acheived by following strict rules, that precisely replicates the density of human body.\n\nIn our case sir Skeeter created a triple safety layer behind the jelly block to cover any over panitration. :) this was the part i was not so sure about.  For dead center hit we trusted on sir Skeeter''s experienced hands. We had a concrete bunker for the spectators and the jelly mix to replicate the human density was a home made recipe.\n\nAnyway, i have kept that bowl of jelly for cheking airgun pallets. :D as that bowl came from upper side of the testing block.', ''),

(98715, ' [quote=12gauge]However i''m confused over few things that u''ve mentioned. firstly, the trigger pull in SA and DA instead of a consistent single figure, is quoted by "a range of 2kg-4kg". meaning the trigger would be one hell of a tricky thing to master in this instance cause its not consistent and would require different levels of force in SA mode and similarly would require different level of force in DA mode as well. second dont you think that the trigger pull is on the higher side in both SA and DA. 2KG would be like 4.4lbs and 4KG would be 8.8lbs in SA. now with 6KG of 13.2lbs in DA, IMHO, it would require nothing short of a hydraulic press to operate such a trigger mechanism. there goes the double tapping idea out the window no matter how short the trigger reset is.\n\nsecond: the barrel length quoted by the company is 101.6mm or 4  inches whereas you said it 108mm. we are talking about pt809E right?\n[/quote]\n\nVery positive criticism 12gauge bro... \nTaurus website is notorious for giving out ambiguous figures in product specs. These figures tend to vary between the published data on Brazilian website and US website. \n[b](UPDATED from the provided manual)[/b]\nThey state pulls to be SA: (1.7 - 2.3)kg or (3.7 - 5)lb - DA: (3.5 - 4.8)kg or (7.7 - 10.5)lb . \nHowever it doesn''t mean that on a single specimen the DA/DA pull would vary shot by shot. It is rather very consistant and smooth pull with a very predictive and crisp let off.\nSo what this published data means? Well I myself am not sure about it, but it is just an assumption that what they mean is the trigger pull will finally smoothen out with time as it breaks in and the pull weight might come down. The barrel length as stated on US website is 4" which is an approx figure again I dont know why they put up approx figures. Manual says 4.2" or 107mm (Manual) which is exactly right as I checked it is slightly more than 4" on the scale.', ''),

(98723, ' @Denovo 87. You are right sir, it is a 303 with a detachable box magazine. I think I wrote about it some where in some post and Sir Skeetor60 also threw light on it. Anyways, there were five basic models made in this type of Lee Enfield 303 rifle called  Number 1-Mk 1, Number 2 - Mk 1, and so on till Number 5, Mk 1. This one is called Number 1 Mk 5, oftenly referred to as "Jungle Carbine" though this name was never officially adopted. It has a reduced length meant for the fighting in Far East, Jungles of Burma and Chindits (Militia fighting under allied patronage against Japanese in Eastern Theater rather in Burma) of Wingate (The allied commander of this Militia Force). It is a derivative of Number 4 with approximately 100mm shorter length and probably 1 Kg lighter than its predecessor. Came in production in 1944, had another version as well called Number 5 Mk 2. Similarly with some modifications each number probably also had some derivatives (I,m not sure hence will go no further on this issue). There was some reported problem with its accuracy as well which later proved incorrect, however, somehow the production of this model discontinued in 1947.\n\n    I have used it for Wild Boar Hunting and found it quite accurate but may be since I have scarcely used it beyond ranges of 200 so the comment may not be very accurate for longer ranges. My reasons for not commenting on its accuracy with authority are:-\na. I have frequently shot at around 100 or less than 100 yds/M so I have no experience with its accuracy over say 150-200.\nb. It is fairly high powered to down a wild boar hence I have never bothered to check the shot placement on the boar as wherever it hits, the boar is down (by this I do not mean that even on tail or skin it downs the boar :) )\nc. I do not do target shooting with this weapon as it is quite heavy on shoulder and kicks like a mule.\n\n[b]Gilani could be the right man to comment on its long range accuracy as he does a hell a lot of target shooting. I am sure he either has it or will have it very soon. It is matter of he reading this post [/b] :)\n\n\nMore can be read from these sites, particularly the last one about the history\n\n[url]http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jungle_Carbine[/url]\n\n[url]http://www.deactivated-guns.co.uk/live-firearms-and-shotguns/lee-enfield-no5-303-jungle-carbine/prod_177.html[/url]\n\n[url]http://www.diggerhistory.info/pages-weapons/303.htm[/url]\n\nHope that does the job Bro', ''),

I bought this scope for my intended .308 Rifle. The scope is one of the best available in the market for mid to long range shooting. Comes from a very well reputed company. It has a 30mm tube with a Trade Mark Gold Cirle towards the target end of Scope. Black finish, very clear seeing through and a duplex reticle which helps in range estimation. The rifle scope''s exceptional light management system, the Leupold Index Matched Lens System, provides maximum resolution and image brightness across the entire visual field. Light transmission is a remarkable 98% in this scope, and the fast focus eye piece allows for quick adjustments in the field. Other features include 1/4 MOA adjustments and finger adjustable turrets. Like every Leupold VX-III Rifle Scope this is also water, fog and shockproof. It is generally tested to very high standards for shock proofing. It has an eye relief of almost  five inches, which is very good for eye protection against the recoil injuries for heavier calibers.

[u][b]Laser Bore Sighter[/b]. [/u]This laser bore sighter is from Bushnell. As is evident from the name, it helps sighting the scope and saving some ammo for zeroing the rifle. Using the appropriate adopter, which is screwed in towards the thinner end of bore sighter, the bore sighter is fixed in from the barrel from muzzle side and laser is switched on. Thereafter, having sighted the laser dot through the scope, necessary corrections are made to bring the axis of barrel and axis of scope in sync with each other at pre-selected distance say 150 Meters. Thereafter you zero the rifle using the type and grain of ammo you intend using for the hunt. It helps in saving ammo and some times only first group confirms the zeroing.

(98823, ' [quote=khurramdool]Sorry Bros,\nI think my post is misunderstood, the intention of this thread is weather Taurus is over all a reliable brand to buy like Glock, Beretta, S&W coz here price tag difference is like heavens and earth, but in US market hardly any difference between prices of glock, taurus, bretta ect.[/quote]\nKhurram sahib, your query has two parts:\n\n1.  Comparison between Taurus and other famous brands like Glock, Beretta, S&W, CZ etc outside Pakistan where they all fall in more or less the same price bracket.  \n\n2.  Comparison between Taurus and other famous brands in Pakistan where the other brands cost 4 or 5 times the price of Taurus.\n\n[b]Outside Pakistan[/b], specially in US, Taurus loses in overall comparison, IMHO. The reason is simple and quite understandable; what Glock or CZ or Beretta offers in 500-650 $ price is far better than what Taurus offers in the same price range.  Would anyone like to buy a Taurus pistol instead of Glock 17/19/26/34 or CZ75 or Beretta PX 4 Storm / 92FS once he is paying the same price? May be as a third or fourth handgun, but not as a primary handgun. Taurus 1911 is a different case because in the price bracket of of 1911s, it is one of the cheapest yet offers good quality. In US, people have the advantage of customising 1911s so they can really turn their Taurus 1911 into a superb high class gun by just spending a couple of hundred dollars more. The overall price would still remain far less than other 1911s like Colt, STI, Kimber, S&W, Springfield, Sig Sauer etc. But for other handguns, they have far better options available in the same price range. \n\n[b]In Pakistan[/b], its a different issue. All brands that you have named cost 4 or 5 or even six times the price of Taurus pistols. So here in Pakistn, Taurus is generally a good buy. One may therefore conclude that though Glock 39 is far better but its not available in Pakistan and if available, is prohibitively expensive. So one may ultimately settle with Taurus PT145 which is a reasonably good pistol in an affordable price range. etc etc. \n\nOut of all the Taurus pistols, PT92/99 and PT1911 are perhaps a different class. Other Taurus pistols, specially striker fired ones, have had mixed reviews. [b]So in my view, as far as PT92/99 and PT1911 are concerned, they dont have a competitor in Pakistan in this price range. They simply win.[/b] So any one looking for an accurate large size gun, these two are the best options. As for other Taurus pistols, one may like to compare them with other brands/handguns like Baikal, CZ999, Turkish pistols, Chinese pistols etc and see if one is getting a sufficiently reliable, accurate and rugged pistol for the price that he is paying for? Personally speaking, I would avoid buying Taurus striker fired pistols. :)\n\nregards', ''),

(98959, ' To one of the questions above, the one regarding ammo in a car on a hot day, I found the following info useful. It is on a different thought, ie ammo in fire. But by cook-off temperatures in furnaces or when heat from a propane torch was applied directly to the primer, the temperatures recorded to set off the ammo indicate that it happens at temperatures that a hot car doesn''t attain. This is a post from thehighroad.org, pasting the best answer below and link to the original post.\n\n===============================================================\n\nIn his book "Gunshot Wounds" Vincent Di Maio describes various experiments where ammunition was heated in ovens. He says that .22 long rifle cartridges detonate at an average of 275F, .38 Special at 290F and 12 gauge shotgun shells at 387F. The interesting thing about these furnace experiments was that in all instances the cartridge cases ruptured, but the primers did not detonate. In fact the primers were removed from some of the ruptured cases, reloaded into other brass and fired.\n\nWhen cartridges are placed in a fire he confirms that the most dangerous component of a cartridge is the brass, or fragments thereof that may cause eye injury or penetrate skin, but certainly there is no evidence that a cartridge that is not in a firearm can cause a mortal wound, either by action of the bullet or the brass/primer fragments. It is important to remember however that a chambered cartridge that detonates in a fire is just as dangerous as a cartridge that is fired under normal circumstances in a firearm.\n\nTo get a better understanding of the behaviour of free-standing ammunition in a fire, he conducted experiments with a propane torch. A total of 202 cartridges (handgun, centerfire rifle and shotgun cartridges) were used. If the heat was applied directly to the base of a shotgun shell the primer would detonate, the powder would ignite and the shell would rupture. Any pellets that emerged were traveling too slowly to be recorded on a chronograph.\n\nIn rifle and handgun cartridges where the flame was applied to the base of the cartridge the primers always detonated but the powder only ignited in half the cases and in those instances the cases did not rupture but the gas was instead vented through the primer hole.\n\nWhen he heated these same handgun and rifle cartridges at the front, the powder would burn and the cases would usually rupture but with few exceptions the primers did not detonate. The velocity of expelled projectiles ranged from 58 ft/s to 123 ft/s. The only exception was the .270 cartridge where the bullet velocity was 230 ft/s. Primer velocities ranged from 180 ft/s to 830 ft/s.\n\nAs a side note he says that a revolver in a fire is especially dangerous because all the cartridges can cook off and be discharged such that there is a danger from projectiles. Only the bullet that came out of the barrel will have rifling marks and the ones that came from non-aligned chambers will have shear marks on them. Obviously if there is a question about the firing of a weapon and whether it was cooked off or fired intentionally they will look for a firing-pin impression on the primer of the suspect cartridge case.\n\nReferences:\n\nSciuchetti G.D.

(99133, ' [b]Can Science Explain Heaven?[/b]\nScientists try to explain near-death experiences.\n[url]http://www.newsweek.com/id/235462?GT1=43002[/url]\n\nI first encountered this idea as I was researching my new book, Heaven: Our Enduring Fascination With the Afterlife. I was having lunch with my friend and colleague Christopher Dickey, who told me that his father, the writer James Dickey, had a fantasy of heaven in which all of his closest friends were sitting around a swimming pool, chatting. "There was nothing special about the pool itself," wrote Chris in Summer of Deliverance: A Memoir of Father and Son. "Nobody walked on the water. And he never told me who the friends were ... But what he took away from the dream was a sense of contentment, of being at ease with himself and the world, as if he had gotten a preview of heaven. He called that place ''The Happy Swimming Pool.'' " Chris believes that everything we think we know about heaven happens in the moments before death. After that, there''s nothing.\n\nScience cannot definitively proof or disprove Chris''s theory, but some scientists are willing to take guesses. And these guesses are based, in part, on a growing body of research around near-death experience (NDE). According to a 2000 article in The Lancet, between 9 and 18 percent of people who have been demonstrably near death report having had such an experience. And surveys of NDE accounts show great similarities in the details. People who have had NDEs describe—like some religious visionaries—a tunnel, a light, a gate, or a door, a sense of being out of the body, meeting people they know or have heard about, finding themselves in the presence of God, and then returning, changed.\n\nAndrew Newberg is an associate professor in the radiology department at the University of Pennsylvania who has made his reputation studying the brain scans of religious people (nuns and monks) who have ecstatic experiences as they meditate. He believes the "tunnel" and "light" phenomena can be explained easily. As your eyesight fades, you lose the peripheral areas first, he hypothesizes. "That''s why you''d have a tunnel sensation." If you see a bright light, that could be the central part of the visual system shutting down last.\n\nNewberg puts forward the following scenario, which, he emphasizes, is guesswork. When people die, two parts of the brain, which usually work in opposition to each other, act cooperatively. The sympathetic nervous system—a web of nerves and neurons running through the spinal cord and spread to virtually every organ in the body—is responsible for arousal and excitement. It gets you ready for action. The parasympathetic system—with which the sympathetic system is entwined—calms you down and rejuvenates you. In life, the turning on of one system prompts the shutting down of the other. The sympathetic nervous system kicks in when a car cuts you off on the highway; the parasympathetic system is in charge as you''re falling asleep. But in the brains of people reporting mystical experiences—and, perhaps, in death—both systems are fully "on," giving a person the sensation both of slowing down, being "out of body," and of seeing things vividly, including memories of important people and past events. Does Newberg believe, then, that visions of heaven are merely chemical-neurological events? He laughs nervously. "I don''t know." He laughs again. "It''s, um … I don''t think we have enough evidence to say."\n\nSince at least the 1980s, scientists have theorized that NDEs occur as a kind of physiological self-defense mechanism. In order to guard against damage during trauma, the brain releases protective chemicals that also happen to trigger intense hallucinations. This theory gained traction after scientists realized that virtually all the features of an NDE—a sense of moving through a tunnel, and "out of body" feeling, spiritual awe, visual hallucinations, and intense memories—can be reproduced with a stiff dose of ketamine, a horse tranquilizer frequently used as a party drug. In 2000, a psychiatrist named Karl Jansen wrote a book, Ketamine: Dreams and Realities, in which he interviewed a number of recreational users. One of them, who called himself K.U., describes one of his drug trips this way: "I came out into a golden Light. I rose into the Light and found myself having an unspoken interchange with the Light, which I believed to be God." Dante said it better, but the vision is astonishingly the same.\n\nAdapted from the forthcoming book Heaven: Our Enduring Fascination With the Afterlifeby Lisa Miller.

Lol I am so used to seeing HJ shooting nothing but bulls that when I saw this target in person at the range my first comment was why are these two shots outside ? :D\n\nI went to the range yesterday and today as well and am happy to report that shooting is going well, there are some days when you feel that you can shoot the wings of a fly (Wanted style) and others when you can''t hit anything but the ground :) \n\nMy personal best before was 194/200. Yesterday I managed to cross it and score a 195/200, today I did it again. Here are both targets (yesterday''s and today''s) along with a summary of today''s shooting. Distance was ofcouse 25 M, firearm was the Ruger Mark 3 and the ammo was Eley Club. \n\n[img]http://i262.photobucket.com/albums/ii99/AbbasMalik/195A_resize.jpg[/img]\n\n\n[img]http://i262.photobucket.com/albums/ii99/AbbasMalik/195B_resize.jpg[/img]\n\n\n[img]http://i262.photobucket.com/albums/ii99/AbbasMalik/Scores_resize.jpg[/img]\n\n\nAlthough still have a long way to go, I feel I have corrected most things about my shooting, the errors mostly come in three things which result in 9''s or 8''s.\n\na).

They had a performa with multiple queries … e.g \nWhen did you applied for the license?\nWhen did you visit Islamabad ( M.O.I) dates and any proof of visit?\nDid you applied on your own or through any agent?\nDid you submit license fee yourself, have any proof or copy of bank challan?\nThe person concerned you meet at the M.O.I?\n\nObviously many of us got their licenses made through agents, so told them that I never visited M.O.I nor have any proof of fee duely submited in the bank. They told me that only those who fill this performa will likely have a chance of re-issuance of their liceses after completing all legal formalities and strongly adviced me to surrender my licences at the area Police station.So the bottom line is:\n[u]I advice all the members to carefully check the list published in daily Nawai-Waqat (26-03-10).[/u]\n[u]If found your licences mentioned in it, obtain performa from F.I.A office and surrender licences at concerend P.station.[/u]\n[u]For those who are applying for new one should ask their agent to provide you with the copy of bank  challan deposited on your behalf.[/u]\nRegards.

The philipine rounds i was getting for 180 each, but since i have never used them i avoided them. Will appreciate a comment on philipine rounds if anyone has used them. I dont have the PNS karsaz shooting range membership yet but planning to apply once they reopen the memberships, but i dont think they would allow me to fire a .45 over there, will have to ask, however i took it to a friends factory and tested it over there. They have a huge old school generator, which covers the sound, having fired .32s and 9mms all my life, i am not quiet used to a .45, i find the recoil a bit too much for me and right now i find it hard to come back to the target instantly. However initially i fired 60 rounds, 30 of each brand, no misfires. I havent tried quick firing it, again because of my own delay of comming back to the target. however since i did not have proper targets, i hung a normal corolla tyre in front of a barrell, and fired at 15 mtrs. managed to get all the round on the barrell within the tyre, will post pic of that soon. Other than that, the gun has a good grip, but once loaded it is quiet heavy, i guess its because of the big babies. The trigger is very smooth. Disassembling it is quiet complicated, but at one time or another, i guess we all found the simplest of the guns very complicated. Anyways I am happy with my purchase.

The unprincipled high ups are again protecting their unlawful possessions (PB licenses/weapons) by unblushingly sacrificing the law abiding citizens.

(99432, ' The US army in 80''s considered converting 1911 side arms to 9 mm briefly before opting for 92f.\n\nFrom  the accounts of those who have used them, slide whose mass and weight was geared to the powerful .45 round, the 1911 only works with 9x19 amino with a very light recoil spring. That makes it much easier for older shooters, or those with small hands or slender wrists, to operate its slide. Being a distinctly heavier pistol than, say, a Browning Hi-Power, the 1911 transmits only a gentle bump to the shooter when it spits a 9mm Parabellum round. Describing the recoil of a centerfire pistol with the phrase "It kicks like a .22" is one of the most tired and overused comments in gun-writing, but in this case, it comes awfully close to the sensation of firing a 1911 with a standard pressure 9mm load.\n\nAlso the price benefit of ammo price in Pakistan cannot be overlooked either.\n\nAlso other gun companies have had 9mm in 1911 for a while.', ''),

(99824, ' [b]Stopping power[/b]\n[url]http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stopping_power[/url]\n\nStopping power is a colloquial term used to describe the ability of a firearm or other weapon to cause a penetrating ballistic injury to a target human or animal, sufficient to incapacitate the target where it stands.\n\nThe term is not a euphemism for lethality. It refers only to a weapon''s ability to incapacitate quickly, regardless of whether death ultimately ensues. Some theories of stopping power involve concepts such as "energy transfer" and "hydrostatic shock", although there is disagreement regarding the importance of these effects.\n\nStopping power is related to the physical properties of the bullet and the effects it has on its target, but the issue is complicated and not easily studied. Critics contend that the importance of "one-shot stop" statistics is overstated, pointing out that most gun encounters do not involve a "shoot once and see how the target reacts" situation.\n\nStopping is usually caused not by the force of the bullet (especially in the case of handgun and rifle bullets), but by the damaging effects of the bullet which are typically a loss of blood, and with it, blood pressure. More immediate effects can result when a bullet damages parts of the central nervous system, such as the spine or brain. In response to addressing stopping power issues, the Mozambique Drill was developed to maximize the likelihood of an attacker''s quick incapacitation.\n\nA manstopper is a generic term used to describe almost any combination of firearm and ammunition that can reliably be expected to incapacitate, or "stop" a human target immediately. For example, the .45 ACP pistol round and the .357 Magnum revolver round have a firm reputation as "manstoppers". Historically, one type of ammunition has had the specific tradename "Manstopper". Officially known as the Mk III cartridge, these were made to suit the British Webley .455 service revolver in the early 20th century. The ammunition used a 220 grain cylindrical bullet with hemispherical depressions at both ends. The front acted as a hollow point deforming on impact while the base opened to seal the round in the barrel. It was introduced in 1898 for use against "savages,"[citation needed] but fell quickly from favour due to concerns of breaching the Hague Convention''s international laws on military ammunition, and was replaced in 1900 by re-issued Mk II pointed-bullet ammunition.\n\nSome sporting arms are also referred to as "stoppers" or "stopping rifles". These powerful arms are often used by game hunters (or their guides) for stopping a suddenly-charging creature, like a buffalo or an elephant.\n\n[b]History[/b]\nThe concept of "stopping power" appeared in the late 19th Century when colonial troops (American in the Philippines, British in New Zealand) engaging in close action with native tribesmen found that their pistols were not able to stop charging warriors. This led to larger caliber weapons (such as the .45 ACP) being developed to stop opponents with a single round. \n\n[b]Dynamics of bullets[/b]\nA bullet will destroy or damage any tissues which it penetrates, creating a wound channel. It will also cause nearby tissue to stretch and expand as it passes through tissue. These two effects are typically referred to as permanent cavitation (the hole left by the bullet) and temporary cavitation (the tissue displaced as the bullet passed).\n\nThe degree to which permanent and temporary cavitation occur is dependent on the mass, diameter, material, design and velocity of the bullet. This is because bullets crush tissue, and do not cut it. A bullet constructed with a half diameter ogive designed meplat and hard, solid copper alloy material will crush only the tissue directly in front of the bullet. This type of bullet (monolithic-solid rifle bullet) is conducive to cause more temporary cavitation as the tissue flows around the bullet, causing a deep and narrow wound channel. A bullet constructed with a two diameter, hollow point ogive designed meplat and low antimony lead core with a thin gilding metal jacket material will crush tissue in front and to the sides as the bullet expands. Due to the energy expended in bullet expansion, velocity is lost more quickly. This type of bullet (hollow-point hand gun bullet) is conducive to causing more permanent cavitation as the tissue is crushed and accelerated into other tissues by the bullet, causing a shorter and more voluminous wound channel.\n\nBullets are constructed to behave in different ways, depending on the intended target. Different bullets are constructed variously to: not expand upon impact, expand upon impact at high velocity, expand upon impact, expand across a broad range of velocities, expand upon impact at low velocity, tumble upon impact, fragment upon impact, or disintegrate upon impact.\n\nTo control the expansion of a bullet, meplat design and materials are engineered. The meplat designs are: flat; round to pointed depending on the ogive; hollow pointed which can be large in diameter and shallow or narrow in diameter and deep and truncated which is a long narrow punched hole in the end of a monolithic-solid type bullet. The materials used to make bullets are: pure lead; alloyed lead for hardness; gilding metal jacket which is a copper alloy of nickel and zinc to promote higher velocities; pure copper; copper alloy of bronze and tungsten steel alloy inserts to promote weight.\n\nSome bullets are constructed by bonding the lead core to the jacket to promote higher weight retention upon impact, causing a larger and deeper wound channel. Some bullets have a web in the center of the bullet to limit the expansion of the bullet while promoting penetration. Some bullets have dual cores to promote penetration.\n\nBullets that might be considered to have stopping power for dangerous large game animals are usually 11.63 mm (.458 caliber) and larger, including 12-gauge shotgun slugs. These bullets are monolithic-solids; full metal jacketed and tungsten steel insert. They are constructed to hold up during close range, high velocity impacts. These bullets are expected to impact and penetrate, and transfer energy to the surrounding tissues and vital organs through the entire length of a game animal’s body if need be.\n\nBullets with sufficient stopping power for humans are generally large caliber, 9.07 mm (.357 caliber) handgun bullets of hollow point design. Pre-fragmented bullets such as Glaser Safety Slugs and Magsafe ammunition are designed to fragment into birdshot on impact with the target. This fragmentation is intended to create more trauma to the target, and also to reduce collateral damage caused from ricocheting or overpenetrating of the target and the surrounding environments such as walls.\n\n[b]Physical effects[/b]\nPermanent and temporary cavitation cause very different biological effects. The effects of a permanent cavity are fairly obvious. A hole through the heart will cause loss of pumping efficiency, loss of blood, and eventual cardiac arrest. A hole through the brain can cause instant unconsciousness and will likely kill the recipient. A hole through an arm or leg which hits only muscle, however, will cause a great deal of pain but is unlikely to be fatal, unless one of the large blood vessels (femoral or brachial arteries, for example) is also severed in the process.\n\nThe effects of temporary cavitation are less well understood, due to a lack of a test material identical to living tissue. Studies on the effects of bullets typically are based on experiments using ballistic gelatin, in which temporary cavitation causes radial tears where the gelatin was stretched. Although such tears are visually engaging, some animal tissues (other than bone or liver) are more elastic than gelatin[citation needed]. In most cases, temporary cavitation is unlikely to cause anything more than a bruise. Some speculation states that nerve bundles can be damaged by temporary cavitation, creating a stun effect, but this has not been confirmed.\n\nOne exception to this is when a very powerful temporary cavity intersects with the spine. In this case, the resulting blunt trauma can slam the vertebrae together hard enough to either sever the spinal cord, or damage it enough to knock out, stun, or paralyze the target. For instance, in the shootout between eight FBI agents and two bank robbers on April 11, 1986 in Miami, Florida, (see FBI Miami shootout, 1986) Special Agent Gordon McNeill was struck in the neck by a high-velocity .223 bullet fired by Michael Platt. While the bullet did not directly contact the spine, and the wound incurred was not ultimately fatal, the temporary cavitation was sufficient to render SA McNeill paralyzed for several hours.\n\nTemporary cavitation can also cause the tearing of tissues if a very large amount of force is involved. The tensile strength of muscle ranges roughly from 1 to 4 MPa (145 to 580 lbf/in²), and minimal damage will result if the pressure exerted by the temporary cavitation is below this. Gelatin and other less elastic media have much lower tensile strengths, thus they exhibit more damage after being struck with the same amount of force. At typical handgun velocities, bullets will create temporary cavities with much less than 1 MPa of pressure, and thus are incapable of causing damage to elastic tissues which they do not directly contact.\n\nCore-locked rifle bullets that strike a major bone (such as a femur) can expend their entire energy into the surrounding tissue, causing it to take on a gelled consistency as the cellular structure is destroyed. The struck bone is commonly shattered at the point of impact.\n\nHigh velocity fragmentation can also increase the effect of temporary cavitation. The fragments sheared from the bullet cause many small permanent cavities around the main entry point. The main mass of the bullet can then cause a truly massive amount of tearing as the perforated tissue is stretched.\n\nWhether a person or animal will be incapacitated (i.e. ''stopped'') when shot depends on a large number of factors including physical, physiological, and psychological effects.\n\n[b]Neurological effects[/b]\nThe only way to immediately incapacitate a person or animal is to damage or disrupt their central nervous system (CNS) to the point of paralysis, unconsciousness, or death. Bullets can achieve this directly or indirectly. If a bullet causes sufficient damage to the brain or spinal cord, immediate loss of consciousness or paralysis, respectively, can result. However, these targets are relatively small and mobile, making them extremely difficult to hit even under optimal circumstances.\n\nBullets can indirectly disrupt the CNS by damaging the cardiovascular system so that it can no longer provide enough oxygen to the brain to sustain consciousness. This can be the result of bleeding from a perforation of a large blood vessel or blood-bearing organ, or the result of damage to the lungs or airway. If blood flow is completely cut off from the brain, a human still has enough oxygenated blood in their brain for 10–15 seconds of willful action[1], though with rapidly decreasing effectiveness as the victim begins to lose consciousness.\n\nUnless a bullet directly damages or disrupts the central nervous system, a person or animal will not be instantly and completely incapacitated by physiological damage. However, bullets can cause other disabling injuries that prevent specific actions (a person shot in the femur cannot walk) and the physiological pain response from severe injuries will temporarily disable most individuals.\n\nSeveral scientific papers reveal ballistic pressure wave effects on wounding and incapacitation, including central nervous system injuries from hits to the thorax and extremeties.[2][3][4][5] These papers document remote wounding effects for both rifle and pistol levels of energy transfer.\n\nRecent work by Courtney and Courtney provides compelling support for the role of a ballistic pressure wave in creating remote neural effects leading to incapacitation and injury.[6][7]This work builds upon the earlier works of Suneson et al. where the researchers implanted high-speed pressure transducers into the brain of pigs and demonstrated that a significant pressure wave reaches the brain of pigs shot in the thigh.[2] These scientists observed neural damage in the brain caused by the distant effects of the ballistic pressure wave originating in the thigh. The results of Suneson et al. were confirmed and expanded upon by a later experiment in dogs[4] which "confirmed that distant effect exists in the central nervous system after a high-energy missile impact to an extremity. A high-frequency oscillating pressure wave with large amplitude and short duration was found in the brain after the extremity impact of a high-energy missile . . ." Wang et al. observed significant damage in both the hypothalamus and hippocampus regions of the brain due to remote effects of the ballistic pressure wave\n\n[b]Psychological effects[/b]\nEmotional shock, terror, or surprise can cause a person to faint, surrender, or flee when shot or shot at. Emotional fainting is the likely reason for most "one-shot stops", and not an intrinsic effectiveness quality of any firearm or bullet; there are many documented instances[citation needed] where suspects have instantly dropped unconscious when the bullet only hit an extremity, or even completely missed. Additionally, the muzzle blast and flash from many firearms are substantial and can cause disorientation, dazzling, and stunning effects. Flashbangs (stun grenades) and other less-lethal "distraction devices" rely exclusively on these effects.\n\nPain is another psychological factor, and can be enough to dissuade a person from continuing their actions.\n\nTemporary cavitation can emphasize the impact of a bullet, since the resulting tissue compression is identical to simple blunt force trauma. It''s easier for someone to feel when they have been shot if there is considerable temporary cavitation, and this can contribute to either psychological factor of incapacitation.\n\nHowever, if a person is sufficiently enraged, determined, or intoxicated they can simply shrug off the psychological effects of being shot. Therefore, such effects are not as reliable as physiological effects at stopping people. Animals will not faint or surrender if injured, though they may become frightened by the loud noise and pain of being shot, so psychological mechanisms are generally less effective against non-humans.\n\n[b]Industry penetration requirements[/b]\n\nAccording to Dr. Martin Fackler and the International Wound Ballistics Association (IWBA), between 12.5 and 14 inches (318 and 356 mm) of penetration in calibrated tissue simulant is optimal performance for a bullet which is meant to be used defensively, against a human adversary. They also believe that penetration is one of the most important factors when choosing a bullet (and that the number one factor is shot placement). If the bullet penetrates less than their guidelines, it is inadequate, and if it penetrates more, it is still satisfactory though not optimal. The FBI''s penetration requirement is very similar at 12 to 18 inches (305 to 457 mm).\n\nA penetration depth of 12.5 to 14 inches (318 and 356 mm) may seem excessive, but a bullet sheds velocity — and crushes a narrower hole — as it penetrates deeper, while losing velocity, so the bullet might be crushing a very small amount of tissue (simulating an "ice pick" injury) during its last two or three inches of travel, giving only between 9.5 and 12 inches of effective wide-area penetration. Also, skin is elastic and tough enough to cause a bullet to be retained in the body, even if the bullet had a relatively high velocity when it hit the skin. About 250 ft/s (76 m/s) velocity is required for an expanded hollow point bullet to puncture skin 50% of the time.\n\nThe IWBA''s and FBI''s penetration guidelines are to ensure that the bullet can reach a vital structure from most angles, while retaining enough velocity to generate a large diameter hole through tissue. An extreme example where penetration would be important is if the bullet first had to enter and then exit an outstretched arm before impacting the torso. A bullet with low penetration might embed itself in the arm whereas a higher penetrating bullet would penetrate the arm then enter the thorax where it would have a chance of hitting a vital organ.\n\n[b]Overpenetration[/b]\n\nOverpenetration is often emphasized by those that prefer shallow-penetrating "rapid energy transfer" bullets. Tests have shown that human skin, on the entry side, can resist penetration as much as 2" (5 cm) of muscle, and skin on the exit side can be the equivalent of up to 4 in (10 cm)[citation needed]. A bullet would need to penetrate greater than approximately 15 inches (38 cm) of tissue simulant to have a chance to completely perforate a 9" (23 cm) thick torso, and would need to penetrate more than 17 inches (43 cm) to actually pose a serious threat to people downrange.\n\nEven if the bullet does completely penetrate a person, it will have a very reduced velocity and probably will no longer be ballistically stable. Missing the intended target altogether, hence leaving a full velocity bullet to harm whatever is in its path, is a much greater threat.\n\nA hit on a less dense peripheral body area, such as a limb, does present a more serious risk of overpenetration however. Penetration of walls and other cover is also a consideration for police and urban use.\n\nAccording to NYPD SOP-9 (Standard Operating Procedure #9) data, in the year 2000, only 9% of shots fired by officers engaged in gunfights actually hit perpetrators at which they were fired[citation needed]. In the same year, there were a total of 129 "shooting incidents" (including non-gunfights, such as officers firing at aggressive dogs, unarmed or fleeing perpetrators, etc.), 471 total shots fired by officers, 367 shots fired at perpetrators, and 58 total hits on perpetrators by police. So, when non-gunfight shooting data is added, the rate at which police hit what they aim at in real life situations is typically only 15.8%. By either measure, the vast majority of bullets were not stopped by hitting perpetrators, but ultimately encountered some other object. The propensity of these "stray" bullets to pass through windows, walls, car doors, etc. and possibly injure bystanders is a concern, and falls into the overall risk/benefit calculation when considering how much penetration is enough[citation needed].\n\nA study carried out by the FBI found that the .223 Remington (.223 cal) from a rifle had a smaller chance of overpenetration than the 9 mm Luger (.354 cal) handgun round.[8]\n\n[b]Energy transfer[/b]\nThe energy transfer hypothesis states that the more energy that is transferred to the target, the greater the destructive potential.\n\nIn ballistics, energy is a function of mass and the square of velocity. Generally speaking, it is the intention of the shooter to deliver an adequate amount of energy to the target via the projectile/s. Projectiles such as rifle bullets, high velocity handgun bullets and shotgun slugs can over-penetrate. Projectiles such as handgun bullets and shot can under-penetrate. Projectiles that reach the target with too low a velocity or bird shot may not penetrate at all. All the above conditions affect energy transfer.\n\nOver-penetration is detrimental to stopping power in regards to energy. This is because a bullet that passes through the target does not transfer all of its energy to the target. Despite decreased tissue damage due to loss of transferred energy on an over-penetrating shot, the resulting exit wound would cause increased blood loss and therefore a decrease in blood pressure in the victim. This effect on both persons and game animals is likely to be incapacitating over the length of the entire shooting event.\n\nUnder-penetration is also detrimental to stopping power. Projectile/s that do not transfer enough energy to the target may fail to create a fatal wound cavity. Also vital organs may not be reached, thereby limiting the amount of tissue damage, blood loss, and/or loss of blood pressure.\n\nNon-penetration of projectile/s may only deliver enough energy to create bruising, punctures and or blunt force trauma. All of which may result in internal injury solely through the force of the impact but not stop the target.\n\nAs mentioned above, there are many factors that affect "stopping power." Within this theory energy transfer is related to destructive potential; however, the importance of energy transfer in determining the stopping power of projectiles (when compared to other factors like location of the wound and wound cavity size) is a controversial topic.\n\nThe force exerted by a projectile upon tissue is equal to the bullet''s local rate of kinetic energy loss, with distance dEk / dx (the first derivative of the bullets kinetic energy with respect to position). The ballistic pressure wave is proportional to this retarding force (Courtney and Courtney), and this retarding force is also the origin of both temporary cavitation and prompt damage (CE Peters).\n\nThis ‘energy transfer” theory is frequently referred to by Kennedy assassination theories. These theorists cite the Zapruder film, as evidence that that shot that killed President John F. Kennedy must have been fired from in front of the limousine rather than from behind; which the Zapruder film shows Kennedy''s head recoiling backwards from a shot. Lee Harvey Oswald was claimed to have fired from the Texas School Book Depository, and thus The Zapruder film appears to imply a second assassin as inferred by Kennedy assassination theorists.\n\nThe theory of energy transfer can be observed in other theories.\n\nKinetic energy transfer is merely part of the means by which to damage the central nervous system or create a wound of sufficient surface area to cause enough blood loss that will result in rapid incapacitation. The idea that greater kenetic energy transfer will necessarily correspond with more rapid incapacitation is fallacious as evidenced by the use of "bean bag" shotgun rounds which cause much greater energy transfer to the targets they hit than more lethal, lower energy projectiles such as a bullet from a .22LR cartridge. Furthermore, every shot that is fired from a firearm that isn''t touching anything except the shooter and the atmosphere will transfer at least as much energy to the shooter as the target. (Newton''s Third Law of motion) Obviously, the shooter is not usually incapacitated from the shot they fire.\n\n[b]Hydrostatic shock[/b]\n\nHydrostatic shock is a theory of terminal ballistics that wounding effects are created by a shock wave in the tissues of the target. Evidence of such shock can be seen in ultra-high-speed images of supersonic bullets passing through various objects such as fruit; the fruit explodes due to the shock waves caused by the bullet passing through at high speed. Damage to the brain from hydrostatic shock from a shot to the chest occurs in humans with most rifle cartridges and some higher-velocity handgun cartridges\n\n[b]Knockback[/b]\n\nThe idea of "knockback" is a subset or simplification of energy transfer theory, and states that a bullet of sufficient caliber at sufficient speed which transfers all its energy to a subject has enough force, by sheer momentum of the bullet, to stop forward momentum of an attacker and knock them backwards or downwards. The idea was first widely expounded in ballistics discussions during American involvement in Philippine insurrections and, simultaneously, in British involvement in the Caribbean, when front-line reports stated that the .38 caliber revolvers carried by U.S. and British soldiers were incapable of bringing down a charging warrior. Thus, in the early 1900s, the U.S. adopted the .45ACP cartridge in what was to become the M1911A1 pistol and the British adopted the .455 Webley caliber cartridge in the Webley Revolver. The larger cartridges were chosen largely due to the Big Hole Theory (a larger hole does more damage), but the common interpretation was that these were changes from a light, deeply-penetrating bullet to a larger, heavier "manstopper" bullet.\n\nThough popularized in television and movies, and commonly referred to as "true stopping power" by novice or uneducated proponents of large powerful calibers such as .44 Magnum, the effect of knockback from a handgun and indeed most personal weapons is largely a myth. The momentum of the so-called "manstopper" .45 ACP bullet is approximately that of a 1 pound (0.45 kg) mass dropped from a height of 11.4 feet (3.5 m).[10][note 1] Such a force is simply incapable of arresting a running target''s forward momentum. In addition, bullets are designed to penetrate instead of strike a blunt force blow, because, in penetrating, more severe tissue damage is done. A bullet with sufficient energy to knock down an assailant, such as a high-speed rifle bullet, would be more likely to instead pass straight through, while not transferring the full energy (in fact only a very small percentage of the full energy) of the bullet to the victim.\n\nThe "knockback" effect is however commonly "seen" in real-life shootings, and can be explained by physiological and psychological means. Humans encountering a physical hit, be it a punch or a bullet, are conditioned to absorb the blow by moving in the same direction as the force. The physical effect against a non-penetrating weapon is to reduce the force felt by the blow, and in addition, retreating from an attack increases the distance such an attack must cover, which in the case of non-projectile weapons such as fists or a knife, places the target out of range of further attack. In addition, there is a theoretical sociological explanation, that in modern civilization, with far greater separation by most individuals from violence, hunting, and combat, normal individuals may simply recoil, buckle, or fall backward when hit by a bullet, even when in pure physiological terms they are perfectly capable of continuing to charge.\n\nAlthough knockback is not possible with a handgun bullet, it can be an actual effect occurring in reaction to being hit by a massive slug, such as a rubber bullet or sandbag fired from a shotgun. The dynamics of a slug round are quite different than penetrating bullets; the projectile is here designed not to penetrate but instead to strike a hard, blunt force blow, and as the power of a shotgun cartridge is greater than practically any production handgun cartridge, the force imparted is comparable to a hard punch and is capable, by physics, of affecting a person''s forward motion. In any case, due to conservation of momentum, the gun''s recoil is always larger than the bullets knockback, as some momentum of the bullet is lost during flight, and if the bullet penetrates through the target it will not have imparted all its energy into the target.\n\n[b]One-shot stop[/b]\nThis hypothesis, promoted by Evan P. Marshall, is based on statistical analysis of actual shooting incidents from various reporting sources (typically police agencies). It is intended to be used as a unit of measurement and not as a tactical philosophy, as mistakenly believed by some. It considers the history of shooting incidents for a given factory ammunition load, and compiles the percentage of "one-shot-stops" achieved with each specific ammunition load. That percentage is then intended to be used with other information to help predict the effectiveness of that load getting a "one-shot-stop." For example, if an ammunition load is used in 10 torso shootings, incapacitating all but two with one shot, the "one-shot-stop" percentage for the total sample would be 80%.\n\nSome argue that this hypothesis ignores any inherent selection bias. For example, high-velocity 9 mm hollow point rounds appear to have the highest percentage of one-shot stops.[citation needed] Rather than identifying this as an inherent property of the firearm/bullet combination, the situations where these have occurred need to be considered. The 9 mm has been the predominantly-used caliber of many police departments, so many of these one-shot-stops were probably made by well-trained police officers, where accurate placement would be a contributory factor. However, Marshall''s database of "one-shot-stops" does include shootings from law enforcement agencies, private citizens, and criminals alike.\n\nCritics of this theory point out that bullet placement is a very significant factor, but is only generally used in such one-shot-stop calculations, covering shots to the torso.[citation needed]\n\nSince 2006, after the conviction of retired school teacher Harold Fish in Arizona for second degree murder during a self-defense shooting, some CCW holders in the United States have elected to switch from carrying hollow-point bullets, and especially 10mm Auto caliber weapons with perceived higher one-shot stopping power, to carrying smaller caliber weapons[citation needed]. Fish''s conviction for killing a homeless man with a history of mental instability who attacked him while hiking on a remote trail, was obtained through a jury trial by stressing that Fish overreacted, through choosing to use the increased stopping power of 10 mm hollow point bullets. State law in Arizona has subsequently been changed, such that the state now has the burden to prove that a self defense shooting was not in self defense, whereas the burden previously, before the Fish incident, was that the shooter on trial had to prove that the shooting was in fact, done in self defense. The conviction has since been thrown out by the Arizona Court of Appeals. Meanwhile, many CCW holders have elected to switch to carrying handguns loaded with FMJ bullets in calibers smaller than 10 mm[citation needed]. A choice often advocated for selecting the correct stopping power in CCW training classes is to select to use the exact same type of bullets (FMJ or hollow point), in the exact same caliber that are used by the local police, to avoid being accused of overreacting during any self defense post-incident trial.[11][12]\n\n[b]Big Hole School[/b]\nThis school of thought says that the bigger the hole in the target the higher the rate of bleed-out and thus the higher the rate of the aforementioned "one shot stop". According to this theory, as the bullet does not pass entirely through the body, it incorporates the energy transfer and the overpenetration ideals. Those that support this theory cite the .40 S&W round, arguing that it has a better ballistic profile than the .45, and more stopping power than a 9x19mm Parabellum.\n\nThe theory centers on the "permanent cavitation" element of a handgun wound. A big hole damages more tissue. It is therefore valid to a point, but penetration is also important, as a large bullet that does not penetrate will be less likely to strike vital blood vessels and blood-carrying organs such as the heart and liver, while a smaller bullet that penetrates deep enough to strike these organs or vessels will cause faster bleed-out through a smaller hole. The ideal may therefore be a combination; a large bullet that penetrates deeply, which can be achieved with a larger, slower non-expanding bullet, or a smaller, faster expanding bullet such as a hollow point. It is important to note however, that in the extreme a heavier bullet (which preserves momentum greater than a lighter bullet of the same caliber) may "overpenetrate", passing completely through the target without expending all of its kinetic energy in the target.\n\nSo-called "overpenetration" is not an important consideration when it comes to wounding incapacitation or "stopping power." (Liability maybe, but not incapacitation...) Not only does overpenetration indicate that the projectile was moving faster than it would if it hadn''t overpenetrated, (A faster moving projectile of the same composition, weight, and shape will generally produce a "bigger hole.") but also it will mean that there are now two holes that blood can flow from instead of just the one.\n\n[b]Other contributing factors[/b]\nAs mentioned earlier, there are many factors, such as drug and/or alcohol levels within the body, body mass index, mental illness, motivation levels, body part strike (i.e. "armpit hold") which may determine which round will possess true stopping power during any given situation.', ''),

(99941, ' [quote=Gilani]@Pistol, Spaypanther and Idrees Taj sahib:\nI am interested in buying a 1911 in 9mm, obviously due to the cheap availability of ammo. However, I have no experience on 1911 in 9mm caliber. Could someone share his experience as to why 1911 is not that good in 9 mm parabellum and what problems / defecencies  are generally observed.   \nthanks[/quote]\n\nwell I am one of those who have a love affair with 1911s since early 1990s when I first got hold of a Remington Rand 1911 made around mid 1920s which I upgraded with Wilson Combat parts worth US $ 350. Then bought the Colt Combat Elite and a Colt Special Combat Govt Modlel in .45 acp from Colt Custom shop, but was mad enough to sell it some years later. That piece is somewhere in peshawar! and would regret my entire life. That was perhaps the only piece in the country. Then bought a Taurus 1911 which has all the bells and whistles the Colt Custom shop gun had. Later also managed to get my hands on a 1911 9 mm built in US on a S.S frame and slide from phillipines. This has more bells than any other 1911 gun I had including a Smith and Alexander Mag well with checkered main spring housing and clark barrel, high rise beavertail grip safety and Bomar ajustable rear sight. \n\nAs far as I am concerened, the 1911s are range guns for me as I have adjusted the triggers to under 4 pounds. The recoil of a 45 acp round fired from a 1911 does not bother me at all. I have shot several one hole groups with the pt1911, Colt Custom 1911 and I am doing the same with the 9mm 1911. \n\nThere were times when 45 acp round was available for Rs 5 and the 9mm from POF costed 8 or 9 Rs. Hence it was cheap fun to fire round after round of 45 acps. Now the situation has changed. 45 acp is more that Rs 70 whereas 9mm is half the price. Therefore you can do twice the amount of practice with a 9mm.\n\nThe recoil of the 9mm in a 1911 is a pussy cat and mind it, the 9mm is no slouch when it comes to stopping power. Hence one can use it as a regular carry gun. \n\nTo be frank, this 9mm 1911 is my hottest favorite and i usually pull this piece from below my bed before going to sleep. (it is like a bed time story or a LORI for me). The size of the 9mm and 45 acp are exactly the same.\n\nSo folks, if you can get hold of a 9 mm 1911, go for it. I assure you, you wont be dissapointed. Taurus PT 1911 will be available in stores in the US in May 2010. A few others like Springfield, Kimber, Wilson and Rock ISland Armory (based on slides and frames from philipines) STI and Les Baer market 1911s in 9 mm but they are usually above $1500. However Taurus PT1911 in 9mm would be available in $ 600 price range which in Pakistan, one should be able to buy around Rs 70,000. Another good buy would be from the new Iver Johnson company which is having there 1911s built in philipines on slides and frames made in philipines and internal parts supplied by iver johnson.\n\nLike so many others around the world, i am also dying to lay my hands on the 9mm PT 1911 when it becomes available.\n\ngood luck''\n\nsikandar pasha', ''),

(100013, ' Hi guys!  Here is Akdal Ghost TR2. A friend of mine used to talk very high of his Akdal Ghost. Today, I borrowed his pistol and carried out the test. It was an almost new pistol with only 50 rounds fired from it.  And what a disappointment. Though I have fired a lot from Akdal Ghost TR1 and was never impressed with it, this one was even worst. When my friend called me in the evening and asked about the performance of his pistol, I simply told him to change the handgun if he can and never to carry it for SD. May be this one was a lemon but I would rate a well made local clone better than this pistol. Here we go..................\n\nFirer: 		Gilani\nHandgun:	Akdal Ghost TR2\nCondition:	Excellent. 100%\nBarrel:		113 MM\nSize:		190x135x30 mm (a very convenient size BTW)\nDist:		10, 20 & 30 M\nAmmo:		POF 2Z\nSequence:	5 shots from 10 M, 5 from 20M and 5 from 30M on the same target.\nStoppages:	3 out of 30, one misfire and two failures to feed. \nScore:		73 / 300 [b](24.33 %)[/b]\n[b]Accuracy Rating:	JUNK, DONT BUY IT[/b]\n\n[img]http://i206.photobucket.com/albums/bb136/sualeh/Guns/DSCN5930.jpg[/img]\nYou can see that bullets from 10 M (encircled in red) are on the right side of bull but far away from the centre. Only two bullets hitting from 20 M. And from 30 M, not even a single hit on the target. I just could not imagine that such a nice looking handgun could be so inaccurate also. :mad:\n\n[img]http://i206.photobucket.com/albums/bb136/sualeh/Guns/DSCN5939.jpg[/img]\nSecond test fire was worst than first. All bullets from 10 M hitting right and low. No bullet from 20 M and only 1 bullet from 30 M. This one bullet from 30 M must have been my fault because all other bullets were hitting way outside the target. So far away that my attendant was continuously saying, Sir where are you shooting :)\n\nAkdal Ghost TR2 is a nice looking pistol with a very good grip and balance. Has a very convenient size and to say the least, is impressive out of box. Barrel is very light. In comparison, CZ999 has a slightly shorter barrel but is far more heavy. I am not sure what material the barrel of TR2 is made of but its certainly a very light one. \n\n[b]Ranger performance of Ghost TR2, as you have seen above, is [/b] [b]miserable[/b]. The gun i tested was hitting way off the target and trigger is quite pathetic. There were three stoppages which does not speak good on the reliability part. It is possible that the one that I tested was a lemon and other Akdal pistols are good but I am not very positive about it. I have fired more than 100 rounds from Akdal Ghost TR1 also and that handgun was also not reliable though it was more accurate than this one, but still not very accurate. If this be the standard of average Akdal pistol, I would not recommend any to buy Ghost TR2. [b]Final Accuracy Rating is "JUNK"[/b]', ''),

Although it was quite off your POA (the bull) but still a good group hence an accurate weapon. Sights are suspect. They are ruining the accuracy of the pistol. That infers the factory adjusted sights were not perfectly aligned during the assembly of parts in factory. It is infact not very uncommon in mass produced guns. If the sights are dove tailed and provided with an ''Allen Screw'', the pistols need just a little effort to come alive. Same is the case with 446''s accuracy vs. CZ999''s. I doubt there would be any real difference between these two in accuracy department.\n\nA bit of note on local 92, very nice grouping as well with this pistol indeed. I wish the sights were a bit aligned the rounds would print on target''s center mass. That could give a whole lot impressive look to the results and hence the comments. For those who want to try a clone and want reliable primer ignitions they should get the fire pin rebuilt by a competent gun smith like those who have experience of working in Factories (they are real experts).

Its good that you have raised a few issues on which I myself wanted to talk about. \n\n[b]First of all, the purpose of this thread is to give idea to an ordinary gun enthusiast about the performance of a particular handgun in the field of accuracy and help them in making decision while buying a handgun by giving some tangible results.[/b] This thread is not for the experts who can get custom jobs done on their guns and hence, greatly improve their performance. I fully admit here that testing one specimen of a particular gun may not give a clear picture. It may be a faulty gun and it may be a lemon. But even result of one gun would be better than not having any tangible input and commenting that this gun is good or this gun is bad. \n\nNow coming to your comments about the accuracy of TR2. Sir, this is the most inaccurate pistol I have ever fired in my life. Out of 15 bullets fired, 8 are not even on the target. You have mentioned that TR2 is making good group but it is off the target so a problem of sights. Well, from 10 M if a pistol is making 5 inches group and that too 6 inches away from the point of aim than in my view its no good a pistol. All accurate pistols should be right in the bull area from 10M and making not more than 2 inch group. (mind you I am firing with my elbows resting on the table). You can see the results of CZ 999, PT99, Baikal and few others that they are dead accurate from 10M. This pistol was almost an NIB pistol and if the sights are that much off, it does not speak good of the company. That means there are serious manufacturing and quality control issues. \n\n[b]Now as I already said, this thread is for a common joe. The one who buys a pistol through his hard earned money and than trusts his life on it. [/b]The poor guy neither has scientific knowledge to carry out all the tests and than determine that his gun is trustworthy or not nor he has the facilities available to him to get custom jobs done on his gun even if he finds out the problem. In simple words, leaving aside the experts who have the knowledge and resources to get custom jobs done on their guns and improve their performance, [b]all of us should buy guns which are accurate and reliable out of the box and we can trust them during the hour of need[/b] :)\n\nregards', ''),

It was a deliberate fire on rapid fire targets (which are different from precision shooting targets). They are the same targets which have been shown in Abbas sahibs video clips. Basically, precision shooting target has 1 inch radius bull and rapid fire target has 2 inch radius bull.

Sooner or later, no matter how average joe you happen to be, if you carry on with the gun operator phrase as in literal sense.. you gotta be a little more functional with the tool in your hand.

(100100, ' [quote=MIdreesTaj]For the average pistolero joe concept, shooting, self defense, home defense etc.. in all we have one common thing. That is, a gun operator. Sooner or later, no matter how average joe you happen to be, if you carry on with the gun operator phrase as in literal sense.. you gotta be a little more functional with the tool in your hand. Otherwise I dont think you can harness the potential of a firearm. Firearms also, are not meant to be operated superficially. And also the average joe does nothing with a firearm to his benifit. A firearm differs from a Car I''ll put as an example, where an average joe, a superficial user, a woman who doesnt know what is next if a bonnet uncovers a thing called engine still drives it for routine work and inter city touring.\n\nFor the poor TR2 I would say, I am very curious to know what could have been possibly wrong with the subject pistol that it ended up throwing rounds off target at 10M only. The whole TR2 sounds like a LEMON idea or junk to me as a reader of your thread which I doubt can''t be true. TR2''s behaviour like that becomes a mystery. :)\nFor a true gun enthusiast, there should be left no mystery. \n\nIt was just my 2 cents in this... :)[/quote]\n\nIdrees sahib, fully agreed. And this exactly my worry is. Out of more than 1500 members of PakGuns, every one is not a gun expert and everyone is not an excellent shot also. Its all a matter of opportunities. Many members do not have the opportunity of practicing and dealing with the guns as some of us have. However, most members are deeply and genuinely interested in knowing accurate facts about the handguns and certainly do not want to go wrong when they buy one. Our discussion in this thread should primarily focus on providing some practical input to such members, in whatever capacity we can and in the end I am sure we all will benefit. \n\nWith this in view, I would fully agree with SA sahib that more of us need to post results in this thread so that we have diverse views on a particular handgun (at least those of us who have the opportunity and resources to post results of the handguns they possess, are requested to do it).  :)\n\nI wont certainly say that all pistols made by Akdal Arms are of low quality as I do not have sufficient evidence for it (I must at least fire 10 different Akdal pistols to prove this)  [b]As for this particular TR2, I think it was a combination of improperly fitted sights and low quality barrel.[/b] I fired a TR1 few months back and it was not accurate either though it was better than this one. Both had an undesirable number of stoppages. So I have so far fired two and both were inaccurate and unreliable. I brought this TR2 home and inspected in detail. The internals are least impressive and quality of machining / manufacturing is quite ordinary. To me, it appears to be a gun whose manufacturer has spent all his energies in improving the finish / style and has paid very little attention to quality of parts. Still I would like to see someone else posting the results of Akdal Ghost so that we can confirm the things.  \n\nregards', ''),

See once u engage the safet on the left side, the trigger is locked, but if somehow, just by some stroke of badluck, u have a little pressure applied on the trigger while ur engaging the safety, the trigger does not lock. So if a round is chambered, it will fire. but the slide will remain locked and will not move to eject the fired shell.[/quote]\n\nIt is a known fact for 24/7 Mil PRO series [url]http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnzBhMWuWJw[/url]\n\nNot sure about 24/7 OSS DS and 24/7 PRO DS.

All 40 and + cals show good tissue disruption simulated in ordnance gel tests.\n\nFor SD 9mm jacketed hollow points are the best improvisation over full metal jacket 9mm ammo. \n\nModern and premium 9mm JHPs like Speer Gold Dot +P and Winchester Ranger SXT/Talon +P loads are the best consistent expanding ammo which reach minimum of .70 cal upon expansion and show very uniform expansions and weight retention with minimal defragmentation in Gel tests. One of the most powerful JHP for self defense is Cor-Bon Powa Ball +P ammo generation up to 1500 FPS from 5" Barrels and 1400+ fps from 4" Barrels is also considered good in expansion and weight retention after the 2 above mentioned rounds.\n\nOn the other hand I would not consider myself under powered with 9mm FMJ ammo too because I tend to practice hitting center mass and on top of it with a double tap.', ''),

He was asking more than 500K for G-34 with the whole accessories.\n\n@Vik, I think @X-Gage was so indulged in other things that he didn''t took more pictures of the Styer M9. \n\nAlso following is the pic of M-16 type shotgun and G-34(Here stock can be seen attached with G-34) in background I have tried my level''s best to hide the faces of people present there\n\n[img]http://i737.photobucket.com/albums/xx17/HammadArshad/G_36_with_Stock_M16_Shotgun.jpg[/img]\n\nAnother image of M16 type shotgun and G-34 with a magazine in M-16 type shotgun\n\n[img]http://i737.photobucket.com/albums/xx17/HammadArshad/Again_G34_M16_with_Magazine.jpg[/img]\n\nWinchester 7mm rifle\n\n[img]http://i737.photobucket.com/albums/xx17/HammadArshad/Winchester_7mm_Rifle.jpg[/img]\n\nOther than these I was also looking for Shaheen 4 No. cartridges, well please someone help me to understand the prices of these :/ these cartridges were available for 1500 to 1200 rupees a box.\n\nAlso @X-Gage was very much interested in buying 1 no. slugs for his airgun, so we bought them as well and we were offered Gamo Shadow 1000 for 25K :rolleyes: I don''t know what is wrong with me or do I look like a guy with lot of money to spare cause list time a dealer offered me Shaheen 4 no. cartridges for 1800 a box :|', ''),
