These two items should be gifts only, memberships or no memberships! I think this would be a perfect introduction and Pakguns would be swaying in new terrains as well!

Make sure you teach him how to make local and long distance phone calls. Even a small child can be taught to dial “15” for help, or, “111-222-345” CPLC operator. Find out if “15” or CPLC is servicing your local area.\n\n3	Listen attentively when your child talks about “a man or woman” he or she met in your absence. Create an environment in which the child feels free to talk to you, let him/her know that you are interested and sensitive to their fears.\n\n4	Teach your child not to wander off, to keep you in sight at all times, and to avoid lonely places.\n\n5	Keep your child in sight at all times; when your child is away from you, know whom he or she is with and where.\n\n6	Teach your child never to go anywhere with anyone who doesn’t know a family “code” word.\n\n7	Don’t let your child accept rides from anyone with whom you haven’t made previous arrangements-even if they are known or a friend of the family.\n\n8	Children should immediately tell you if someone has asked them to keep a secret from you.\n\n9	Never leave your child alone in a public place, stroller or car, not even for a minute.\n\n10	Tell your child about the abduction problem in a calm and simple way as if you were teaching any other important coping skill.\n\n11	Teach your child that it’s OK to run away or to scream if someone is making him or her do something he or she should not do.\n\n12	Children should scream and scatter books and belongings, if they are forced towards a building or a car.\n\n13	Children should not take candy or other gifts from strangers or anyone else without asking a parent first.\n\n14	Children should know that no one, even their teacher does not have the right to touch any part of their bodies that a bathing suit would cover.\n\n15	Accompany your child on the day of issuance of Report Card to school.\n\n\n[u][b]VALUE OF LIFE  ….

The trainers were ex-Scotland yard consultants who have been negotiating hostage releases for the British Government across the world for the last 30 odd years until retirement and entry into private service.  Very knowledgeable guys and the presentation was an eye opener in some areas.\n\nTo quote one of them, the cardinal rule which you should remember while driving is "Tires and tarmac" i.e. when you stop behind a car, you must stop at a distance which allows you to see both........and this distance allows you to back out or get away without your car being blocked.\n\nThey also did not advise carrying weapons as it tends to escalate the situation besides most civilians do not have the proper training to use them.  Similarly, having a police / military guard is next to useless as they are not trained close protection specialists .  Interestingly, the only trained close protection unit in this country is a small detachment of the SSG who guard various top ranking dignitaries who have been trained by the SAS and this consultant also made presentations to us around 6 months ago.\n\nTo sum it up in a nutshell using layman terms:\n\n1) Opportunistic kidnapping - Create deterrence -  Have guards with visible weapons and follow all security precautions above\n2) Planned kidnapping - Nothing above including weapons will work on this.

Guide me, if I am wrong, and bear with me, if I am right. The question of required Concealed Carry Permits to carry your guns has been raised and discussed on manifold threads and there has never been any conclusive standpoint on this issue. We all have our own opinion in this regard. I, personally, have always opined that I do not think these permits should be required apart from when section 144 is imposed. I may be wrong, yet I find it totally absurd that after being issued a licence to keep a firearm, I should have to look for a permit to keep/ travel with that licenced gun! Furthermore, I deem the ability to protect your life is needed more outside your house than inside of it. Thus, if a licence is issued for the purpose of protection, it would be totally out of bound, if you cannot carry that weapon outside of your premises, without a special permit, being issued on special grounds, by endorsement of some special S.P!   On top of page 5 of your MOI licence, below the Government Of Pakistan heading, it is CLEARLY stated that the licence is issued : For The possession of arms and ammunition and for GOING ARMED FOR THE PURPOSES of SPORTS/PROTECTION/DISPLAY. Furthermore, on page 28, clause 4, under CONDITIONS: THE LICENSEE or any RETAINER acting under this licence SHALL NOT GO ARMED with any arms covered thereby OTHERWISE THAN IN GOOD FAITH! Indeed, there is a clause on the same page, clause 3 page 28, that states some limits and reserves some rights for the Federal/Provincial Govenments, to impose restrictions, but that is where I think section 144 is being touched. Section 144 is a restricting rule that we can get to know about through media, and act according to, yet other restrictive rules, if any, imposed by the Government, which would necessitate a Concealed Carry Permit have never been highlighted by any media and one cannot always keep eyes and ears open for such announcements!  Neither is one ever briefed about any such restrictions at the time of applying for or collecting the licence. Nor is it written ANYWHERE in the licence that the firearm can ONLY be kept within your house. I, therefore, maintain, that a Concealed Carry Permit may not be required for you to carry your gun outside your premises, apart from when section 144 is employed. I have requested other members to inquire about this confusion from both the MOI and D.C.O offices, yet we have not heard anything so far.

(18122, 732, 0, 'Hamid', 378, '', 1240893450, '[b]How to check the condition of a used handgun[/b]\n\n\nBefore handling any firearm, always open the action and verify that both the chamber and the magazine are empty. Remove the magazine if possible. Every time a firearm changes hands it should be cleared.\n\n1. Look at the overall condition of the gun. Notice the condition of the bluing and the overall wear. Look for rust pitting on external metal surfaces. Are the grips in good condition? All screws should be tight and the screw heads un-marred. The gun doesn''t have to be perfect in every area, but it should show care rather than neglect. A pistol could be rough on the outside, yet perfect on the inside, but the chances are that an owner who didn''t care for the external parts of a gun also didn''t care for the parts you can''t see.\n\n2. The size, shape and angle of the grip should fit your hand. When you bring the gun to eye level your master eye should be looking straight down on the barrel. The gun should not be tipped up or down. Having a gun that points naturally is especially important for a pistol that might be used for protection.\n\n3. Look carefully down the external length of the barrel to see that it looks straight and there are no subtle bulges. Don''t buy any handgun if you suspect that the barrel (or the cylinder of a revolver) has been bulged, no matter how slightly, or if it is not straight. Also look at the crown of the muzzle--it should not be dented.\n\n4. Note the position of the rear sight on guns with adjustable sights. If it is way off to one side, suspect some sort of problem and ask to shoot the gun to verify accuracy before purchase. If the seller refuses, reject the deal.\n\n5. Check the condition of the grips. There should not be any splits, chips, or cracks in the grips, particularly if you are looking at a discontinued model (for which it may be hard to find replacement grips). Scratches in the grip finish, worn checkering, and tiny nicks in the grips will not affect the gun''s function, but should lower the price. \n\nAs the screws holding wood grips to the grip frame are tightened they will tend to pull deeper and deeper into the wood. Check to see that they are not about to pull clear through. This is particularly common with Ruger single action (SA) revolvers, but applies to most guns with wooden grip panels.\n\n6. Get permission to dry fire the gun and check the trigger pull. Dry firing will not hurt most centerfire handguns, but it is still a good idea to use snap caps to protect the firing pin. Snap caps have been discussed in separate thread on the forum. \n\nWhatever the trigger pull weight, it should be consistent from shot to shot. If it feels like a stock factory trigger (too heavy with some creep), fine, you can get it adjusted later. If it feels crisp and breaks at 2.5-3 pounds it has probably been worked on or adjusted. This is great if done properly, as it will save you some money, but make sure that the piece will not jar off.\n\nTo test this, get permission to bump the butt of the cocked handgun against some firm but padded surface. The gun should not fire. Push against the fully cocked hammer (if the pistol has one) with your thumb--it should not slip out of its notch; reject the gun if it does.\n\n7. Check the inside of the barrel (and the chambers of a revolver''s cylinder). If the barrel is dirty, ask that it be cleaned or for permission to clean it yourself. Do not oil the barrel after cleaning, and be suspicious of any barrel that has been oiled. The shine from the oil can hide minor barrel imperfections and pitting. (A friend of mine, who is in the car restoration business, washes the prospective purchase to have a close view of the vehicle''s condition. Same rule holds true for weapons.)\n\nOnce the barrel is reasonably clean, dry, and oil free, open the action or remove the barrel and look into it from both ends. Use a bore light. Hopefully it will be clean and bright with sharp rifling. A slight amount of rust or pitting inside the barrel (or the cylinder of a revolver) will ordinarily not seriously degrade the performance of a handgun, unless it is a target pistol, but it should lower the used price.\n\n[b]Specific things to check on used revolvers[/b]\n\n1. Note the condition of the forcing cone at the back of the barrel. Slight erosion in this area, particularly on magnum revolvers, is not cause for concern, but it should not be seriously eroded. The more erosion you see the more the gun has been fired with heavy loads.\n\n2. Check for cutting of the top strap at the cylinder gap, particularly with magnum revolvers. A little erosion here will not hurt, but excessive cutting is undesirable and indicates a lot of shooting with heavy loads, or a wide cylinder gap, or both.\n\n3. To test the safety notch of a traditional single action revolver, pull firmly (about 8-10 pounds--this is not intended to be a test to destruction) on the trigger with the hammer in the safety notch to see if it can be easily forced. Put the revolver on half cock (the loading position) and repeat the test, applying about 5 pounds of pressure on the trigger. The hammer should not drop. This test does not apply to New Model (two screw) Ruger SA revolvers, as they use a different lockwork than traditional SA revolvers.\n\n4. The cylinder of Colt double action revolvers should be completely tight when the trigger is pulled all the way back (the hand forces the cylinder against the bolt). S&W revolvers are never as tight as a Colt, but at least they should not rattle. Slight cylinder play is permissible with S&W DA (and also Ruger SA) revolvers.\n\n5. Check the cylinder gap. It should not exceed .010", and .006" is ideal. Cock the gun to turn the cylinder so that every chamber, in turn, lines up with the barrel. The cylinder gap should remain constant.\n\nAlso, the cylinder should not slide back and forth appreciably on the cylinder pin. This is called endplay, and it generally increases with use.\n\n6. The crane of a swing out cylinder DA revolver should fit tight to the frame (when closed) without any unsightly gaps. If it doesn''t the crane may be sprung. When you wiggle the cylinder with your fingers the crane should barely move, if at all.\n\nWhile you are at it, check to make sure that the ejector rod has not been bent. This is easy to see if you spin the cylinder, which should spin true.\n\n7. Use you fingers or thumb to put a small amount of drag on the cylinder while you manually cock the revolver (single action mode). The cylinder bolt should click into the locking notches in the cylinder, locking the cylinder in place, at the end of each segment of cylinder rotation. If it does not, the gun is out of time and needs work. Then rapidly thumb cock the gun (don''t "fan" a revolver)--the cylinder should not rotate past the proper locking notch. Also, the bolt should not be dragging on the cylinder as it turns. If it does it will leave a clearly visible wear line in the cylinder''s finish.\n\n8. Examine the sideplate of a DA revolver. If it has been improperly disassembled it may show pry marks at the edge or have been warped. The sideplate should fit flush and tight, without any gaps.\n\n9. Check the tip of the firing pin, it should be smooth and rounded, not sharp or broken. The firing pin hole should not be chipped or burred.\n\n[b]Specific things to check on used semi-automatic pistols[/b]\n\n1. See that all of the controls work smoothly and with a reasonable amount of pressure. The safety should prevent the gun from firing (check by setting the safety and pulling the trigger normally). The slide lock should hold the slide open. The magazine release should release the magazine easily and yet hold it securely in place until it is pushed. If there is a grip safety the gun should not fire unless the grip safety fully depressed. If there is a magazine safety the gun should not fire unless the magazine is in place. \n\n2. Cycle an autoloader to verify that it operates smoothly and properly. See that the slide is tight and reasonably free of slop when closed and the pistol is cocked. (There is ordinarily some play or the gun will not function.) Verify that the pistol fieldstrips and reassembles correctly. Also see that the action has been kept reasonably clean for proper functioning.\n\n3. Examine the slide (especially at the front and at the ejection port) and frame for excessive wear or cracks. Aluminum alloy frames are particularly susceptible to developing hairline cracks (and eventually failing) from extended use.\n\n4. The cocked hammer or striker of a SA auto pistol should not drop when the slide is closed smartly. If you can make the hammer drop by letting the slide slam closed the gun is unsafe.\n\n5. Check the magazine(s) for wear and condition. A proper magazine is very important to the functioning of an autoloading pistol. You want the original, name brand, magazine(s) in good condition. Inspect the feed lips for bends, cracks and wear, and insure that the seam at the back of the magazine is tight.\n\nAlso check the bottom of the magazine to insure that it has not been ejected from the pistol and allowed to fall to the ground. This looks great on TV or at action matches, but in real life it is very hard on magazines. Magazines are not expendable.\n\nCurtesy \n[url=http://www.chuckhawks.com]www.chuckhawks.com[/url]', 0, 1, '58.27.227.114', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 1034, 22167),

Its a pretty basic range. You can shoot at targets from 15 meters onward to 50 meters (this is done by placing target stands at the required distance). There is now a dedicated enclosed Air pistol/Air rifle range as well. LRC is open on Saturdays and Sundays from 9:00-6:00. \n\nThere are dedicated turning targets for .22 Standard Pistol matches. Matches are held every few months. These are usually Big bore pistol matches (one handed at 25 meters), Amateur big bore (2 handed at 15 meters), Speed shooting Thooti matches at 15 meters (Draws are made at random amongst participants who compete 2 at a time, whoever shoots 5 painted Firni Thootis first, advances to the next round until 1st, 2nd and 3rd are determined). Standard Pistol .22 matches at 25 meters, 50 meter Free Pistol matches, .22 rifle matches at 50 meters (Prone position), both in Professional and amateur categories. 60 shot Air pistol matches at 10 meters (such as in the Olympics).\n\nRecently there was a big bore pistol match at 50 Meters shooting clay disks measuring 10 inches from high caliber pistols/revolvers such as .45, .357, .44. Also there was a .22 rifle bench rest match in which the winner was the person with the smallest cumulative group size after 20 shots.

Such a decision by the most powerful neighbour of India also underlines the possibility of the increasing Chinese power in the Indian Ocean.\n\nBeijing’s decision of supporting the Rajapaksa government in eliminating the LTTE from its very root cannot be viewed as an isolated issue, as the Reds have also helped the island nation earlier. In 2008, China sold huge sophisticated weapons to its new partner Colombo and also gave an aid of more than five times of $1 billion. Presently, China is the largest donor to Sri Lanka.\n\nThe Sri Lankan Air Force is bedecked by the Chinese Jian-7 fighter jets, anti-aircraft guns and JY-11 3D air surveillance radars, which have played a major role in getting success against the LTTE rebels in recent days.\n\nChina started helping the Lankan government after the Unites States stopped sending aids to Colombo for breaching the human rights. Beijing is also influencing its decade old ally - Pakistan for providing military assistance to Lanka. The Pakistani air force also trained their Sri Lankan counterparts in precision-guided attacks.\n\nAccording to Brahma Chellaney, the strategic affairs expert, China is trying to influence the Lankan government for its importance in the Indian Ocean so that the communists can make international passageway for trade and oil in future.\n\nThe Chinese engineers are presently working for a billion-dollar port in the country''s southeast, Hambantota. This would be the latest Chinese strategy to control vital maritime communication between the Indian and Pacific Oceans by assembling the listening posts, special naval arrangements and access to ports. A big highway, two power plants and a new port in the hometown of Lankan president are also under construction by some Chinese engineering companies.\n\nNew Delhi’s reluctance over the issues of Lanka helps China to increase its influence in the island nation. The continuous protest in Tamil Nadu against the Lankan government over the killing of LTTE rebels has crippled the Indian government to take a strong stand. Cashing in on the issue, China continues to aggressively pursue its strategic interests in the Indian Ocean rim.\n\nlink\n\n[url]http://www.merinews.com/catFull.jsp?articleID=15767304[/url]', 0, 1, '118.103.224.250', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 489, 22498),

Abbas said the military was trying to eliminate militants from Buner, a town which lies around 75 kilometres (46 miles) south of Swat valley. In February, the government agreed that Islamic sharia law could be enforced in Swat, in deal with militants aimed at ending two years of rebellion. Abbas said between 400 and 500 militants had entered in Buner early this month ''in violation'' of the February agreement, and were harassing and terrorising the local population.

The advantages are that:\n\n1. for concealed carry you cannot find a leather holster that is as thin (for concealability) , whilst \n\n2. very strong (for protection from falls and bumps) as well. \n\n3.Additionally, such holsters do not require a retention strap as the trigger guard of the holster captures the pistols trigger guard with an audible "click".\n \n4. The pistol can be easily re-holstered  with one hand which is usually not the case with thin fabric IWB holsters which tend to collapse once you take the weapon out (because they are sandwiched between your body and your belt and pants). Then when re-holstering you have to follow the dangerous practice of using the thumb and forefinger of your opposing hand to open the mouth of the holster whilst pointing a loaded firearm at them. As you may appreciate this is hardly desirable with a loaded firearm, specially under stress if you have to use your firearm for Self Defense (God forbid). You want to minimize chances of shooting yourself by accident at the range and under pressure situations.\n\n5.

PERSONAL  PROTECTION  Measures\n	\n	Personal  protection  is  largely a matter of common sense. Most people have an in-built sense of survival and avoid situations that may endanger themselves. However, most people are not aware of how criminals operate. The following measures reduce the risk of becoming the target/ victim of criminal activity\n\n		Do Not Set Patterns \n\nVary routes and timing when travelling to and from School, Work, Shopping, etc.\nVary routes and timings for walks/jogging or outing\n\n	1.2	Use Main Routes And Avoid\n\nBadly lit areas\nQuiet Residential / Industrial / Barren areas\nSingle lane roads\n\n	1.3	Look Ahead\n\nWhen driving and walking, look ahead and be aware of situation that may cause you to slow down or stop. If suspicious, avoid getting into that situation. At night do not give way to a suspicious vehicle if he honks or flashes his headlights from behind to corner you.\n\nWhen driving lock your doors and leave enough distance from the car in front, so that in case the front car stops/blocks you, there is enough space for you to get away. \n\nWherever possible, stay on the roads having fast moving traffic.\n\nIf anybody blocks your road, try to choose an exit point even if it means damaging your car to escape the blockade.\n\n	1.4	Look Behind\n\nWhen driving and walking be aware of who is following you, if suspicious, stay calm, and head for the nearest safe haven such as police/military/navy, barracks, busy areas etc. try to lose them and never approach your house or your friends. If being followed drive fast and be alert. Watch your rearview mirror at all times.\n\n	1.5	ALWAYS  LET  SOMEONE  KNOW  YOUR  WHEREABOUTS :-\n\nIf possible tell someone where you are going and let them know your program/schedule. Avoid quiet early morning or noon outings. \n\n	1.6	Vehicle Security\n\nInstall Vehicle Alarm System. The latest Satellite Vehicle Tracking System not only secures your Vehicle, but cares for the security and safety of your family.\n\nWhen approaching a parked car, kindly ensure that no suspicious person/s are around. \n\nDo not leave any children inside parked cars. Avoid sitting in the vehicle at roadside or shopping centers.\n\nInstruct drivers to park the car at a prominent place, lock it and stand away from the car while waiting for you to return.\n\n		\n2.	SECURE FAMILY\n\n	2.1	Do not display your name on the gate of your apartment/ house, just the address.\n\n	2.2	Auto Lock System at gate and doors connected to a speaker system and closed circuit TV around the house and entrance porch. \n\n	2.3	Intercom with coded identification to communicate with guards/servants to allow access.\n\n	2.4	Door Chains\n\n	2.5	Guards should be positioned on Terrace with Sensor Lights activated around the house \n\n	2.6	Employees must deposit: \ni) I.D Card       ii) Photo 	iii) Reference iv) Registration with Police for  Servants, Drivers, Maids,  Guards, Sweepers, Gardeners, etc.\n\n	2.7	Keep bedrooms locked, pre-determined coded words for opening at all times. Identify restricted areas of the house for servants, especially males. This will also help prevent burglars from accessing the rooms of other family members.\n\n	2.8	Do not be threatened by Dacoits / Burglars to disclose hidden cash/jewelry on the mere threat of killing a family member. Make a small safe at a place where nobody looks and distribute your valuables. Be calm, do not be intimidated, act scared, start crying, the criminals like to believe they have scared you, so you must be telling the truth.\n \n\n3.	Personal Safety\n	\n	3.1	Print only plain Visiting Cards.\n	3.2	Discourage display of Mobile Phone by children.\n	3.3	Never sit in the front with Home Drivers or Van Drivers.\n	3.4	Don’t Carry weapons.\n	3.5	Do not Drive without a License.\n	3.6	Late Night Outings should be discouraged.\n	3.7	Careful whilst inside and when leaving Lockers, Banks, Moneychangers and approaching ATM machines. \n\nWhen approaching any of the above, visually scan the area before getting out of your car. If you see something suspicious, like someone just standing around or many people in a nearby vehicle, but no one especially at the ATM, then leave the area immediately and if you also feel like something is "just not right" then play it safe and go to another ATM. When your transaction is completed immediately take your property (ATM card, receipt, money, etc.) and leave. You can always count your money later in the safety of your car or home.\nSimilarly, when in lockers to take home jewelry wear it on your person, never carry it in your purse. Put your dupatta/scarf around and while leaving observe the outside area as explained above. Watch your rearview mirror, you may be followed to be intercepted. In such a situation quickly hand-over your purse, which would only contain empty jewelry boxes. Use a special purse for this purpose when visiting lockers.\nBank and Moneychanger places are always hot favorites of criminals. They may be observing while standing right beside you when encashing foreign exchange or cheques. Be extremely cautious and alert when returning as warned in 3.7(a).\n	3.8	Share a family code for identifying genuine telephone messages sent through strangers/ acquaintances for its genuineness and safety.\n	3.9	Use your mobile phone to call the place / house you intend to visit. It helps establishing your last location and movement.\n	3.10	Do not leave old people on their own at the mercy of mere servants.\n	3.11	Obnoxious/ Annoying Telephone Calls:- \n\nAlways install a digital telephone line with Caller ID. \nCaller-ID is a great way to screen your phone calls. Instruct  your children,  who may be home by themselves, to check the  Caller-ID before answering the phone and only answer the phone calls from displayed names they recognize. If Caller-ID is not available, then instruct your children not to answer the phone and arrange a "ring code" (like one ring, hang up, count to three and call again) with your children so you can reach them when you need to.\n\n\n\n\n	An answering machine is another safe way to screen your incoming phone calls for you and your children. Be sure to tell your  friends and relatives that you will answer the phone, when you  are home, once you hear them talking. Your outgoing message  should not reveal your identity or that you are away. There are a wide variety of professional "answering message" tapes available in various retail stores.  \n\nIf you receive "obscene" phone calls from strangers who ask  questions regarding private matters, HANG UP!!! Be sure to keep a log of the dates and times of these phone calls. Chronic  harassing phone calls should be reported to the Police or CPLC. Consider having your phone number changed to an unlisted number because your peace of mind is what is most important.\n\n\nBlackmailing, call CPLC / Police\n\n   “Phone calls from friendship magazine” are for blackmailing\n\n   Take care when photographed at parties, they can be misused\n\n  Never get blackmailed. Face it the very first time, have them apprehended\n\nDo not make friends through phone\n\nDo not encourage chatting With Strangers On Internet Or Lead To Personal Relationship\n\nExtortion/Threats, call CPLC / Police\n\nNever give your name, number or secret code of mobile/ land line telephone. Ask which number have they dialed and for whom? Never give out any personal information, financial information or a credit card number during an unsolicited phone survey or sales promotion. Do not fall prey to the claim that "You''ve Won a Prize!" and all the caller needs is your credit card number for proper identification or the secret code needs verification/testing. Tell the caller to notify you by mail of your good fortune and hang up. If he has your telephone number he should have your address also, don’t provide anything on your own.\n             g.   Preferably lock your mobile phone at all times.\n\n4.	How To Handle Kidnapping For Ransom\n\n	4.1	Give the kidnapper your residence telephone number having caller ID and name to contact. (negotiator)\n	4.2	Be calm, family must inform Police on emergency No. 15 or CPLC on (021) 111-222-345 immediately, for assistance and training on how to deal with the situation.\n\n	4.3	Decide upon a  negotiator within the family\n	4.4	Father and son should preferably not travel to work together. Also do not carry a cheque-book, if necessary write fake / coded balance on counterfoil, so as not to disclose the actual financial status.\n	4.5	Discuss within the family how to respond when confronted with such a situation by any member.\n\nSalary\nHome Ownership\nVehicles: Self / Company / Leased\nBank Balance / Jewelry\nMobile Phone Auto-lock\nFamily details / status\nHow not be get intimidated\n\n	4.6	When Women / Girls are Kidnapped while in car how to Escape?\n\nIf he has taken you hostage by sitting in the back seat of the car with a gun, be calm. If he tells you to quietly move to the next seat, just get down from the car and refuse to accompany him. If you have your child tell him/her to get down softly,  but firmly. Tell him to take your purse, car and whatever is inside quietly, you assure him you will not report this for an hour, but refuse to accompany him. Just walk off. Report it to the Police immediately.\nIf he tells you to drive off while he is sitting in the back, go ahead and drive. View the road and keep your car amongst other cars. Try to come to a red light at the signal and bang the car in the front. This will create a commotion, show you are jittery and get down to pacify the car driver in front. The criminal will quietly get down and escape at the first opportunity. You can now run and shout for help. Afterwards give your explanations. Call CPLC if you need any further assistance. \n\n5.	Secure Property\n\n	5.1	Property listed and Coded as per attached performa.\n	5.2	Cash, Household articles etc. should be preferably insured.\n	5.3	Please keep valuables in bank lockers. Jewelery photographed.\n	5.4\n	Give special instructions to bank that if signature is deliberately being extended on a cheque, take the person in custody and call police. The gang can be apprehended and it may also result in saving your life.\n	5.5	When having a new cheque book issued, please count its leaves in serial order and its exact quantity as stated. A missing cheque leaf can be used for fraud by the banker or by your own office staff. \n \n\n6.\nWAYS TO HELP PREVENT A CHILD ABDUCTION / MOLESTATION\n\nThe help you can offer a young child is somewhat different from what is useful for an older child. Here are some suggestions :\n\n6.1	Take head-to-shoulder photos every six months for children aged six and younger, annually for older children; make note of birthmarks and other distinguishing features including medical, dental history and finger prints.\n\n6.2	Teach your child his full name, your full name, address, and telephone number. Make sure you teach him how to make local and long distance phone calls. Even a small child can be taught to dial “15” for help, or, “111-222-345” CPLC operator. Find out if “15” or CPLC is servicing your local area.\n\n6.3	Listen attentively when your child talks about “a man or woman” he or she met in your absence. Create an environment in which the child feels free to talk to you, let him/her know that you are interested and sensitive to their fears.\n\n6.4	Teach your child not to wander off, to keep you in sight at all times, and to avoid lonely places.\n\n6.5	Keep your child in sight at all times; when your child is away from you, know whom he or she is with and where.\n\n6.6	Teach your child never to go anywhere with anyone who doesn’t know a family “code” word.\n\n6.7	Don’t let your child accept rides from anyone with whom you haven’t made previous arrangements-even if they are known or a friend of the family.\n\n6.8	Children should immediately tell you if someone has asked them to keep a secret from you.\n\n6.9	Never leave your child alone in a public place, stroller or car, not even for a minute.\n\n6.10	Tell your child about the abduction problem in a calm and simple way as if you were teaching any other important coping skill.\n\n6.11	Teach your child that it’s OK to run away or to scream if someone is making him or her do something he or she should not do.\n\n6.12	Children should scream and scatter books and belongings, if they are forced towards a building or a car.\n\n6.13	Children should not take candy or other gifts from strangers or anyone else without asking a parent first.\n\n6.14	Children should know that no one, even their teacher does not have the right to touch any part of their bodies that a bathing suit would cover.\n\n6.15	Accompany your child on the day of issuance of Report Card to school.\n7.	VALUE OF LIFE  …. Your life is Priceless. Value it !\n\n	7.1	Do not frequently visit Video Shops, avoid public Billiard Places.\n		\n	7.2	Never ever become friendly with strangers.\n		\n	7.3	Always keep someone informed or note your fears.\n		\n	7.4	Identify friends you can be proud of.\n\n\n\n	7.5	Never get involved with Teachers especially at Tuition Centres, it is merely infatuation. It is also a breach of trust bestowed by your parents.  Report all such advances / intentions of your teacher to your parents / friends / school principal. \n\n	7.6	Do not eat sweet supari/ pan masala/ gutka, etc. Many of them contain additive ingredients.\n	7.7	Say No to Drugs !\n\n\n8.\nHOW YOU CAN HELP ?\n	\n	8.1	Educate others what you have learnt regarding personal safety.\n\n	8.2	See or Hear anything suspicious/criminal, call CPLC (021)111-222-345\n\n	8.3	Sponsor and support CPLC initiated Public Toilets Scheme\n\n	8.4	Offer moral and financial support to CPLC and its campaigns.', 0, 1, '119.160.17.228', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 1068, 23588),

Never use materials such as a wire brush or sandpaper. The most effective and safest material to use to remove rust from your gun is a steel wool pad. The finer the wool the better.\nImproper lubrication is the second biggest error in rust removal. You must keep an ample amount of lubrication on the gun during rust removal. Nearly any type of oil will be sufficient. There are many varieties of oil avialable designed especially for firearms. Ordinary "3-in 1" oil is also sufficient. If you are in a pinch, even cooking oil can be a great substitution. \nYou will need plenty of paper towels and old newspapers. In the absence of those, old rags or towels are acceptable. \n\nOnce you have all your supplies, you are ready to begin the rust removal process. Your work area should be steady and sturdy. Spread out the old news papers or towels to catch any debris that may result from the removal of the rust on your gun. A gun vice is a handy tool to have to keep your firearm steady while you are working on it, however it is not vital. Just be sure to place your gun so that it does not move while you are working. \n\nUse the oil to lubricate the areas on the gun that are affected by rust. Apply the oil liberally. Use the steel wool to gently rub the rust away from the surface of the gun. Be careful not to use excessive pressure or to scrub vigorously, as this can damage the finish on the gun. Be certain to keep adding the oil to affected area. \n\nAfter a few minutes use the paper towels to wipe off the excess oil and debris from the removed rust. This will allow you to see the progress you have made and determine how much more work you will need to do to completely remove the rust. If rust remains, repeat the above process until it is removed. \n\nOnce you have finished with the removal, give your gun another coat of lubrication. Be sure to check your firearm periodically while in storage. Once a gun has developed rust it is likely to reappear in the same areas even after removal. \n\nJust be sure not to use your wifes "good towels". You might end up with bigger issues than rust removal !

First of all welcome onboard Pakguns. Hope you''ll both enjoy from this site as well as gain in knowledge from us on your devoted hobby, not to say impart us with knowledge that we may not have! Welcome! Second, thanks a lot for taking meaningful share in this on-going thread of mine dealing with this very important issue on Concealed carrying of licensed firearms. I have inspected to my best ability the reference that you''ve quoted dealing with this question and my observations are: 1) Licence holders can carry their weapons in a CONCEALED manner, thus not in DISPLAYED manner. 2) Licence holders complying with these directions should NOT BE HARESSED by LEA. 3) The Ban on DISPLAY of arms, however, does NOT apply to HUNTING parties with valid licenses/permits issued from the relevant departments like Forestry/Wildlife/Fisheries, etc. I appreciate your reference as it simplifies conclusion of this thread, yet the only little doubt that i have in my mind left is that the letter seems to have been issued around the year 2000, and I would therefore be a bit cautious as to deem the directions within it valid until now. Nevertheless, I do not THINK that changes HAVE been made, yet suggest that somebody plz check the up- to- date status of the directions given in the letter, just for assurities sake. It is indeed noteworthy that the letter deals with Provincially issued Licenses. Furthermore, though clarity of writing is very vague on this print, it seems to me that these instructions are in relation to imposition of sect.144 as well. Plz do CORRECT me if I am wrong here.  As far as MOI licences are concerned, my initially listed observations in the begining of this thread have already concluded this question. Before asking Abbas as well as our mods to close this thread as concluded, I would suggest fellow members to come up with comments, as to how far we have come to the core of this issue.

I mostly love guns in black & metal (stainless steel) body. So guyz plz help me out in choosing one.

Any weapon excellent for one role may not be very suitable for another role.\n\nAsk yourself some basic questions like, what would be the primary use of this weapon, this is the most important question which must be answered before deciding to purchase your weapon. Would you be the sole user or your family (spouse/ children/parents/siblings) would also be using it in your absence?\n\nWhat is your budget? among reliability, durability and accuracy which is most important (should be dictated by the basic purpose)\n\nGo to the market, and look up all the available weapons, ask all the intelligent and stupid questions. take notes.\n\nIf this is going to be your HD weapon, you might consider a heavier, large fram, all steel gun. They are durable and have lesser recoil compared tolighter ones. A quick second shot is easier and better. longer barrel will have a longer sight radius, thus more accurate as compared to smaller ones. Will have higher capacity magazines, etc\n\nIf you plan to carry it 24/7 or something like that, then you a smaller, lighter, polymer frame for IWB carry. Or you may prefer an even smaller (mouse) gun for pocket carry.\n\nDo you want an external safety or Decocker or none? You want SA or Da or SA/DA ? fixed barrel or rotating barrel or tilting barrel ? are you left handed/ do you want a gun  with ambidextrous controls?\n\nShort list  a few based on the purpose and your preferences and then ask for the members feed back regarding their good / bad points, reliability, accuracy, maintenance etc\n\nthis my humble and sincere opinion, you may however disagree and you know you have the right to do so, and I respect that.\n\nbest of luck in your find.', 0, 1, '115.186.142.6', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 1099, 24914),

Sorta like golf in-fact...a cheap set of clubs costs between 50 & 70K whereas each ball is 40 and above (though you can reuse em)....\n\nI''d treat the hobby as such and charge premium pricing for issuing a license and make it easy and convenient to get it...I mean why not have a person apply and take 15K minimum for normal cases and 20K for fast-track cases. \n\nOnce the form (and only the form) has been submitted, their own people run around and get the due-diligence and ancillary paperwork completed....I mean hey given the situation why not have the FIA do a background check for the first time (we are after all responsible citizens and gun users are we not) and then issue the license within a month. Subsequent licenses should take two weeks or less time as the clearance has already been done.\n\nBut I guess bureaucracies and the status-quo just suits too many players so nobody will actually do it, and I guess this idea is just an exercise in intellectual masturbation...\n\nOh btw I realize this has nothing to do with the subject...just thought I''d hijack the thread for this single post...sorta like the Somali pirates :P[/quote]', 0, 1, '116.71.62.230', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 536, 24938),

The art of hunting a prey with falcons is called Falconry. Some falcons are small and can hunt down birds where as some falcons can hunt and retrieve big animals like deers and wolves. I am actually fascinated with this animals intelligence and beauty.

DO NOT leave\nnickel or chrome plated guns in this solvent for LONG periods of time\n!! The red dye in the Marvel Mystery Oil will soak into the pores and\nleave a yellowish cast to the finish. As I said it is fine for\ncleaning nickel/chrome just don''t leave it in the cleaner for 2 months\n!! ;)\n\nCleaning night sights is o.k. I haven''t seen any problem with Triticon\netc..

It has no effect on stainless steel I can see. \n\nWhen the cleaner gets cruddy: I just let it sit and pour the cleaner\noff the top into another container leaving the crud in the bottom. I\nlet the solvent evaporate off the crud and then dispose of rest\nwrapped in newspaper in the trash.

My interest in these birds has recently been on the peak and ive been on the hunt for them. \nAs for the Sakers size benchmark, my relative comparison was with other falcons and is related to the sizes. Exquisite means beautiful as in i find it more beautiful then others and as ive spoken to a few people who get these Sakers imported for people they told me that these are the most preferred species.\nA Golden eagle has different kinds and one of it is a Steepe eagle. There are others like tawny eagle, spotted eagle, harpy eagle etc.\nI read about the Gyr being the most wanted in the UAE at this website when i was searching for some pictures. [url]http://www.photolosophy.ae/details.php?gid=78&sgid=&pid=135.[/url]\nAbout the crore rs. thing again the importer whom i spoke to told me to forget about the Gyr as it is very difficult to find and very very costly.\n\nSee the thing is that i do not have adequate knowledge about these birds. I saw them at a friends place and found them very attractive and beautiful birds. Again i spoke to a person who imports these on order and has adequate knowledge i suppose. The information was a mix from the web and the first hand info i received. I wouldnt want to defend myself if im wrong nor would aggressively prove that im right but please for the sake of sharing information i would kindly request you to use a bit relaxed tone and correct me where im wrong, not start pin pointing about my sources and questioning me. We are all here to learn and starting this topic was not to give out information but to receive information on my part.

But one thing is sure. Somebody is feeding you facts mixed with fiction. More of the latter than the former.\n\nSakers are the second largest of all falcons, with gyrs being the largest. So a saker is NOT a small bird by any yardstick. \n\nGolden eagle is a species in itself,  and the steppe eagle is a different species altogether.  The golden ios the most widespread of all true eagles (Genus: Aquila) and it found in Asia, Europe, North Africa,  and North America. There are different races amongst the Golden eagle , and the "daphanea" race of Asia is the largest of all. \n\nThe problem with gyrs is that they do not tolerate heat very well, and even our winters are too hot for them, and most gyrs die because of the combined effects of stress, heat, humidity and the resulting disease therefrom.\n\nThis importer you talk about, where does he import these from? Did he tell you that or give you a hint? \n\nHaving said that, falconry is nopt just a hobby or a sport likie shooting.

You have official coverage through the representative of Diana in Lahore Pakistan that helps in after sale issues. \n\nThoroughly read manual of the P1000 and comply with instructions. Use dust proof / fog proof pouch to house the gun. Pump have to have moisture management system. Avoid to fill it early morning when moisture in air is the highest and its dew point is close. Though you can fill 300 bars but better stay at maximum 250. It will elongate the age of cylinder as well as seals and valve. After filling the bottle keep it vertically in such a way that its filling port facing ground for an hour or so. Then hold the bottle in hand in the same direction and release a little amount of air with the help of degassing bolt. This will release moisture condensate instantly. Now you can fit the bottle to the gun. Detach the bottle when the gun is not in use. Keeping the pressurized bottle intact put unnecessary pressure on the internal components of the gun.\n\nYou have ample choice of scopes that can be used on P1000 but keep weight in mind besides other features. I am using hawke panorama scope and pretty glade with it. I am not happy with its factory fitted sound moderator. Its baffle holes clearance is high and the distance between baffles is not acoustically efficient. Suppressor of HW100 works very good on P1000 if you manage to fit it through some precised adapter of 1/2 inch UNF thread. \n\nDo not entangle yourself in in doing research on pellets, just use JSB 16gr, 18gr or H&N barracuda match in P1000.\n\nWell after doing a lot of comparative analysis I still suggest that P1000 is a better choice in the available brand new stuff in Pakistan from price, performance, maintenance and the aesthetics point of view. Otherwise passion is passion and there is no limit to it.\n\n\nRegards', 1, 0, '202.125.154.50', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

The problem is with the sanctions on exports of certain caliber items to Pakistan. All shotguns and .22cal firearms don''t fall in this category so we pay the most reasonable price for these firearms. All pistols, revolvers and rifles(boltaction, semiauto and auto) greater than .22cal are restricted categories from EUROP and NORTH AMERICA. Thats why these are so expensive and scarce. Some dealers who still legally import these firearms have contacts in other countries from where they manage to get these firearms reexported and charge the price whatever they want.

My gun was made right infront of my eyes, they even threw in a 28inch hunting barrel with screw in chokes. lemme say it again: awesomely manufacturered thing.\n\nat the range:\n\nwell, i''m not much of a hunter but i''m totally into skeet. i''m gonna make it short by saying that i''ve personally fired 200 shots in a single sitting without giving the gun a single moment to cool down. and the gun functioned flawless. the barrel was so hot, u could probably light a cigar off it. but the thing just kept on kicking. it gets even more interesting, i thought why not get the barrel tested for surface flaws, u know, with my links it was easy to pull off, the barrel was tested using ultrasonic surface testing and eddy current testing. absolutely flawless after 200 rounds. boy!.\n\n200 rounds might not sound alot but remember it was 200 consecutive bangs in a single sitting. the only rest was involved when the tube magazine was being loaded for another round of punishment. note: there were no cleaning intervals, the barrel was not cleaned during the whole session.\n\nat my brother''s wedding:\n\nme and my cousin fired a total of 150 rounds of SG (00 buck shots). again, no intervals, no resting and cleaning the barrel. she was hot as hell but kept on kicking.\n\nabout the pattern:\n\ngot me a stats genius and we patterened the gun, well, pretty good (it met industry standards), i''m not gonna say awesome, but better than the turkish ones we bought along for comparison. i still have the results with me, and can post them too, both for the short/standard 22 inch barrel and for the custom/28 inch barrel. the stats guy even made me a complex equation by which i can tell where/how will be the pattern at any given distance and choke.\n\nas time passed:\n\nI got me many shotguns now, and now i''m also well experienced in turkish (sarsilmaz, hatsan, volcanic) and russian baikal mp 153.\n\nguess what: at my range, i''m the only guy with Daudson pump and guess what? my club members gladly ask for my gun when they forget to bring their foreign guns, knowing its performace and durability.\n\nand to date, i cannot even count the cartridges i''ve fired, to give an idea: i fire 200-300 rounds a month with my pump. my foreign semi autos are nothing more than cabinet queens now, they just sit and collect dust. I also give/lend them to friends i cannot trust with my precious daudsons pump.\n\nconclusion:\n\nForeign made guns are expensive and probably of higher quality and probably safer to use however my daudson is dirt cheap and definately safe to use. in a contest of "probably" vs "definately", "definately" wins hand down.\n\nRegards.', 0, 1, '58.65.188.203', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 414, 25921),

The gun powder decomposes into both water soluble and oil soluble reredue..while oil does a good job in removing the oil soluble impurities it does not dissolve logically the water soluble compounds  for the same reason water was used.

According to a Pakistani military industry source, the contract was signed last year with the arms export company, China Precision Machinery Import-Export Corporation.\n\nThe initial procurement is a battalion-level system primarily for testing purposes. According to the needs of the Pakistani military, additional imports are also likely.\n\nThis is the first time for China to export the A-100 MLRS to a foreign country. South Asian military industry analysts believe that Pakistan’s procurement of the A-100 is in response to India’s acquisition of the Russian Smerch, or Tornado, MLRS. Both the Smerch and the A-100 are 300-mm calibre rocket launch systems.\n\nIn 2001, India signed a contract with Russia to purchase US$450 million worth of Smerch MLRS, which made their first appearance at India’s 2008 National Day military parade. A source from the Chinese military industry claims that the Smerch’s maximum range is 90 kilometers, while the A-100 can fire its latest submunitions as far as 120 kilometers. After being fitted with a simplified strike correction system, the A-100’s strike accuracy is increased to 33 percent.\n\nThe Pakistani military is considering a possible transfer of production site for the A-100 out of China. However, at the current stage, Pakistan will continue to import the system, according to the military industry source.\n\nSome international analysts are of the opinion that the A-100 and the AR-2 300-mm MLRS produced by Chinese manufacturer Norinco are both imitation versions of the Russian Smerch MLRS. But the manufacturers of the A-100 and the AR-2 insist that these three types of MLRS are completely different. Neither the A-100 nor the AR-2 can fire Smerch rocket munitions, nor do they use the same propellant rocket motors or components.\n\nIn addition, China is now undertaking technological and structural upgrades of both the A-100 and AR-2 multi-rocket launch systems. These upgrades may include replacing their tube-shaped launchers with box-shaped launchers, as the former are much more expensive, cannot be quickly and easily reloaded and are more difficult to maintain. The similar AR-1 MLRS, which are fitted with box-shaped launchers, no longer require transloaders to load the rockets.\n\n--\n\n(Andrei Chang is editor-in-chief of Kanwa Defense Review Monthly, registered in Toronto, Canada.)\n\n\n[url]http://www.upiasia.com/Security/2008/09/25/pakistan_imports_chinese_rocket_launchers/3978/[/url]', 0, 1, '118.103.235.228', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 489, 25980),

In many aspects, the system is very similar to the Russian Smerch 9K58 300mm rocket system. Its rocket is fitted with a primitive guidance system for greater accuracy. In 2002 the rocket system was spotted in service with the PLA 1st Artillery Division in Guangzhou Military Region, possibly for trial and evaluations.\n\nPROGRAMME\n\nChina reportedly received a small number of the Russian Smerch 9K58 300mm, 12-tube multiple launch rocket system and its ammunitions in 1997. The Smerch 9K58 system is capable of firing a ''smart'' submunition that has a dual-colour infrared sensors for terminal guidance, which enables the rocket to achieve accuracies previously difficult to achieve with unguided rockets of that range. The submunition is fitted with kinetic energy fragment warheads which are said to be able to penetrate 70mm of armour at an angle of 30° to the normal.\n\nChina National Precision Machinery Import and Export Corporation (CPMIEC), a trading company that market Chinese missile and defence technologies to foreign customers, revealed the A-100 300mm, 10-tube multiple launch rocket system in 2000. The system was developed by CALT, which is famous for its ChangZheng (Long March) family of space launch vehicles and DongFeng family of ballistic missiles. The A-100 system is CALT''s first attempt to break into the tactical weapon market. The A-100 development possibly began in the late 1990s and the weapon was spotted in service with the PLA 1st Artillery Division in Guanbgzhou MR in 2002.\n\nCPMIEC claimed to have developed a range of rockets with ranges between 40km and 100km, but the actual effective range of the weapon may be around 85km. The A-100 rocket is fitted with a primitive guidance for greater accuracy. The PLA''s acquisition of the A-100 system demonstrated its interest in upgrading its artillery with "deep strike" tactics and capabilities. Combined with advanced intelligence, surveillance, target acquisition, and reconnaissance (ISTAR) capabilities and "smart munitions", the A-100 would enable the ground forces to defeat large armoured formations at "beyond-visual-range".\n\nLAUNCH VEHICLE\n\nThe launch vehicle is based on a TAS5380 8X8 wheeled truck chassis developed by Tai''an Special Vehicle Manufactory. The vehicle weights 21t and has a maximum load of 22t. The vehicle has a maximum road speed of 60km/h and a maximum range of 650km. The vehicles has a gradient of 57% and a fording depth of 1.1m. The vehicle is equipped with four hydraulically operated stabilisers which are lowered in preparation for the rocket launch. 10 launcher tubes mounted on the chassis are arranged as two blocks of four (top) and six (bottom) tubes.\n\nThe vehicle is fitted with a GPS to provide real-time positioning data. A computerised aiming system collects meteorological and other parameters from various sensors and automatically calculate the trajectory for the rockets. The system could complete the process of target setting and pre-launch examination for all 10 rockets within 90 seconds and launch all 10 rockets within 60 seconds. The system is capable of both single and salvo firing.\n\nAMMUNITIONS\n\nThe A-100 fires 300mm rocket powered by a solid propellant rocket motor, with a firing range of 40~100km. The A-100 rocket is 7.3m in length and weights 840kg. The rocket carries a 235kg warhead, and is stabilised by spin, thrust, and stabilising fins. It is fitted with a warhead containing 500 HE-FRAG (High Explosive Fragmentation) anti-armour/personnel submunitions. The submunition can penetrate 50mm of armour, and has a blast radius of 7m. The submunitions have a spreading radius of 100 +/- 40 metres.\n\nThe rocket consists of the warhead and fuse, a thrust stabilising system, a rocket motor and the tail section. The rocket motor is a single chamber, solid rocket motor with an advanced hydroxy-terminated polybutadine (HTPB) composition rocket propellant. The stabilising fins are folded inside the launch tube and open once the rocket leaves the tube.\n\nThe rocket is equipped with an onboard computer to help correct the horizontal and vertical deviations. During the first three seconds of the rocket''s flight, the onboard computer detects the horizontal difference between the programmed trajectory and actual status of the rocket, and controls the rocket''s stabilising thrust system to correct the rocket''s flying direction. The onboard computer corrects the vertical deviation by adjusting the warhead detonation time so that the submunitions are spread with a high accuracy.\n\nGROUND EQUIPMENT\n\nThe ground equipment comprises a rocket launch vehicle, a transport and loading vehicle, and a firing command vehicle. A rocket system battery is equipped with one firing command vehicle, 6~9 rocket launch vehicles, and 6~9 transport and loading vehicles.\n\nThe command vehicle is mounted on a 6X6 truck chassis. It is equipped with a radio communications and data transmission system; a firing and control computer and simulation trajectory system; and a global positioning system. It collects the meteorological information, calculate the trajectory and transmits the data to the firing units.\n\nSPECIFICATIONS\n\nRocket calibre: 300mm\nRocket length: 7,300mm\nRocket weight: 840kg\nWarhead: 235kg, ~500 submunitions\nFiring range: 40~100km\nReloading time: 20 minutes\nLaunch vehicle road speed: 60km/h\nLaunch vehicle travelling range: 650km', 0, 1, '118.103.235.228', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 489, 25981),

The Burraq UAV is named for a winged horse creature in Islamic tradition, similar to Pegasus.\n\nAccording to local news reports, Pakistan is focusing its unmanned aircraft efforts on upgrading various older UAVs with Chinese help.\n\nBut the sources note that no domestically produced UAV is large enough to heft both a missile and a targeting system. The military’s most capable UAV is the air force’s Selex Galileo Falco, which can laser-designate targets for other platforms but cannot deliver munitions.\n\nOfficials with the Ministry of Defence and Ministry of Defence Production here refused to confirm or deny the program’s existence. A spokesman for the military’s Inter Services Public Relations said it was “not ready to give a statement on the issue at this time.”\n\nOne former air force officer said the notion of a Pakistan-developed hunter-killer UAV is credible.\n\n“You only have to see our track record,” said Kaiser Tufail, a retired air commodore. “We have some fantastic achievements in the field of defense.”\n\nTufail said Pakistan needs such a weapon. Anti-terror operations on the frontier require “hours and hours of round-the-clock reconnaissance,” married with the ability to strike quickly when a target is spotted, he said.\nHelp from China?\n\nAnalysts were more dubious about Pakistan’s ability to produce a laser-guided missile, but they noted that help might be found in China or Turkey.\n\nTurkey, with whom Pakistan has an agreement to cooperate on UAV development, is seeking an armed UAV, preferably the Predator or MQ-9 Reaper. This UAV may someday be armed with the UMTAS infrared guided anti-tank missile being developed by the Turkish firm Roketsan to arm the T-129 attack helicopter.\n\nPakistan could simply produce China’s new CH-3 unmanned combat air vehicle, “or co-produce any number of Chinese components to assemble a unique UCAV,” said Richard Fisher, China specialist and senior fellow at the International Assessment and Strategy Center in Washington.\n\n“China has also developed the unique AR-1, a 45-kilogram, laser-guided attack missile, apparently designed specifically for light winged or helicopter UCAVs,” he said.\n\n[url]http://www.airforcetimes.com/news/2009/05/airforce_UAV_050909/[/url]', 0, 1, '118.103.235.228', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 489, 25983),

Pakistan would have legal control over another 50, 000 square-kilometres into the Arabian Sea.\n\nPakistan’s mission to the United Nations in New York had filed a claim for extension in its continental shelf from 200 nautical miles to 350 nautical miles to United Nations Commission on the Limit of Continental Shelf (UNCLOS) on April 30.\n\nThe ministry of science and technology (MoST) was involved in the preparation of the claim for the last couple of years. The National Institute of Oceanography (NIO), an autonomous organisation of this ministry, was entrusted with the task to prepare the claim in accordance with UN requirements. The case was prepared and submitted to the Pakistan mission in New York last month.\n\nUnder the UNCLOS, Pakistan already has an Exclusive Economic Zone extending up to 200 nautical miles.\n\nThe United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) was adopted in 1982 and came into force in Nov 1994. Pakistan ratified the convention in Feb 1997. The Convention entered into force for Pakistan on March 28, 1997.\n\nAlthough the government submitted its claim just two weeks before deadline, Science Minister Azam Khan Swati was all smiles when the announced the news. “It’s a historical conquest. The benefits will be limitless,” he said.\n\n“We gain a substantial area of more than 50, 000 sq/km with another 150 nautical miles into the sea,” said Azam Khan Swati.\n\nListing benefits, the minister claimed that the data acquired during the project would provide a reliable and firm database and foundation, essential for future marine research and exploration of living and non-living marine resources.\n\n“It will also provide a good basis for out scientists/technicians to further promote and develop the marine geological and geophysical research and survey capabilities. The project will contribute directly to the petroleum and mineral sector in general and to the offshore maritime industry/market,” Azam Khan Swati said.\n\n“Elsewhere in the world, deepwater fan and deltaic systems are of great interest to oil exploration companies. After the survey we conducted, it is safe to say that Pakistan’s waters are rich in coal deposits and there is plenty of oil and gas,” Azam Khan Swati said.\n\nThe minister said that as many as 29 countries have filed claim for extension and May 13, 2009 was last date for submission of claim.\n\nIndia has not filed claim for extension of its continental shelf so far, he added.\n\nHe said it was a historical moment that owing to timely efforts by the ministry and other stakeholders, Pakistan would succeed to extend its continental shelf.\n\nThe minister said that Pakistan has 200 nautical miles an Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) which now would be 350 nautical miles.\n\nHe said that substantial area of more than 50,000 square kilometres has been gained after extension of the continental shelf.\n\nAzam Swati said that this would contribute directly to the petroleum and mineral sector in general and offshore maritime industry in particular.\n\nHe said this would also provide a reliable and firm database and foundation for future marine research and exploration of living and non-living resources.\n\nThe minister said that by analogy, elsewhere in the world, deepwater fan and deltaic systems were of great interest to oil exploration companies.\n\nOil and gas developments in sediment-rich margins were clear indicators of potential for the Indus Fan, he said.\n\nThe UNCLOS was adopted in 1982 and came into force on Nov 16, 1994.

I''ve seen a few of their purely defense products and boy! they are freakishly awesome. when i was there, they introduced me to these two south african gun specialist which they had hired to design a 9mm pistol for them, i''ve seen the prototype, they even offered me to fire it, but i''ve always been afraid of hand guns, so naturally i refused. the gun kinda looked like a glock, all polymer based construction. the gun design has been finalized but the south african guys were there to draw up an assembly line for them.\n\nas far as high powered and lower powered, well as i said earlier, daudsons used to had many product lines when they used to focus only on small arms. their product line has shrunk considerably since then but they are more focused on large defense contracts.\n\nabout the load, all daudsons pump action shotguns are test fired on a magnum load cartridge, I''ve inquired about it, its a normal 2.75 inch cartridge but with 30% additional load to check the integrity and safety of standard barrel.\n\nBottom Line:\n\nfor all practical purposes, DSA only produces a single pump action shotgun, but in two different shapes (infact same shape just two different barrel nuts). both are same. infact, if i''m not wrong, my friend bought a DSA recently, and the dealer told him that ''dsa shooter'' is no longer made. its pretty common for a good businessman to focus on more profit oriented projects then to sell few toys a year to a couple of buyers.\n\ni still remember Nooruddin''s reply: it goes something like this: "if it were upto me, i would stop making small arms and focus only on the large defense contracts, i''m only making them cause it was the profession of my forefathers even before the british occupation and i dont want to be the generation that ends it." then he asked me a question: "do you really think that i''ve acquired all that sophisticated CNC machiness and automated lathe machines just to make a few dozen pump action shotguns a year?"

I havent seen 08 in Pakistan as of now.\n\nand if u shoot skeet/hunt often, then i would recommend stay away from external chokes, but if u fire steel shots often then external chokes are awesome. actually external chokes are installed internally too, they just protrude a bit out of the barrel to give an imperssion of external chokes. my 07 has both internal flush mounted chokes and external chokes (they are actually called extended chokes).

Beretta, Remington, Winchester and many others failed at less than 20,000. in case of a Baikal, the test was stopped cause they couldnt destroy the gun even at 50,000 rounds. dont even ask me about turkish guns, they all failed at less than 10K rounds.\n\n[b]for those who think turkish guns are made as per european standards[/b]\n\nIts quiet funny, do u know turkey is not even a signatory to CIP. their guns arent even proof tested,   still they write "barrel tested at 1200 psi" on their barrels when there is not even a single proofing house in whole of turkey. CIP are the foremost, infact the only comprehensive gun safety standards in europe and turkey isnt a signatory to it but yet they are made as per european standards, who are they kidding?\n\n[b]About Baikal[/b]\n\nRussia is a signatory to CIP. their barrels are proof marked, CIP proofing tests are carried at Izsmash/Izhvesh (execuse my spelling) proofing house which is the largest in Europe.

Mossberg Maverick\n3. Daudsons Shooter Pump Action shotgun (a mossberg 590 clone)\n\n\nFrom the list, u can see that I''m basically a Mossberg design fan. there are few things that i believe are best in a mossberg weapon system.\n\n[b]1. Cartridge Elevator[/b] stays folded (out of the way) while loading the gun, a very cruicial advantage while loading the magazine tube during a firefight. same thing also helps in loading the magazine in aimed position.\n\n[b]2. double cartridge extractors:[/b] very dependable, will snatch any struck cartridge out of the chamber. imagine yourself in a hostile situation with an evil cartridge struck in the chamber.\n\n[b]3. lose tolerances[/b] in the action and bolt assembly: ok! i''ll admit that it causes the whole gun to rattle but its very important as it increases the reliability of the whole weapon system. it compromises on the accuracy part, but we are talking about a shotgun so accuracy is secondary thing.\n\n[b]4. Tang safety:[/b] perfect for safety-on, safety-off routine. in any hostile situation, this kinda small stuff matters alot.\n\n[b]5. two+long action bars:[/b] absolute must if you want a highly reliable action that minimizes feeding problems. it also minimized short chucking, any pump guy knows what a menace short chucking is and how it plagues the hearts of men (my shakespeare side just woke up). down boy! go back to sleep.\n\n[b]6. serrated forearm:[/b] another absolute must if u want to keep your sweaty grip on the forearm specially when huge amounts of adrenaline is pumping through your veins.\n\n[b]7. ghost ring sights:[/b] they are considered a must for home defense, specially usefull if your into slugs, very important for quick target acquisition, however i dont like them, I''m too used to a bead sight now that my mind gets confused when peeping through the ghost sights. conventional rifle sights will do too.\n\n[b]8. tactical configuration of the forearm.[/b] you will notice that mossberg''s forearm extends a bit far out. this aids in fighthing and prevents the gun from being snatched from the owner''s hands. however this feature is a huge turn-off in hunting as it kinda fatigues the left arm pretty easily. (i''m assuming the shooter is right handed).\n\n[b]9. Mossberg''s can be tricked out[/b] to a degree that you wont even be able to recognize it after installing after-market accessories such as:\n\n              1. butt-stock side saddle (my personal favorite, currently using/installed)\n              2. receiver mounted shotshell holder\n              3. tactical lights: a must have, my next project\n              4. heatshield: Rambo looking but i dont see a point\n              5. fiberoptic sight for plain barrels (my personal favorite, currently installed, aids in target acquisition in low light conditions, plus it is freakishly scary on a plain barrel.)\n              6. tactical pistol grip with stock: now this is important, my next project ;)\n\nhope it helps.\n\nRegards.', 0, 1, '58.65.191.249', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 495, 26663),

DSA pump''s barrel is actually designed on old european barrel standards. meaning the barrel is cylinder at 18.4mm or 0.724inch inner diameter. new age cylinder diameter is at 0.729inch or 18.52mm. and ultra modern like beretta, winchester, browning, remington (actually mostly US, european are a bit reluctant to follow) are using overbored (US term=backboring) barrels of diameter 0.740 to 0.745inch thats in metric terms cames out to 18.8mm to 18.92mm.\n\nwhy? well, smaller diameter barrels ensure tigher wad seal and hence more powerful shots delivered at target, but after the introduction of plastic wads the diameter was opened out a little cause plastic wads are more efficient at sealing. the open bore increases the shot velocity and lowers pellet deformation.\n\nand now the ultra new age US theory: they say, backbored barrels are even more efficient as they reduce recoil, reduce pellet deformation and give better patterns.\n\n[i]the US theory to date has not been proven by any test. there is no evidence that it acutally does all that. however since target/competition shooters are finiky, highly superstitious and are willing to spend big bucks, they''ll try anything that promises them better patterns. i''ve read somewhere that even beretta said that they are backboring because of the demand not because they support it.\n[/i]\n\nRegards.', 0, 1, '58.65.188.197', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 495, 27195),

The guns are made in Turkey on Beretta''s old machinery hence giving Beretta like quality at an attractive price point.\n\nThe pistol itself employs a rotary barrel locking mechanism which in a nutshell makes firing more accurate.\n\nAs for the answer to your question if it has more recoil, yes it does but only when the pistol is brand new. Put about 100 or 200 rounds though it  and the springs will become softer and the recoil will become smooth and better than most pistols. \n\nThe 24/7 is a great looking pistol but I would never carry it with me for self defense.

And that a better way to oil your gun instead is get an expert gunsmith do internal greasing. \n\nHope i''m able to clear the question.[/quote]\n\nnever ever go for grease in a gun, lemme say that again, ABSOLUTELY NO GREASE. now comming to your question: oil seeping into the wood will cause it the swell, will cause it up to soften up and will cause it to crack under pressure, yes, that is a universial problem with any kind of kind of wood and oil combination, even water can cause wood to do all sorts of nasty things.\n\noiling of the receiver and its internals are absolutely necessary, but the trick is to open up the boxlock/sidelock receiver of a double barrel, apply oil lightly and use compressed air from air cannister (available at general hardware stores) to blow the excess away. and before storing the gun in its usuall position, it is recommended to stand the gun upside down (barrel facing down) for a couple of hours so that any excess oil would run into the barrel instead of the buttstock. this problem is not only associated to my oil its a universal problem.\n\nsecond: grease is highly recommended on the chokes and barrel hinges, dont use grease on any part where rapid movement is involved, grease slows down the action of firing pin, it slows down the cycling rate if used in the action of a semi auto. plus, grease can collect dirt, debris and carbon, turning into a lapping compound that eats away the metal. u dont want your gun to wear out prematuraly.\n\nthere is a reason why a car engine is lubricated with oil instead of grease and ball-joints and axles are lubricated with grease. grease is simple oil mixed with a suspending soap to convert it into a semi-solid form from the liquid form of an oil. car engine is a high speed machine (hence oil lubricated), ball-joints and axle are slow speed but high pressure machines (hence grease lubricated). ever noticed what happens to a ball joint, axle, universal joint (commonly called goda in pakistan) whose rubber boot gets punctured. dirt and carbon mixed with grease forms a lapping compounds which eats the goday in no time. hence it is recommended to replace a broken boot as soon as possible along with changing of the goda grease.\n\nwith that explaination now u know why chokes tubes are highly recommended to be lubricated with grease (moly grease only, go to any auto parts store and buy one, it is black in color). choke tubes are stationary objects that simply sit in their desired position and face high barrel pressures. oil under such pressure will squeeze out of the choke threads and will cause the choke tubes to be stuck in permanently, any guy who uses shotguns knows that getting a stuck choke out is a painful proceedure (for the operator and the gun).\n\n[quote]Would this damage polymer or plastic parts ?[/quote]\n\nit will harm polymers only if you use industrial strength acetone instead of paint thinner, other than that, it will not harm polymer as long as you dont leave it on a polymer part for a long time. I''ve been using it on wood and polymer for quiet a long time now and i''m totally satisfied. my friends are totally satisfied whom i''ve recommended and are using this mixture, my oil however is totally safe, use it blindly.\n\nI can post complete technical details of my oil and how it offers additional benefits than WD40, hoppes and militec oil. it is a different topic altogether. however i will say this: a quiet alot of research and physical tests were conducted on my oil before I started using it and recommending it.\n\nRegards.\n\np.s. about the effectiveness of the solution is concerned, i''ve turned my heavily used barrels in brand new barrels with this. i''ve won a bet with the elder brother of a friend of mine, he dared me to clean his 1950s steven dbbl. the gun was previously cleaned using conventional methods: a bore snake and a dab of WD40. i used bore light to show that bore was dirty as hell, even though using conventional way (looking through the bore with one eye closed while aiming at a light source) of inspecting bore was showing clean/mirror barrel. once i was done, the barrel was shinning so much u couldnt even tell if it was ever used. tears came into his father eyes after seeing the barrel so brand new. he remembered his father (my friends grandpa) and how much he cherished this gun.', 0, 1, '58.65.189.131', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 1189, 27513),

Sir! slugs are not supersonic, they fly at around 1400-1600 fps. atleast ten times slower than a rifle, up side is that at slow speeds there are less deflections to a projectile, downside is that the projectile suffers from rapid loss in terminal energy and velocity as the distance traveled increases.\n\nhumidiy, windspeed and temperature are more important factors in long range sniper/rifle shooting because the projectile is a spitzer round flying at supersonic speeds (e.g. 7.62 nato caliber bullets breaks the sound barrier as soon as it leaves the barrel). there was this episode on myth busters (discovery) where they fire multiple bullets in a swiming pool. all rifle bullets were destroyed, only shotgun slugs made it through the colum of water. why? because slower moving objects resist more and keeps moving, whereas a rifle bullet (high speed projectile) gets easily deflected and breaks into smaller parts.\n\never wondered why a swiming pool looks green/blue when water is essentially colorless. \n\n[i]lemme explain, light is made of different colors with different frequencies. higher frequency color (e.g. red) doesnt penetrate that deep, whereas lower frequency color (e.g. blue/green) penetrates alot deeper. thats why deep end of the swiming pool always looks green.[/i]\n\nnow u know why shorter frequencies (hence higher wavelength) radio signals travel the farthest and face less distortion than higher frequency signals.\n\n\n7. yes! you are right about the shorter flight path, i''m only aiming for 100 yards, which is quiet short compared to 300-3000 yards of a rifle bullet. do u know that a round ball (commonly called punkin ball) travels to 100 yards easy but totally loses accuracy. foster slugs were designed to exceed that range with reasonable accuracy. and that is exactly why they are so famous around the world for their accuracy (for a slug ofcourse) and range (for a chunk of lead ofcourse).\n\n8. highly curved? hmmm.... I think you meant parabolic, yes, i would have to agree to that, its flight path will be highly parabolic, buts thats in the very nature of slow moving slugs. as far as curved path is concerned, a curved bullet is an urban myth, featured in a hollywood movie called "Wanted". other than that it is only an urban myth there is no real proof that a bullet can be curved.\n\nI hope i''ve answered all your questions.\n\nRegards.', 0, 1, '58.65.188.145', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 1209, 27701),

No, the the loudest sound in world is the audible ''''click'''' you hear when you''re expecting a ''''bang''''. In a deadly force situation this is when things get really interersting, fast.\n \n                           When that blaster in your hand goes click instead of bang you have a choice. You can either fix it, get it back up and running rabidly or you can stand there staring at it like a hog looking at a wristwatch. How long do you have to clear a stoppage in a gunfight? You have the rest of your life. How long your training and how quickly you act.\n\n                                                             The Problem\n\n         From a technical standpoint, a stoppage is any unintentional interruption in a guns''s cycle of fire. While the cycle of fire varies slightly from gun to gun, the most common stoppage is ''''failure to feed, failure to fire.'''' In many training circles this is referred to as a ''''Type 1 Malfunction.'''' Although it''s difficult to put a number on it, the Type 1 is the culprit nine times out of ten.\n \n         Failure to feed, failure to fire can include any number of factors. The chamber might be empty, as in, you did not properly load the weapon or the magazine has come unseated and it''s sticking out an eighth of an inch. In some cases there may be a problem with the magazine itself . The ammunition may have shifted or been loaded in the mag improperly. Of course the magazine spring might be stuck, kinked or not working properly.\n\n                                                            Second Strike?\n \n        Another factor in the failure to feed/fire is the ammunition itself. A rond was indeed chambered but did not ignite for some reason. While this is extremely rare, it happens. Yes, the majority of ammunition that did not ignite on the first primer strike will often ignite with the second one.\n\n        There are a number of gun manufacturers and firearms trainers out there that extol the virtues of the ''''second strike'''' handgun, the double-action (DA) or double-action-only (DAO) pistols that allow you to press the trigger a second time even though the round has not ignited. On the surface this sounds like a good idea. I rarely wear my X-Ray vision glasses when I shoot and i cannot peer though the steel of the slide and barrel to see whether or not there is round that needs a second strike or if the chamber is completely empty.\n\n       When i am expecting a bang and instead get a click, i dont''t know why that happened. If the magazine has come unseated and a fresh round was not chambered or if i fouled up and did''t load the chamber, then a second, third, fourth, etc. trigger press isn''t going to help out much. Remember, stoppages are unexpected occurrences that take us by surprise everytim\ne. \n        For the sake of argument, let''s say that you are sure that a round was loaded into the chamber and are determined on performing that second strike. In my current occupation, i work with over one hundred new shooters a month and we expend thousands of rounds of ammunition. During the last four weeks i''ve had students turn in rounds  of ammunition that were duds; they did not go off at all with several strikes.\n \n        If our students have a Type 1 they immediately clear it. If a round didn''t ignite it ends up on the ground . As instructors, we will later inspect it and, if it only has a slight primer hit, we will put it back in the training box. During two instances this month even after a second primer strike, the round would not ignite.\n                                                                The Fix\n\n         For the semi-automatic pistols the steps are bit more complex but not exceedingly so. After all, it''s not rocket science. we call the fix ''''Tap, rack, reassess'''' Yes, it used to be ''''Tap, rack, bang'''' but  we were teaching our people to snap the trigger the moment they clear the stoppage. Not a good idea for those who need to justify every round fired.\n\n         Before you start a working on/fixing your gun, bring it back toward your body. This is your work area and where human beings are most comfortable using their hands. The easiest way to do this is simply pull the elbow of your shooting/strongarm into your ribs. keep the pistol held up in your chest area. This keeps your head and eyes up, versus looking at the ground. \n\nSTEP 1: Tap the magazine. It may not be properly seated; make it so.\n\nSTEP 2: Rack the side firmly and deliberately to the rear. Let it go; avoid the habit or \n             temptation to ride slide home with your hand on it. Belivee me, the recoil \n             spring knows what to do; it doesn''t need your help sending the slide home.\n\nSTEP 3: Reassess the situation. Is the threat still present? Do you truly need to fire or  \n             continue firing? Is the target where it was two seconds ago? \n\n          Lethal force ecounters are fast and furious events and they are extermely dynamic. In the second or two it took you to clear your stoppage the threat may have moved out importantaly, a friendly, no-shoot person may have moved into your line of sight.\n\n          If u have dummy rounds or ''''snapcaps,'''' they are fantastic training tools to aid in your practice . Take a few dummy rounds to the range and randomly load them into your magazines. It needs to be random so you aren''t looking for the stoppage. After a few training sessions the ''''Tap, Rack, Reassess'''' should be second nature.', 0, 1, '195.229.236.218', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 1216, 27796),

Taurus PT92 &PT97 are totally different than the original one. All who kno a bit about it can differentiate. Taurus PT series has so many problems and complains, I feel it is not even worth buying. and Sir, FS 92 is also not worth buying for the price it is available in our country, especially after the decdreased prices of Glock.[/quote]\n\n@Khanzada .. with due respect i beg to differ sir.. PT92 and 99 are exact copy of the 92fs.. they are made on the same design,machine and blueprint as the 92fs with certain extras added. Of all the taurus PT 92 and 99 are the only two series that does NOT have issue. As for your comment about 92 not worth buying, you are entitiled to your opinion but 92fs/glock are two weapon worth buying id say glock would be # 1 and close 2nd would be the 92fs. and if you do not want to dish out the bigbucks and want something identical to 92fs then the PT92/99 are your best bet. I have fired almost 1500 rds from my pt99 no fte/ftf. abbas may have fired more and will vouch for the gun .. and Taurus recently acquired the weapon and has no issues. So your analysis of the pt92/99 is way off in my humble opinion ofcourse\n\nTaurus International\n\nIn 1980, Taurus International purchased the Beretta factory in Sao Paulo, Brazil. In this purchase they acquired all the equipment, staff, and designs necessary to manufacture a number of firearms, most notably the famous Beretta 92. Starting with the original design, Taurus improved on it immensely, one of the results being the Taurus PT-99 Pistol. These additions include a drop hammer forged ordnance grade alloy frame for increased strength and a three-position frame-mounted ambidextrous safety. Overall, the Taurus PT-99 is an excellent pistol necessary for these modern times.\n\n\nSome review for your reference\n\n[url]http://www.gundirectory.com/more.asp?gid=20265&gun=Pistol[/url]', 0, 1, '203.81.209.14', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 1220, 27891),

On the contrary, it will only escalate the crisis to unforeseen heights."\n\nUN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon''s chief of staff, Vijay Nambiar, is due to visit the Sri Lankan capital Colombo to make a last-ditch attempt for a negotiated end to the war.\n\nThe Tigers, whose fighters are said to wear cyanide capsules to be taken in case of capture, this week again refused to surrender or to free civilians, while the government rejected calls to pause its assault to protect the people.\n\nPrime Minister Gordon Brown called for an immediate end to fighting and said Sri Lanka "must understand that there will be consequences for its actions".\n\nPrabhakaran began his fight for a separate state for Sri Lanka''s minority Tamils in the early 1970s, and it erupted into full-scale civil war in 1983.\n\n[url]http://uk.news.yahoo.com/4/20090516/twl-tamil-tigers-are-defeated-41f21e0.html[/url]', 0, 1, '115.42.72.29', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 489, 28015),

I hope now it is clear.\nIn my opinion the caliber # 2 (.22) is batter option for target practice. The range of caliber # 2 around between 250 to 350 feet. It is more powerful rather then caliber # 01 (caliber # 01 is for beginners and children)as well as you can use it for birds hunting (if your target is too good). There is no need of license for Air Gun and you can buy from any armourer''s shop at “Lucky Star”. The scope is not included, you have to buy separately if you want. But scope with Chinese Air Gun is not recommended by me because the range is not so sufficient.

The idea of Semiautos was conceived to utilize the reverse motion of the gun to 1- automatically cycle the slide to feed a new round in the chamber and 2- to reduce the recoil by channeling that energy to move the slide back and cycle a new round. All handguns, SMG''s and machine guns are recoil operated. How that recoil is used, is what we call innovation and development.\n\nMakarov is a simple blow back gun. The energy of the blast in the form of expanding gases pushes the bullet out of barrel and at the same time forces the slide to cycle backwards to feed anew round, the only thing resisting the backward movement of the slide is the recoil spring. If the recoil spring weakens beyond acertain limit the slide willbreakout of the frame and hit your face, hence it is very important to replace your  weak recoil spring on time.\n\n9mm Para on the other hand can not be fired from a simple blow back design, becasue it is a much more powerful round and some form of resistance in addition to the spring is required to slow/ delay the slide cycle. this is achieved by various different designs which include Delayed blow back, delayed roller blck , rotating bolt, rotating barrel, tilting barrel, and gas piston system etc.\n\nAll these methods use the blast energy for the rearward movement of the slide but use mechanical means to either slow it down or dealy it till the gas pressure drops to a safe level enough to cycle the slide. Gas piston also uses the same blast energy which pushes a piston backwards in to a built in cyclender which because of compressed air in the cyclender.\n\nGas/ piston system is mostly used in SMG''s and full auto weapons because it is more reliable (based on natural phenomnon, compression of gas) then with mechanical system which depends on metal parts. As the auto weapons are subjected to more working pressures at higher frequency, chances of mechanical part failure becomes higher thus gas piston system becomes more reliable and easy to maintain. \n\nHandguns on the other hand are not subjected to high frequency rapid fire, thus the mechanical system performs reliably.', 0, 1, '115.186.142.7', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 1239, 28627),

Bennelli autoloader shotgun product range\n3. Stoeger autoloader (turkish)\n\n[b]Advantages:[/b]\n\n1. cleaner action/receiver, no carbon depsits\n2. good reliability if properly serviced\n3. ease of cleaning, no carbon, no fuss\n4. simpler design\n5. light weight\n6. hey! comparing any shotgun to Browning A5 is nothing short of sin, it coined the "autoloader" term that we know today.\n\n[b]Disadvantages:[/b]\n\n1. some what sensitive to loads, a load must provide a certain level of kick/recoil to ensure a reliable operation. any lower and the action will not cycle.\n2. more recoil when compared to a gas operated shotgun\n3. recoil operated guns are more weight sensitive as well, if u alter the weight of the gun, the recoil gets altered (lighter gun more recoil, heavier gun less recoil). altered recoil can cause severe cycling problems.\n\n[b]Gas Operated:[/b]\n\nfirst autoloading gas operated shotgun was produced in 1963 by Remington as Remington100, it is to-date the largest selling and one with the most fan-following shotgun in the world.\n\nIn a gas operated gun, the power of the gases produced during firing is utilized to cyle the action. when a cartridge is fired, a portion of the gases is bled to a piston assembly which gets pushed back under the force of the hot gases. the piston then pushes the bolt back and cycles the action(eject spent cartridge and load fresh one).\n\n[b]Examples: [/b]\n\n1. Beretta A391\n2. Browning\n3. Winchester\n4. Remington\n5. Baikal\n6. Hatsan\n7. Sarsilmaz\n8. infact most of the autoloader shotguns made across the globe are gas operated shotguns\n\n[b]Advantages:[/b]\n\n1. considerably more reliable then a recoil operated shotgun, there must be a reason that there are more gas operated guns in the world then recoil operated, infact recoil operated guns are pretty much on the extinct species list.\n2. newer design, harnesses the power of extra gases. hence more efficient\n3. reduced recoil, there is no doubt about that!\n4. faster cycling speeds, hence the most used type of autoloader shotgun in skeet/trap competitions.\n\n\n[b]Disadvantages:[/b]\n\n1. Carbon/burnt gun powder deposits everywhere, nasty!\n2. higher cleaning requirements\n3. complex design, difficult in assembly/disassembly\n4. heavier in weight when compared to recoil operated shotguns\n\n\n[b]Summary:[/b]\n\nIn my opinion, comparing a recoil operated shotgun to a gas operated shotgun is the an age old debate. many have tried to tame this beast of a question but to-date there has been no concrete "jimmy over sally" type solution. in the end it all falls on one''s personal taste. if u like a recoil operated shotgun, you will always be more inclined towards a recoil operated shotgun. If u like a gas operated shotgun, nobody will be able to convince u otherwise. \n\nhowever if you believe in the herding principle (where a sheep is supposed to follow other sheeps, safety in numbers sort of philosphy) then i would suggest go for a gas operated shotgun.

Don''t do that! girls unlike boys are no Natural to weapons therefore to get them familiarized \n\n\n[b]STEPS THAT I TOOK[/b] \n\n1) I started off with a TOY BB GUN ------------ This will help in getting them familiarized with Guns, magazines, chamber, slide and the loading mechanism. Once there is familiarization load some BBs and let them fire at a target (maybe a toy etc). Let this practice go on for a few days and once you are satisfied that everything is fine and going under control. TEACH THEM NOT TO POINT ANY GUN AT ANY ONE (whether a toy or not) unless they are sure at what they are shooting.\n\n2) Once the TOY GUN phase is passed... get an AIRGUN ; repeat the same procedure and so on so forth\n\n3) Now you are ready to go on the THE Real Guns and live rounds. Get a .22 Handgun. Its both effective and has less recoil and it may help to improve self confidence of the ladies and it doesn''t give out much bang and is easy to control.\n\n___________________________________________________________________________\nYOU MUST TEACH THEM FIRST THE RULES OF FIREARMS SAFETY AND WHERE POSSIBLE USE DUMMY ROUNDS IN THE TRAINING PROCESS\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------[/quote]\n\nDear All \nAssalam-O-Allaikum\nNicely brief, I am 100 % agree with you pashasahab, I am trying to teach my wife now a days.

There are few issues in one of your previous posts that are beyond my comprehension. I am talking about your post that you posted on 15-05-2009(point 6).\n\nIn that post you mentioned the velocity of slugs As between 1400-1600 fps and termed this velocity subsonic. To my understanding speed of sound is 1125 fps when the air is dry and temp is 20C. In this case, slugs move way above the speed of sound, and are supersonic, so, they are prone to face all hurdles that supersonic projectiles face.\n\nAnother issue in the same discussion is that slugs do not move at the 1/10th of the speed of a rifle projectile. Because almost all the rifle projectile(except some special purpose rifles) move with the velocities well below 4000fps e.g 5.56 NATO 3100fps, 7.62x39 2700fps, .22 hornet 2100fps, .17hmr 2200fps, .22lr 1000-1500 fps.\n\nIn the end, there was a little discussion about the light spectrum. To my understanding red colour has the lowest frequency and the violet has the highest. Green and blue come just below violet in frequency table, so, these both have much higher frequency as compared to the red. While in that discussion conclusion was different.\n\nHope our discussion will help in bringing up many positive points.', 0, 1, '125.209.109.98', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 1209, 29284),

As you know hunting knives come in many sizes, shapes and styles, such as folding knives and fixed blade knives making selection difficult. We will attempt to give you information that will assist you in this task. Below we discuss styles, blade types and options that we think are important.\nThe first thing to take into consideration when purchasing a hunting knife is "what is the purpose of the knife". Are you after meat for the table or a trophy to mount in your den? Your answer to these questions will dictate the type of hunting knife and blade style you will need.\n\n[b]KNIFE STYLES[/b]\n\nFolding Knives\n\nFolding knives are strong enough for most hunting , camping and fishing needs. They come in two main types, Lockback and pocket knives. Lock back knives have a release mechanism that secures the blade in the open position. They have the strength and reliability of a fixed blade knife and allow one handed opening when dressing game or cleaning fish. Pocket knives are much like the lockback knife but are more compact for easier carrying. However they do present a safety issue since they can close while working.\n\nFixed Blade Knives\n\nFixed blade knives have a straight rigid blade and are generally the more rugged , reliable and easier to clean of the two. They are also easier to access. However fixed blade knives tend to be bulkier, heavier, and potentially dangerous if not handled properly.\n\n[b]BLADE STYLES[/b]\n\nDrop Point Blade\nDrop point blade is the most popular for hunting knives. It has a curved blade that drops into a point giving added strength to the tip. The design of this blade allows for full use of the knife''s edge when cutting, rather than just the point.\n\nClip point\nThe clip point blade is thinner and flatter than the drop point blade. This gives you greater control over the knife and the cutting and slicing process will become easier.\n\nSkinning Blade\nThe skinning blade has a round, blunt shape suitable for skinning and gutting game. Its shape makes it difficult to accidentally damage the skin or meat of the animal.\n\nGuthook Blade\nThe Guthook blade gives the user better control when cutting into the abdomen preventing accidental puncturing of the intestines, bladder or stomach.\n\nFillet Blade\nThe fillet blade is a long, flexible, thin blade making it ideal for filleting or cleaning fish. They come in single or multiple blade styles.', 0, 1, '116.71.219.75', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 1286, 29374),

Its loaded with 36grams of shots and has a roll/disc crimp infront instead of standard star crimp, with this cartridge you can get the loudest bang there is. \n\nwhy? because of heavy shot load and roll crimp. in my experience, roll/disc-type crimps produce louder bangs and kick like a mule.\n\nRegards.\n\n[i]p.s. why this interest in louder cartridges? dont you love your hearing ability?[/i][/quote]\n\n\nErr.. how does one go about measuring the chamber of his weapon?', 0, 1, '119.73.64.74', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 1207, 29409),

Not only did we change caliber ( a subject that is still open for debate ), we\nadopted a completely different operating system with a double-action/single-action (DA/SA) design. \n\n           I was a young US Marine when this changeover took place and i still remember the noise that went on in the ranks and in the firearms world in general. Gallons of ink and reams of paper were sacrificed during the debate over .45ACP versus 9mm , and the M1911A1 versus\nM9. Before we move one sentence further into this review let me make it clear, I am not going \nto re-fight that war.\n\n           So what is the point: why revisit the Beretta M9 ? Because, like it or not, at the moment there are literally tens of thousands of M9 pistols in the hands of our troops around the globe. All the editorials, reviews, or carefully crafted letters in the world aren t going to change the fact that as these words are put to paper, the predominant sidearm of US Military is the M9 Beretta pistol.\n\n           I carried the M9 for a few years during my tour of Afganistan and i will be the first to admit that after i left Corps i did not carry one again for many years. Only a few months out of the Marines, I entered the police academy and during my career as a cop i carried a number of sidearms, but not the M9 or its civilian counter part the Beretta 92FS.\n\n           Last year i had cause to reconsider the M9 service pistol.  As a member of a small arms and tactics training team, one of my jobs is to train US troops with theM9. For the first time in more than a decade i had to closely examine not only the characteristics of the pistol, but how to best operate the gun in close quarter combat.\n\n           To date i have worked with hundreds of servicemen and women, and have run across the same arguments, issues and axcuses that i heard 20 years ago. The first thing shooters will do after they perform poorly on the range is to blame their equipment. Experience had taught me that, only on the rarest occasion is the equipment at fault. '''' Operator error '''' is by and large the number one reason for failure.\n\n           I remember one admonition from our senior firearm instructor when i was a police academy cadet. A young officer complained that she couldn''t hit the target because there was something wrong with her pistol. the instructor took the pistol and with a single hand held it upside down. After putting a full magazine into the center of the target he handed the pistol back to the shooter and advised, '''' There ''s nothing wrong with this gun.'''' The implication was obious. It''s not the gun. it''s you. \n\n           As asmall arm instructor i have put literally thousands of rounds of ammunition through the M9 service pistol during the last years. while i hate to give the bottom line up front, the fact is that these guns are tough and reliable. They consume magazine after magazine of hot M882 military ball ammo and keep coming back for more.\n\n           In my own little corner of the world, we put shooters through much more than the standard pistol qualifications course. Our students shoot hundreds of rounds on paper and steel silhouettes each week. They must shoot single- and weak-handed, perform rapid reloading drills and fire from awkward positions. In a nutshell, these pistols are run hard.\n\n\nGun Details\n\n\n\n            The current Beretta M9 service pistol is definitely a full-sized handgun. Many have criticized the choice  of a DA/SA action. This criticism aside, the fact remains that it was this ''''first shot double-action'''' feature that allowed the ''''big military'''' to allow its men and women to do something they were prohibited from doing up until its adoption: carry a pistol with a round chambered and the safety on.\n\n             What many people fail to realize is that the standard practice before the M9 was to carry the M1911A1 pistolwith the hammer down on an empty chamber and magazine inserted. It was not until the introduction of the M9 with its DA trigger and active decocking mechanism that the ''''powers that be'''' allowed the troops to walk around with '''' loaded'''' pistols.\n\n             considering specifics, the M9 Beretta service pistol has 4.9-inches barrel with an overall length of 8.5 inches. This duty gun holds 15 plus 1 rounds of 9mm. The pistol is finished in Beretta''s Brunition matte black, non-reflective coating. Sights are fixed, but the rear is drift adjustable. As mentioned, the mechanism and the decocker/safety is mounted on the slide.\n\n             From a technical standpoint the M9 has short recoil, delayed locking block system as oppossed to a straight blowback. In addition to the manual safety lever, the pistol includes a passive firing pin block. When a round is chambered, the extractor protrudes and acts as a loaded chamber indicator. \n\n\n\nTraining\n\n\n              Another change took place with the introduction of the new pistol. Rather than merely conducting slow-fire, marksmanship training with their handguns, the US military srarted training with their pistols in the same manner as their rifles. Whan i first entered the service, the only live-fire training we did was to fire our .45 pistols slowly at paper bull''s-eye targets. When we adopted the M9 we actually began shooting plastic silhouette targets . Drawing from holster became a part of the qualifications process, as opposed to old .45 ranges where weneed drew from the holster with live rounds in place.\n\n              Today''s training is light years ahead of what it once was. We conduct shoot from cover drills, movement drills, and even transition training where shooters rapidly transition from along gun to their secondary weapon, the M9.\n\n               During my own range time i worked with a number of commercially manufactured loads from Carbon, Remington, and Winchester. Over a period of two to three weeks i would hit the range several times. In addition to slow-fire and chronographing, i ran numerous drills from the holster. My holster of choise for this project was BlackHawk SERPA drop leg rig . Over the last few years i have found the SERPA drop leg holster to be fast, secure, and reliable .\n\n               To add some realism to my training i invited a training partner along. Tactical Ted accompanied me to the range for this project. Tactical Ted is a three dimensional plastic target available from law Enforcement Targets, Inc. I dressed Ted in an old shirt and he was ready for\ntraining.\n\n\nPERFORMANCE\n\n\nLoad                                                   Velocity                                         Accuracy\n\n\nCorbon DPX                                         1213                                               3.50\n115+P\n\nCorbon Pow''R Ball                                1386                                               4.12\n100+P\n\nRemington                                            1208                                               3.75\n115 FMC\n\nWinchester/USA                                   1179                                               3.25\n115 FMJ\n\nWinchester                                            1257                                               2.75\n115 STHP +P\n\n( Bullet weight measured in grains, velocity in feet per second (fps) by shooting Chrony, and \n  accuracy in inches for 5-shot groups from 25 yards ) \n\n\n                                           \nFinal Notes\n\n\n                    Many years ago a shooting instructor of mine advised the class to ''''run what you bring .''''

That tool is the 9mm Beretta pistol . As an instructor it''s my job to help students focus not on ''''whats ifs'''' but on the here and now.\n\n                   Beretta''s M9 can be learned and operated by any sized shooter.

They said the authorities concerned did not properly advertise the ban, resulting in several citizens wasting their time in contacting the Home Department or the district coordination officer concerned. The ban was imposed on issuance of new non-prohibited bore arms licence last week. The already approved applications will remain pending as the authorities concerned are verifying and compiling the number of arms licences within each district. A senior official of the Home Department said the department had launched a campaign against bogus arms licences, adding all licences issued in the past were being verified by the department. He said Home Secretary Nadeem Hassan Asif had imposed the ban until the completion of the verification, adding it would take about 40 days. Sources said the department, on Chief Secretary Javed Mehmood’s directions, banned issuance of arms licences for district Kasur (the officer’s home town) one month ago. staff report', 0, 1, '119.160.11.227', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 536, 29493),

(25172, 944, 25017, 'm1carbine', 216, '', 1243255718, 'here is the detailed report of m1carbine.\n\nThe M1 carbine is an interesting little weapon. The original request for a compact and lightweight shoulder arm to replace service handguns for second-line (non-fighting) troops was first issued by US Army in 1938. The idea behind this request was that a shoulder arm, such as carbine, firing ammunition of moderate power, will have more effective range and will be much simpler to train the users to fire it accurately, than the standard .45 caliber semi-automatic pistol or revolver. This request was probably the first recognition of the need in the Personal Defense Weapon in the modern sense. Request was shelved for some time and re-issued in 1940. It included the new cartridge of .30 caliber but of power far less than of US general issue .30-06 ammunition. The cartridge, officially named the "cartridge, ball, .30 caliber, M1", was developed by the Winchester company. It was a straight-case, rimless design with round-nose bullet weighting 110 grains (7.1 gram) and muzzle velocity of 1860 fps (~ 570 m/s). Muzzle energy was about 2 times more than of .45ACP pistol cartridge but still almost 3 times less than of .30-06 rifle cartridge. In the modern sense the .30 carbine cartridge can be called an "intermediate" but the lack of the muzzle energy and round nosed bullet limited the effective range to about 200 meters or so. Anyway, it had still much longer range than any pistol round of its time, along with moderate recoil. Many companies submitted their designs for US Army trials but the winner eventually became the Winchester. The design of the Winchester carbine is often contributed to the David "Carbine" Williams, who was the developer of the gas system. But, according to some sources, this carbine was born as a spare-time hunting carbine project of some engineers at Winchesters'' workshop, and, when military request appeared, this design was resurrected and adopted for intended use. In any case, Winchester began to deliver its first carbines to the US Government in the July, 1942. Some other manufactures also were selected to produce the M1 carbines, such as Inland Manufacturing Division of the General Motors Corp., Underwood-Elliot-Fisher Co., Saginaw Steering Gear Division of the General Motors Corp., National Postal Meter Co., Quality Hardware & Machine Co., International Business Machines Corp (IBM), Standard Products Co. and Rock-Ola Co. During the period of 1942 - 1945 total of more than 6 millions of carbines were manufactured. Since 1944, the only companies still manufacturing M1 carbines were Winchester and Inland. After the end of the WW2 production continued for some time, and M1 carbine and its variations saw some serious action as a first-line weapon not only during the WW2, but also during Korean and early stages of Vietnam war. M1 carbines also were widely exported by US Government to numerous friendly nations, mostly in South-East Asia. M1 carbines saw limited use in the post-war West Germany and France. It should be also noted that M1 carbines are still manufactured by various small US companies for civilian sales, using both military surpulus and newly made parts. Large numbers of surpulus M1 carbines also were sold at the civilian markets in the post-war period.\n\nIn general, M1 Carbine was a really compact and handy weapon. It was lightweight and short enough to be more suitable for jungle combat, than a full-size battle rifles such as M1 Garand. It also offered relatively high practical rate of fire due to large-capacity, detachable magazines and low recoil. The M2 modification, which had a select-fire capability and a magazines of larger capacity (30 rounds, interchangeable with the older 15-round ones), could be described as an "almost an assault rifle" ("almost" is added due to the lack of effective range). Had Americans a little trouble to soup it up slightly in the terms of power and range, they could have a true assault rifle 20 years before they actually did, and probably with much less headache. But they did not, and M2 was manufactured in relatively small numbers and was mostly used during the Korean war. Another modification was the even more compact "paratrooper" version, M1A1, with side-folding metallic buttstock and a pistol grip. This version also was produced in limited numbers. The last modification was the M3, which originally appeared as an experimental prototype T3. It was no more than a M2 select-fire carbine, fitted with special mounts to accept night-vision sighting devices (IR sights). Intended use was as a short-range, night-time sniper rifle. M3 also was used in Korea and, probably, Vietnam.\n\nIt must be noted that during the war in Korea M1 carbines received some bad fame due to reliability problems in extremely low temperatures and also due to underpowered cartridge, which was sometimes unable to effectively penetrate the thick winter uniforms of North Korean and Chinese soldiers at extended ranges.\n\nTechnically, M1 Carbine is a gas operated, magazine fed, semi-automatic or select-fire (M2) short rifle. It uses the short-piston stroke gas operated action, designed by D. Williams. Gas piston is located under the middle of the barrel and has a travel of about 1/3 inch (8 mm). When gun is fired, the powder gases are bleed from the barrel into the gas chamber and propel the gas piston violently to the rear. The gas piston thus gives a sharp blow to the operating slide, which is located inside the stock and is linked to the rotating bolt, more or less similar to one found in M1 Garand rifle. The bolt has two forward lugs that locks into the receiver walls. The safety on all M1 carbines and variations is located at the front part of the triggerguard. On the earliest carbines the safety was in the form of the cross-bolt push-button but latter it was replaced by the lever-type switch, because in the heat of the combat the safety button was sometimes confused with magazine release button, located next to the safety. The fire mode selector on the M2 and M3 was located at the left side of the receiver. The cocking handle is permanently attached to the operating rod. Sights on the earlier M1 carbines had a flip-up rear diopter (peep-hole) with settings for 150 and 300 feets, and later rear sights were replaced by drift-adjustable diopter. Carbines were issued with sling and sometimes with additional pouch that was mounted on the buttstock and allowed to carry two spare magazines on the gun itself. Early M1 carbines had no provisions to mount a bayonet, however, some older models had bayonet lugs on the barrel.', 0, 1, '203.82.55.18', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 1314, 30101),

Roda only took Manton & Co., as their serious competitor. and that indicates that LYON & LYON were closed down by 1930s!!!! around 70 t0 80 years back waterfowling in india used to be a BIG BONANZA and scoring 700 birds in morning flights with 5 to 6 guns was a normal case and longer barrels and chokes were in common use!

For your information it was invented by Col George Vincent Fosbery VC in the late 19th century, it was thus named because of the "paradox" implicit in the design, being neither a true smoothbore gun nor a true rifle. Those Paradox used to have that V sight wtih range leaves!\nI asked you about the spellings because in that era some of the manufacturers tried to earn fame in the name of REAL ones like Westley Richards is genuine Westely Richards.....Another gun maker of the same era by the name [b]W.R. Richards [/b]is not Westely Richards.....[b]J.P. Clarrough & Bros.[/b] tried on the original [b]J.P.

They have served me well too.[/quote]\n\nI absolutely agree with you sir but somehow i''m not comfortable with the idea of hunting with swiss army knives. they are multipurpose alright and can be used for survival/lost/marooned on an island kinda situations i''ll agree however they are not strong enough to be dedicately used in hunting. we are talking strictly talking about hunting knives right? atleast thats what it says on top of this topic.\n\nhere''s a thing: next time tune into discovery''s survival man, the guys is professional stuntman and a survival specialist. he carries an ordinary folding knife.\n\nallow me to  post the picture of my trusty blade:\nits an Schrade''s OLD TIMER. a simple folding knife with hammer forged stainless steel blade and brass handle. heavy as a rock but very strong. i''ve done some tasks with it and it proved that it was money well spent. tasks that totally ruined genuine ka-bars and bowies. my blade''s down side is that its blade even after many years of abuse is still so sharp that i have to handle it with care cause it can easily chop a finger off in no time.\n\n[url=http://www.postimage.org/image.php?v=gx1hVNrJ][img]http://www.postimage.org/gx1hVNrJ.jpg[/img][/url]\n\ncheck this out: its blade is so sharp, most of the time, ye shikar ko haram kar dayta hai, it totally decapitates/chops the neck off the shikar with only a little extra force.', 0, 1, '58.65.191.245', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 1286, 30547),

The reason is that it has blade that can be sharpened to a razor edge, and that knife can also has a saw, screwdrivers, corkscrew, bottle opener, toothpick, tweezers, wire cutter, etc. I have used all these applications at one point in time or the other, and am not worse off for it. \n\nFurthermore, no knife stays razor sharp forever, it has to be kept razor sharp. Being old fashioned in more ways than one, I prefer a 60 year old oilstone to sharpen my knives. If you make a good edge the first time round, then subsequently all you ever have to do is gently glide the blade over the lightly oiled stone in a few smooth and shallow strokes, alternating the sides of the blade as you do so.  Once the blade is sharp enough to shave the hair off your forearm without snagging on your skin, you are good to go hunting.\n\nHaving said that though, the best throat slitter I have ever had is an Italian Lion Steel folding knife with a 4.5" blade. That knife is sharp enough to slice through a hare''s neck in one draw, with minimal downward force and even bigger game such as gazelle require nothing more than a mere acknowledgment of gravity to make them lawful for you to eat. \n\nAll said and done, a knife is something very personal, whatever has worked best for you, is the best there is. \n\nLast but no the least here are the links to two of the knives that I so ardently admire.\n\n\n[url]http://www.victorinox.ch/index.cfm?site=victorinox.ch&page=161&lang=E[/url]\n\n\n[url]http://www.worldknives.com/products/lion-steel-pattada-molla-26cm-folding-pocket-knife-ls625co-1972.html[/url]', 0, 1, '202.70.147.76', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 1286, 30585),

Most misses are caused by stopping the barrel’s swing to and through the target as the shot is fired. Longer barrels assist in smooth swing follow-through, and also provide the increased sighting plane needed for longer shots. Remember that with the advent of choke tubes, almost any length barrel can have almost any degree of choke. Big game hunters who use slugs now have the best of both worlds. The traditional Foster-type rifled slug, a weight-forward lead projectile with a hollow base and side vanes, has been greatly improved. And the relatively new sabot slugs, when fired from a fully rifled barrel, can result in awesome accuracy at incredible distances.\nOTHERWISE! If one has to compare the pros and cons of longer barrel Vs Shorter Barrels then;\n\n[b]Longer Barrels[/b]\n\nPros: Longer sighting plane, less noise, less muzzle flash, less recoil.\nCons: Harder to maneuver with, heavier weight.\nLonger shotgun barrels are generally best suited to hunting and other sporting purposes, such as trap, skeet, and sporting clays. These longer barrels provide a longer sighting plane, which makes it easier to accurately aim the gun. This is because the sights are further apart along the length of the barrel, and it is more apparent when the sights are correctly or incorrectly aligned on the target, compared to a shorter barrel. Longer barrels also produce less noise and muzzle flash. This is because the pressure inside the barrel has dropped to lower levels by the time the projectile(s) exit the barrel. There is also less recoil on a gun with a longer barrel, since the added weight of the barrel reduces recoil. Some people will claim that longer barrels will result in increased muzzle velocity, but this is generally not the case. An 18? barrel is sufficiently long to allow the gun powder to burn and accelerate the projectile(s) to their top speed, and for the pressure to drop to the point that using a longer barrel doesn’t add velocity to the projectile. In fact, when shooting sabot slugs from a rifled barrel, excessive barrel length (perhaps beyond 30?) could result in additional friction between the projectile and the barrel, reducing muzzle velocity. The cons of a longer barrel are reduced maneuverability, and added weight. The reduced maneuverability is a prime concern for home defense shotguns, which is why I recommend an 18? barrel for home defense shotguns. A 30? barrel would be harder to swing around in close quarters, and would be easier for a home invader to grab the end of\n\n[b]Shorter Barrels[/b]\nPros: More maneuverable, less weight\nCons: Shorter sighting plane, more noise, more muzzle flash, more recoil\nShorter shotgun barrels are best suited to home defense shotguns. The shorter length allows the user to maneuver the shotgun more freely. I recommend an 18? barrel, which will allow the shotgun to be swung with ease, but will still maintain the full ballistic performance one would expect from a longer barrel. The cons of shorter barrels are the increases in noise, flash, and recoil. As the projectile exits a shorter shotgun barrel, the (relatively) high pressure gases are released, causing more noise than there would be with a longer barrel. This extra noise can be a nuisance to neighbors, or be seen as a violation of etiquette when trapshooting. Similarly, there is an increase in the muzzle flash, which can also affect the night vision of the shooter or those nearby. Shorter barrels generally weigh less, which means the shotgun will recoil a bit harder than it would with a longer barrel. For these reasons, a longer barrel is generally better for sporting purposes.\n\n[b]Conclusion[/b]\nPick the shotgun barrel length that is appropriate for whichever shotgun activity you have in mind. Changing a shotgun barrel is no harder than cleaning the shotgun, and can be done by the user with no tools required. I encourage everyone to buy multiple barrels for their shotgun, and enjoy the use of the proper barrel for each shotgunning discipline.\n\nCourtesy learnaboutgun.com :)', 0, 1, '210.2.140.76', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 1353, 30924),

Handguns are nowhere near as effective as rifles in combat, but they still have their uses, so this matter is relevant for troops. The bullets from handguns are much slower (about half as fast) than rifles. \n\nA number of nine-millimeter service pistols are in service. In general, these pistols weigh around two pounds, are  about seven-and-a-half to nine inches long, with a barrel about four to five inches long, and usually hold anywhere from 12 to 18 rounds. There are several 9mm pistols in wide service, that can be considered candidates for the best in class.\n\n\nThe Browning Hi-Power (or GP35) is in service with the United Kingdom, and carries thirteen rounds. The British have used this pistol for decades, and it was what the SAS carried in the takedown of six terrorists at the Iranian embassy in 1980. It was designed by the legendary John Moses Browning (who also designed the famous Colt M1911 and the Browning BAR). There are no real bugs in this single-action design (the operator must cock the pistol before the first shot can be fired). This design has been around for a long time, and  was widely used by forces on both sides of World War II.. It will be sticking around for a long time to come, continuing in service around the world.\n\nThe U.S. military primarily uses the Beretta 92 (designated the M9). It is a double-action design, which does not require cocking for the first shot - but there is a long trigger pull for the first shot, and a short pull for the second shot (an operator does have the option of cocking the pistol). It has a clip of 15 rounds, and drew controversy when it replaced the M1911, a .45-caliber (11.4mm) pistol.\n\nGermany''s Heckler and Koch makes the USP, which comes in nine millimeter, .40 S&W (10mm), and .45 ACP. It comes in a choice of double-action or double-action-only (which requires a long trigger pull each time). The nine-millimeter version in service with the German Army has a 15-round clip.\n\nPerhaps the most notorious nine-millimeter pistol is the Glock 17. This pistol was designed by Gaston Glock and has spawned a family of over twenty pistols in various sizes. The Glock 17 is in service with Austria and Norway, and Glock has a huge following among law enforcement agencies around the world, albeit not all of them use nine-millimeter (the FBI, for instance, uses the Glock 22 and Glock 23 in .40 Smith and Wesson). Aside from its polymer frame, the Glock''s other feature is its ability to function like a revolver - to operate it, one just has to aim and pull the trigger.\n\n\nThe nine-millimeter round is kind of weak, especially in the full metal jacket configuration required by the Hague Convention. As a result, the United States Special Operations Command has used the Mk 23 SOCOM, a variant of the USP that fires the .45 ACP round and has a 12-shot clip. The .45 ACP''s full-metal-jacket round is felt by many to perform much better in combat situations. The Marine Corps uses an upgraded M1911 called the M1911 MEU(SOC), which has an eight-round clip. American law enforcement agencies use a variety of pistols, from makers like Sig Sauer, Colt, Springfield, and Smith and Wesson. The American law enforcement scene also uses a variety of calibers besides nine-millimeter, not just the .45 ACP, but also the .357 SIG, .40 S&W, 10mm Auto, and the new .45 GAP.\n\n\nThe best of these nine-millimeter pistols is probably the Glock. It is a simple pistol, and very reliable. Glock has done some pretty extreme torture tests on the pistol, and it has continued to perform. The Glock is also widely used, so in the case of a failure, spare parts can easily be acquired. It has worked well in its twenty-two year history for numerous military and law-enforcement customers. It has arguably become the standard by which other pistols are to be judged. \n\nSource:[url]http://www.strategypage.com/htmw/htweap/articles/20070209.aspx[/url]', 0, 1, '116.71.209.204', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 1360, 31096),

MP5 is still being used by number of Army''s and special forces around the world simply because it''s the best and most proven weapon when it comes to CQB. The only difference between our MP5 and the one''s you see elsewhere is that they aren''t upgraded with dot sights and a retractable butt. \n\nThe reason why our army uses MP5 is because MP5 is designated for our officers who lead the men into battle. Officers throughout history have been known to carry pistols and sidearms as their primary weapon. Instead of sticking with the old methods, now we have automatic SMG''s for our officers in shape of the MP5. \n\nAlso, the MP5 is used by our Tank and armoured crew. Due to it''s small size, its easily accessible and a proven weapon. Kinda like how Russian vehicle crews use the AK-74U.\n\nAs far as G3 is concerned, It''s a proven, reliable and battle ready weapon. And POF has the license to build it which makes it cheaper for us to deploy. You''re wrong when you say that the G3''s never been used in any war. \n\nhere''s a list of conflicts where G3 proved its worth.\n\n---Portuguese Colonial War, Rhodesian Bush War, Carnation Revolution, Cambodian Civil War, Iran–Iraq War, Salvadoran Civil War, Turkey-PKK conflict, Sierra Leone Civil War, Ethiopian Civil War, Operation Enduring Freedom/ISAF - Afghanistan, Second Gulf War---\n\nPakistan army requires a full scale battle rifle due to the nature of its requirements. Our soldiers are trained on this platform and it will take some time for us to switch our troops from the G3 to another rifle. \n\nBut I have good news for you. There''s a probability that Pakistan''s indigenous produced PK-8 rifle packing the 556 round with stock dot sights will replace the G3. \n\nAs for the AK, well, we DO use the AK for our special forces and its still being used by Infantry. The Type 56 Chinese variant of the AK-47 is still being used by the Army but for limited purposes. Army''s are supposed to be professional. They cannot rely on simply ONE weapon (AK in this case how you suggested) that''s why we have a range of different weapons for the military which serve their purpose and will continue to do so.\n\nRegards, \nBezerk', 0, 1, '99.235.226.40', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 1370, 31619),

So officially, only those trophies are recognized which have been hunted legally after paying the proper Govt fees & permits and the hunts are processed through legal international formalities (like CITES export permits {Conference of International Trade of Endangered Species} in collaboration with local wild life law enforcement agencies of every country) .... etc.\n\nSo officially, the Blandford Urial which my friend Corey Knowlton shot in Balochistan will soon become the next world record when it will be presented to the SCI (Safari Club International) measuring and certification committee after a couple of months. Currently the existing world record of Blandford Urial is 34 Inches (i don''t remember its total score but it is less than Corey''s) although, Corey''s Urial is 33.75 Inch, it will become the new world record because the bases of both horns (which are 9.75 to 10 inches) are much thicker than existing world record.\n\nPlease note, while measuring the trophy the following intenationally recognized formula is used.\nFirst total length of each horn is measured eg: Left 33.75 inch, Right 33.50 inch, Total= 67.25 inches.\nThen circumference both horns are measured from their bases eg: Right 10" + Left 9.75" Total = 19.75\nThen circumference of each horn is measured after every 4 inch of length & total is added to get the final score. \n\nSo the total figure becomes official score which is recorded in SCI world record book. At times, people lose their world records for just a fraction of an inch or sometimes a millimeter ... but that''s what the competition is about. \n\nIn order to become an "Official Master Measurer" one has to qualify an extensive formal training course and then practice for a very long time before becoming a "Master Measurer" which is considered as a great title/honor so it''s  quite a difficult job because there are so many animals (with horns & without horns) in the world and each animals has a different criteria of measurement (Carnivores & some species of Antlers pose greater problems) so it''s a tough job. \n\nTo know more about SCI which is the world''s largest hunting organization, you may click on \n[url]http://www.scifirstforhunters.org[/url]\n\nTo see their trophy measuring details and criteria ... click on\n[url]http://www.scifirstforhunters.org/conte[/url] … ent_id=105\n\nThe world''s second largest hunting organization is Grand Slam Ovis which can be seen at\n[url]http://wildsheep.org/[/url]\n\nThe current official world record of Sindh Ibex is of Mr. Chris Boddington from USA which is 45 inch (I don''t know the toal score)  ... but I''ve never heard of the 49 inch long horn of any Sindh Ibex dead or alive ! or Urial which is 39 inch ... but like you said ... let''s wait & see when the taxidermist finishes his work at Koh-e-Kaaf !!! .... lol. \n\nBy the way the unofficial world record of Punjab Urial was the one at Lahore Zoo whom I personally measured last year at 37.5 inches ... but the poor fellow disappeared from the zoo in a strange manner ...!\n\nAnd here is Corey''s new pending world record Blandford Urial ... See how the tips of both its horns has made holes in its jaws and penetrated over two inches through the jaw bone ... I''ve yet to see such an amazing ram !\n\n[img]http://i560.photobucket.com/albums/ss46/pakistanguides/corey_blandford_L1.jpg[/img]\n\n[img]http://i560.photobucket.com/albums/ss46/pakistanguides/Coreys_Big_Urial.jpg[/img]\n\n[img]http://i560.photobucket.com/albums/ss46/pakistanguides/Blandford_Horn_1.jpg[/img]\n\nI hope the above information will enlighten all my dear friends at Pak Guns ... have fun .. !\n\nWith love & best regards to all my friends at PakGuns, ... please stay in touch !', 0, 1, '119.153.54.78', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 1398, 32076),

Coming back to the topic I have never seen such an engraved Python ever except for customised pythons with a very minor engravings! And that engraving is called Class "B" engraving that Colt does on order and charges above 1000 USD to 4000 USD for engraving only depending on %age of engraving requested! In that respect your gun seems to be a FORTUNE!\n In fact a fully engraved COLT PYTHON was actually THE LAST PYTHON that Colt produced as Python''s Last model at its 50th anniversary and that was something levish enough to mark the 50th anniversary of a handgun and to give an END to the model that so long ruled most of the handgunner''s hands :) For your information, Colt''s LAST PYTHON had 24 karat gold inlays and it was levishly engraved!\nFor further information of our friends, The Colt Python is a .357 Magnum caliber revolver manufactured by Colt''s Manufacturing Company of Hartford, Connecticut. The Colt Python is considered to be a premium American pistol. Along with the Colt Peacemaker it is considered to be one of the finest revolvers ever made by Colt. The Colt Python is a double action, large I-frame handgun chambered for the powerful .357 Magnum cartridge. Pythons have a reputation for superior fit & finish, accuracy, smooth trigger pull and a tight cylinder lock-up. The Colt Python was first introduced in 1955 as Colt''s top-of-the-line model and was originally intended to be a large-frame 38 Special target revolver. As a result, it features precision adjustable sights, a smooth trigger, solid construction, and extra metal. Pythons have a distinct appearance due to a full barrel underlug, ventilated rib and adjustable sights. Originally, Colt manufactured Pythons with hollow underlugs but left them solid to work as a stabilizing barrel weight. When the revolver is at full cock, just as the trigger is pressed, the cylinder locks up for the duration of the hammer strike. Other revolvers have a hint of looseness even at full-cock. The gap between the cylinder and forcing cone is very tight, further aiding accuracy and velocity. Each Python revolver was boresighted at the factory with a laser and was the first mass-produced revolver to do so.\nColt Python serial number ranges from 1955 to 1985: The sudden increase in production in 1964 indicates that the CNC machining process may have been introduced in the mid-60''s. Toward the end of 1969 the letter "E" was added as a prefix to the serial number. In 1975 the letter "E" was moved to the end of the number, becoming a suffix. In 1978 other letters were used! above, production of the Python peaked in 1981 (the highest production year). However, 1978 is a "question mark" due to missing information surrounding guns with serial numbers that have the "N" Suffix. If more than 9,900 Pythons were produced with the "N" Suffix, 1978 would be the highest production year. At any rate, the five year period from 1977 through 1981 appears to be the peak demand period (Life Cycle Peak) or "golden years" of production for the Colt Python. After 1981 production numbers fall off rapidly, culminating with the gun eventually being produced by the Colt Custom Shop to order only, up until production ceased altogether. Some very lucky person out there owns the very last Python produced by Colt. I suspect the value of that gun to a collector would be very high. However, as long as Colt remains in business the remote possibility exists that they might produce another Python, thus de-throning the "last produced Python", a proposition that could never threaten the "first Python produced". Colt Manufacturing Co. announced the termination of its production of Python revolvers in October 1999 due to lack of sales and rising production costs. The Colt Custom Gun Shop continued making a limited number of Pythons on special order until 2005, when even this limited production was terminated.\nThe Python was originally available in two finishes: Royal Blue and Bright Nickel. The Bright Nickel model was discontinued with the introduction of the more durable satin stainless and mirror-polished Ultimate Stainless models (The One Connector probably owns :) ) But none was engraved! The stainless steel and Royal Blue finishes were offered until 2003 by Colt on the Python "Elite" model.\nPythons were available with 2.5 inch, 4 inch, 6 inch, and 8 inch barrels. The six-inch model was the most popular generally and the 8 inch model was intended for hunting. A rare 3 inch barrel version is very collectible, although not all 3 inch barrel variants are rare. The Python Silhouette model, with 8 inch barrel and factory-installed Leupold scope, was made in 1981. A Python Target model was made for several years in .38 Special only, in blue and nickel finishes. Two variants of the Python were made in small numbers by Colt. The first was the Colt Boa of 1985, which was a limited production revolver, also .357 Magnum caliber, made by Colt for the Lew Horton Distributing Company in Massachusetts. It closely resembles the original Python. Six hundred 6" revolvers and 600 4" revolvers were made, of which 100 were matched sets. Though it resembles a Python visually, in order to keep its purchase cost down it is substantially different internally and required less hand fitting. The second was the stainless steel Colt Grizzly of 1994, another limited production .357 Magnum revolver. 500 of these revolvers were manufactured, with 6" Magna-Ported barrels only. The Grizzly has smooth, unfluted cylinders. The barrel is ported and includes a bear footprint. The frame and action were based on the Trooper/Mk-III action. Similar was the Colt Kodiak which was a Colt Anaconda with a Magna-Ported Barrel and an unfluted cylinder. Approximately 2000 Kodiaks were manufactured.\nNow, :D Coming to the last python!

Turkish o/u are more refined, better weight regulation, better patterns and with special emphasis on beauty however turkish o/u are less reliable, durable and have less usefull life in terms of cartridge fired.\n\ncomparing the two would be the equivalent of "Jeans vs fancy dress" type question. both will cover the body, Jeans takes the abuse, dress looks good.\n\nin my experience, Russians tend to overlook on guns finish, they are more practicality oriented. Russian o/u have case hardened receivers, heat tempered firing pins, hinges/trunions/pivots. if you look inside the action of a baikal IZH27, it is quiet similar to the legandary Browning B25. hence a very reliable/long life action. weight is neutral (just the way i like it). sorta a bit heavy in weight (good for skeet/trap, reduces recoil). chokes/patterns are good enough (install aftermarket chokes if u want worldclass patterns, however factory chokes also produce acceptable patterns).\n\nTurkish philosphy however is a totally different ball game. they offer more finish/beauty to their customers and compromise on durablity/reliability/life. in my experience, turkish gun makers flash their customer''s eyes with shiny/beautiful/high finish guns cause it is common human behavior/response that we confuse finish with reliability.\n\na quick test, take u''r russian o/u and strike the pivot with a nail and hammer and u''ll see that u wont be able to scratch it, why? simple! heat treatment gentlemen. the steel is hardened inorder to be used over and over again. do this to a turkish o/u and u''ll probably regret it (as far as i''m concerned, been there done that and still regret it).\n\nwith this example now u why turkish o/u users complain that the receiver rattles with volume shooting. it rattles cause it wears off. i''m not saying that Russian wont rattle, it will eventually, but it will out-wear atleast three turkish over and unders before it starts to rattle.\n\n[b]Regards.[/b]\n\np.s. i''m the jeans kinda guy. I kinda get disgusted by the idea that people routinely compare Turkish shotguns to Russian shotguns. seriously! why? Turkish shotguns are nothing but a well organized equivalent of our Darra. since dealers make high profits on turkish shotguns as compared to Russian shotguns, they promote turkish shotguns.\n\none more thing: IMZ (holder of Baikal trademark, lets not go into a discussion whats the relationship between IZMASH and IMZ, cause thats a whole different topic) that makes IZH-27 is actually the world''s largest firearms maker and largest since 1949. IZH27 is over 60 year old, time tested and proven design. I had a magazine once, sorta lost it inside my house, i''m still looking for it though. it says something like this if my memory serves right.\n\npercentage of shotguns in international shooting matches:\n\nkreigoff, beretta and browning were at top three with around 20 percent each and the fourth largest catagory was Baikal at around 8 to 12 percent. no ones uses a turkish in any international match. that should end the debate.\n\nRegards.', 0, 1, '58.65.189.125', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 758, 32595),

So officially, only those trophies are recognized which have been hunted legally after paying the proper Govt fees & permits and the hunts are processed through legal international formalities (like CITES export permits {Conference of International Trade of Endangered Species} in collaboration with local wild life law enforcement agencies of every country) .... etc.\n\nSo officially, the Blandford Urial which my friend Corey Knowlton shot in Balochistan will soon become the next world record when it will be presented to the SCI (Safari Club International) measuring and certification committee after a couple of months. Currently the existing world record of Blandford Urial is 34 Inches (i don''t remember its total score but it is less than Corey''s) although, Corey''s Urial is 33.75 Inch, it will become the new world record because the bases of both horns (which are 9.75 to 10 inches) are much thicker than existing world record.\n\nPlease note, while measuring the trophy the following intenationally recognized formula is used.\nFirst total length of each horn is measured eg: Left 33.75 inch, Right 33.50 inch, Total= 67.25 inches.\nThen circumference both horns are measured from their bases eg: Right 10" + Left 9.75" Total = 19.75\nThen circumference of each horn is measured after every 4 inch of length & total is added to get the final score. \n\nSo the total figure becomes official score which is recorded in SCI world record book. At times, people lose their world records for just a fraction of an inch or sometimes a millimeter ... but that''s what the competition is about. \n\nIn order to become an "Official Master Measurer" one has to qualify an extensive formal training course and then practice for a very long time before becoming a "Master Measurer" which is considered as a great title/honor so it''s  quite a difficult job because there are so many animals (with horns & without horns) in the world and each animals has a different criteria of measurement (Carnivores & some species of Antlers pose greater problems) so it''s a tough job. \n\nTo know more about SCI which is the world''s largest hunting organization, you may click on \n[url]http://www.scifirstforhunters.org[/url]\n\nTo see their trophy measuring details and criteria ... click on\n[url]http://www.scifirstforhunters.org/conte[/url] … ent_id=105\n\nThe world''s second largest hunting organization is Grand Slam Ovis which can be seen at\n[url]http://wildsheep.org/[/url]\n\nThe current official world record of Sindh Ibex is of Mr. Chris Boddington from USA which is 45 inch (I don''t know the toal score)  ... but I''ve never heard of the 49 inch long horn of any Sindh Ibex dead or alive ! or Urial which is 39 inch ... but like you said ... let''s wait & see when the taxidermist finishes his work at Koh-e-Kaaf !!! .... lol. \n\nBy the way the unofficial world record of Punjab Urial was the one at Lahore Zoo whom I personally measured last year at 37.5 inches ... but the poor fellow disappeared from the zoo in a strange manner ...!\n\nAnd here is Corey''s new pending world record Blandford Urial ... See how the tips of both its horns has made holes in its jaws and penetrated over two inches through the jaw bone ...

Kindly allow me to elaborate as follows !\nThese trophy hunts are done through a very organized community based system and 80% of the money paid to buy these trophy hunting licenses goes to the village communities who protect and look after these animals. Since each & every family in the village gets its fair share (which sometimes goes in lacs of Rs) this system is working perfectly and it has totally eliminated the illegal poaching of these animals. Even the villagers cannot get engaged in poaching because there are rewards on reporting the poachers so every body watches every body and no one can poach. Poaching by the outsiders is literally impossible because you''ll need Allah Din Ka Chiragh to evade all these villagers to poach an animal. So this fool proof program is a wonderful conservancy program and it is working perfectly. The remaining 20% of the money goes to the concerned Wild Life Department of the area & this money is spent on paying the salaries of game scouts & other staff.. etc. The number of animals shot every year is so small it does not disturb the population and/or their growth. For example, out of total population of approx 7000 blue sheep, only six male extra old animals are allowed to be shot every year. The hunting quota for Astor Markhor is 4/year, Kashmir Markhor is 4/per year, Punjab Urial is 8/year, Sindh Ibex from Province of Sindh is 10 & from Balochistan is 12 ... and so on ... If we compare these very small hunting quotas with the natural death pattern of these animals, it is far far too less  and more animals in the  nature get killed at the time of birth, killed by predators, or by avalanches, and also by mountain accidents and above all ... by natural diseases.\nNO Sir, ... Personally, I don''t hunt these animals at all, ... though, I do wish I could hunt them !!! but I cannot afford the very expensive prices & I am totally against illegal hunting. So I only organize these hunts for hunters who come to Pakistan from around the world. \nAs regards the prices, .... well these hunts are very expensive .... see the price I''ve written under the Photo in which our group is marching towards Shimshal ... Blue Sheep Hunt is considered as moderately priced hunt ! Whereas, the hunting Package for Kashmir Markhor is being sold out @ an average cost of Rs 12,500,000/= .. Yes Sir ! This is Big Game Trophy Hunting and it is greatly benefiting the poor people of the mountains who all work very hard to protect them through thick & thin !\n\n[img]http://i560.photobucket.com/albums/ss46/pakistanguides/lowerlalazar.jpg[/img]\n\nWith love & best regards to all my friends at PakGuns !', 0, 1, '119.153.53.247', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 1398, 32636),

Despite all the power and influence our army has, they could not succeed in convincing the community of Torgahr to let their chief hunt there ... so this is indeed a great success story. \nBut like I said earlier, Punjab Urial and Himalayan Ibex is an exceptiuon because the Himalayan Ibex is spread over a very large area and its poaching cannot be monitored whereas, poaching of Punjab Urial is unfortunately being facilitated by the Staff of Punjab Wild Life Department.\n\n[img]http://i560.photobucket.com/albums/ss46/pakistanguides/hunzaautumn.jpg[/img]', 0, 1, '119.153.53.247', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 1398, 32639),

They both do reverse engenering but DARRA people neither have access to modern machines nor to the proper metal. On the other hand Turkish plants are manufecturing some weapons at NATO standard for their troops. Turkish companies have knowledge sharing with the worlds best companies like Stoeger is a subsidery of BERETTA. Turkish walnut is considered one of the best.[/quote]\n\nsir, thats what i said, turkish gunmaking facilities are basically our darra type facilities, however they are more techologically advanced, they got CNC machines in 2001 (courtesy of USA not italy). they are getting better at metallurgy (again courtesy of USA) and thats it. Turkey is not a signatory to CIP, their guns are not proof tested, there is no one to guarantee the safety of their firearms. there are no formal testing standards. (now u know why turkish guns dont carry proof marks/stamps). now dont tell me "proof tested at 12000 psi" stamped on turkish barrels counts for something cause no it does not.\n\none more thing, stoeger plant was not established by beretta, it was in actuality, bought as a fully functional entity by beretta. that ends the debate that beretta quality guns are being produced their. beretta bought a cheaper company to expand their reach to lower price shotgun market. thats it folks, thats it.\n\n[quote]As far as the use of guns in competitions is considered it is not the quality of russian guns that take them to the events, but the patriotic competitors of the Russian block who were not allowed to use anyother gun.[/quote]\n\nsorry sir, european (specially britain, spain, french, even italian) players have intentionally opted for russian guns in international tournaments, not just russian block players.

According to recently declassified research by the Department of Defense, the new bullets will allow snipers to hit targets several kilometres away. "This technology could change the nature of war," says Ron Barrett, an aerospace engineer at Auburn University in Alabama who is testing prototypes of these Barrel Launched Adaptive Munitions.\n\nBLAMs steer by twitching their noses. Each bullet has a nose that can swivel, changing the angle it makes with the airflow. "At supersonic speed, very small angles generate huge amounts of lift," explains Barrett. Angling the nose towards the target causes the bullet to veer in that direction.\n\nThe mechanism is simple. The nose is connected to the body by a ball-and-socket joint, and held in place by a number of piezoceramic rods, or tendons, which change length when a voltage is applied to them. Increasing the length of a rod on one side of the bullet while shortening its opposite number changes the angle of the nose (see Diagram). The nose can move by up to 0.1° in any direction.\n\nThese simple actuators are ideal for bullets because they can withstand the huge forces generated during firing, says Barrett. He has already demonstrated that the prototype can survive accelerations of more than 17 000 times gravity.\n\nThey are also able to lengthen and contract hundreds of times a second. This is important because spinning bullets travel at several times the speed of sound, so any control mechanism must be able to react quickly to compensate. In wind tunnel tests, Barrett has proved that the piezoceramic rods can produce good control of a round travelling at more than Mach 3.\n\nSo far the work has focused on the large-calibre bullets with diameters of 20 millimetres or more that are used in aircraft cannon. These bullets are notoriously inaccurate because they are blown off course by the wind and follow parabolic trajectories, dropping significantly over distances of a kilometre or so. "The way pilots guarantee a hit is by filling the sky with lead," says Barrett. Because BLAMs generate lift, they can overcome the effects of wind and gravity, giving them at least twice the range of conventional bullets. "And with BLAM, pilots would need only one bullet to get a hit," says Barrett.\n\nIn addition to the steering mechanism, each bullet would also need a guidance system that tracks the target and controls the actuators. Barrett says this is the easy part of the problem. "Accurate guidance systems have been around for 30 years," he explains.\n\nThe idea is to "paint" the target with a laser beam and equip the bullets with a sensor that homes in on this signal, just like smart bombs. Each bullet would have a sensor behind a quartz window that picks up the signal and controls the bullet. Barrett says that suitable sensors already exist that can withstand the stresses of being fired from a gun and can be made more or less the size of a microchip.\n\nBut the bullets will not be cheap. Aircraft bullets cost more than $30 each. Barrett says the piezoceramic materials would add $10 to this while the microelectronics would cost another $100. But he argues that the increased strike rate would lead to cost savings. "You''d only fire one when otherwise you''d fire hundreds."\n\nAnother advantage of piezoceramic actuators is that they can easily be made smaller. "You don''t have to fiddle around with tiny mechanisms as you would for conventional actuators," he says. This raises the prospect of smart bullets for small arms.\n\nLaser reflection is already a common method of sighting for hand-held weapons. But a sharpshooter must still compensate for gravity and wind, and this limits the range of even the most accurate guns to a kilometre or so. With smart bullets, snipers could hit targets from several kilometres away. The gun and the laser sight need not even be in the same place.\n\nBut a lot of research and development is needed before the first weapon fires a smart bullet. "The technology is not yet fully proven," says Fred Davis, who heads the flight vehicles branch at the US Air Force''s Wright Laboratory in Florida, which funded Barrett''s work. But Davis believes that smart bullets are a practical possibility, although he predicts they are 15 years away. He says that his laboratory has already developed scaled down, cheaper versions of the smart bombs that were so successful during the Gulf War.\n\n[url]http://www.snipercountry.com/Articles/SmartBullets.asp[/url]', 0, 1, '115.42.79.231', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 1424, 33104),

With a unique cluster of the world''s many highest peaks , creeping crevassed glaciers, massive lackostrine deposits, gigantic scree eroding mountains, greens meadows, fertile alluvial fans and stark rigid gorges; Shimshal domains the largest glaciated region on Earth outside the polar regions.\n\n[img]http://pakistanguides.com/hunting/blue_sheep/images/shimshal_blue_sheep_hunt_l10.JPG[/img]\n\nArbab Purian Base Camp (14350 Ft) - Blue Sheep Hunt, Shimshal Valley (March 2009)\n\n[img]http://pakistanguides.com/hunting/blue_sheep/images/shimshal_blue_sheep_hunt_l12.JPG[/img]\n\nShimshal''s extreme isolation thus imposed by the unbelievably steep gorges of the Karakoram, rise to a long standing, wholly indigenous & pure diet consisting almost entirely of apricots, wheat and Hunza Water, a locally brewed wine, & hence the long living inhabitants.\n\n[img]http://pakistanguides.com/hunting/blue_sheep/images/shimshal_blue_sheep_hunt_l63.jpg[/img]\n\n[img]http://pakistanguides.com/hunting/blue_sheep/images/shimshal_blue_sheep_hunt_l56.jpg[/img]\n\nThe society is co-operative rather than competitive. Each family grows enough food for its own use. As the Shimshalis lived aloof from the outer world, each citizen was self sufficient in making his own shoes, clothes & bowls, until, the perilous jeep track linked them with the world.\n\n[img]http://pakistanguides.com/hunting/blue_sheep/images/blue_sheep_hunt_shimshal_l7.JPG[/img]\n\n[img]http://pakistanguides.com/hunting/blue_sheep/images/shimshal_blue_sheep_hunt_l15.JPG[/img]\n\nThe walk into and across Shimshal, however, is not a task to be undertaken lightly. It’s a tough walk up and down the gorges, across rushing icy torrents, along steep narrow trails, through broken rocks, over wire-rope bridges and through many crevassed glaciers.\n\n[img]http://pakistanguides.com/hunting/blue_sheep/images/shimshal_blue_sheep_hunt_l19.JPG[/img]\n\n[img]http://pakistanguides.com/hunting/blue_sheep/images/shimshal_pass_l1.JPG[/img]\n\nOur Team of 1 Hunter +20 Porters +2 Guides +2 Cooks +4 Climbers +Me Marching Towards Shimshal For Blue Sheep Hunt (March 2009) - This Hunt Costed A Little More Than Rs 2,100,000/= See we are all tied with ropes together !\n\n[img]http://i560.photobucket.com/albums/ss46/pakistanguides/shimshal_blue_sheep_hunt_l53.jpg[/img]\n\nOne small slip on this dangerous & scary slope and you may lose your life for the rest of your life !\n\n[img]http://pakistanguides.com/hunting/blue_sheep/images/shimshal_blue_sheep_hunt_l27.JPG[/img]\n\nShimshal is a farming & herding community of 3000 people, situated at north-eastern extreme of the former state of Hunza. The settlement occupies the upper portion of a valley of the same name, which descends west into the Hunza River valley at Passu and separates the Ghujerab and Hispar Mustagh ranges of the Karakoram mountains. Shimshal is also famous for the longevity of its people.\n\n[img]http://pakistanguides.com/hunting/blue_sheep/images/blue_sheep_hunt_shimshal_l6.JPG[/img]\n\nWithin Shimshal''s territory are innumerable peaks, glaciers and trekking routes, including nine peaks above 7,000 meters. Yukshin Gardan, Yazghil Dome, Dataghil Sar, Malangutti, Karoon Koh are the famous ones.\n\n[img]http://pakistanguides.com/hunting/blue_sheep/images/shimshal_blue_sheep_hunt_l28.JPG[/img]\n\n[img]http://pakistanguides.com/hunting/blue_sheep/images/shimshal_blue_sheep_hunt_l29.JPG[/img]\n\n[img]http://pakistanguides.com/hunting/blue_sheep/images/shimshal_blue_sheep_hunt_l30.JPG[/img]\n\n[img]http://pakistanguides.com/hunting/blue_sheep/images/kaiser_blue_sheep_hunt_l5.JPG[/img]\n\nShimshal is rich in fauna & many threatened wildlife species are found here. It is the only place where Tibetan Wild Ass (Equus bemionus kiang), & Blue Sheep (Pseudois nayaur) are found. Snow leopard (Uncia uncia), Himalayan ibex (Capra Ibex Sibirica Hemalayanus) and, Golden Marmots (Marmota caudate) are also found in Shimshal. Migratory birds like ducks & cranes also enroute Shimshal Valley.\n\n[img]http://pakistanguides.com/hunting/blue_sheep/images/shimshal_blue_sheep_hunt_l37.JPG[/img]\n\nThe people of Shimshal are cheerful & friendly. The entire population belongs to the Ismaili Shias sect headed by Prince Karim Agha Khan. The women wear bright clothes, long shirts over baggy trousers and embroided pillbox hats over which they drape their shawls, whereas, men mostly wear simple dress composed of shalwar (trouser) & kamiz (shirt) or western trousers with a hand woven wool cap.\n\n[img]http://pakistanguides.com/hunting/blue_sheep/images/shimshal_blue_sheep_hunt_l58.jpg[/img]\n\nShimshal pastures cover about 2700 sq km of the Central Karakoram. Within that area they maintain their three dozen individual pastures, including three large and highly productive alpine areas. \n\n[img]http://pakistanguides.com/hunting/blue_sheep/images/shimshal_blue_sheep_hunt_l60.jpg[/img]\n\nShimshal’s villages are situated on a series of glacial and alluvial deposits that form a broad strip between the river''s floodplain and steep mountain slopes to the south. These deposits have been terraced for several hundred years. They are irrigated by glacier melt water which currently dissect them.  Shimshalis grow wheat & barley, potatoes, peas, beans, apricots and apples. Small quantities of garden vegetables are also grown. Shimshalis are one of the few communities in Pakistan''s Northern Areas that grows enough agricultural produce to feed itself. \n\n[img]http://pakistanguides.com/hunting/blue_sheep/images/shimshal_blue_sheep_hunt_l51.JPG[/img]\n\nShimshalis complement their irrigated agriculture with extensive herding of sheep, goats, cattle & yaks. They own more livestock per capita than any other Hunza community & earn more by selling dairy produce, yaks and yak hair carpets. This is due, in part, to the community''s exclusive control of vast areas of high altitude land. Serving tourists as porters, guides, drivers & cooks is another source of income.\n\n[img]http://pakistanguides.com/hunting/blue_sheep/images/shimshal_blue_sheep_hunt_l57.jpg[/img]\n\nAs per many popular tales of community, Shimshal was founded four centuries ago by Mamu Singh, a Burusho from Baltit (Hunza), and a member of the ruler''s family. Mamu Singh was sent to Sarikol, Central Asia, as ambassador, but later fled with his Wakhi wife Khodija, when relations with Hunza deteriorated. They were pursued into the Upper Hunza River Valley, as far as Avgarch Pasture on the slopes of Qarun Pir, where they made their home for several years before migrating into the lower reaches of the Shimshal Valley. \n\n[img]http://pakistanguides.com/hunting/blue_sheep/images/shimshal_blue_sheep_hunt_l47.JPG[/img]\n\n[img]http://pakistanguides.com/hunting/blue_sheep/images/shimshal_blue_sheep_hunt_l46.JPG[/img]\n\nNOW ....

These MTs are never made by IZHMASH but by KBP that is a different company and much prestigeous company. They don''t make cheap stuff like Baikal but very fine and expensive stuff. We can compare it with London best or European best. At the same time for our fellow members Russia never bagged 4 olympic golds is a row nor it won four golds in skeet in the history of Olympic Skeet. Yes, in the 1968 olympics PETROVE won a gold in skeet and that is the only gold they have in this decipline. Petrove and Yuri TSURANOV showed some extraordinary skills of markesmanship in the comming years.\n\nI am posting a link just to have a fair idea about the IZH and the MTs.

Only 6 boars were shot at night using spot/flash lights. \nMy client Helmut used Blazer 338 but was not so happy because his magazine could only give him 4+1 shots and he missed lots of boars while loading his gun, whereas, his fellow hunter Fischer used the Semi Automatic Wichester 30.06 with large magazine carrying 11 shots .(plus a spare loaded magazine) .. so obviously he had an edge over Hlelmut and had a better score.\n\n[img]http://pakistanguides.com/boar/photo_gallery/images/westfalia_jagdreisen_boar_hunt_26L.JPG[/img]\n\nThis is Fischer proudly exhibiting his 22 + 22.5 cm long wild boar trophy he harvested ij Jan 2009\n\n[img]http://pakistanguides.com/boar/photo_gallery/images/westfalia_jagdreisen_boar_hunt_8L.JPG[/img]\n\n[img]http://pakistanguides.com/boar/photo_gallery/images/westfalia_jagdreisen_boar_hunt_34L.JPG[/img]\n\n[img]http://pakistanguides.com/boar/photo_gallery/images/westfalia_jagdreisen_boar_hunt_33L.JPG[/img]\n\n[img]http://pakistanguides.com/boar/photo_gallery/images/westfalia_jagdreisen_boar_hunt_24L.JPG[/img]\n\n[img]http://pakistanguides.com/boar/photo_gallery/images/westfalia_jagdreisen_boar_hunt_35L.JPG[/img]\n\nMy sons thoroughly enjoyed this wild boar hunt and it was a great experience for them.\n\n[img]http://pakistanguides.com/boar/photo_gallery/images/westfalia_jagdreisen_boar_hunt_21L.JPG[/img]\n\n[img]http://pakistanguides.com/boar/photo_gallery/images/westfalia_jagdreisen_boar_hunt_30L.JPG[/img]\n\n[img]http://pakistanguides.com/boar/photo_gallery/images/westfalia_jagdreisen_boar_hunt_19L.JPG[/img]\n\n[img]http://pakistanguides.com/boar/photo_gallery/images/westfalia_jagdreisen_boar_hunt_23L.JPG[/img]\n\n[img]http://pakistanguides.com/boar/photo_gallery/images/westfalia_jagdreisen_boar_hunt_22L.JPG[/img]\n\n[img]http://pakistanguides.com/boar/photo_gallery/images/safari_international_boar_hunt_4L.jpg[/img]\n\n[img]http://pakistanguides.com/boar/photo_gallery/images/westfalia_jagdreisen_boar_hunt_10L.JPG[/img]\n\n[img]http://pakistanguides.com/boar/photo_gallery/images/safari_international_boar_hunt_3L.jpg[/img]\n\n[img]http://pakistanguides.com/boar/photo_gallery/images/westfalia_jagdreisen_boar_hunt_29L.JPG[/img]\n\n[img]http://pakistanguides.com/boar/photo_gallery/images/westfalia_jagdreisen_boar_hunt_25L.JPG[/img]\n\n[img]http://pakistanguides.com/boar/photo_gallery/images/westfalia_jagdreisen_boar_hunt_37L.JPG[/img]\n\n[img]http://pakistanguides.com/boar/photo_gallery/images/westfalia_jagdreisen_boar_hunt_32L.JPG[/img]\n\nI think these are enough for today but I''ll revert soon and show you guys some more photos of my wild boar hunt that I conducted for my American and Italian hunters ....

I wanted to ask ... you had mentioned in some of your posts that it requires a certified measurer for the Trophy hunting.... what if I hunt a boar and its by far a good big sized .. what criteria would there be to judge whether I got the biggest boar?\nSpecially when no certified hunter is accompanying me ... who would certify the hunt?[/quote]\n\nDear Khalidsh\nLike I said earlier, people have undoubtedly hunted extra large trophies around the world, and many of them even possess world record trophies, however, in order to participate in a competition or make your trophy officially registered for the whole world to accept it, so it may become undisputable, you have to register it with the SCI who have a transparent system of measuring all kinds of trophies and they use the services of "master measurers" who are well trained and have lot of experience. To distribute the work load, some other hunting organizations also do this job of measuring, like Grand Slam Ovis, Shikar Safari International, Dallas Safari Club ..etc and pass on the result to SCI accordingly. \nAs regards your question, you don''t have to carry a master measurer with you who must accompany you on hunt to certify that this is your hunted trophy. He just receives the trophy through proper channel and measures it. But to officially certify that this is YOUR trophy, a hunting certificate is issued by the Wild Life department of every country which is issued only after you have bought the hunting permit and paid all the Govt fees. For all big game hunted trophies, the hunter is always escorted by the representative of wild life department plus the representative of the concerned community based conservancy (where you are hunting) and they both sign your hunting certificate as witness to your hunt after which the department issues the hunting certificate and this becomes your official trophy. Then in order to send your trophy for official measurement to SCI you need an export permit from NCCW (@ Rs 5000) and ship it to SCI with their fee. After it is measured and certified, they send it back to you. Then you can display your trophy in your drawing room with the certificate that will not be challenged by anyone anywhere in the world ... BUT you may be very much dissappointed to hear the news on the very next day ... that YOUR world record has been broken by some Tom Dikk or Harry .... lol !\n\nThe same process is to be followed for the wild boar around the world ... fortunately, however, there is no hunting permit or hunting fee for Pakistanis to hunt the wild boar in Pakistan and Pakistani hunters just need the official shooting permit. Whereas, all foreigners pay US$ 100 to Ministry of Tourism, plus Rs 1500 for the shooting license to provincial wild life department.\nNow after you have "legally hunted" the wild boar (with your proper shooting permit) and cleaned its trophy, you have the right to go to the office of the wild life department and claim for the hunting certificate clearly mentioning the size of the wild boar trophy then you can send this hunting to SCI, however, since wild boar is "haram" and obnoxious for all Muslims, the wild life department may refuse to touch or issue such certificate (especially when they are not getting any fees etc) and since there is no such precedence, they may not even consider it !!!\n\nThat''s how they measure it !\n\n[img]http://vermontbiggametrophyclub.com/yahoo_site_admin1/assets/images/IROC_Show_2008.49122803.jpg[/img]\n\nPlease note since there are hundreds of species being hunted around the world, the world record list is very big & keeps changing every day. So you can see the list of top ten trophies of each specie.\n\nClick here :  [url]http://www.scifirstforhunters.org/members/RB/view_minimums.cfm[/url]\n\nIf you determine to enter this list, ... Your today''s dream can become tommorrow''s reality !\n\nLike all other animals, there are many species of wild boars. Pakistan is mainly populated with Sus Scrofa which is of almost same size as Razorbacks of America but much bigger than the Feral Pigs of Europe .. Yet much smaller than the Tusckers of Turkey which are hunter''s favorites because they have big bodies and big fangs. \n\nNevertheless, none of these species can even come closer to the African Wart Hogs whose teeth are very big as compared to their own body and teeth of any other specie. \n\nThis is how an African Wrathog Looks like !\n\n[img]http://www.glenoakzoo.org/PPHTAG/PPHTAGimages/warthog.jpg[/img]\n\n[img]http://i72.photobucket.com/albums/i199/seawolf_2006/Warthog11tommer.jpg[/img] \n\n[img]http://i560.photobucket.com/albums/ss46/pakistanguides/Huge20Warthog20taken20by20little20b.jpg[/img]\n\n[img]http://www.paulbrunner.net/images/Kane%20Photos/Dan%20Holland%20with%20HUGE%20Warthog.jpg[/img]\n\n[img]http://i560.photobucket.com/albums/ss46/pakistanguides/ChineseWildBoar.jpg[/img]\n\nBut this strange boar from China is some strange specie that I never saw before !', 0, 1, '119.153.70.115', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 1452, 34314),

Assault rifle was first introduced in World War II, Germany deployed  "Stoßtruppen" (Shock Trooper), who were equipped with "Sturmgewehr 44" (Storm Rifle) chambered for 7.92x33mm Kurz, major battlefield results showed that major engagements occurred at less distance than 300 meters, which meant that the heavier 7.92x57mm round rifles were over powered and were heavy and difficult to assault with. This was the dawn of Assault rifles. Now the performance showed for it self, soldiers were able to fire in bursts while moving, and they moved faster too. This idea was the result of "Blitzkrieg", a German Army assault tactic. \n\nWhat is a battle rifle?\nA battle rifle incorporates a heavier round for e.g 7.62x51, with a range and accuracy upto and beyond 1000 meters. These rifles have been in the world since the begging of the 19th century.\n\nNow, Armies and their commanders are not stupid, they know what they are doing, The US Army standard issue is M16, heavier and longer barrel, while an M4 is a special forces weapon with a shorter barrel and its compact, SF''s job is to infil and exfil light and quick and complete their objectives, while the Army has to stick it to the enemy. \n\nPak Army standard issue rifle is the G3 for a soldier, which is dead accurate and lethal at range, but JCO''s get the MP5, which is 9mm, so if the point is lethality then the JCO with the MP5 is worthless who is supposed to be leading his squad/platoon. Why does the Pak Army and Germans still incorporate the MG3 as their primary machine gun, Power? No its meant for suppression, a 7.62x51 will suppress an enemy the same as a .50 BMG, they want it to be light, deploy able and suppress the enemy by volume.\n\nThe lighter the round, the lighter the rifle, more a soldier can perform and more he can carry in volume.\n\nThe debate about penetration, when you are in Close Quarter Battle, having a heavier bullet makes a bullet prone to penetrate walls, in a hostage situation do you want that? NO\nBoth 9mm and 50 BMG can kill a man, the 50 BMG will only make his guts spill out more.\n\nThe 7.62 and the 5.45 are both great rounds in their category, the 7.62 Assault rifle is intended for a powerful barrage of bullets while deadly at short range, while the 5.45 is intended for accurate and controllable hits. the 5.45, 7.62, 223, and 308 are excellent calibers in battlefields they are to be.\n\nThe objective and conditions decide which caliber, not vice versa.', 0, 1, '202.147.163.9', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 768, 34480),

There are few animals in the world that can compete the excellent eye sight, very strong sense of smell and very sharp ears of Mountain Goat and Himalayan Ibex\n\n[img]http://i560.photobucket.com/albums/ss46/pakistanguides/mountain_goats_sheer_drop.jpg[/img]\n\nThat''s how Robert Bateman visualised & captured on canvass the habitat of this majestic animal !\n\n[img]http://i560.photobucket.com/albums/ss46/pakistanguides/mountaingoat5.jpg[/img]\n\n[img]http://i560.photobucket.com/albums/ss46/pakistanguides/MountainGoat3.jpg[/img]\n\nCatching these goats at this altitude is difficult indeed ... quite difficult, especially when their hunt opens up in peak winters when all the mountains are full of ice & snow !', 0, 1, '119.153.54.107', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 1452, 34493),
