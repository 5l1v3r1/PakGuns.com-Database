I do have a shooting range and OK its not that PRIVATE but still at least I have one :D. Jokes aside, its actually a flood channel which is near my home and is pretty good for such type of field tests. As I was planning for shooting with a rest so the only thing available as a rest was a concrete block 1.5 feet high and I had to sit on the ground in an Altii Palti position (couldn''t find a suitable word for this position ;)) with an arching back and drooping my shoulders to the height of the concrete block (pretty uncomfortable; next time I am making proper arrangements. InshAllah). \n\nPlease note the following as you proceed reading:[LIST=1]\n[*]I had tried to tune down the power by turning the screw of the Hammer Spring CCW one full circle.\n[*]Before trying out each type of pellet or distance, I filled the cylinder to exactly 200 bars.\n[*]Few days back, I had vaguely tried to zero the scope at 17 yards at 10pm in the light of the Torch which was in the Elite''s package.

The RWS seemed absolutely adamant on hitting several inches below the intended target and were all over the place. (Guys at RWS, what have you been all up to)  \n[ATTACH=CONFIG]27640[/ATTACH]\n\n[B]JSB Exact Heavy 18.13gr\n[/B]Now this is what I call a pellet. I would say the Czechs have rightly been doing their homework. I got a 14mm group from 6 pellets. Then the next 4 pellets slightly opened up but that''s totally my bad. I should have tried to remain calm but the excitement of the first 6 pellets made me slightly shaky :D. \n[B][I]Group of 6 pellets[/I][/B]\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]27638[/ATTACH]\n[B][I]\nGroup of 10 pellets[/I][/B]\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]27643[/ATTACH]\n\n[B]H&N Barracuda Match 21.3gr\n[/B]I tried out the H&N at 35 Meters. Interestingly they were also spread out. However the shot string between pellet 2 and 7 seemed to group to some extent. Secondly, unlike the other pellets where the pressure dropped from 200 to 170, with the Barracudas it came down to 175. That means a 2.5 bar drop at each shot.  \n[ATTACH=CONFIG]27644[/ATTACH]\n\n[B]JSB Exact Jumbo Monsters 25gr\n[/B]The JSB Monsters were also tried out at 35 meters and the last 5 pellets seemed to make a tight group. I guess that''s because of the sweet spot of the Elite, which brother Jog3ee rightly pointed out to be at 180 bars.   \n[ATTACH=CONFIG]27645[/ATTACH]\n\n[B][U]CONCLUSION\n[/U][/B]No I am not reaching at any conclusion, yet. \nReasons:\n1. The shooting position was not so Restful. I am trying it out again on a proper bench at the shooting range. (Not this shooting range but another one :))\n2. I still cant comprehend why the RWS were so spread out. Would soon like to know more about it. \n3. OK, the Elite has a liking for JSB Exact Heavy 18.13gr but I would like to give another chance to JSB Monsters (25gr). Why? The Elite is extremely powerful and I believe the 25gr pellets should suit it.\n4. I may change the scope and install the UTG 6-24x56.

Unfortunately I busted a screw-head trying to open the stock and have to wait till weekend for Khilji to rescue me, so the stock is stuck and I cannot adjust the hammer spring.\n\nSorry I don''t have any pics now, but will inshaAllah upload tonight. \n\nHere goes: remove the airtube from the gun, on the end which goes inside the gun there is a black metal washer with a small check nut on it , and the hammer hits the black metal washer which in turn pushes the valve stem inside the airtube and air comes out. The valve stem has 4mm travel, so I used a cycle tube to make 2 washers of same dia as the black metal washer, each rubber washer is 1mm thick so effectively tried to reduce valve stem travel to approx 2.5mm from current 4mm (0.5mm margin for rubber getting pressed). The check nut and metal washers are loctited, so use a small spanner and pliers carefully to unscrew. Both will come off separately, then insert the two washers on the valve stem and make sure you glue them together. Tighten the washer and check nut and screw back the airtube.\n\nPut the tube back in, filled to 140 bar and did a rough test. I first put a gamo pellet into two old sidney sheldon novels using the HW-100 at 15 yards rooftop range, and the pellet completely penetrated the first and came to rest one quarter inside the second one. Then did same using BT-65, and penetration was ~10% more. Both pellets were evenly and similarly deformed at the tip. The HW does ~880fps, so I guess the Hatsan was doing roughly 950fps. The BT-65''s noise was lower, but still it was loud enough and I quit after 5-6 shots.\n\nI will add another washer tonight when I get home inshaAllah, and then when light goes and generators starts, will try penetration test again and see how many shots I can get from 125 to 100 bar. Without the washers I get 10 shots, so shot-count should theoretically improve with the washers.', 1, 0, '202.143.123.161', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

I was originally a bit skeptical about retention and carried an empty chamber under the hammer for several weeks before becoming confident that the gun wouldn''t get knocked out if I bumped it into something. \r\n\r\n You''ll note it''s what I call a "single side" holster, with a "purse strap" over the shoulder, and a smaller, elastic strap that serves only to keep the main strap from sliding off.  The main strap is very wide and distributes the weight of the gun over a large area, though the little aluminum gun doesn''t weigh much.\r\n\r\n It took a few days to get used to something pulling up under my armpit; after that, I got used to it and don''t notice it at all.\r\n\r\n The holster fits me well.  I''m thick across the top, so the upside-down rig moves the larger part of the gun down where it doesn''t stick out as much.\r\n\r\n I have the left hand version.  Interestingly, it is just as easy to pull the gun with either hand; reach over with my left hand and pull it across my chest, or reach up under my jacket with my right hand and pull it straight down, a motion sort of like scratching your ribs.\r\n\r\n There are a couple of other companies making upside-down holsters.  The S&W J-frame with 2" barrel is the standard; some support 3" and 4" barrels or Colt revolvers, but snubnose revolvers are all anyone supports with this design.', 1, 0, '76.125.99.223', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

The guy in the pictures has the elastic strap very loose.\n\n Even without the strap being snug, the weight of the gun will cause the holster to rotate until the center of gravity of the gun and holster are below your shoulder joint; that''s just gravity at work.  This means it''s a long reach-around to get to the holster.  You can also see why it''s just as easy to pull the gun with the "wrong" hand; I think a right-handed shooter would be better served by a left-hand holster, which would ride on the right side.\n\n One major downside I forgot to mention:  due to the strong elastic, it''s rather difficult to get the gun into the holster; it takes a firm grim on both the holster and the gun, and if you''re wearing the holster at the time, the procedure is doubtless very amusing to any onlookers.  The first couple of times, I wound up turning around like a dog chasing its tail, trying to get a grip on the holster.\n\n The holster trades the accessibility and convenience of a conventional vertical or horizontal for better concealability and comfort; that''s the trade-off I wanted, and I''m happy with it.  But if a fast draw and easy re-holstering are more important for you, this probably isn''t a holster you might want.', 1, 0, '76.125.99.223', 0, 1, 3, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

(418239, 11259, 360714, 'Jibz', 7777, 'Breech Seal Damaged &amp; Repaired', 1388398735, 'Dear Airking users\nI came across the issue of loss of power and the first thing that came to my mind was that the spring is to be blamed for this problem (There was a muffled sound and also the slow speed of the pellet could be noticed with its delayed strike on the target). But before that I wanted to make sure that the rest of the possibilities related to this issue are written off. So I did the following:[LIST=1]\n[*]Checked the barrel thoroughly to make sure there is no obstruction of any sort.\n[*]Cleaned the barrel with dry patches first and then sprayed WD40 in it. Black colored residue dripped out of the barrel and was cleaned with few more dry patches.\n[*]Cocked the side lever and I noticed that the amount of effort required was almost similar to when I had used the gun the last time. (Thus I concluded that the spring was not at fault here rather the issue was something else).\n[*]I fired few shots with it and instead of the "shrraakhhh" (dont know its right term :( ), it produced a muffled sound.\n[/LIST]The muffled sound was also accompanied with an air-blow to the fingers of my left hand holding the front end so there it was, a leaking breech or a compression cylinder.  \nThe compression cylinder was retracted and I checked the barrel; it looked perfectly fine so the next thing was to check the compression cylinder itself. I peeked inside the front end of the compression cylinder and I noticed something that looked like a smashed pellet stuck in the cylinder. The first thought that occurred to me was that a mis-feed had caused this problem and a pellet was crushed inside the breech between the cylinder and the barrel. I tried scratching it and with a little effort it came out. Whollaaaa, it was not a pellet but a deformed SEAL, a breech seal to be specific. Pictured below. \n[ATTACH=CONFIG]27770[/ATTACH]\n\nIt was not insulating the pressure properly and thus causing the leak along with some undesired vibration. You can see in the picture above that from one side it is damaged (perhaps a misfeed) and the pressure from the piston was leaking from there. (Pictured below: As I didnt take pictures of the compression cylinder along with the damaged breech seal so here I am using one from internet)\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]27772[/ATTACH]\n\nNow the next thing was to find a remedy for it. Well the solution is surely a new breech seal but question remains, where to find one. So till the time I could find this part, I thought to create a makeshift arrangement and that was by using O-Rings. Pictured below (source Internet).\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]27771[/ATTACH]\n\nI joined together two O-rings (same diameter as the breech seal) with UHU adhesive and after several hours to let it dry out, I pushed it inside the breech. The makeshift arrangement of O-rings sat in the cavity very easily. I fed a pellet in the rifle and the sweet symphony of the "shrraakhhh" sound (still dont know its right term :( ) brought tears in my eyes. (Now I am being toooo dramatic... lol). \n\nI wanted to check the power of the gun so shot a couple of Gamo promags on a concrete wall from a side angle [I](Caution: Be very careful when doing this because the pellet can ricochet back at you)[/I]. The following picture of disintegrated pellets demonstrates the achieved result wrt the power of the gun. \n[ATTACH=CONFIG]27774[/ATTACH]\n\nThe vibration in the gun was almost NIL and there was no air leakage from any side. Tried out the rifle on a paper target from 17 yards (the max distance available to me on my roof top) and it made a half-inch group with 5 pellets. :)\n\nLater on while discussing the whole setup with brother Khilji, I was guided by him that I can make a breech seal out of a Teflon rod. Teflon is softer than plastic and settles down very quickly and its service life is also better as compared to plastic (The original breech seal in the gun was made of plastic). \nRegarding checking the sealant capability of the new setup of O-Rings, Khilji suggested that when the breech and compression cylinder are shut, vacuum should be created in the barrel by sucking out the air with mouth and then placing the tongue on the barrel. If it sticks, mission accomplished; and if it doesnt, there is still leak in the whole setup. I tried it out and got a complete vacuum inside the barrel ([U][I]Mission Accomplished[/I][/U]) along with a nasty taste of WD40 in my mouth. eeeekhhhh. :D', 1, 0, '182.181.133.105', 0, 1, 4, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

Back even a few decades ago it required specialized equipment that not even all ammunition manufacturers owned, much less gun manufacturers.  Now electronic pressure sensors are cheap enough that even individuals might purchase them... but the "industry standard" method, required by law in some countries, if the "proof test", where a gun type, or each individual gun, is tested with a special high-pressure cartridge.  The proof test is very simple; if the gun is damaged, it fails.

These sensors directly measure the strain (elongation) developed in the barrel.

See if you sold this gun you will suffer loss of app 3k to 4k and when you purchase new one may be its little bit costly as fixed barrels are costly then break barral, so you will loose your money why not to spent that money on a good scope you can get good scope at 4k to 5k and a very good one at about 6 k to 9k it will increase the range and  accuracy of you shots and solve you barral drop problem as well.

I have small hands and it has got a generous grip, original configuration is 15+1, for Canada it is 10+1, hence the magazine is punched. Front sight is fiber optic.

Heres why: Despite the third gens only have right handed mag releases and me being a lefty, I prefer the slimmer button over the wider and flatter gen4''s. Another thing is the grip texturing, although neither is perfect IMO, with the gen4''s being too aggressive and the Gen 3''s not aggressive enough, my money still goes to the 3rd Gen for being more comfortable overall. Sizewise, even though the 4th Gens have multiple back straps, the 3rd Gen SF grip is a perfect fit for me. However that point may be moot if you''re deciding on a 9mm. Lastly i''m not a huge fan of the dual captured recoil spring. Irrespective of reliability, the ejection pattern is just not consistent enough in terms of distance and direction. However, my Gen4 is an early production piece from several years ago and I do not have extensive experience with newer examples. Regardless, Glock rose to fame and prominence with the original spring, and there was no need to "improve" that particular component. In that regard, it was change just for the sake of change IMO. Although that''s just one person''s opinion, there must be many others like me, since Gen 3''s are still in the current production line up.[/INDENT]\n\n\n\n[/COLOR]', 1, 1, '24.85.141.11', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

In these instances, armed intruders enter the home  and intimidate the homeowner and their family until they get [IMG]http://images.homedefensegun.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Fotolia_40034507_460.jpg[/IMG]what they want. Unfortunately, they often leave members of the household injured or murdered in their wake.\n\n In a recent news story a homeowner was the subject of such a  strong-arm robbery. The homeowner was a gun owner who kept several  firearms for self-defense. Unfortunately, the firearms were left on a  bedroom nightstand and none were in his possession when he was accosted  in his living room.\n All too often this is the case with people who keep a firearm for  self-defense. They may carry concealed religiously in public, but fall  into a sense of complacency when they return to their homes and leave  their firearm in a safe or on a nightstand.\n The best way to prepare for this type of scenario is carrying a handgun in the house.\n [h=2]Comfort[/h] One of the reasons most gun owners do not carry in the home is due to  the lack of comfort of wearing a holstered firearm when they are  relaxing. This is usually an equipment issue that can be overcome by  changing holsters. An inside the waistband type of holster may not be  comfortable to wear while seated in front of a TV or otherwise relaxing  at home. In such cases a shoulder holster can be worn instead or a  smaller handgun can be carried in an appropriate pocket holster.\n Even if the handgun carried in question is a small caliber that may  be considered marginal for neutralizing a threat, it can prove to be  very effective at fighting your way to a larger handgun or long gun in  the home that is more suitable for repelling boarders.\n [h=2]Safety[/h] Another reason to carry inside the house is the matter of safety.   First a handgun on your body is not going to find its way into a  toddler’s hands or the hands of a child friend of the family.  If the  gun isn’t on your body, it needs to be secured which will delay your  access to it when you need it.\n Also in the safety mode is the idea that you put on the gun when you  get dressed in the morning and take it off when you put on your pajamas.  Read the article on [URL="http://www.homedefensegun.net/dropping-a-gun/"]Dropping Your Gun.[/URL]   The less you mess with your piece will reduce the change of dropping  it, misplacing it or “forgetting it” when you just head down to the  neighborhood store.\n \n [h=2]Ignore the myths[/h] A common and persistent myth is that a home invader need only hear the [URL="http://www.homedefensegun.net/3-shotgun-myths/"]sound of a shotgun action racking a round[/URL]  into the chamber or see a red laser dot superimposed on their chest to  make them flee in terror. These may work in the case of a burglar  stumbling into what he thought was a vacant home and is only looking for  an escape route. Chances are, if you are subject to a real home  invasion, that the invaders will not be so easily dissuaded. More often  than not, they may be targeting your home because they know that you  have firearms and they may be anticipating a fight.\n Should that be the case, be prepared to [URL="http://www.homedefensegun.net/psychology-of-gun-ownership/"]go all the way [/URL]when  it comes to taking the fight to the intruders. Simply displaying a  handgun, a laser or racking a shotgun’s action will not always dissuade  the most hardened types who will more than likely be your assailants.\n [h=2]Paranoia or Preparedness[/h] Some people scoff at the notion as they believe (and rightfully so)  that their home is their “castle”. Some go as far as to scoff at those  who carry in the home thinking that they may be paranoid. Yet, the gun  owners who have ended up as victims would probably welcome the thought  of carrying in their home if they had the opportunity.\n There is often an air of superiority carried by fellow gun owners  when it comes to carrying in the home that borders on ridicule. Such  persons will say: “What are you expecting, a home invasion or zombie  attack?”\n The simplest way to dismiss these conversations is to answer their  question with one of your own, such as: “Do you have a fire extinguisher  in your house because you plan on burning it down?”\n There is no shame in being prepared. There is a difference between  carrying your firearm in the house and sitting in a makeshift bunker  wearing Threat Level IIIIA body armor, a gas mask and helmet while  having a loaded select fire BAR (Browning automatic rifle) at the ready  with an Uzi pistol in a shoulder holster and cameras monitoring your  doors and windows 24 hours a day.\n Keeping the appropriate level of awareness goes hand-in-hand with  preparedness when it comes to the safety of you and your family.\n\n[/QUOTE]', 1, 1, '58.27.215.126', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

This is probably one of the most serious safety  breaches that can [IMG]http://images.homedefensegun.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Fotolia_51127489_XS.jpg[/IMG]occur both from the danger of getting shot and from the danger of losing your CCW license if in public.\n [h=3]Obey the Police[/h] Now before we go further, if you are involved in a shooting and the  police arrive or if the police stop you and tell you to drop the gun –  you need to drop the gun.  A lot of things  are going on right here; all of which can end up extremely badly for  you.  Police responding to a shooting call are already extremely on  edge, they will want to make the scene safe as fast as possible. As  Massad Ayoob explains in this [URL="http://www.homedefensegun.net/massad-ayoob/"]video[/URL]  you need to drop the gun if they tell you to. Don’t try to put it on  the ground slowly, that is a move that bad guys use to make a quick move  on the police.  Don’t try to explain how you are cooperating and then  try to lay it gently on the ground. That’s not cooperating. If the  police tell you to drop it, [B]drop it[/B].\n [h=3]If It Falls, Let it Drop[URL="http://amzn.to/1c23jwo"][IMG]http://images.homedefensegun.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/414w0cQHqKL._SY300_.jpg[/IMG][/URL][/h] If you happen to lose control of your gun, either on the range or it  just falls out of your hand or holster, let it drop.  It is extremely  dangerous to try and grab the weapon in the air. There is a chance you  will get tangled up in the trigger and it could go off. Modern weapons  are fairly drop safe and it is much better to let the internal safeties  work instead of trying to grab it.\n [h=3]Don’t Fool with It[/h] The best way to prevent a drop is to [URL="http://amzn.to/1fCbArw"]carry it securely[/URL]  and not fool with your weapon. A good practice to get into is to put on  your weapon when you get dressed in the morning and don’t touch it  until you get undressed to go to bed.

They announced XL 50, XL 100 and XL 200. I will be reviewing XL 200 here. Most often I do come across many people pondering upon the issue, as to which flashlight is just perfect? It is a fact I must say that nothing perfect exists in this world. No single gun can serve all your purposes and no single car can give you the comfort, speed and economy. Same is the case with flashlights. Usually the dilemma here face by us is that we often do not have a broad range of choices to choose from.\r\nThere are many big names in the flashlight industry that I must say are producing high-end flashlights, but as they say you get what you pay for.  The matter of flashlights among our hunting communities is so less discussed that most of us even don’t know what we want from a flashlight. When we speak of some Chinese LED flashlights we see long long beams that one couldn’t have ever thought of in the incandescent times. And when we see a flashlight as such we instantly become impressed with its range. But I must say we do not consider that following things that are necessary :\r\n1)	Is the long beam alone enough?\r\n2)	Intensity of the light itself that is emitted.\r\n3)	Backup time and power saving options.\r\n4)	Ease of backup of power\r\nWe  know that the longer the beam of a flashlight is, the narrower the spot becomes, and even if it widens, then it might only at a distance at which the human eye might not see properly as a result I must say that the greed for having a long range flashlight basically nullifies. Hence what a person needs is an optimum balance or equilibrium between the brightness and spot of beam. That is the reason most of high end flashlight manufacturers are rather focusing on their flashlights to have more flood than spot. The other problem with having a really tight beam and a long ranged flashlight ends up in a scenario that it usually is very uncomfortable for one’s eyes at a closer distance  and same problem at the longer distance that I have pointed to earlier.\r\nIntensity of the light is an important factor. The intensity of light I measured in lumens. Now there are some real big claims by the flashlight manufacturers in the market, that are really tempting to read but most of them don’t even reach 1/8th of their claim. \r\nThe other problem is even if a flashlight tends to give the claimed light output then the question is for how much time does it gives lumens at par on a fresh set of batteries? Then we also see that most of the rechargeable flashlights have a specialized set of batteries that once expired become very difficult, if not impossible to avail from the market. And most such flashlights also have just one mode to operate on. Thus the user has no options to make the flashlight adaptable to his requirements and conditions of use.\r\nFurther the problem is faced when one tends to go out on an outdoor trip for a couple of days, and when there aren’t any charging options available in the wild. So also the easy availability of extra batteries is always a plus.\r\nWhen we think of all such questions then we have an answer; The Maglite XL 200! Having a length of just 4.8” ma diameter of 1” and a weight of 104 grams(without batteries) it easily slips into your pocket without causing any trouble and it is obviously lightweight and quite a pleasure to handle. It has a glossy smooth finish. It operates on 3 AAA size batteries that sit in the battery compartment of the Maglite XL 200. The Maglite XL 200 provides 172 lumens and has 5 modes of operation. All the modes are operated from the single tail cap switch that is equipped with latest motion sensors. Following are the modes.\r\n1)	1 click starts the flashlight on high mode\r\nWhen the user presses the tail cap switch the flashlight turns on a high mode. But that’s not just the end of it. If you press and hold the switch after one click then the flashlight lets you adjust the intensity of the light by rotating your hand either in a clockwise or in an anti-clock wise direction. The XL 200 has a memory so when you switch on the flashlight next time it would start at the same power that you had set on the previously.\r\n2)	2 clicks start the strobe mode.\r\nWhen the user presses the switch twice the flashlight starts in the strobe mode, but here also if you press the switch twice and hold it the flashlight would let you adjust the frequency of the strobes with clock or anti-clock wise movement of your hand. And also the intensity of light that you had sat in first mode would be the same for the strobe mode and all other modes as well. There is also a memory for the strobe setting as well.\r\n3)	3 clicks start the night mode.\r\nWhen the user press the switch thrice the flashlight starts in the night mode i.e. the flashlight would start with full light, and slowly dim down the lowest output, but as you will move the flashlight, the flashlight again goes to full light. The XL200  can operate upto 216 hours in this mode. This mode is very useful when you want to save batteries and have some light around you and because of the motion sensor it enables you to quickly check your surroundings without disturbing the switch.\r\n4)	4 clicks signal mode\r\nWhen the user presses the switch four times the signal mode is activated, the intensity of the light would the same as the user has set in mode one. In this method the flashlight automatically turns on or off by rotating it clockwise or anti-clock wise.\r\n5)	5 clicks start the SOS mode.\r\n By pressing the switch five times the flashlight starts in the SOS mode i.e. a specialized sequence of strobes. \r\n\r\nOverall the Maglite XL 200 is a fantastic flashlight at a price tag of nearly Rs 6000. The fact that it uses AAA batteries enables you to get as much backup as you want and the batteries are very easily available. The latest trend in flashlights is CR123 batteries, but the greatest disadvantage with CR123 battery operated flashlights is that they tend to die out immediately as the battery power goes below a certain level. Whereas with Maglite XL 200 I have used my rechargeable batteries for over 20 days but the flashlight didn’t die out. In the end I would like to say that the Maglite Inc has done magic producing this little gadget.', 1, 1, '182.182.94.71', 0, 1, 2, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

It&#8217;s built with a G34 slide width on a G21 Gen 4  frame, saving 1.5 ounces over a standard G21 Gen4. It all boils down to  a new Practical/Tactical model in .45, much like the Glock Model 34 and  35 (9mm and .40 S&W respectively). The benefits of the legacy  Practical/Tactical models will carry over to the new G41, such as a  maximized sight radius, improved weight distribution and a refined  balance. \n\nOne of the added benefits of a slimmer slide mounted on a G21 Gen4  frame is the shelf created in and around the takedown lever. This shelf  serves as a great spot to place your support-hand thumb to gain greater  leverage and control over the pistol during rapid-fire strings. Glocks  are one of the few pistols available with this feature.\n\n\n&#8220;[I]The longer barrel and slide on the G41 Gen4 helps to reduce muzzle  flip and felt recoil, while the longer sight radius makes the pistol  more accurate for competition or duty use,&#8221; says Glock Vice President  Josh Dorsey. &#8220;This pistol is ideally suited for tactical use, both on  and off the range.[/I]&#8221;\n\n \nAs with all Gen4 Glock pistols, the G41 comes with all the standard  features common on other Generation 4 pistols, such as the modular  backstrap design, the Gen4&#8217;s excellent rough texture frame and a dual  recoil spring assembly.\n\n[LEFT][COLOR=#000000]\n[B]G41 Specifications\n\n[/B]Dimensions\n\nLength (overall): 226 mm / 8.90 in.\nLength (slide): 211 mm / 8.31 in.\nWidth: 32.5 mm / 1.28 in.\nHeight (with magazine): 139 mm / 5.47 in.\nBarrel length: 135 mm / 5.31 in.\nLength of twist: 400 mm / 15.75 in.\nTrigger distance: 72.5 mm / 2.85 in.\nTrigger travel: 12.5 mm / .49 in.\nBarrel distance: 20 mm / 0.79 in.\nLine of sight (polymer): 192 mm / 7.56 in.\n\nWeight\n\nPistol without magazine: 690 g / 24 oz.\nMagazine std. empty: 85 g / 3 oz.\nMagazine std. full: 340 g / 12 oz.\nMagazine Capacity (rounds): 13\nBarrel Profile: right hand twist; octagonal\nStandard Trigger Pull: ~5.62 lbs.\nMuzzle Velocity*: 853 fps\nMuzzle Energy*: 347 fps\n\n*[I]Dependent on ammunition[/I][LEFT][COLOR=#000000]\n\n[/COLOR][/LEFT]\n[/COLOR][/LEFT]', 1, 1, '39.52.31.6', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

The  G42 is still classic Glock design though, albeit a scaled down version  of its larger brethren. It maintains all of the same great attributes  Glock is known for, such as: simplicity, natural grip-angle, low  bore-axis, intuitively placed controls, and reliability. One feature of  particular note retained from the originals is the Glock Safe Action  System trigger. This new pistol maintains the same trigger consistency,  pull weight and safety features found in the models you&#8217;re already  familiar with.\n\n\n The slim design of the G42 fits the hands of any shooter;  specifically it gives those with smaller hands a comfortable option like  they&#8217;ve never seen before. Most compact pistols have been shunned  because they&#8217;re too small and are not comfortable to shoot. The new G42  won&#8217;t share that reputation. It doesn&#8217;t feel like you&#8217;re grasping the  pistol with only two fingers, and thanks to an integral beavertail, the  backstrap and slide won&#8217;t feel as though they&#8217;ll dig into your hand each  time the pistol cycles. Another benefit of the beavertail is that it  helps set your grip from the draw, allowing for consistent firing-hand  placement each time you draw the pistol. \n\nThe G42 is a great step in that direction and there are plenty of  benefits to a carrying a backup.380, especially as one as compact as the  Glock 42. Most of the shooting/carrying  population will feel as though they have full control of this pistol,  especially under recoil. All of this translates into a very dependable  package.\n[LEFT][COLOR=#000000]\n\n[B]G42 Specifications\n\n[/B]Dimensions \n\nLength (overall): 151 mm / 5.94 in.\nLength (slide cpl.): 146 mm / 5.75 in.\nWidth: 24 mm / 0.94 in.\nHeight (with magazine): 105 mm / 4.13 in.\nBarrel length: 82.5 mm / 3.25 in.\nLength of twist: 250 mm / 9.84 in.\nTrigger distance: 61 mm / 2.40 in.\nTrigger travel: 12.5 mm / .49 in.\nBarrel distance: 18 mm / 0.71 in.\nLine of sight (polymer): 125 mm / 4.92 in.\n\nWeight\n\nPistol without magazine: 350 g / 12.35 oz.\nMagazine std. empty: 40 g / 1.41 oz.\nMagazine std. full: 57 g / 2.01 oz.\nMagazine Capacity (rounds): 6\nBarrel Profile: right hand twist; hexagonal\nStandard Trigger Pull: ~5.62 lbs.\nMuzzle Velocity*: 886 fps\nMuzzle Energy*: 162 fps\n\n*[I]Dependent on ammunition[/I]\n[LEFT][COLOR=#000000]\n\n[SIZE=1](copy and type from February 2014 issue G&A magazine)[/SIZE]\n[/COLOR][/LEFT]\n[/COLOR][/LEFT]', 1, 1, '39.52.31.6', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

This has double meanings. I see a few poses with fingers on triggers and guns pointing in unsafe directions. Here are time tested rules for firearm safety, follow them so everyone arrives home safely that evening.\n\nColonel Jeff Cooper''s Four Basic Rules Of Firearm Safety: \n&#61623; All guns are always loaded. (means consider them loaded at all times)\n&#61623; Never let the muzzle cover anything you are not willing to destroy. (that includes the Mother-in-law)\n&#61623; Keep your finger off the trigger till your sights are on the target. \n&#61623; Identify your target, and what is behind it. (just in case if the round goes through the target, what is it going to hit behind your target?)\n\n\nFrom personal experience I can tell you that you want everyone at the range to follow rules, otherwise it can be uncomfortable in the least to be at such a place. I have been to unsupervised shooting ranges here in Canada and sometimes because of the unsafe behavior of people, I leave so I can live to comeback another day! We humans are prone to mistakes, sometime it is easy to forget that the gun has a round chambered etc. If you follow the golden rules above, you would avoid errors and keep everyone safe. Specially guys who are new shooters like me, try to get into good habits in the start. Here is a fun example that I witnessed a lifetime ago.\nWe were out at the shooting range in KHI for our NCC. I was second in line, they were giving each guy 8 round stripper clip to fire in prone position. We were supervised by poorly trained Army medical core guy. The guy ahead of me (Kazim) was done shooting his clip, they collected the fired cartridges and he had 7. They won''t let him go until they found the 8th round, which made sense. So we are looking around for the spent case and someone suggested maybe he didn''t fire the last round. At this point the "instructor" was in the 2 feet deep ditch exactly in front of Kazim''s shooting position and searching for the spent case. Kazim walks back to the rifle that is lying at the shooting position and calmly presses the trigger to see if it were loaded!!!!!!! BANG.......... sweeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeennnnnnnnnnnnnnnn!!!!! The bullet hit the sand about 2 feet from the "instructors" feet and man did he JUMP...... Well give Kazim some credit, HURRRRAAAYYYYYY, he found your lost cartridge!!!! Why are you yelling and swearing at him and trying to beat him to the ground "instructor"??????\nI hope you get my point. Happy and safe shooting, But remember safety starts with you! It''s never the gun but the person behind it...... that reminds me of another incident that happened way back when.\nWe were out hunting ( or pretending to hunt) near Sheikhupura, I had an old 12 gauge that we had borrowed from my friends guard. I fired at a bush, click and nothing!!!!! I cocked the hammer back again and click and nothing. I believe it was a slow ignition, one is supposed to keep the firearm pointed in the safe direction for 30 seconds if that happens, just in case if it goes off. Ofcourse I didn''t know that, but common sense prevailed and I held the gun in both hands pointed upwards and was thinking of breaking it open and ejecting the shell when it fired, BANGGGG!!! and since it was not on my shoulder the recoil pushed it down and it ended with the muzzle close to my nose!!!! I did feels some wind go through my hair, which I had plenty of back then!! I was lucky!!! I am lucky!!! It takes one BAANGGG to ruin lives!!! Please learn from other people''s experiences.\nGood luck and have fun on your next range trip, keep us posted, I always like to see happy faces. Also I find it COOLER to have the trigger finger on the frame or the slide in a picture....', 1, 0, '173.209.122.102', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

He while shocked just checked if the kids were OK and Alhamdulillah everything was fine except the rear glass.\n\nAfter returning home when he closely examined the car there was a dent on the right edge of the roof, almost where the rear glass meets the body.

You see the Lahore Gymkhana golf course is right next to the Jail Road, and the 14th hole of the course is parallel to the road. As such, a mis-hit from the tee, results in the golf balls landing on the Jail Road and specifically in the area where the cars stop at the traffic lights. There was an incident a few years ago, wherein a woman banker was hit on the head while she was seated on the back car seat and the car had stopped at the traffic lights. Luckily she survived, because as you can see for yourself, the golf ball can do a lot of damage. I think the whole family was very lucky that the ball didn''t hit a few inches lower, otherwise it could have been very dangerous, and thank god for that.\nThe club administration really needs to think about how they can put some ''barrier'' to prevent golf balls flying off to the main road. Some suggestions were given a few years back but then the cost of the solution prevented any further action from being taken.\nI myslef have been lucky to escape being hit as i have seen, at least on two occasions, golf balls falling on the road in front of the car. And since I play there regularly, it is one of the holes I really dread to hit my shot on, and hence always get a bad score on it. \nAnyway, hope this clears the confusion and again, thank God that no injuries were caused by this incident.', 1, 0, '182.189.56.244', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

Don''t get me wrong, I am a proud American, I''m not saying whether I''m red or blue, but I am a pro gun supporter, NFA (in CDA) and NRA (in USA) lifetime member, and thus receive all their publications and email correspondence... you don''t have to be the sharpest guy in town to see through to the true intention of these "informational" articles. Picking out one or two to read, it may actually seem logical, but when you''re literally bombarded with the entire "series" of writings, the actual agenda becomes glaringly apparent.\n\nAnyways ED, WROL stands for "without rule of law". It''s a term coined by an American Youtuber and has been popularized by preppers around the world (apparently). What are "preppers" you ask? They are people who anticipate civilization coming to an end in one way or another, and [I]prepare[/I] for it. Some "extremists" have underground bunkers reminiscent of the cold war, supply rooms that could be confused with a grocery store, weapons to arm a platoon, and enough ammo to fight a small war. \nThere''s probably a little prepper in most guys, I''m sure many of us have played the "what if" game; I have some basic survival stuff with extra food and ammo, but I''m not a prepper by any means... I''d probably be considered a wannabe prepper :)', 1, 1, '24.114.36.190', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

They  have to have their way, and if you disagree with them, they will impose their will upon you by way of ridiculing, criticizing every post you make, and mocking every thought you share. Sure it''s just the Internet, but nonetheless, just words can make people feel very uncomfortable. As a result, members post less and less, then stop posting, and if the harrassment continues, they eventually stop visiting the forum (or blog, or website, or channel) altogether.

I have quoted were from the picture which the chief has uploaded in his thread "the 9mm ammunition report". If you check the picture where he shows the crate of red box ammo he has procured, it clearly states a gas pressure of 300 MPa. I might be completely off in my conversion from MPa to psi because I just used an online convertor.', 1, 0, '66.249.81.16', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

To my surprise it won''t fit. Then i realize that the 12 Shot Baikal MP442 has a bigger and square trigger guard and the barrel is also slightly longer :frusty::frusty::frusty:. Wasted few hours figuring it out what to do. Then i realized that if i cut a little potion from the holster where its rounded off, the gun might fit. But there was no guaranty that the gun will fit and holster won''t be ruined. But if i didn''t try the holster was of no use so i scratched my head couple of time being a gun enthusiast improvised a bit.

I  discovered this forum accidentally when searching for skeet resources in  Pakistan.\n\nHere is my brief introduction in firearms context:\n\n\n[LIST]\n[*]Got my introduction to guns at age 5 - exclusively  airgun. Used to save my eidee to shoot the airgun and pop some balloons  at close range. This  was (feeling nostalgic) an entertainment provided  by street hawkers where I used to live in Karachi.  I still remember   those airguns that were so loose that you have to hold them at breech  while shooting so they don''t open during aiming/shooting.\n[/LIST]\n\n\n[LIST]\n[*]Some introductory shooting while accompanying my grandpa during hunting trips around age 10.\n[/LIST]\n\n\n[LIST]\n[*]Cadet (Military) around age 13-19 : Real fun begins.  Everything from M1-Kali-bar (punn intended) to G3 (yeap - full auto),  SMG (H&K variant), heavy machine guns.  Got good education on  firearm safety/cleaning, marksmanship (very basic), some local  competition at regimental level.\n[/LIST]\n\n\n[LIST]\n[*]Quite period for next 6 years. Higher ed is really expensive and no free time for any hobby like this.\n[/LIST]\n\n\n[LIST]\n[*]Extended quite period for 3 years - Country of residence with restrictive laws for non-citizens when it comes to firearms.\n[/LIST]\n\n\n[LIST]\n[*]Last 7 years:\n[LIST]\n[*]Started with pistols - First with IDPA, then stuck with USPSA (Product division) in US.\n[*]Regional rifle competitions.\n[*]Some regional wins when in California and went to nationals once.\n[*]Not much winning chance since moving to Texas. Competition is very tough and eyes sight issues  start to creep up during same time.\n[*]Also lost the shooting partner. So now pistol shooting is  limited to occasional (~once in 2 month) outings, purely  entertainment/defensive practice only.\n[*]Complete surprise: Got  second place (mostly luck and some  experience, and not much skill) in local club shoot tourney that was  Beretta sponsored. Won SV-10 Prevail O/U. Tried to sell it,  unsuccessfully (I had no appreciation back then for shotguns).\n[*]End up taking it to clay sports range at the behest of a friend who is an avid shotgunner.\n[/LIST]\n \n[/LIST]\n\n\n[LIST]\n[*]The rest is history.. I am addicted to shotgunning and  decided to keep the O/U. Shooting a stationary target/poking holes in  paper is not fun anymore.\n[/LIST]\n\n\n[LIST]\n[*]Found trap quite boring. Getting addicted to Skeet. Sporting Clays is fun but bit expensive specially when volume shooting.\n[/LIST]\n\n\n[LIST]\n[*]Became member at the Sportsman Club, took lessons, go  there every chance I get. Recently, got my first straight 25. Trying to  repeat that with some consistency and go for 100 straight as my next  goal. Still very very new to skeet.\n[/LIST]\n\nI am in midst of moving right now. I am figuring out custom laws,  firearms licenses in Pak/Sindh, buyers to sell my modest collection  locally, and finding out if I can carry on with Skeet  after moving. I  find this forum extremely useful. \n\nAt the same time I am some what disappointed with the limited skeet  scene and cost prohibitive to some degree. I am hoping this is not true  when I discover something different after I am here physically (wishful  thinking???). I probably need to take initiative with your support to  change this (and rekindle old relationships with my old buddies in  military).\n\nLooking forward to learn a lot from you all, and contribute whatever I can.\n\nRegards,\nskeet-newb', 1, 0, '75.62.16.125', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

So this event was for military personnel.  Hence no civilians.\n\nGranted that scores were not good at all, it takes lot of practice AND good instructor AND mental training is a must to shoot perfect score.  Free stuff (if indeed truly the case) is a huge break, no doubt. BUT it is not enough to win competitions.  I would also question how much time the participants had to prepare and if it was truly UNLIMITED free resources AND time.  I know that Col/Brgd have lot of command responsibilities as well as junior officers are kept very busy.\n\nRandom ideas: Should get some experienced AAA battery gunners since they are used to shooting at moving targets and know concept of lead/projectile motion/trigonometry. Although I am not sure if they (or AAA batteries as part of Civil defense) are still around.  \n\nI bet Pak military have some excellent rifle/pistol marksmen. But as per my experience and according to master level shotgun instructors, these are some of the toughest students to teach shotgunning.\n\nWhat I have gathered from reading some posts on this forum, military has offered some of its facilities for public use (albeit not open access) such as Karsaz and  a range in Lahore??. \nArmy used to offer NCC for intermediate students as part of civil defense training (remember M1 kali-bar and "duroost shist kee tareef" ??).  So I would not blame military in keeping civilians away from firearms.\n\nDisclaimers: Very new to skeet.

It was made in Hungary by FEG, and not many were imported to my country before FEG went out of business. \r\n\r\n Though the GKK looks much like a Browning High-Power, and FEG made various pistols either similar to or interchangeable with the High-Power, the GKK''s resemblance is only superficial.  Internally, it looks similar to a Smith & Wesson Model 59.\r\n\r\n The GKK is double action.  The safety also acts as a decocker.

The one with the thicker pad is an aftermarket ProMag and holds 8, for 7+1 or 8+1.  I have two of those.\r\n\r\n The holster is a Galco "Miami Classic II" shoulder rig.  Almost all modern holsters, including the rest of Galco''s product line, are formed to fit specific pistols.  This one is for a 1911, but it was soft suede instead of hardened leather.  I had to move the rivet forward about 13mm and stretch the leather under the guard another 13mm or so by soaking the holster overnight in warm water.  The stretched leather kept its shape when it dried.\r\n\r\n The GKK is almost exactly the same size as a 1911; my trusty Norinco is shown for comparison.  However, the GKK''s trigger guard is longer and deeper.  The GKK is also heavy; it weighs 1.25kg according to the data sheet.\r\n\r\n The rubber sleeve on the grip is a slide-on part from Hogue.  I found the front radius of the GKK''s grip to be sharpish and uncomfortable.

We expect Nikoo to do better next time otherwise according to his trainer, he will be riding high tides, lol. \n\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]28182[/ATTACH]\nUnlike our last venture, this time we were sufficiently stocked with water and even Nikoo had chances to quench his thirst. \n\nWe started of at 9:30 in the morning (pretty late for a morning session), and interestingly the first thing we came across was a four footer, a dark gray wild boar. It came out of the bushes 25 meters from us and dashed away from our party. The beast must be around roughly 140 pounds and I have to be honest here that I got a little scared as the cartridges in the chamber were No 6 and these loads only scratch the dust off these fatties. Fortunately the boar was running away from us so out of "Chuul", I sent both shots at its hinds; the boar didnt even flinch and kept on running. Immediately it entered dense vegetation and we lost track of it (BTW I was not at all in favor of tracking it down. lol). \n[ATTACH=CONFIG]28184[/ATTACH]\nWith in next 5 minutes we saw a hare and it too vanished in a glance. I am very sure that the bloody nibbler showed itself to us as a teaser only. lol. \n\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]28183[/ATTACH]\nThis gray francolin was the first blood of the day. A fellow hunter shot at it, missed and the bird took a right turn directly over my head. I took a shot and dropped it several meters from us. This was the first bird we found after almost 3 hours of search. \n\nThere was a break for tea :) at around 1:00 pm where we took the following pictures. \n[ATTACH=CONFIG]28186[/ATTACH]\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]28187[/ATTACH]\n\nAt zuhar time, we reached a rain-filled pond and started getting ready for prayers. The water in the pond was cold like ice and didnt taste funny at all. lol. The surrounding fields were irrigated through it and according to a shepherd they used this water for cooking purposes as well in dire situations. What are [I]dire situations [/I]I really didn''t ask and wouldn''t like to know. :(\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]28191[/ATTACH]\n\nWe concluded our session (which lasted the whole day) at about 4:45 pm till then I had shot another black francolin. We had to head back to Peshawar as it was getting late (the outskirts of DAK especially Matani area is notorious so wanted to cross it as soon as possible). The 3 birds bag was photographed in the boot of my car. :)\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]28192[/ATTACH]\n\nIn the end a concluding pose for the camera ;)\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]28193[/ATTACH]', 1, 0, '39.50.42.104', 0, 1, 10, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

The information is wonderful to have.\n\nI currently have a Norinco Type 54 pistol, which honestly, i don''t like. It jamms all the time and i doubt it''s held in high regard on here. I suspect it''s not been properly maintained in the past. Also, my local arms dealer (back road type), said in a pack of 50 bullets, 2-4 will jam. This is rubbish right?\n\nAnyway i would like to buy an upgrade and my budget is probably around 80k. I can go higher, but only if the gains are a lot to get.\n\nI''ve currently got my eyes on a Taurus PT99, mainly because it looks nice lol. Also i''ve only read positive reviews. I have rung Hira Arms in Lahore (quite rude!), Orient Trading (nice) and P.A.R.A (impressive). The last 2 have quoted me 75k for the PT99, but only PARA said there is a guarantee with it. I live in Jhelum but i''m prepared to travel to Lahore for the perfect gun. \n\nI require a handgun for SD and home defense. I will be carrying it around daily. I''d like something that looks the part and sounds loud lol. That''s my only concern with the PT99, will it be too bulky? Will it feel ok in a holster? I have looked at other makes, such as CZ, but i think they are over 100k? I may go to target practice but thats not a definite. \n\nAre there any other recommendations you could make, and would appreciate if you could include your reasoning.

The information is wonderful to have.\n\nI currently have a Norinco Type 54 pistol, which honestly, i don''t like. It jamms all the time and i doubt it''s held in high regard on here. I suspect it''s not been properly maintained in the past. Also, my local arms dealer (back road type), said in a pack of 50 bullets, 2-4 will jam. This is rubbish right?\n\nAnyway i would like to buy an upgrade and my budget is probably around 80k. I can go higher, but only if the gains are a lot to get.\n\nI''ve currently got my eyes on a Taurus PT99, mainly because it looks nice lol. Also i''ve only read positive reviews. I have rung Hira Arms in Lahore (quite rude!), Orient Trading (nice) and P.A.R.A (impressive). The last 2 have quoted me 75k for the PT99, but only PARA said there is a guarantee with it. I live in Jhelum but i''m prepared to travel to Lahore for the perfect gun. \n\nI require a handgun for SD and home defense. I will be carrying it around daily. I''d like something that looks the part and sounds loud lol. That''s my only concern with the PT99, will it be too bulky? Will it feel ok in a holster? I have looked at other makes, such as CZ, but i think they are over 100k? I may go to target practice but thats not a definite. \n\nAre there any other recommendations you could make, and would appreciate if you could include your reasoning. I would also appreciate it if you could suggest decent highly regarded arms retailers in Lahore. I am planning to make the trip down to Lahore soon, i can''t wait to hold a good handgun :)[/QUOTE]\n\nWelcome to Pakguns bro. PT99 is a good choice. It reliable, durable and very accurate too. I just don''t like the SS one. It looks very Sunjay Dutt or Filmy you might say. Black one looks like a real gun. if you can increase your budget slightly, then go for Cz 75b in SS if you like flashy stuff. Or you can also go for P07 Duty. A polymer CZ75. You can never go wrong with a Cz. Rest is your choice. If you want Filmy stuff or not.....', 1, 1, '173.245.221.29', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

I am another American who is very interested in your struggle for legal guns in the country of Pakistan.  I thought perhaps my brothers in gun ownership would like to see some of the Smith and Wesson M&P or military and police line pistols.  It is odd that they call them M&P in this way because they are available to any citizen who is legally allowed to own a gun.  \n\nI own three of the smith and wesson line.  They are the MP9c which is the compact version, the MP9 which is the fullsize version at 4.25 inches barrel length and the MP22 which is the .22 long rifle training pistol.  I will also share a bit about the MP9 PRO which is a version of the long pistol at a 5 inch barrel.  In fact this barrel is 5.7 inches as it is a threaded version.  I hope very much they my friends in pakistan will be allowed to bring Smith and Wesson guns into your country because they are of very fine quality.\n\nI will tell you that the smith and wesson pistol is my favorite line of pistol.  They range in price in USD between 400 and 750 dollars depending on what you get.  This is also about the same price as most glocks in our country cost.  I enjoy reading about shooters with glocks in pakistan.  I also have shot many glocks and I do like them but they do not fit my hand well.  \n\nLet us look at some pictures ok?\n\n\n[URL="http://s34.photobucket.com/user/1czshooter/media/20140121_191011_zps8ac1dea5.jpg.html"][IMG]http://i34.photobucket.com/albums/d130/1czshooter/20140121_191011_zps8ac1dea5.jpg[/IMG][/URL]\nThis is a line up of the pistols from smith and wesson that I own as well as a second mp22 that belongs to my father.  The far left is the mp9c there are two mp22 in the middle and the mp9 is on the right.  \n\n\n\n[URL="http://s34.photobucket.com/user/1czshooter/media/20140121_191045_zps169b0473.jpg.html"][IMG]http://i34.photobucket.com/albums/d130/1czshooter/20140121_191045_zps169b0473.jpg[/IMG][/URL]\nThis is the MP9c it is a very nice smaller compact gun.  The magazines shown with it are 12 round capacity.  There are two different magazine types one that is flat at the bottom which is the smallest possible carry size and the other that has a finger groove to make shooting more comfortable.  I have seen several pak built guns that are made in the same way and it seems great minds think a like.  I carry this gun with me at almost all times.  There are some places that we Americans cannot carry a gun at which point of course I follow the law.  One interesting point about the 9C is that it accepts the other fullsized magazines allowing for 17 rounds in the magazine.  When I carry a gun I have a 12 round magazine 1 in the gun and an additional 17 round magazine.  I am ready for the mongul horde.\n\n[URL="http://s34.photobucket.com/user/1czshooter/media/20140121_191106_zps48744fb3.jpg.html"][IMG]http://i34.photobucket.com/albums/d130/1czshooter/20140121_191106_zps48744fb3.jpg[/IMG][/URL]\nThis is my MP22 trainer gun.  For a long time in America cheap and high quality .22 rounds were easy to get.  The demand for them has gone up a lot over the last year.  But it is still a great way to shoot the same style of guns for practice at a much lower cost.  These guns are about 300 USD.  The magazine holds 12 rounds and the pistol shoots very nicely.\n\n\n\n[URL="http://s34.photobucket.com/user/1czshooter/media/20140121_191123_zps11ffeff9.jpg.html"][IMG]http://i34.photobucket.com/albums/d130/1czshooter/20140121_191123_zps11ffeff9.jpg[/IMG][/URL]\nThis is my MP9 this is the ''full size'' gun which is the fighting size.  It is the best size for use and handles 17 round magazines.  As you can see it has a surefire x300 light on it.  This is what I call my bedside gun.  If someone were to break into my home at night this would go into action quickly.  The light can show me exactly where someone was.  The magazines for this gun have become very expensive as demand for them has gone up.  These magazines can cost between 35-75 USD while a few years ago they were as little as 15 USD.  Luckily they are well made magazines and do not break.\n\n[URL="http://s34.photobucket.com/user/1czshooter/media/1522070_10152168095233399_488026680_n_zps1989123f.jpg.html"][IMG]http://i34.photobucket.com/albums/d130/1czshooter/1522070_10152168095233399_488026680_n_zps1989123f.jpg[/IMG][/URL]\nThis is an MP9 PRO or pro bro as my friends call it.  It is the 5 inch version of the gun.  This one has upgraded sights and an inforce light.  This is normally a competition gun and they shoot very well.  They can hold a group of about 2 or 3 inches at 25 meters.  I owned this gun for a few years then sold it to a good friend who is also a member here.  \n\nI will answer any questions my friends have about these guns.  I will also gladly take more pictures for you simply say what it is you would like to see.

I have witnessed 5-(ISSF shotgun World cups) a recent one in Al-Ain(U.A.E) in April 2013,but never seen, even for the FEMALE shooters to use KO.\n\nHow much did you pay for the Stock Alterations at Beretta (Dallas) and how much would you pay me, if I use a (2500-Euros) Adjustable STOCK.(Joking) but it''s possible.[/QUOTE]\n\nWAS,\n\nI only shoot American Skeet for recreation  or socially with LOW gun (that is how I was taught by the first coach).   But I know that I won''t be here for long and ISSF skeet is the way to go anyways.  So this is what I practice and trying to at least reach MQS (114/125 Correct??) requirement. \n\nAbout my gun..it is a long story.  I won it in a competition.  Since I picked up the gun from the Beretta Gallery, stock fitting was free. I had no knowledge or appreciation of the O/U shotguns at that time. In fact I try to sell it and buy another pistol/rifle. But due to the very reasons you mentioned, I could not sell it.  A friend took me to sporting clays range and this was the start of my addiction. I decided to keep the gun.  \n\nKO (or any recoil reduction solution for that matter) is more of a gimmick and even ladies don''t use it as you very well articulated using science of propellants involved here.    As per my research, even after-market and custom stock manufacturers don''t have options for SV10 such as PFS or Gracoil  due to KO pistons and Q-stock (another gimmick) features on this gun that are embedded deep into the stock.  I got excited after reading your post on working around customs'' rules buy taking stocks and chokes only and borrowing barrels onsite, but soon it was a disappointment to learn that it is not possible with SV10. I am learning that unlike 68x-E series, the parts are not swap-able on SV10.\n\nI am more than willing to pay any creative stock fitter and you will be doing me a huge favor, joking aside. I have read your and 12Gauge''s posts on this subject and am very much intrigued. But the decision about "how much" is based solely on if it is worth investing on this gun versus buying a proper gun.\n\nI know that I will eventually need a better gun with perfect fit and one that is made for skeet. Your earlier post confirms this for me. It is just the timing of my personal situation with move, start-up business etc. So I am deciding to redirect the limited "fun funds" to ammo, range fees, and coaching for time being since this allows me to spend over the extended time. I really value your guidance if you believe this is going to hold me back.\n\nMy goal: Be able to to qualify for regional and national sporting competitions and finish without embarrassing myself. With my age and other handicaps, I am not looking for (or even thinking) International events. I simply want to enjoy the comradery of serious shot-gunners and and possible our Olympians. \n\nThanks for your insight and guidance!', 1, 0, '75.62.16.125', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

Hope you enjoy your stay here & we can share what we know.[/QUOTE]\nThank you for your warm welcome but you are far too kind brother.  My understanding of your gun ownership situation is very much lacking and I would like to know more.  Most great men that I have known have believed that not knowing others history will doom you to relive it yourself.  I also correct people very regularly about the ''khyber'' style guns.  Many Americans have no understanding of this and will repeat what they are told.  \n\n[QUOTE=AK47;421916]CZDuty bro...............Welcome to the forum and  thanks for your personnel impressions on the SW M&P series, along  with photos.\n\nI''ve been thinking occasionally about the S&W and am still attracted to both the C and the full sizer.\n\nI studied the compact version sometimes back and even suggested members  here to give it a thought for deep concealed carry, since I''m of the  impression that it packs quite a lot in a very compact package.\n\nI think barrel length of the C model with a 12+1 capacity is 3.5 inches.  Price difference here is some 100K''s between baby Glock and S&W C.\n\nThe Shield version is suited for even deeper CC.\n\nWe''re still missing feed backs however on the M&P 9 series. How do  you rate the hinge type trigger break vs the bladed one of Glocks?\n\nGood you got it started.\n\nRegards.[/QUOTE]\n\nThe shield is too small for my preference to carry.  I purchased a  springfield XDS 45 which is another small carry gun in .45 acp but it  was away for several months for repairs.  While it was away I purchased  the 9C to replace it and sold it when the XDS returned.  The concept of  the trigger difference is very minimal compared to the overall feel of  the gun.  In the latest generation of the Glocks they have changed the  feel allowing for different back straps to be used.  I have some what  smaller hands and use the smallest back strap for the 9C and the medium  for my 9.  In America we have a few custom house companies that produce  after market triggers for us.  On the MP9 I have ordered the forward set  sear from APEX triggers.  They are about 136 USD but they offer a very  clean and crisp trigger pull.  I have used other apex kits and am told  this is the best offering yet.  I look forward to it and will of course  let you my pak brothers know how I feel about it when it arrives.  Glock  and SW are a bit of a split in America.  Most people who like the glock  feel it fits in their hand better and the same is true for the Smith  and Wesson it is that saying when someone first picks up a gun they like  the way it feels...or it doesn''t feel right.  I think the blade trigger  has little to do with my choice to go with S&W guns over glocks.   Both are very strong proven guns.\n\n[QUOTE=hsnmz;421918]and also about MP22, how does it perform with  different types of ammo since .22 tend to be quite ammo  sensitive.[/QUOTE]\nI was lucky to have a very large amount of .22  ammunition before America had its ''panic'' many of you know last winter  we had a bad shooting in a school and many people thought our government  would take away guns.  In the end many people bought as much ammo and  guns as they could.  The .22 ammo is still very hard to find.  I have a  large amount of Eley Sport ammunition which is from Mexico and I  understand you are able to get Eley products in Pakistan.  I feel they  shoot well.  If I shoot standard velocity or about 1100-1200fps ammo the  pistol shoots every kind I give it.  If I shoot subsonic or some of the  900 fps offerings they do not cycle.  It is slightly more giving than a  walther p22 and the sig mosquito line of guns.  I have almost 10,000  rounds through this .22 and as long as I give it a good scrub for carbon  it continues to shoot happily on each outing.', 1, 0, '50.81.184.23', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

But brother I seriously doubt about life time warranty because Orient Traders give no such warranty or better to say false hopes.\n\nAtleast for Taurus products that Life time warranty does not exist at all in Pakistan , Trust me. Even in USA people get their weapons back many weeks later from Taurus with the same problem persisting even after repairs etc. many are not happy with their after sales service, just google it and you will find it true\n\nI cannot imagine PARA sending back the weapon all the way to Taurus and getting it repaired and so on. It is just a business trick to gain the confidence of customers and make their reputation better ( which is no longer even satisfactory at all ). What they do is get that weapon repaired from a local gunsmith and return it back to you. \n\nBrotherly advise, Just handover the weapon back to PARA get refund and at the same day purchase it from Orient Traders they have recently imported many Taurus pistols but please first call them and make sure they do have your desired model or not & DO NOT TRUST ANY DEALER, thoroughly inspect the weapon in good light from different angels take your time and do not PAY THE AMOUNT until you are fully satisfied.\n\nMy personal interaction with PARA was not good asked about semiauto shotgun they showed me three in my range and they were asking 10K over the market rate for each weapon. I dont now what is in their mind because everyone who steps out of home to purchase a weapon do ask rates from various dealers .\n\n No doubt they are soft spoken etc. but that matters a little because what you need is a NIB untouched flawless weapon.\n\nRegards & I dont care if PARA is reading it and it is offensive', 1, 0, '182.189.227.99', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

Ooohhh GOD\n\nthe second thought which i got is that why i didn''t hunt a clay bird, to fulfil the inner stuff and got confused that what was the actual motivation which forced me to kill and take lives ... Was it the word "kaesa girya" or was it the likeness of process of dying, the scream ,the fluttering , taking of last breath, and finally transfer of sprit and after that the sense of achievement which blinded me to pass and cross any line, or was it the " wah wah "of hunt mates   \nWhat ever it was God plz FORGIVE me, and give me strength to say NO to killings (hunting)\n\nsorry just wrote without thinking just a feeling i putted down..we forgot that we ourself are mortals, and what happen if we, or our close one get hunted..[/QUOTE]', 1, 1, '173.209.122.102', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

Luckily I rang Leon and he told me it was well over priced and should be 60k. So Plz Bros if You go Para try and get a PG Expert like Leon to advise You on Price. I had a look at the Zastava but even the compact version is not completely a CCW. So after visiting most shops the Cz P-01 fitted in my hand like it was made for me and I felt goose bumps in my stomach whilst holding it. Wow Bros its beautiful and the design is sleek. Thank You Leon bro for getting me discount and also advising me. I also liked the Cz Rami and if I get another license made then I will be buying a Rami.\nAnyway theres not much choice in the shops due to import issues.

I was looking a conceal carry as my Beretta 92fs was getting scratched up carried around all day. I went to Imran and sons, there they had the turkish Grisan 9mm and he claimed it was used by American Special forces and he wanted 85000k last price. But I did not like it because as much I like Imran and Sons company they do 99percent of the time talk Bull S**T. I visited Para and Eshan had a Cz Alpha, asking price 90k. Luckily I rang Leon and he told me it was well over priced and should be 60k. So Plz Bros if You go Para try and get a PG Expert like Leon to advise You on Price. I had a look at the Zastava but even the compact version is not completely a CCW. So after visiting most shops the Cz P-01 fitted in my hand like it was made for me and I felt goose bumps in my stomach whilst holding it. Wow Bros its beautiful and the design is sleek. Thank You Leon bro for getting me discount and also advising me.

Professional assassins (usually thugs working for organized crime) have long favored using .22 caliber (5.56mm) pistols for their work. While not a powerful round, if you shoot someone up close with a.22 caliber pistol several things are noted.1- The victim is dead if you shoot him in the head, which is what pros usually aim for (as these guys like to say, "two in the head and you know he''s dead.") 2- There is hardly any sound if you use a silencer, and not much even if you don''t. 3-A 22 caliber pistol is small, even with a silencer. That makes it easier to conceal, and easier to dispose of.Then the Russians noted that Chechen snipers were effectively using .22 LR (long rifle, then little bullets kids use to hunt squirrels and rabbits with) weapons. Inside towns and cities, the .22 LR sniper was veryeffective, especially since the Chechens would improvise a very workable silencer by putting a plastic bottle on the end of the rifle''s barrel, with a hole in the bottom of the barrel for the bullet to exit. Using a cheap scope, Chechen snipers were very deadly at ranges of less than a hundred meters. Such ranges were pretty common in built up areas. And since you usually did not hear the shot (to the head or face, of course), you had a hard time finding the shooter. Having suffered from these low tech .22 caliber Chechen snipers for ten years, the Russians have come out with their own professional .22 LR sniper rifle, the SV-99. This is a little heavier (at 8.3 pounds) than your usual .22 LR rifle, but is built for professionals. It has a heavier barrel, a bipod, silencer and scope. It''s 39 inches long and can accept five, eight or ten round magazines. There is a compartment in the butt stock for two five round magazines. With the SV-99, at a hundred meters, a skilled shooter can consistently put all rounds in a half inch circle. This is a specialist weapon, most likely used by commandos. But any trained sniper can quickly adapt to using it. And snipers like not being heard.#mods hopefully you dont dont for some words in this post which are intended solely for informational purpose. cheers', 1, 1, '8.37.227.99', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

I hunt because being outdoors and watching these fabulous creatures in their natural environment gives me pleasure, and as an added benefit I get healthy, unadulterated meat and good exercise. The meat we buy from stores here in Canada is full of hormones and medications that I don''t need. Look at the obesity rate in North America! Its actually cruel and criminal in my view how they raise chicken etc. here. Every summer I try and buy (desi) roosters from a farm and butcher and freeze them, its not cost effective but is healthy and does not taste like rubber (the regular chicken bought from the store does). Even honey I do not buy off the shelf because they pasteurize it and that destroys the enzymes. When I first came to Canada I felt like I had lost my taste buds, nothing tasted good, now I have realized it is because of logistics and growth in population, they engineered seeds, feed poultry and livestock growth hormones etc, everything is based on quantity rather than quality. From meat to grain to fruit, no comparison to what I have tasted in Pakistan. So every year I raise 2 lambs fed on grain and grass and no hormones, they taste awesome. I am trying to hunt to store enough meat in my freezer and buy enough roosters in summer to last a year. For grain I am looking for a grain share program where they give you a share and grow it naturally. But for me the actual part of killing, skinning and butchering an animal is work that I do not enjoy. I am OK till I take the shot! But then I have a heavy heart. And yes I do not intend to kill a creature for fun, if I feel threatened by it, yes.[QUOTE=hsnmz;422883]I was not just refering to food rather to the source of food. while staying in the context of your question i.e. "[B]hunting[/B] [B]for food[/B] or fun" IMO there is no more any requirement to hunt for food since we have it available in abundance alhamdulillah. meat through butchers/domesticated animals and birds, and grains + veg through farming. So all those who hunt in this era, hunt for fun.

By carrying you are bringing deadly force to a fight, which may and will be used against you.

There are so many variables in this discussion that one can write a book. But generally speaking lots of practice builds muscle memory and reduces the stress level and keeps one in or close to the comfort zone.

I hunt because being outdoors and watching these fabulous creatures in their natural environment gives me pleasure, and as an added benefit I get healthy, unadulterated meat and good exercise. The meat we buy from stores here in Canada is full of hormones and medications that I don''t need. Look at the obesity rate in North America! Its actually cruel and criminal in my view how they raise chicken etc. here. Every summer I try and buy (desi) roosters from a farm and butcher and freeze them, its not cost effective but is healthy and does not taste like rubber (the regular chicken bought from the store does). Even honey I do not buy off the shelf because they pasteurize it and that destroys the enzymes. When I first came to Canada I felt like I had lost my taste buds, nothing tasted good, now I have realized it is because of logistics and growth in population, they engineered seeds, feed poultry and livestock growth hormones etc, everything is based on quantity rather than quality. From meat to grain to fruit, no comparison to what I have tasted in Pakistan. So every year I raise 2 lambs fed on grain and grass and no hormones, they taste awesome. I am trying to hunt to store enough meat in my freezer and buy enough roosters in summer to last a year. For grain I am looking for a grain share program where they give you a share and grow it naturally. But for me the actual part of killing, skinning and butchering an animal is work that I do not enjoy. I am OK till I take the shot! But then I have a heavy heart. And yes I do not intend to kill a creature for fun, if I feel threatened by it, yes.[/QUOTE]\nin my opinion there can be no rational justification for hunting. Why do  we take some one''s life? why do we shatter a family? why do we snatch  the most basic right from a bird/animal of LIVING HIS LIFE.  Dodo, if  you can''t get unadulterated food, this is your problem not the problem of  animals/birds. What if everyone in CANADA adopts this attitude?

The AMS EVO X 2.4L Big Bore Stroker is the newest race engine for the Evolution X designed by AMS Performance. By increasing displacement to a robust 2.4 liters, this powerplant allows you to run a larger turbo for increased horsepower without sacrificing your power-band. [/FONT]\n              \n              [FONT=Verdana]The AMS EVO X 2.4L Big-Bore Stroker Crate Engine is the ultimate solution for high horse power reliability without the hassle of sending in your cores. Our crate engine comes complete from valve cover to oil pan to timing chain and components to make installation as painless as possible. This package uses only the best products we sell and comes ready to drop right into your EVO. [/FONT]\n              \n             [FONT=Verdana][B]Big Torque For Quicker Turbo Response[/B][/FONT]\n              \n              [FONT=Verdana]If you are running an upgraded turbo system, the Big Bore Stroker improves torque numbers down low by increasing stroke. 500 ft/lbs can be achieved as early as 4200rpm with the appropriate turbo system.  Off the dyno, full spool can be achieved at just above 4000rpm.  With the added torque, you will power out of turns quicker for improved lap times on the road course and leave your opponents in the dust on the street!

What’s most impressive about this new engine configuration is it adds torque down low and that torque carries all of the way to redline.  In addition, horsepower continues to climb all the way up to the maximum rev limit of 8500rpm. With such a wide power-band your EVO X will be unbeatable on the street or the track with big power and monster torque on tap at nearly any rpm.

[/FONT]\n              \n[FONT=Verdana]Each block is  precisely machined to accept ductile iron sleeves. The sleeves are  pressed into the block to sit atop a machined step to ensure they will  not sink during engine operation. The new sleeves are machined to sit a  few thousands above the rest of the deck surface allowing for a tighter  sealing surface between the block and cylinder head. The block is then  final bored & honed using a torque plate to ensure perfect  clearances and fitment.  The finished product allows for higher cylinder  pressures and added strength and rigidity to the block. [/FONT]         \n              [FONT=Verdana]To top off this package we include the AMS EVO X CNC Ported Cylinder Head.  Featuring the most advanced port design on the market, this head is fortified with +1mm oversized Ferrea valves and valvetrain components.

They predate the metallic cartridge, which is essential for an autoloading pistol.  Instead of a one-piece barrel, the back of the barrel was cut off, and five to seven blind sections mounted close to it on an axle.  Each blind section was loaded, then turned into alignment with the barrel and fired.  Much lighter and less bulky than the earlier "pepperbox" arrangement of independently charged barrels.\r\n\r\n  In fact, revolvers predate the priming cap; there were some flintlock and even matchlock revolving rifles made.  But the priming cap made the revolver a production item; just put a cap on each nipple, pour black powder into each chamber, and seat lead balls on top.  A pair of revolving pistols gave any man the firepower of a squad with the old weapons.\r\n\r\n When the metallic cartridge was invented, it was immediately applied to the revolver, which not only gave the revolver overwhelming firepower, but allowed virtually "instant" (by the standards of the day) reloading, increasing individual firepower yet again.\r\n\r\n The metallic cartridge''s convenient packaging of powder, primer, and ball in one waterproof assembly started people thinking about autoloading pistols, and some were made... but none of them went anywhere, because the power of black powder ammunition varied dramatically from brand to brand, or even batch to batch.  Making consistent black powder is still an art even today.  Automatics demand ammunition that is neither too weak nor too strong; it wasn''t until smokeless powder came out that automatics became practical.\r\n \r\n\r\n As to why new revolvers are still made... some people find them easier to conceal.  Revolvers are utterly indifferent to the quality of ammunition you use in them... even if it fails to fire, you just cock it and pull the trigger again on the next cartridge.  And if you want power... a .357 or .44 snubnose puts a lot of power in a small package.  And if you want MORE power, like .454 Casull, .460 S&W, .475 Linebaugh, or .500 S&W - a revolver is the only way to go.  Automatics stop at the .50 Action Express, and that only in the Desert Eagle now.  If you were so inclined, you could cut down the barrel and grip of a .500 S&W and drop it in a pocket.\r\n\r\n\r\n And besides... some of us just like revolvers!', 1, 0, '76.125.99.223', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

I hunt because being outdoors and watching these fabulous creatures in their natural environment gives me pleasure, and as an added benefit I get healthy, unadulterated meat and good exercise. The meat we buy from stores here in Canada is full of hormones and medications that I don''t need. Look at the obesity rate in North America! Its actually cruel and criminal in my view how they raise chicken etc. here. Every summer I try and buy (desi) roosters from a farm and butcher and freeze them, its not cost effective but is healthy and does not taste like rubber (the regular chicken bought from the store does). Even honey I do not buy off the shelf because they pasteurize it and that destroys the enzymes. When I first came to Canada I felt like I had lost my taste buds, nothing tasted good, now I have realized it is because of logistics and growth in population, they engineered seeds, feed poultry and livestock growth hormones etc, everything is based on quantity rather than quality. From meat to grain to fruit, no comparison to what I have tasted in Pakistan. So every year I raise 2 lambs fed on grain and grass and no hormones, they taste awesome. I am trying to hunt to store enough meat in my freezer and buy enough roosters in summer to last a year. For grain I am looking for a grain share program where they give you a share and grow it naturally. But for me the actual part of killing, skinning and butchering an animal is work that I do not enjoy. I am OK till I take the shot! But then I have a heavy heart.

Why don''t you take a second and actually look at what this CF has  to offer.  In the price range of 50K, this is probably the only weapon that has been in the market long enough and I have not yet seen or read or heard a single negative comment regarding this model.  Secondly, as an individual, SD is the primary objective...CF delivers all that it is meant for.  having said that, don''t brand it as a CF, I''d rather treat it with a little more respect because much larger establishments like the Taurus, pretty much every single weapon has both positive as well as negative comments.  This little baby came out in market in and 2008, and since then people having have been choosing this along side the dazza!! (.30 bore)!!! for their SD...there is no doubt why the prices have been shooting up...I remember this gun being bought at 32K in 2008...and the same dealer now demands 52K here in Karachi.  in this price range, even the dealers now have the flexibility to amaze the buyer with the jargon "would you like a 9mm or a .30" because both are now affordable without compromising the SD aspects of keeping the weapon in the first place...personally, I would now actually prefer this CF over the .30 for a few reasons...for SD purpose, mobility is the primary thing, and if you compare the weight CF being a fiber alloy its sturdy as well as durable, and lighter to carry.  Also, the fact that it has a capacity of 15+1 rounds makes this a much better preference.  Another reason why CF has jumped up the ladder on SD for me is because the fakes in the market are easily identifiable...whereas for .30 it takes a good eye to differentiate...\n\nNevertheless, .30 bore has the market with both hands and is the trend...what I would like to see is more models on this bore...like Ruger .30 ... this baby means business from its first sight, then along with the bang and dazza of .30 makes it an ideal addition in the collection along with the peace of mind on SD...\n\nAll you brothers out there, try and get more models of .30 in Pakistan, there is a huge market for this and whosoever fills this gap up will surely pat his own back for the rest of his life...\n\nCheers...', 1, 0, '182.178.45.73', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

Why don''t you take a second and actually look at what this CF has  to offer.  In the price range of 50K, this is probably the only weapon that has been in the market long enough and I have not yet seen or read or heard a single negative comment regarding this model.  Secondly, as an individual, SD is the primary objective...CF delivers all that it is meant for.  having said that, don''t brand it as a CF, I''d rather treat it with a little more respect because much larger establishments like the Taurus, pretty much every single weapon has both positive as well as negative comments.  This little baby came out in market in and 2008, and since then people having have been choosing this along side the dazza!! (.30 bore)!!! for their SD...there is no doubt why the prices have been shooting up...I remember this gun being bought at 32K in 2008...and the same dealer now demands 52K here in Karachi.  in this price range, even the dealers now have the flexibility to amaze the buyer with the jargon "would you like a 9mm or a .30" because both are now affordable without compromising the SD aspects of keeping the weapon in the first place...personally, I would now actually prefer this CF over the .30 for a few reasons...for SD purpose, mobility is the primary thing, and if you compare the weight CF being a fiber alloy its sturdy as well as durable, and lighter to carry.  Also, the fact that it has a capacity of 15+1 rounds makes this a much better preference.  Another reason why CF has jumped up the ladder on SD for me is because the fakes in the market are easily identifiable...whereas for .30 it takes a good eye to differentiate...\n\nNevertheless, .30 bore has the market with both hands and is the trend...what I would like to see is more models on this bore...like Ruger .30 ... this baby means business from its first sight, then along with the bang and dazza of .30 makes it an ideal addition in the collection along with the peace of mind on SD...\n\nAll you brothers out there, try and get more models of .30 in Pakistan, there is a huge market for this and whosoever fills this gap up will surely pat his own back for the rest of his life...\n\nCheers...[/QUOTE]\n\ni said 55k is too much because i bought it for 37 and the price in pindi is still 47k asking. i know that CF is a very nice weapon ive had it for over 2.5 years now. ive also used glocks, berretta PX4 storm, FNP9 and walther P38 but still i love my CF. so far no FTF or FTE a very reliable weapon, though so far ive only used china red box and POF ammo.', 1, 1, '39.47.131.200', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

There are some cosmetic differences between the two. The major difference from P22 is a heavier slide and new slide serrations. Has a steel guide rod, the earlier had a plastic/polymer guide rod. They have reprofiled the hammer a bit as the earlier had an issue of FTF due to slide getting held up during cycling.

There''s an elastic panel on the front of the holster that keeps the trigger guard forced against the pocket in the holster, but though the gun never came out by accident, it was easier to pull than I really liked.\n\n When I realized that the grip was the problem I went looking for some "regular" grips.  As far as I can tell Taurus never shipped the Model 85 with regular grips, and net.lore said that S&W grips wouldn''t fit a Taurus 85.\n\n I had some Rossi grips in my parts box.  The Rossi is another S&W variant, and the way the grips were attached to the frame was basically identical to the Taurus.  However, they were much larger than the Taurus frame.  I marked the Rossi grips and used the disc sander and Dremel to reprofile them and round them off.  If you scroll up and down you can see they are much smaller than the original Taurus grips now.  If you look at the top you can see the step in the grip where it meets the frame; there''s a semicircular cutout in the frame and a matching shape inside the grip to locate it and take recoil load.\n\n Yes, the gun says "Taurus" and the grips say "Rossi."  I feel it gives the gun some character...\n\n The original grips were more comfortable (and better looking!), but the Rossi grips will keep the gun more secure in the holster.  I set the original grips aside in case I want to reinstall them later.\n\n This picture was taken right after the grips were shaped, rounded off, and attached.

Now I understand what people mean when they talk about clothing made for extra room for a shoulder holster.\n\n Just in case anyone is interested, reholstering a pistol with an upside-down or horizontal rig requires two hands; you have to hold the holster to force the gun in to the formed holster.

As I said in the beginning of this thread, I do not agree with killing for fun or thrill, but I am not calling it wrong.\n \nIf everyone in the world or Canada adopts my practice, there would be a lot more healthier people around.

No FTE issues or feeding problems. Broken ejectors or worries about which ammo the pistol ‘likes’ FMJ or JHP or any specific brand. \nWith a wheel gun “you” decide what ammo type U like not the gun! You may load semi-wadcutters and she will not complain. \nEven if there is a failure to fire the shooter does not have to take ‘time out’ in a gun fight and clear the dud round manually. With a revolver he simply continues shooting.\n\n[B]Simplicity[/B]\n\nFor a newbie to the fire arms world i almost always recommond a wheel gun over a pistol. its far more simpler to operate then a pistol \n\n[B]Choice:[/B] \n\nThe .357magnum can also fire the .38 spacial. My .32 S&W long can do .32 s&w short and in a pinch even .32 acp ( A pistol round)  However I can just imagine stuffing my  .32 revolver round in the .32 pistol! Boom if I ever were able to stuff it inside the gun!\n\n[B]Safety:[/B]\n\nIMHO one of the most crucial differences between the wheel gun and the pistol is that the pistol cycles a fresh round “after” it has been fired. While the revolver completes its cycle “before” discharge.\nHow does it affect the safety of the weapon?\n\nWell. The safest way to carry a firarm is condition 3 or chamber empty. Unfortunately if the stuff hits the fan. All you have to pull the trigger on a pistol suddenly all u get is a click.. U can go on clicking ad infinitum. Untill you charge the weapon manually u wont get anywhere. \nHowever, with a wheel gun even when there is an empty chamber under the hammer when you squeeze the trigger the piece will fire. The rotary mechanism will ensure there is a fresh round whenever the trigger is pulled.\n\n[B]Quantity vs. size:[/B]\n\nThe size of a pistol round is limited to the size of the grip. It is possible to stuff a .357magnum round in a desert eagle, but you would have to be a giant to conceal it let alone fire it comfortably.. if u have normal sized hands that is. It is a huge, heavy chunk of metal.  \nA titanium 7 shot .357 magnum Taurus snubbie can easily be dropped in an ankle holster and the owner will barely feel it is there!\nBesides, the chances are if you cant do something with 7 or 8 .357 magnum rounds, you probably wont get a chance to do with 17 9mm rounds either. \n\n[B]Ease of handling:[/B]\n\nI have used both as my EDC. But I found the task of unloading the chamber every time I came back home and then re-stuffing the 17th round back in the magazine, odious at best.  I stopped abusing my thumb nail and simply shifted to my revolver.  I also don’t have to worry about spring fatigue anymore. \n\n[B]More tolerance for different gripping styles[/B]\n\ni have yet to see a wheel gun fail to fire/extract due to limp wristing or injuring a thumb or fingers  because the shooter allowed it to hover close to the slide. \n\n(I made such an error once and am lucky my thumb is intact) \n\n[B]Security[/B]\n\nIt also does not leave ''calling'' cards behind on the scene of an incident. I like my brass with me not strewn all over the road. \n\n[B]you get what u are promised[/B]\n\none more edge a revolver has over pistol, in revolvers you get exact barrel length you are promised with same length of rifling not like pistols where length of chamber (a feed ramp as well in CZ''s case) is deducted from advertised barrel length \n\nThere was an incident when me and my friends were coming back from French beach and on the way back on the Mauripur road we saw a bunch of moter bikers crusing slowly.  I immediately charged my 9mm pistol… Or tried to at any rate. I fumbled and the slide got stuck half way. It took me a good 10 minutes to clear the jam. Luckily for me my friend and his wife. The bikers were just a bunch of kids coming back from the beach. But I learnt my lesson that day.  \nAnd shifted to the wheel gun for serious SD work.[/QUOTE]\nExcellent review! Ed....

The other  ammunition will be imported according to the requirement of the  association’s units,” he said. \n \nAll four provinces, Islamabad, and three armed forces are the units of NRAP. \n \n\nIt  must be noted that[B][I] [COLOR=#800000]the association is not allowed to directly import  air weapons[/COLOR][/I][/B], which is hampering their efforts to spread this sport in  the country although Admiral M Asif Sandila, Chief of Naval Staff, is  its president. \n\n \n[B][COLOR=#800000]The secretary said that only arms dealers  are allowed to directly import weapons[/COLOR][/B]. “The sport is getting popular in  Pakistan. We have recently started training programmes in 40 to 50  schools and colleges, so we are in dire need of equipment,” said the  secretary. \n\n \n“We have to boost this sport because we have a  lot of talent in it. Besides this direct import issue, [B][COLOR=#800000]we have some 80  percent duties on the import of air weapons[/COLOR][/B], which is another blow to  the sport,” he added. \n\n \nJaved said that without duties one  rifle costs Rs350,000 and pistol costs Rs150,000. “[B][COLOR=#800000]We have 55 percent  duty, 15 percent sales tax, and five percent income tax[/COLOR][/B]. One can guess  how difficult it is for this sport to flourish in the country.” \n\n \n\nHe  claimed that India allocated Rs500 million annually for this sport and  Iran $5 million, but “here in Pakistan we have annual grant of Rs1.2  million, and out of that Rs0.4 million is spent on paying fees to  international bodies. The amount we need to spend on the preparations of  one shooter is Rs5 million a year,” he said. \n\n\n  [URL="http://www.thenews.com.pk/TodaysPrintWriterName.aspx?ID=10&URL=Waqar%20Hamza"]Waqar Hamza\n[/URL] The News\nMonday, September 10, 2012 \nFrom Print Edition', 1, 0, '77.30.83.90', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

The distance was about 40 feet using .22 14.3g H&N (fake) pellets through Crosman Nitro Venom Dusk equipped with a Center Point 3-9 x 32 scope. It was more a test of the pellet than the gun. The Crosman premier hollow point pellets are more accurate over longer distances but cost twice as much. Fired a total of 7 pellets and pretty much all (except 1) hit the intended target. \n\nI also tried the gun from 20 yards and was able to hit a small target (about the size of a 5 Rs. coin) twice with 3 going off target. The gun is certainly accurate at shorter distances provided one uses better pellets. My experience with the fake/counterfeit (so called made in germany) H&N pellets is that there is a lot of variation in these pellets. Some have a tight fit and some don''t. The above results are based on a selection of the better (tighter) fit pellets. \n\nAs for the gun itself, I read numerous reviews about the trigger and why most people didnt like it. Yes it has a longer pull and its not as good as the one on a Diana but its a question of getting used to it. I now feel comfortable with the trigger and although there is room for improvement, its not a deal breaker. \n\n[I][B]I wrote this review because I couldn''t find something specific for this particular air rifle on this forum.

But I have to agree with Mian Jee it should NOT worth more than 80-100 K.\n\nFor the last few months I have been in search for a .223 rifle in affordable price range, even I have started a thread in Rifle section. Because .223 has recently been placed into NPB category so there is a Psuedohype in its prices sky high you can say, just like realestate about a deade back in Lahore. But eventually the bubble brusted and all the prices were again back to what they should be.\n\nCouple of months back Mr.Nafees Malik of Hira Arms showed me COLT .223 with a scope mounted over it & can you guess what the asking price was ....... JUST [B]12 Lac [/B]Rupees. According to him it is a snipper rifle with only scope of about 350K and capable of taking down a target at 1000 meters ( which I never believed, how much good the rifle may be the bullet ballistics do not say so, could be true if he was saying same thing about .30 06 or .308 ). I dont know much about scopes but same model of colt without scope is available for just under 1000 USD. So even if you double up the prices it should not be more than 200K or even less !!!!\n\nMy dealer(Not Hira Arms) told me to wait for atleast six months when the proper shipments of .223 now NPB weapon will arrive and prices will go down definitely and then purchase a quality weapon. Obviously prices of America & Co. countries will remain high like Glock due import restrictions but there are numerous other options available in this bore... Sarsilmaz, Zastava, Chinese ..... etc. and the list will be long once the proper time will come.\n\nRegards', 1, 0, '182.189.234.97', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

However people don''t do this, and I don''t know if they think they need more expensive gear or are just lazy, but here are some easy tips to take your still pictures to the next level no matter what camera you are using.\n\n1. DON''T USE THE FLASH\nThe direct flash on the camera destroys more pictures than anything else, and unless you are photographing the license plate of a hit and run driver speeding in to the distance or something like that there is no reason to ever use it. Any kind of light can be used, it''s easiest to take good pictures in good natural lighting but since you can easily adjust the white balance, tone and color later it''s not super important as long as there''s no glare or shadows on your object.\n\n2. Use a Tripod\nEven a cheap $10 mini one will do. When you are taking pictures without the flash you will probably need a longer exposure time, and if you are holding the camera in your hands the photo will be blurry and out of focus.\n\n3. Use the Timer\nLike the tripod, this will remove the variable of movement, even on a decent tripod your finger on the camera will affect the photo. Just set it to the timer as you would with a family photo.\n\n\n\n4. Use a Small Aperture\nThis will increase the depth of field, meaning more of the photo will be in focus at once, which is nice for taking pictures of guns or really anything at indirect angles. This also increases the exposure time so obviously the tripod and timer are not optional.\n\n5. Use a Low ISO\nThis adjusts your cameras sensitivity to light, and has similar effects as using the small aperture, increased depth of field and higher detail. I nearly always use an ISO of 100 on non moving objects. Again, tripod and timer are necessary.\n\n6. Black or White Backgrounds\nThis is always nice especially for guns as it gives you such a clean look. For a black background go get a yard of synthetic black velvet, costs less than $10 at a craft store. Hang it on the wall behind what you are taking a picture of (the further the better as it will be easier to control the light). Try and illuminate the object but not the background. You can use a desk lamp or even a piece of cardboard on the light in the room to block it from hitting the velvet. The background should be pitch black in the photo. White backgrounds are the opposite, get a large sheet of white paper, place it behind the object making sure there are no folds or creases, and put all the light you can on the background rather than the object. You may need to adjust the exposure to make it completely white.\n\n7. Play With Light\nFor both the black and white background photos and most photos really you rarely will get the light perfect the first time. Just try a lot of different things until you like what you see, over time you will get a sense of what light works for photos.\n\n\n8. Don''t Put a Knife or 12ga Shell in Your Trigger Guard\nGo to any forum and you will see a ton of photos like this. Spend 10 seconds thinking about a way to prop up the gun at your desired angle without it being visible in the photo. I''ve had some precarious setups but it''s worth it not to have that kind of distraction in the photo.\n\n9. Edit your Photos\nAt the very least you should resize them so people don''t have to spend 30 seconds loading them, but almost every picture can benefit from a bit of tweaking. Photoshop and Lightroom are great but you don''t need them, there''s an amazing free program called Paint.net that will allow you to do adjust the hue, saturation, etc. At the very least use the auto corrects and resize the photo.\n\n10. Take More Photos\nThe more you take the better you will get. Once you take some nice ones you will be more motivated to take more as well. Try as many different ideas as you can too, the best thing about digital is you can take an endless amount and delete them in seconds if you don''t like them. You really have no reason not to take more, so go for it.', 1, 1, '103.20.1.37', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

The first is the original No.2 Mk I that was first adopted on June 2, 1932. The second version is the Mk I*. The MK I* had a spurless hammer and Enfield removed the single action notch from the hammer which made this version strictly double action only.

This version eliminated the hammer safety stop. While the elimination of this feature made the revolver appreciably easier to produce, it proved an altogether false economy since it gave the revolver an alarming tendency to accidentally discharge if it was dropped. This version was discontinued and recalled and later converted back to the MK I* configuration in the post war years"\r\n[/FONT][/COLOR]"[COLOR=#000000][FONT=Arial]The vast majority of the Enfield No.2 Mk I revolvers were modified to the Mk I* configuration during WWII. This generally happened as they came in for repair or general maintenance.

If we are talking specifically about the AR platform, I''ve gone with the trends and tried a lot of different systems, with regards to:\nAccuracy? DI wins due to less reciprocating mass and free floated barrel.\nWeight? DI wins with a lighter operating system.\nSimplicity? DI wins with fewer parts.\nLongevity? DI wins with no issues of bolt dive and/or cam pin gouging.\nCommonality? DI wins since all piston driven AR''s are proprietary systems while DI''s have standardized mil specs, allowing interchangability of parts.\nTrack record? DI wins from its original design and uninterrupted military service.\nEfficiency? DI wins with all things being equal, they cost less to produce.\nSuppressed fire? DI wins because piston guns will be louder shooting the same ammo due to venting of gasses at the port.\n\nFurthermore, it''s misleading when people say piston AR''s are cleaner. Just as much residue is produced in either system, it''s just a matter of whether the dirt goes to the back with the bolt, or stays in the front with the piston.

The first is that many of the gas piston modifications for the M4 isolate the piston so that piston jams or related malfunction require the entire weapon be disassembled, such disassembly cannot be performed by the end user and requires a qualified armorer to perform out of field, whereas any malfunction with the direct-impingement system can be fixed by the end user in field. The second is that gas piston alternatives use an off-axis operation of the piston that can introduce carrier tilt, whereby the bolt carrier fails to enter the buffer tube at a straight angle, resulting in part wearing. The third is that the use of a sound suppressor results in hot gases entering the chamber, regardless of a direct-gas impingement or gas piston design choice. The gas-piston system also causes the firearm to become proprietary to the manufacturer, making modifications and changes with parts from other manufacturers difficult.[14][53] The argument for a gas piston is that it would reduce fouling; while the argument against it is that it would increase weight and reduce accuracy.[citation needed] The Enhanced M4 uses an articulating link piston operating system.\r\n\r\nSource: Wikipedia', 1, 0, '175.110.209.11', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

Its called Crosman Optimus which comes with a 4x32 fixed scope. The next superior model to the one that I have is the Crosman Benjamin Trail series. The Benjamin Trail probably comes with the same scope as the one on my gun. However the Trail is faster and more powerful than mine but then its quite a bit more expensive as well. At that price I would probably consider a Diana Magnum 350 even though it has a higher recoil and is louder. You can buy these from Buksh Elahi in Lahore. They have another outlet in Main Market, Gulberg which carries more range of options. \n\nAs for the price, I have noticed that Buksh Elahi is charging around 100% more than what its worth in US. I got mine for 30K with Free Crosman pellets (worth 2K).  \n\nYou are absolutely correct with your observation regarding the absence of sights.

Not a day passes when I don’t talk about guns with friends or don’t read about guns used in crimes. I keenly read instances where guns have been used in self defense.\r\nLast night in Jhelum, a robbery attempt was foiled in a house where a wedding was taking place. All the family members of the house had left for the rusm-e-hina except five people. They were bride, her father, brother and his wife, and a young man. They were also about to leave for the nearby large house where mehndi was about to take place.\r\nThe door bell rang. The inmates answered the bell through an intercom and learnt that some ‘wedding guests’ had arrived at the main gate. The father and the son went downstairs to receive them. As soon as the opened the gate, the three ‘guests’ tried to rush inside the house. The father and the son was quick to apprehend the danger. They jumped on the robbers and caught hold of them, while the third robber had made his way inside. A scuffle broke outside the house between the robbers and the brave father and the son. It started with fists and blows with the scale tilting against the robbers.\r\nSensing the failure, one robber fired three shots on the father, which hit him on calf, knee joint and thigh.\r\nMeanwhile, the automatic door had locked itself and was separating the two robbers from the third robber who had gone inside the house. The fire shots had alerted the residents of the house. When the robber entered the living quarters, a lady of the house attacked him with a hammer which a carpenter had left in the house. The carpenter had come to repair a bed in afternoon and forgot his tool. Repeated hammer blows knocked the robber down. He was overpowered by two ladies, including the bride, and the young man. The robber was found carrying two chambered TTs.\r\nThe robbers outside the house decided to run away but they wanted to take along their third partner in crime. Unable to open the door with force, they fired at the steel door with an automatic assault rifle (44 bore) to break open the lock. Failing to do so, they ran away.\r\nThe police and rescue team were quick to reach the crime scene. The father was immediately shifted to the hospital and the police arrested the semi conscious robber from inside the house. He was found to be a fugitive from law since 1996 and was an accused in 3 murders and countless robberies.

I remember when I used to be stupider (read younger), my uncle''s house was robbed and they did a clean sweep, no lie, they even took the bathroom slippers! We were there for my cousin''s wedding and had just left a few hours ago. I had  a friend in the anti car lifting cell, a few months later I asked him if he could trace a stolen car for me, and gave him the details of my uncle''s car that was taken in that robbery. He told me which city it was in, but refused to tell me where. His words were "death wish, back off!". Even on my silly persistence he did not tell me. May Allah bless his soul! A couple years later the leader was caught by sheer accident and cops not knowing who he was. Turns out he had over 90 murders on his head and was trained by one the now outlawed group and he was about 22 when he was apprehended. And all what my friend had told me matched with the facts. That bugger later "fled" from prison and then killed another 18-20 people before being shot down.\r\nGeneral rule is do not resist and give what they want, if they keep on being aggressive and abusive and do not leave after getting all the money, and you believe that life and "izzut" is at stake, then think of reacting to save those.[/QUOTE]\r\n\r\nWell i think if someone enters one''s house with a bad intention, he should not wait to find out whether his izzat is at stake or not. The intruder shot be shot dead on the spot even if he is a trained serial killer. Someone''s strong background should not stop us from defending ourselves.

The process is lengthy and may take a month after the deadline ends.&#8221; \n\nThoughts shared by Mr Memon may help scores of the applicants who are waiting for their computerised licences if they are informed about it officially. \n\nThe Sindh government had on Jan 30 extended the deadline for another 15 days i.e. Feb 15, to receive applications for computerised arms licences on the grounds that the `cumbersome process` required more time for the licensees to complete it. \n\nIn September 2013 the government had put an immediate ban on issuance of new arms licences before launching a campaign against illicit weapons in Karachi in Oct 2013 in line with the Supreme Court orders that also included verification of hundreds of thousands of licences.\n[/TD]\n[/TR]\n[/TABLE]', 1, 1, '103.249.152.244', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

The process is lengthy and may take a month after the deadline ends.” \r\n\r\nThoughts shared by Mr Memon may help scores of the applicants who are waiting for their computerised licences if they are informed about it officially. \r\n\r\nThe Sindh government had on Jan 30 extended the deadline for another 15 days i.e. Feb 15, to receive applications for computerised arms licences on the grounds that the `cumbersome process` required more time for the licensees to complete it. \r\n\r\nIn September 2013 the government had put an immediate ban on issuance of new arms licences before launching a campaign against illicit weapons in Karachi in Oct 2013 in line with the Supreme Court orders that also included verification of hundreds of thousands of licences.\r\n[/TD]\r\n[/TR]\r\n[/TABLE][/QUOTE]\r\n\r\n\r\nIt never said that it has been extended to 15th March.... i think its just a rumor...', 1, 0, '119.157.224.55', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

The  process is lengthy and may take a month after the deadline ends.”\n\n  Thoughts shared by Mr Memon may help scores of the applicants who are  waiting for their computerised licences if they are informed about it  officially.\n\n  The Sindh government had on Jan 30 extended the deadline for another  15 days i.e. Feb 15, to receive applications for computerised arms  licences on the grounds that the ‘cumbersome process’ required more time  for the licensees to complete it.\n\n  In September 2013 the government had put an immediate ban on issuance  of new arms licences before launching a campaign against illicit  weapons in Karachi in Oct 2013 in line with the Supreme Court orders  that also included verification of hundreds of thousands of licences.\n\n\n[url]http://www.dawn.com/news/1086149[/url]\n\n                     [TABLE="class: table"]\n[TR]\n[TD][/TD]\n[TD][/TD]\n[/TR]\n[TR]\n[TD][/TD]\n[TD][/TD]\n[/TR]\n[TR]\n[TD][/TD]\n[TD][/TD]\n[/TR]\n[TR]\n[TD][/TD]\n[TD][/TD]\n[/TR]\n[TR]\n[TD][/TD]\n[TD][/TD]\n[/TR]\n[TR]\n[TD][/TD]\n[TD][/TD]\n[/TR]\n[TR]\n[TD][/TD]\n[TD][/TD]\n[/TR]\n[TR]\n[TD][/TD]\n[TD][/TD]\n[/TR]\n[/TABLE]', 1, 1, '58.27.215.126', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

In my experience, Norincos of all shapes and sizes would take that title. They mat not be the prettiest, but their metallurgy is always superior (forged and cast parts) compared to competition in the same price range, and sometimes even surpasses that of premium brands costing much more. A PT1911 may be shinier when nib, but aside from the frame, slide and barrel, just about every other part on the gun is made by MIM. That may not bother some people, but to many others including myself, it''s not something I''d pay a premium for, just because the gun looks nicer, and it''s definitely not something I''d trust to go to war with. Anyways, just my $0.02 :)\nFunny thing, I have a friend who decided to get a particular "cheap" 1911. Knowing it had a fair number of MIM parts in it, he thought he would just replace those parts. A good 1911 is not only about how well it''s parts are made, but even more so it''s how well those parts are fitted, so replacing certain parts necessitated changing other parts.

I did mention that quality of plastic parts finishing (such as rear sites) was not clean, and Saif assured that this is fixed with a machine he showed us and that the samples we had in hand were quite old. In all honesty, the rear sites on these old raw samples were as good (or bad) as DSA''s Trushot rear sites!!!\n\nPictures of their finished pistols are excellent but I am waiting to see at least 1 finished pistol in my hands before considering an order.

Saif explained that they get a lot of visitors and if they have a finished pistol that is not pre-ordered, it is always bought there and then hence they hardly have any finished pistols for show. \n\nAlthough we saw raw samples, the metal machining and colouring on them was of very high quality, better than any clones I have seen in the market. Then we saw the CNC machine printing on the slide of a Baikal MP-442 (blueing on that slide and printing was excellent I have to admit!) ... you can also give them any design (in jpeg format for example) and the CAD software will do that design via CNC machine on the frame &/or slide. I did mention that quality of plastic parts finishing (such as rear sites) was not clean, and Saif assured that this is fixed with a machine he showed us and that the samples we had in hand were quite old. In all honesty, the rear sites on these old raw samples were as good (or bad) as DSA''s Trushot rear sites!!!\n\nPictures of their finished pistols are excellent but I am waiting to see at least 1 finished pistol in my hands before considering an order. Hopefully on the next trip I will get to see one.\n\nVisited DSA''s second factory, where they make sub 100k shotguns ... their PKR550K export quality shotguns I didn''t get to see as those are made in main factory. Sunset time so left without exploring further.\n\n\nOh, they have stopped the Glock production ... and the handful that they had sold have been bought back from those customers so none are in market anymore.

Headshot (only) with 25.4gr pellet will put down a boar and for boars one doesn''t need to be as far as 100 yards ... without a doubt it is an extremely lethal weapon and if it can penetrate a boar''s skull to kill instantly, human skull is much softer in comparison (and other vital organs have even little protection). At 100yrds, using 15gr or 18.1gr pellet, the pellet will go through the bird. And no licence whatsoever required since it is a pellet gun, so one can carry in car without any legal issues. In UK, there are laws for carrying airguns in certain condition (unloaded etc) and use is restricted to certain areas only. and the normal airguns and PCPs alike are all power restricted there too.

Saif explained that they get a lot of visitors and if they have a finished pistol that is not pre-ordered, it is always bought there and then hence they hardly have any finished pistols for show. \n\nAlthough we saw raw samples, the metal machining and colouring on them was of very high quality, better than any clones I have seen in the market. Then we saw the CNC machine printing on the slide of a Baikal MP-442 (blueing on that slide and printing was excellent I have to admit!) ... you can also give them any design (in jpeg format for example) and the CAD software will do that design via CNC machine on the frame &/or slide. I did mention that quality of plastic parts finishing (such as rear sites) was not clean, and Saif assured that this is fixed with a machine he showed us and that the samples we had in hand were quite old. In all honesty, the rear sites on these old raw samples were as good (or bad) as DSA''s Trushot rear sites!!!\n\nPictures of their finished pistols are excellent but I am waiting to see at least 1 finished pistol in my hands before considering an order. Hopefully on the next trip I will get to see one.\n\nVisited DSA''s second factory, where they make sub 100k shotguns ... their PKR550K export quality shotguns I didn''t get to see as those are made in main factory. Sunset time so left without exploring further.\n\n\nOh, they have stopped the Glock production ... and the handful that they had sold have been bought back from those customers so none are in market anymore.

My opinion remains unchanged- the shooters’ ability to shoot has a far greater impact on the defensive use of a firearm than the caliber. One argument for why you should use a .45 over a 9mm is that the surface area of the .45 is 63% bigger than the surface area... of the 9mm. When the .45 punches the hole through you it damages a surface area 63% larger than that of the 9mm. While true, and potentially convincing, I likened it in my head to two students. One scores 10% on a test and the other scores 16.3% on the test and the one is talking trash on the other because he scored 63% more on the test… \n\nI took this idea and went to work with it.\n\nI am an average sized dude at 5''11" and, ahem, a bit over 200 pounds. I put a ruler to my chest and abdomen. There is an area on the front of my body which is 10” by 23” where if you shot me I would REALLY not appreciate it much. You would shoot it with a bullet which is either .452” across or 9mm across.\n\nUh, hmmm, different standards of measure: Let’s use the metric system. So them there bullets would be either 9mm or 11.48mm across. These circles have a radius of either 4.5mm or 5.74mm.\nThe frontal surface area of my “I really don’t want you shooting me” area is 254mm by 584.2mm which calculates to 148,386.8 square millimeters. That’s right almost 150,000 square millimeters.\n\nThe surface area of them bullets is 64.62 square millimeters for the 9mm and 103.5 square millimeters for the .45. For the really sharp readers you can already see the point.\n\nThe 9mm punches a hole which is 64.62 square millimeters divided by 148,386.8 square millimeters. That 9mm is only 0.04% of the surface area of my “please don’t shoot me zone.” The .45 is only slightly better at .06975% of the surface area of the same area.\n\nI gave the bullets far more credit than they deserved. It’s like they took a 10,000 question test and one got 4 questions right and the other got… ok, 7 questions right. And the friends of Mr. I Got 7 Questions Right, are talking heap big trash on the friends of the guy who only got 4 questions correct. That’s pretty pathetic, don’t you think?\n\nSo, the surface area is 63% larger argument really doesn’t work for me since the original hole was so paltry to begin with. [COLOR=#ff0000][I][U][B]Now, consider this… Most of the gun-board commandos can’t shoot.\n[/B][/U][/I][/COLOR]\nThese guys puffing their chest and stroking their ego because they are a .45 fan-boy are missing that bulls-eye by 4”, 6” or even 12” all the time. To convert that to metric- they are missing by 101.6mm, 152.4mm or even 304.8” with a bullet that it 2.48mm larger in diameter. Let that sink in. They invest hours crafting an argument as to why they are better because they use a bullet 2.48mm larger in diameter, but miss by 100mm to 300mm. Their inability to shoot has an effect 41 to 123 times greater than their bullet diameter does.\n\nLearn to shoot.\n\n[URL]https://www.facebook.com/#!/TheDeadeyeMethod/posts/556470631040646[/URL][/QUOTE]\n\nHAHAHAHA! so true :D', 1, 1, '58.27.215.126', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

House was in the middle of a forest with a fair bit of land. Lizards were common living space invaders but had 1 rattle snake and 1 black cobra grace us. Rattle snake was spotted by our cat Tom, who ran out of that room like he''d been scared s''less, which gave us the indication something was in the room next to my room. I, 14 or 15 then, walked in the room to find the rattling sound .... ''mommmmm .... snaaaaaake ....'' close door, and ran to call Juma Waan (our hard core Indonesian gardener). This guy was fearless ... arrived with a long stick he had for catching snakes and in 5 minutes the rattle was bagged. Second time was the cobra coiled up outside parents room, mid-afternoon. Mom was snoozing and when she woke she called the maid to remove the ''rassi'' from the front of the room. Baffled maid walked to the corridor only to scream ''sapppp baaji'' ... again the gardener to rescue. Both times living snakes were handed over to pest control govt agency - they killed the rattle snake but took the cobra away live, don''t know why ...\n\nOne thing Juma Waan told us was to avoid killing the snake inside the house as where one kills the snake the others are likely to visit. On the single lane road to the house from the main road, every other week a snake of some kind would fall victim to the car tyres. After the rattle snake incident and watching the agency people smash it''s head, we started driving slow to avoid wrecklessly killing these creatures. \n\nWould recommend you get a garbage picking stick, modify the length and picker face, or order a snake catcher stick.', 1, 1, '223.29.228.162', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

Tried to reason with it by getting a Gamo Shadow CSI which in its catagory is a hell of an air rifle (it really is). But then @sansyed keeps posting the clips of his unbelievable shots. Plus the performance equal to that of a .22lr (or even better) and the No need for a license No problems in carrying it around were good enough reasons to get one. One of my main concerns was the weight as I intend to carry it in the field for birds hunting. Walther Dominator and Diana P1000 were few excellent options but the weight of these kept me away from these. after some thorough research I managed to get my hands on a masterpiece of its catagory the BSA Ultra Multi Shot. BSA has been making rifles for over 100 years and this surely tells of their fine work.\n\nIt weighs around 3Kg which is very comfortable to carry around.\nThe rifle is 100% accurate that means one can get a single hole group at 50 yards. while test firing I was hitting a half inch pipe at about 25 yards while standing.\n10 Rounds Magazine.\nHammer forged free floating match grade barrel.\n2 stage adjustable match trigger.\nMicro movement cocking/decocking system.\nMine has a beech stock and is fitted with AGS 3-9x40mm mil dot AO scope which provides a very crisp view of the target.\nthe thing you notice right after the first shot that it is a very quiet shooter. Its sound is lesser than my Gamo shadow csi.\nAlso got a 3 stage FX pump. The rifle is relatively easy to fill up to 220 bars.\n\nI am thankful to brother sansyed, verve and other friends for their help, support and to motivate me to make the choice which I am certain I wont regret. sansyed often said Life starts with a P and Ends with a P, now I know why he said that.\n\nNeed some good pellets now @sansyed bro  your help will be greatly appreciated :)\n\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]28852[/ATTACH]\n\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]28853[/ATTACH]', 1, 1, '39.32.6.188', 0, 1, 2, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

ATF would be for automatic transmission/gearbox only and not for power steering as PS oil is quite different. \r\nYour suggestion of using a quality ATF makes good sense to use in guns - genuine Honda ATF 1quart costs 1k and that''s plenty to lube many many guns. Mixing oils of different viscosities and weightings, i.e ATF and Mobile 1 or fully synthetic with semi-synthetics or mineral oils, however I wouldn''t recommend as that can cause early degradation of the oil.

Another point to highlight here is the round capacity of Viking, 18 rounds in the magazine does feel a lot especially when you r out and the other one is still going :)\n\nPS : During the course of firing on to the target 01 X round FTF in EZ9 , I was unable to determine y that happened, as my friend started making fun of it but after clearing the round from the barrel ,the gun fired smoothly .
