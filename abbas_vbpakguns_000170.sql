(654025, 'Are Baikal chokes that bad? Hi there!\n\nI have my Baikal 27 12gauge since last fall and it was manufactored in June/2015.\nIt came with three chokes, a half in the lower and a full in the upper barrel and a quarter separately.\nThey are all stamped lead and steel capable. According to the manual it is not really clear to me if I can use steel shot or not in that gun because it is not CIP-stamped with the steel-shot "lilly".\nWhen I read the several threads in diverse forum almost everbody uses aftermarket skrew-in chokes instead of the one that came with the gun and I wonder why. I did not find any markable explanation for this except for the prolonged ones which are turnable without the wrech and protect the muzzles.\nI''m satisfied with my chokes so far but maybe you guys can give me some reason to buy me some new chokes?\nOh btw, please don''t write to much in your language because my Urdu is absolutely zero and therefore I''ve problems to understand some postings when I browse this great forum!\n\nBest regards\nMathi', ''),

Even after hours of arguing at the GPO i only got the price down to 20k and had to pay that. The real depressing thing was that the laptop wasent even worth much.

That is all it matters. I have seen a few people at various shooting ranges with Baikal guns/factory chokes and they, as you say, crack clays as skillfully as a few owners of Beretta and Browning do.\nHowever, here is my take based on my very limited knowledge of this complicated subject: \nAs you mentioned extended choke tubes protect the muzzle and are easy to change without the wrench. Additionally, choke constriction is stamped on the extend part and you don’t have to look at the muzzle to count the notches to see what tube you had already installed. Another important factor to use extended tube is to improve pattern efficiency and quality, and there are many studies out there to prove that. Even in extended chokes, differences in lengths of their tapered and parallel sections change pattern efficiency. You should do homework by patterning your gun with different combinations of Baikal tubes, shot sizes, shot materials, payloads and mfg brands at your normal shooting distance/s. Pattern efficiency is not dependent on level of constriction alone and aftermarket tubes will not necessarily give you the advertized constriction relative to the bore diameter of you gun.\nThereafter, if you don’t like using choke wrench and cannot get a satisfactory pattern then try an aftermarket tube and repeat the same process to see if you get your money’s worth. \nYou can use steel shots in your gun, especially if its manufacturer says so. However, you should use ammo that complies with CIP standards to avoid any long term damage to your barrel. CIP also sets maximum constriction limit for high performance steel.', ''),

(654135, ' Added on 23 Feb 2012:During the past one year, I have come across numerous cases of cracking of Baikal Viking polymer frame. Three of these cases were personally inspected by me. In two cases, an arms dealer who was known to me showed me two grease packed NIB MP446 which had a cracked frame. I could not take the pics but both the frames were cracked in the area between trigger guard and the right portion of slide release lever. Both these were 2010 model guns. After a few day, a friend reported that the frame of his Viking has also cracked after shooting around 100 rounds. I inspected that gun as well and found the frame cracked from the same place as in case of first two handguns. Two more cases were reported to me but I did not personally inspect those guns. I am of the view that there is some serious quality control issue with Baikal 2010 and 2011 models. \r\n\r\nAdded on 28 Feb 12: A few pics of the cracked frame aided ([url]http://thegunforum.net/viewtopic.php?p=37356#p37356[/url]).

(654271, 'HID Search Light (DIY) AoA Brethren.\n\nA quick attempt to improve the output and results of a search / spotlight without spending a fortune. \n\nAlthough this one hour job was in pipeline since the introduction of less expensive HID kits but never materialized due to ''always ready'' lights at hand. Fortunately or unfortunately, a few days back, I was carrying only one light and its halogen bulb gave up. The spare 3 bulbs were found to be fused just by being in the vehicle in a padded box for over a year. So here is what it yielded. \n\n I happen to have two different pairs of identical lights among others, so for this comparison chose one pair that is a bit tricky to install an HID kit due to backspace.\n\nThese lights are easily available under Rs. 2k / pc.

I am glad to announce that I have tested the handgun in question over the weekend and found it to behave as expected.\n\nAK I agree with you a 100% on the pre-purchase decision and having done all the requisite homework. I knew exactly which gun I wanted with all its pros and cons. My only concern was if the piece I purchased had any manufacturing defects that exhibited only when the gun was in actual use. Ahsan Sb was accommodating enough to assure me that I would be facilitated, if that were the case. The good news is that I won''t be needing any facilitation :)\n\n[QUOTE=AK47;491828]You''re an exception to be given this chance. With thanks to PARA and Ahsan Sahib.\n\nGenerally you need not check functioning of NIB imported handguns.\n\nWhen buying from credible outlet with pro-customer approach like PARA, a video of first session would be enough to convince them into change of weapon, IF any malfunction due to manufacturing fault. This is a rarity occasion however.\n\nAs for how a handgun behaves in your hands, or how you "feel" about it, I''m of the opinion that it''s a pre-purchase evaluation by your good self that counts, and your study of the weapon intended.\n\nThis, humbly, cannot be an obligation on part of the seller. So....they''re indeed being nice to you.\n\nDo your study of intended weapon and ask for PARA''s words on cooperation, IF handgun does not operate functionally.

( Before i tried to weld them to the plate but that dident work out as planned)  I fixed the copper plate right behind the light and ran the wires outside the casing/enclosure ( was a plastic enclosure ) \n\nThen i took a old scrap PC processor/cpu heatsink off a blown Pentium 4 ( Dont ask ) and drilled holes in the side of the heatsink where the aluminium is still a solid block ( asked my local auto workshop to do it, he used a 3mm drill bit ). I bent the copper wires in a way that each wire went into a drilled hole in the heat-sink, then using a bit of wood as a kind of gasket i attached the heatsink to the side of the enclosure. \n\nThe project worked out great! It was as cool as a cucumber, and it ran for upto 6+ hours at a time ( never tested it any further ) ( The power source was two honda 125 batteries in parallel ) \n\nThe only issue was if by chance you touched the naked copper wires, you were in for a world of pain. \n\nBut alas, the 125 batteries died after about 4 months in of daily use, then it got thrown around till it mysteriously disappeared one day....\n\nThe lights i used were 1 watt led lights, about 20 ish of them bought them for about 7 rs each. If anyone has played with the more powerful LEDs here, they would know the amount of heat they output.', ''),

It must be a long time back. You must be enjoying the ease now as complete assemblies are available with drivers and heat sinks already attached and even enclosures to go with them.\n\nI had a little experience while attempting to make an LED lightbar for offroad use out of raw LEDs. At that time a very few people were importing LED lightbars for 4x4s and were selling those for around Rs.50,000. Now those bars are down to 1/3rd of that price.\n\nKhair, at that time, matching drivers, heat sinks, enclosures and reflectors were almost non-existent. Few people had them and that too mismatched or unsuitable. Even sourcing thermal paste was a challenge...So my experiment went on hold and a few years later the market was full of complete plug-n-play assemblies and lightbars etc. Alhamdo Lillah.\n\nAnd heat is always there except if its a photon based light source...Even so, one cannot hold a small halogen bulb with bare fingers for more than three seconds when its ON. The related equipment is always designed to withstand all that heat. The problems occur mostly due to substandard equipment and materials used.\n\nKind regards', ''),

You might have fired the same type (make and model) numerous times but at the time of purchase what I am interested in is how the pistol (this very piece) I am buying will behave.\n\nEven a fresh out of the plastic film pistol might malfunction. And such malfunction might not be detectable in dry fire or other inspection (at least not by me). Ihsan Sb and his crew at PARA were nice enough to accommodate me to test the pistol at my own convenience and facilitate me if things in anyway were not in order. With the current law and order situation, such a situation leaves a person like me in a fix.

BTW all famous old firearms makers started small,and we call these talented people "criminals" ,totally wrong charge and definition. \nAccording to one dealer DSA DB S by S guns are exported and will cost around 12Lacs.(6 or 7 top firearms can be bought in this price) And all my life I thought these to be max 25k.', ''),

I never had an experience for buying cartrages for the said gun as in last 23 years we did not bought any cartriage except the time we bought the gun.

I was for quite a time assuming that my gun uses 5.45 x 39 ammo for .222 is it a nice assumption?\n4).

You want a cure for the flinch? \n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nCount out loud: ONE TWO. \n\nNow do it again faster: ONE TWO. \n\nAnd again real fast: ONE TWO. \n\nNow point with your pistol using a normal 2 hand hold with both of your thumbs pointing in the same direction as the barrel. \nWith your pistol pointed below the target, bring it up slowly to the target. As soon as you are on target say "ONE". Now say "TWO" and pull the trigger at the same time. ONE = found target TWO = bang. \n\nWhen you are bringing your pistol onto the target, this is hunt mode. Hunt mode can be from side to side or bottom to top. Start traning with bottom to top as explained above. When you find your target say "ONE". When you say "TWO" pull the trigger. \n\nOne Two = Target Bang\n\nWhy does the ONE TWO method work? It keeps you from thinking too much and removes indecision. Thinking too much and holding your aim on target too long causes the wiggles. Anticipating the recoil and bang causes fliches. Counting out loud ONE TWO gets your mind off the recoil and bang. After hours of training using ONE TWO, reflexes start taking over and you start shooting good. \n\nFor further read :[URL]http://www.best9mm.com/shootingtip.html[/URL][/QUOTE]', ''),

A ACOG or a Red dot/holosight. \n\nOh, be careful, you might end up buying a gun that is considered to be PB in pak and post it hear. Check before you post.\n\nPost some pics of that ammo too. \n\nLook up youtube for cleaning a ar 15, and make sure to oil the gun and wipe off grease before first use. \n\nBUY MORE AMMO. \n\nand of different brands. 200-300 rounds is enough to break it in, use junk ammo for it. ( i usually fire Tulammo for junk plinking ammo) \n\nThen when you have that all done, decide if you wanna shoot accurately or if you wanna shoot fun. \n\nMod your ar accordingly, if you want, and then just keep using tulammo or remanufactured ammo for fun shooting or something like speer, federal etc for accurate. \n\n\nEach ammo is different, buy small boxes first of 4-5 brands then see if your gun likes it or not. If you use optics, remember you have to re-zero the optics for different ammo brands, weights, and loads.\n\nBuy bulk to save cash, i usually go for 500 rounds at a time. It lasts me a month or two.\n\nLearn gun safety rules and trigger discipline. \n\nClean after every use, and buy a budget gun safe ( 200-300 dollars ) or gun locks+ trigger lock. \n\nKeep unloaded when not shooting, or about to shoot. ( Dont load it and go to the range etc, load it AT the range ) Range masters are very finicky, and don''t tolerate breaches in discipline. ( \n\nAlternatively, always remove receiver before storage for safety.  \n\nNow this is the west, so a few rules apply when owning guns. From my own experiences, these have to be followed very strictly. \n\n1.) NEVER talk about your gun. Ever. Don''t tell anyone aside from other gun owners at the range, online ( where you are anonymous ) or other people in your home. Your non-gun loving friends, coworkers, neighbours, keep them in the dark. It is for your own safety above all else. Law enforcement is a exception. If they show up at your door, and ask to come in, the first thing you need to inform them is of the weapon, and where it is. They will , likely take a look, and while they do follow all basic common sense rules. No sudden movements, let them touch the gun first ( don''t pick it up and give it to them ) , have your licence ready to show at all times.  The only time you should mention your own ownership of a gun in casual conversation, is if the other person has done so first. \n\n2.) Inform other people in your house where it is ( depending on their trustworthiness. no kids, no teens ) , and instruct them to never talk about it too. Always keep it locked away, and prohibit access to it unless under your direct supervision. Even when under direct supervision, never hand them ammo, never hand them the mag, never take off the locks. \n\n3.) You have a desire to show it off. I know. I had it too. I still have it . [B][I][U]DONT[/U][/I][/B]. \n\n4.) when taking it anywhere, never keep it in the passenger area in your car. Always the trunk/boot, and follow the same rules as in no 1 if stopped by a cop.\n\n5.) Don''t use your range bags for day to day use. It almost happened to me, nearly took a 9mm round that  I missed to a public mall. \nThey likely smell of gunpowder, and probably have a few loose rounds in them. Don''t use them for anything else other then range use. \n\n6.) Read up on your states gun laws. They vary, and are very unusual. Things like putting a slanted foregrip is illegal, but straight grip is not. Check online before any mods, and before any mods double check with your local gun shop. I live in canada so the laws are mostly the same all round, but that is not such for the US. \n\n7.) On occasion, you will get approached at the range. Put down your rifle and check clear before you start talking to anyone or doing anything else. If a range master is trying to get your attention, and you turn around with your loaded rifle...that will not turn out well. \n\n8.) Make white people friends at the gun shop and range. This is important. We already have a certain....stereotype. ( I have been asked many...questionable things. Gun owners have a much larger right wing demographic then most, so be on guard. ) \n\nUse your most politically correct face, and answer with a smile. \n[I][U]Go out of your way to offer help to other people at the range[/U][/I] Whenever you go to a range, there are some people who just stare.\n\n Which is fine, but just smile back, and if they do it while you are shooting, the best method ive found is to just offer to let them shoot your gun, while making a reference to their staring. If they refuse, insist once or twice, then go back to shooting. So far , that method has served me well.\n\nOnce you are bit better known by the owner, and the crowd there, all is fine. They treat every newcomer with a bit of healthy skepticism, but its a bit more concentrated when it comes to us.\n\n\nThats about it really.', ''),
(655560, ' Be sure to remove the trigger slacks before calling the numbers 1-2 to aim and shoot!!!![QUOTE=Ka_Khan;172729]Just find this interisting article.Just give it a try and i am sure it will help some of you. :)\n\nThis is a little trick picked up in the Navy.\n\nJust going to the range and shooting thousands of rounds does not make you a good shooter. \n\nYou know how sometimes it is difficult to hold the pistol on target, or the shakes start kicking in before you pull the trigger? You want a cure for the flinch? \n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nCount out loud: ONE TWO. \n\nNow do it again faster: ONE TWO. \n\nAnd again real fast: ONE TWO. \n\nNow point with your pistol using a normal 2 hand hold with both of your thumbs pointing in the same direction as the barrel. \nWith your pistol pointed below the target, bring it up slowly to the target. As soon as you are on target say "ONE". Now say "TWO" and pull the trigger at the same time. ONE = found target TWO = bang. \n\nWhen you are bringing your pistol onto the target, this is hunt mode. Hunt mode can be from side to side or bottom to top. Start traning with bottom to top as explained above. When you find your target say "ONE". When you say "TWO" pull the trigger. \n\nOne Two = Target Bang\n\nWhy does the ONE TWO method work? It keeps you from thinking too much and removes indecision. Thinking too much and holding your aim on target too long causes the wiggles. Anticipating the recoil and bang causes fliches. Counting out loud ONE TWO gets your mind off the recoil and bang. After hours of training using ONE TWO, reflexes start taking over and you start shooting good. \n\nFor further read :[URL]http://www.best9mm.com/shootingtip.html[/URL][/QUOTE]', ''),

Now the striker pin and the spring look like before, absolutely no signs of wear. If pushed with the finger tip it moves freely and sticks long out of the hole, same length as the upper striker.\nElsewhere, but I do not remember where, I have heard about switching these striker springs to some from a Colt 1911 which are supposed to be much better. I don''t have any idea if that is worth the effort.\nSo I think I will try my space washer on the rod before the spring to give the hammer more power.\nForgot to tell: I checked with different ammo brands as it is wellknowns to handgun primers the manufacturers use different thickness of the tin.\nI also checked the inside of the stock for rubbing marks on the wood which can slow the hammer to fall.\nI''m not unexperienced in smithing of handguns and therefore is my conclusion the spring is to weak. But why not from the very beginning when I cut some coils off?\nIn rest position both firing pin tips are flush with the receiver holes, no hiding or protruding, so I think they are not too short.\n\nBest regards\nMathi', ''),

Now I guess I found an answer:\nI cutted the coils from brand new springs and it worked great. A coil spring is prone to set after some use as each coil spring does (thats why one sometimes has to replace older recoil springs or magazin springs which have setted). Now the hammer springs have been set, the upper is still strong enough to hit but the lower hammer spring is not caused to the different angle of both firing pins in the receiver the lower needs a tad more force to be pushed forward hard enough.\nI guess this could be the solution to my probs but I will certainly give shahrozes ideas a trial before I make the spring hitting harder.\nI will give you all an update if this works or not , thats for sure.\n\nBest regards\nMathi', ''),

Then I examined the inside of the stock again for rubbing, painted the inner with some watercolor from my granddaughters paintbox and then put it all together again. I cycled the action a few, put it all apart and examined the inside. So I found a small rubbing line but not where the springs move but much more up where the pin on the hammer is which  moved the cocking bar. This pin must have rubbed slightly when the hammer is fired and in its forward position.\nSo I cleaned the wood out at this spot and there is now not anything touching the wood.\nI''m very confidend that everything is under control and my Baikal will serve again as it should.\n\nBest regards\nMathi[/QUOTE]\n\nA few questions:\nWhat made you to modify (shorten) the springs in the first place, especially before firing your gun a few hundred times?\n\nI am not very familiar with the internals of Biakal O/U but could it be possible that washer below the spring may cause a rattle once spring is in the non-compressed state?

As soon as you are on target say "ONE". Now say "TWO" and pull the trigger at the same time. ONE = found target TWO = bang. \n\nWhen you are bringing your pistol onto the target, this is hunt mode. Hunt mode can be from side to side or bottom to top. Start traning with bottom to top as explained above. When you find your target say "ONE". When you say "TWO" pull the trigger. \n\nOne Two = Target Bang\n\nWhy does the ONE TWO method work? It keeps you from thinking too much and removes indecision. Thinking too much and holding your aim on target too long causes the wiggles. Anticipating the recoil and bang causes fliches. Counting out loud ONE TWO gets your mind off the recoil and bang. After hours of training using ONE TWO, reflexes start taking over and you start shooting good. \n\nFor further read :[URL]http://www.best9mm.com/shootingtip.html[/URL][/QUOTE]\nI have modified this tip a little bit as follows:\n1. pull the trigger back to its slack-free point and hold there.\n2. raise the barrel and line up sights with bulls''eye.\n3. call ''12'' and at the same time continue to pull the trigger until hammer falls.\n\nresult: faster handling with tighter group.', '');

May be in your case your gun springs may have reached to their life time service as you already shorten them. Depending upon the shots fired, these springs lose strength over the period of time. So instead to put a washer or something (which could result bad really bad) you should check for a new spring or a matching spring with a slightly bigger length. I personally do not recommend or will try any xyz spring in the gun even if it is matching with all dimensions unless I am pretty much sure that it is made of same material or else I will consult a gunsmith to help me out. \nRegards,', ''),

(655871, ' Hello!\n\nSpoken in general is the reduced force of a hammer spring very helpful in any firearm due to reduce the pressure on the hammer notch to the sear notch. This accompanied with polishing of the inner parts of an action without reducing some of the materials mostly diminishes even a before given creep and lightens the trigger pull vastely. All done in steps and let the arm being safe.\nSo my S&W Revolver 686-4 has a leaf hammer spring and a screw which takes pressure on the leaf the more it is turned in or out. This is the way to tighten or lighten the revolvers trigger pull.\nA common 1911 style gun or a CZ75 comes with a trigger pull between about 3000 grams and up to 5k or 6k grams. This is very nice for a carry gun to prevent acidential firing but not for a target gun (even a safety lever is not used for targets).\nDue to spring setting and eased movement of the inner parts rubbing to each other will the trigger pull reduce lightly during shooting periods and practicing but not significant. So a CZ75 is known for action improvement the more it is used.\nThis fact is always to keep in mind when working at a guns trigger but in this special case of my o/u I didn''t do that, my fault!\nThe russian springs are wellknown for a extraordinary stiffness and cause the also wellknown hard breaking. Therefore is a good cure to cut some coils from the ejector springs to ease this. The side effect is the empties don''t fly all along the range. If the cocking is even lighter the shotgun better breaks open a certain amount as well.\nI would not say it is a Perazzi or Beretta for some thousant bucks then but almost as good.\nDue to target shooting regulations is a given lightest trigger pull to respect and before each contest this pull is to be checked with a pull gauge. \nThis means 1350 grams or 1500 grams in some diciplines is the minimum (they always check each cartrigde for weight and load with a sample from the box and a deloading hammer and scales to meet the given factor).\nYou can always stay above this trigger weight but not below or you are disqualified.\nWell anyway, this morning I fired some trap rounds from the lower barrel and now everything is ok as well with the upper bbl.\nTherefore I leave my Baikal as it is now and will open the action again only if something gets wrong again sometime.\nBTW:\nDue to the fact that each springs sets along with use time about 15 years ago I tried some special Wolff main springs with reduced power and new to me a rated stiffness in spring rates.\nI can tell you this does not last too long until the springs behavior works like each regular coil spring. The latest invention are springs made of flat wire instead of the rounded but I don''t got any personal ex. with them.\nDon''t hesitate for more!\n\nBest regards\nMathi', ''),

That document is written in Persian and is jotted down in persuasion of a Quranic injunction to write down every deal or transaction one makes. The area mentioned in the document presently falls in Balochistan and third relic is the ring which I wear since 2003. It bears the name of my same grandfather, in mirror image, who had the honour of writing a copy of Quraan . It is a seal or stamp which my grandfather used to affix on the &#8220;Fatwa&#8221; or &#8220;Decree&#8221; he used to issue in capacity of a Mufti . Please note that the area, to which my forefathers belonged to, or even the area I live in today, is unfortunately considered one of those having a very less literacy rate. One could imagine that even in those areas, which are still ravaged by illiteracy, my great grandfathers were educated enough to write Quraan , document their transactions and issue decrees centuries ago\n\nThe reason of telling you about my family background is just to let you friends know that being a member of an an educated family , I am well versed with the literature of, Persian , Sindhi , Balochi, , Urdu ,Punjabi , Pashto, Arabic Hindi etc , either by reading those languages directly or through translations and now through modern education, I am well versed with the literature of west also . It is a very strange phenomenon that literature of nearly all those languages is teemed with the references of weapons of the era before the machines rose to prominence that is crudely called as Agricultural or feudal era. If you ask me , I could quote hundreds of verses from Arabic , Persian , ,sensikrat (the root language or the mother language of Indo- Aryan languages and German language) hindi , balochi , Punjabi , sindhi , sraiki , Urdu languages, in which the swords , arrows , bows , daggers , spears etc etc are mentioned as the references to the beauty of beloved or in any other related matter. In the classic literature of these languages, a lover is described to have felt that a pair of arrows has pierced through his heart when his beloved raises her eyes and looks at him. At some moments, a poet describes the curt behavior of his beloved as deadly as direct blow a spear dipped in venom. For poets and lovers , the moments passed in separation from the beloved are passing over them as the sharp edge of sword passes over the throat of one who is being slaughtered . At the moments the curved eye brows of beloved are compared to tight bows that help fire a volley of arrows of the deadly sights from the eyes of beloved. And interestingly, in the eastern languages, these references are still used in their poetry . I have never heard or red and poetic piece where the sight of beloved is compared to the a 50 BMG bullet fired from a Barret sniper rifle ,or the wink of an eye from the loved one is compared to a 9mm round . or I have never hared any song in which it is said the un- courteous behavior of beloved has devastated the heart of lover as a rocket propelled grenade or a javelin missile devastates a tank or APC .  There are lots of phrases like &#8220;stabbing in back&#8221; but I am yet to hear a proverb like &#8220;firing in the back (or front)&#8221;. There are some notes though, in western poetry, about the present day weapons, but those very few poetic works are yet to be acclaimed by the literary critics as the permanent and classical parts of literatures of the respective languages\n\nIt is even a strange phenomenon that on one hand , the modern weapons based on firearm principles, have been very actively shaping the geopolitical scenario of the the world since centuries , they are considered not worthy of mentioning by the writers and poets in their poetic works and lyrics but there is one exception to it too. There is a modern weapon that has been successful in making its place in the creation of poets and writers; even you can found that weapon in the building of United Nations, proudly making its presence felt by being embossed on the national flag of a sovereign, independent country\n\n[url=http://imgur.com/fr5yWSN][img]http://i.imgur.com/fr5yWSN.png[/img][/url]\n\nYes, you got it .the modern weapon that has made its way in the folk lore and literature of many languages is legendary KALASHNIKOV aka the AK47\n\nKalashnikov is the only weapon that has been able to have such profound impact not only on the geographical and political conflicts but the its legendary ruggedness and reliability has compelled the writers to mention it in their creations. This weapon is sung in folk lore of Vietnamese, Palestinian, , Russian , Afghan, pushto , Persian, balochi Sindhi, darri, tamil, and other countless languages and many other African literatures. . In my opinion , Kalashnikov is the only weapon of modern times , which , like the classic &#8220;sword&#8221; , has many names , probably different name in in every region .It is called Kalashnikov , Kelashan , Kelash , Thopak , Mashine ( local word for MACHINE),geepak etc etc This is also a fact , however , that this weapon is termed to be having evil features in the western world and is often looked down upon .\n\nThe debate of AK VS AR is a never ending debate and social media like face book and you tube and gun forums around the world are overwhelmingly filled with discussion threads and videos favoring or disfavoring the respective views . But it doesn&#8217;t seem to be reaching to any ultimate conclusion any sooner.\n\nI do not intend to fan the flames of this never ending debate, but I shall exercise my democratic right of freedom of expression being an AK lover , and shall say that I agree with a spaznatz members assertion that AK is a true friend , a mother and a beloved at the same time . It never betrays them in battle as a true friend, its presence and solid feels comforts them as a child is comforted by the soothing feel and the touch of its mother and these qualities of this weapon creates a bond of a love between the soldier and his AK and AK becomes a beloved. \n\nAn AR is also a good friend, but a good urban girl friend, decorated with modern makeup, thin, slim, and faithful to her limits but her limits are too narrow and short in comparison to an AK.\n\nIf I am asked to try to visualize both weapons / platforms with the help of the picture of my choice available on the internet, my visualization may be something like this\n\nThe AK platform\n\n[url=http://imgur.com/Yf96DaM][img]http://i.imgur.com/Yf96DaM.jpg[/img][/url]\n\nThe AR platform\n\n[url=http://imgur.com/WJHIyZA][img]http://i.imgur.com/WJHIyZA.jpg[/img][/url]\n\nI don&#8217;t have a vast experience with AR platform, but once I saw a recruit performing a remarkable maneuver. He had a wall to climb on. He un tied the sling of his AK from stock, kept his AK with its muzzle up with the wall , stepped on the magazine of his AK , jumped a bit , hold the edge of wall with his hand and stabilized himself , climbed the wall and pulled the AK up with the sling he tied in his belt hook. I don&#8217;t know if anyone could step upon the magazine of an AR to climb a wall.

(655981, ' When I got the CQA , the Chinese 5.56 rifle made on AR platform, or an M4 clone to be precise , I played a lot with it so as to develop my familiarity with AR platform . With respect to the feelings of AR lover friends, I found AR platform to be too fragile to my personal taste. May be, I am an old school guy who loves to see a weapon made in steel and wood rather than aluminum and polymer.\n\nAfter having the CQA in my inventory, When I heard about the arrival of Chinese Hilink LR3 , a rifle chambered in 556 but made on AK platform, I developed a strong desire to have it too . But the insane and a heavy price tag attached to it was more than an ocean between me and her.\nOne day my arms dealer called me and asked about thoughts to sell my BRNO model 2 , proofed in 1967. I recalled that sometimes back I mentioned about my plan to let it go , but the expected price he quoted was so low , that I thought it better to let it rest in my gun safe . His call alarmed me and I told him that I had dropped the plans to sell it. Fortunately, the would be buyer sitting beside him was so impatient that he talked to me on his phone and we exchanged numbers. Cutting long story short, he was so desperate to fulfill the desire of a political figure by gifting him a BRNO model 2 , in a good condition , that he did not waste a second to offer me a Hilink LR 3 in exchange for my BRNO model 2 and I did not waste a second to agree to the proposal either.\n\nThe day I got the gun was a beautiful cloudy day with gushing winds. I took along my friend , the one and only ED along with me to range . We had a mixture of American green tip rounds (M88) and chinese 223 to be experimented\n\nBefore going to the details of range report, here is a brief introduction with the Gun itself .\n\n[url=http://imgur.com/hSYzkTn][img]http://i.imgur.com/hSYzkTn.jpg[/img][/url]\n\n[url=http://imgur.com/0fOo0cZ][img]http://i.imgur.com/0fOo0cZ.jpg[/img][/url]\n[url=http://imgur.com/BwmMvDd][img]http://i.imgur.com/BwmMvDd.jpg[/img][/url]\n\n[url=http://imgur.com/2IjN2Ho][img]http://i.imgur.com/2IjN2Ho.jpg[/img][/url]\n\nLet&#8217;s start with butt stock and pistol grip \n\nThe butt stock is made of some moderate quality wood and finished with some cheap kind of clor . It has a trap door to accommodate a cleaning kit which is not supplied. Its opening is in the middle of middle of a metal plate fixed to stock with the help of two screws. . The pistol grip is also made up of same wood and finished with same paint. It is screwed with the gun with a nut . The sling swivel on is the stock is no good and is apparently made of cheap metal.\n[url=http://imgur.com/nG4s2Cv][img]http://i.imgur.com/nG4s2Cv.jpg[/img][/url]\n[url=http://imgur.com/wkrJCRw][img]http://i.imgur.com/wkrJCRw.jpg[/img][/url]\n[url=http://imgur.com/0Uyc5Mv][img]http://i.imgur.com/0Uyc5Mv.jpg[/img][/url]\n[url=http://imgur.com/ivqf19p][img]http://i.imgur.com/ivqf19p.jpg[/img][/url]\n\nThe gun was also available in under folding and side folding stocks. I did not like its furniture so went for a fixed stocked one so that I can change its furniture after wards. The under folding and side folding models lacks the flexibility of furniture change. The front hand guard is also no exception and is made of same cheap wood. The magpul and other stuff, made for AK platform is said to fit well to this gun\n\nMagazine\n\nThis gun uses the propriety magazine of 22 rounds. The reduced number of 22 rounds seems to be due to legal restriction barring the magazines from holding the count of bullets more than 22. The existence of 30 rounder is heard but I am yet to see one in real.\nThe magazines are crudely made and some time requires an extra attempt to be inserted in the magazine well. But once fitted in their place , they are snugly placed . In the like manner, the magazine may require an extra effort to be removed from the rifle as well . This extra effort may be due to gun being a new one and may get improved with the passage of time and use.\n[url=http://imgur.com/4vG98Lb][img]http://i.imgur.com/4vG98Lb.jpg[/img][/url]\n\n\n[url=http://imgur.com/8rewMBd][img]http://i.imgur.com/8rewMBd.jpg[/img][/url]\n\nThe gun comes with two magazines and I got other 3 extra magazines. I did not try by putting and removing them in the gun at the time or did not take those extra 3 magazines to the range too. And I had to pay for this mistake. When I returned home . I saw Those 3 extra magazines would never get inserted in the gun. I tried to force enter one of them in the gun but that stucked so badly that I had to carry it to the gunsmith for removal. The other penalty of not trying the magazines at the dealers shop, I had to pay, was taking those 3 magazines all the way back to Karachi to return them and to get new ones. I could not take the pain of taking the rifle all the way back to Karachi so I tried them in other piece available with the dealer. I was praying that these magazines may fit in my gun. My prayers were granted and they fit in the gun well . While the faulty magazines were with me, I talked with a gunsmith friend who told me that a person brought 2 magazines to him that would not fit in his Hilink and he grind magazines on their top on both sides.. The result of this procedure was positive and the magazines fitted the gun well. But I preferred to get new ones instead of doctoring the existing ones. So, my advice to those who wish to get extra magazines is to try them in their rifles on the spot.', ''),

(655982, ' Front and Rear sight\n\nThis gun has an excellent set of front and rear sights. The front sight is a typical Chinese hooded front sight that has became an icon, a hall mark of Chinese guns made on AK platform. The front sight is opened from up for adjustment. However the sights are just perfectly aligned, and, in my opinion, to meddle with their factory setting shall be a totally unwanted exercise. These sights are perfectly aligned for windage and one just has to adjust elevation to drop the bullet at target. Those sights worked wonders while my brief ranges session that shall follow this introduction.\n[url=http://imgur.com/RCsxJlc][img]http://i.imgur.com/RCsxJlc.jpg[/img][/url]\n[url=http://imgur.com/y1P6heN][img]http://i.imgur.com/y1P6heN.jpg[/img][/url]\nThe rear sight is made of steel and is adjustable in 100 meters increments up to 800 meters.\n\nThe barrel\n\nThe metallurgy of barrels of Chinese weapons is always appreciable. In my region, the Chinese AKs are even preferred over Russians. The reason , as told by prominent gunsmiths and those who possess the practical experience of firing thousands of rounds in &#8220;hot moments&#8221; is the difference in metallurgy and chrome plating. According to those practical persons, the metallurgy in Russian AKs is inferior to the Chinese one . The lands and grooves in the barrels of Russian AKs erode much earlier and drastically than Chinese guns, they opine. Moreover, the chrome plating of Russian AKs comes out in tiny bits on extensive use, while the chrome plating in Chinese guns last till the end of barrel . These are the factors that makes the Chinese AKs the first choice of the people of my region.\n[url=http://imgur.com/rOb917s][img]http://i.imgur.com/rOb917s.jpg[/img][/url]\n\nThe 16 inch barrel of Hilink LR3 is blued and chrome lined, having strong lands and grooves. The sight of interior of the barrel is impressive. It has 1/8 rate of twist that makes it capable of stabilizing modern heavier grains rounds. The gun is marked as 223 but I fire 556 green tip NATO rounds without any hesitation as I know the modern rifles are made by keeping in mind that they would be firing 556 rounds any way, thus they are capable enough to withstand the higher pressure generated by 556 rounds. The cleaning rod is attached under the barrel in AK fashion . The matal and standard of sling swivel attached to the barrel is comparatively better than the one on stock .\n[url=http://imgur.com/rE0lPT3][img]http://i.imgur.com/rE0lPT3.jpg[/img][/url]\n[url=http://imgur.com/9ehQtHH][img]http://i.imgur.com/9ehQtHH.jpg[/img][/url]\n[url=http://imgur.com/XUojrF5][img]http://i.imgur.com/XUojrF5.jpg[/img][/url]\n\nThe barrel of Hilink LR3 is threaded. It is supplied with a muzzle device of nearly 3 inches that fits by turning the device to right hand . The device has 6 Breaches and I am yet to fire the gun with this device removed. The device itself has two spots from where the device may or may not be splitted in to further parts. these apparent joints are slightly visible in shape fine and thin of straight lines from where it may be unscrewed . I tried to unscrew the device from those spots with hands but could not succeed in moving them. Haven&#8217;t tried to use tools though.\n\nThe receiver\n\nThe receiver is a stamped one and is made of steel , but thinner gauge steel is used in comparison to the that used in in AK47 aka Type 56 , the Chinese AK variant chambered in 7.62x39. And it seems reasonable too. The 7.62x39 round is way too heavier than 223 or 556 rounds so the use of metal of same gauge, meant for such a heavier round , in a small round like 333/556 would have been an over kill in my opinion. This rifle suits and feel good and solid enough in the metal it is made of and is able to withstand the pressure of 223/556 rounds. The receiver is covered by a dust cover that is identical to the dust covers used in AK rifles and unlocks in same manner. The return spring, piston, bolt and bolt carrier are all the copies of original AK 47 in the corresponding size that suits the 223/556 caliber.\n[url=http://imgur.com/UDsTuMw][img]http://i.imgur.com/UDsTuMw.jpg[/img][/url]\n[url=http://imgur.com/2BoLHw6][img]http://i.imgur.com/2BoLHw6.jpg[/img][/url]\n\n\n\nTrigger\n\nPerhaps the excellently aligned set of iron sights and the sweet trigger is most appreciable part of this rifle. Honestly speaking, I did not expect such a fine trigger from this rifle. It does not have any creep or over travel and breaks like a fine and thin glass .

(655983, ' Range report\n\nThe day I got the gun was the day I was set to return home. The time  between the delivery of gun and my schedule to leave Karachi was just  shortly apart. I had to arrange the ammo and range visit on emergency  basis. I took along ED with me and while having a working lunch in the  vsvicle we left for the range .\nWhile on our way to test the gun at range, I was thinking as to how the  invention of gun powder had changed the balance of power for ever. Prior  to its invention, the power of human body and expertise in art of  battle were the deciding factors for human battles / wars . After the  invention of gun powder, the muscle power or expertise became  irrelevant. Now even a child can kill a seasoned fighter of the size of a  Somo wrestler from distance. In my opinion, that balance of power,  which was came int existence after the invention of gun powder was  furher re-shaped / changed eternally with the invention of AK47 . This  rugged ,reliable and agriculturally simple weapon gave the individuals  and groups the power and capability beyond their wildest dreams . This  indestructible device was the source of many changes ingeography,  history , regimes and social values. Its ease in manufacturing resulted  in its unprecedented proliferation and this weapon , now , needs no  introduction in any part of world .\nThe society of Sindh was also no exception in getting affected by this  tool that reshaped the world . Sindh had always been a society with a  very limited number of weapons . The persons having single barrel or  double barrel 12 gauge shot guns were respected in society and the  village where a gun existed was often ignored by the thieves which were  the tough guys of those times. The official weapon of police was a Lee  Enfield bolt action rifle chambered in the 303 , often referred as  jungle carbine , which was locally called &#8220;Sulfi Rifle&#8221; due to the shape  of its typical flash hider ( sulfi is pipe sort of apparatus , made  from clay , used to smoke tobacco of Hashish . The upper part of sulfi  resembles the flash hider of jungle carbine, thus the name).\n\n\nThe Sulfi\n[URL="http://imgur.com/AL6C81A"][IMG]http://i.imgur.com/AL6C81A.jpg[/IMG][/URL]\nThe Lee Enfield jungle carbine rifle\n[URL="http://imgur.com/l33f5he"][IMG]http://i.imgur.com/l33f5he.jpg[/IMG][/URL]\nThe flash hider of Lee Enfield Jungle Carbine rifle\n[URL="http://imgur.com/aXUGAne"][IMG]http://i.imgur.com/aXUGAne.jpg[/IMG][/URL]\n\nIn those days , Sindh was a heaven . A calm and peaceful land . The  peasants and farmers work in their fields in day time and gather in  spacious &#8220;Ottaque&#8221; or community gathering places in the nights to  discuss the issues , settle the pity disputes and chat. There was entire  tribe or community namely &#8220;Bhatt&#8221; or &#8220;Charan&#8221; who were local poets and  entertainers but their standard of entertainment was so much high. They  used to record the important events in their poetic verses and sing them  for centuries to come. They were the source of Most of the history  recorded in our region. The society supported them collectively. On the  occasion of harvest of crop, a fixed quantity of grain , along with some  dresses of cloths and some cash was given to them by each household ,  so that they should keep them entertained and record the history without  worrying about their subsistence. These folk artists/ entertainers tell  folk stories to the audience with music . Some of the stories last for  many nights . Every new comer was greeted in a traditional and a very  interesting manner . They sung soofi (Mystical) songs and verses of Shah  Abdul Lteef Bhittai in the corresponding nights of lunar months (  shah&#8217;s poetry is sung according to Surr (Melodies) which are divided to  be sung according to seasons and nights of lunar month) .The houses in  those villages did not had doors as most of the villages consisted upon a  single tribe or community closely related to each other. The only fear  they had was the thieves who come for some cattle heads but their dogs  were enough to contain them . And in case , the owner woke up during  theft , the thieves preferred to escape rather than confront. Those were  the last days of peaceful Sindh and that tradition of night gathering  which were called &#8220;Katchehries&#8221; was soon to be over and vanish forever  in the sound of burst fires of AK 47. I can remember that the news  papers published in old styled press , use to bear the pictures of  notorious bandits of that era in which the bandoliers of 12 gauge  cartridges were wrapped around their waist and simple people of that era  get impressed with those pictures .\nParoo Chandio , a notorious outlaw ,killed decades ago , posing with a jungle carbine he snatched from police\n[URL="http://imgur.com/CRZ22Bh"][IMG]http://i.imgur.com/CRZ22Bh.jpg[/IMG][/URL]\nBut after 1983 , suddenly a new weapon was introduced out of blue, and  with stunning speed, it took the entire Sindh by storm. The overwhelming  fire power of this gun (AK47) and its mysterious easy availability  resulted in mushroom growth of gangs of ruthless bandits which were  unknown to the culture of Sindh of respecting the females even during  robberies. Suddenly fort like walls start to emerge in the viilages in  which the boundaries of the homes were defined by the man&#8221;s height  fences of thorny bushes. The heavy wooden and metal gates started to  restrain the free passage of cool morning breeze in the streets where  the doors were considered as wastage of wealth and un necessary thing.  Those were the days in which peaceful Sindh that had preserved its  culture since centuries was lost forever. it was only after many years  that we came to know that the price we paid in shape of losing our  peaceful and tolerant society was due to taking part in CIA sponsored  Jihad , being waged by CIA created Mujahedeen , who were selling the AKs  and their ammo supplied to them to the criminals of our land dirt cheap  .\nMy thoughts were discontinued as we reached at the range.\nI thought to zero the rifle first at 50 meters and proceeded to the 50  meters range. The first shot went off and wow, I was amazed at the  sweetness of trigger . That first shot was a hit on the target which was  a standard steel plate . The hit was a bit high though . I zeroed the  gun in few shots and within few shots I was hitting the plate constantly  .\nThe gun and 50 meters range\n[URL="http://imgur.com/wRQeGxZ"][IMG]http://i.imgur.com/wRQeGxZ.jpg[/IMG][/URL]\nI am happy to have you, baby\n[URL="http://imgur.com/olpyxPi"][IMG]http://i.imgur.com/olpyxPi.jpg[/IMG][/URL]\n[URL="http://imgur.com/bgs0yB0"][IMG]http://i.imgur.com/bgs0yB0.jpg[/IMG][/URL]\nED and range master showed me a target paper already installed on a  stand with one hole in it already. We kept that hole in mind and I fired  a 5 shot group on the paper and what a group it was . Less than one and  half inch . The magazine was filled with the rounds alternating the  Chinese Norinco 223 ammo and American green tips ball ammo. But the  rifle was treating both rounds alike. I gave the rifle to ED who was  once a bitter critic of this gun but when he was finished with firing  his rounds, he was a completely changed person. For the first time I  heard admiring words about this gun from him that are still pouring  without any stoppage .\nAfter that I turnred to the longest range available at our disposal  there. It was 277 meters. 10 to 20 meters were added to it since our  last visit to it when I purchased my CQA. It was also test fired in this  range and I was able to hit the plates installed at the distance of 260  meters with iron sights twice . This time the range was added with some  extra meters and when I start to shoot, I was surprised to see that  this AK based gun was hitting more accurately than my CQA. In a 5 shots  group , I was able to hit the farthest plate for 3 times . This was  impressive and satisfying for me and was only due to the excellent  trigger and set of iron sites that this rifle is equipped with \nED wondering and amazed as to why he was critical to this gun\n[URL="http://imgur.com/8NZT2jV"][IMG]http://i.imgur.com/8NZT2jV.jpg[/IMG][/URL]\nThe carbon fouled internals of then after brief range session\n[URL="http://imgur.com/oPvUKC0"][IMG]http://i.imgur.com/oPvUKC0.jpg[/IMG][/URL]\n[URL="http://imgur.com/XoR9sOh"][IMG]http://i.imgur.com/XoR9sOh.jpg[/IMG][/URL]\n[URL="http://imgur.com/IjsgoVE"][IMG]http://i.imgur.com/IjsgoVE.jpg[/IMG][/URL]', ''),

I completed the rudimentory oil finished stock to a matte satin and nice grained stocks, rounded all metal and wooden edges a bit and made it handsome and good looking in comparision to much more expensive shotguns I''ve seen on several occasions.\nNot just once I heard a shout from other sporters or hunters like this: "Oh this is really a Baikal?

(656068, 'MOI License inheritance Gentlemen, I''ve spent a fair number of hours in the archives looking up this issue, but there are still gaps in my knowledge, especially in regards to current procedure (as a lot of things may change with time), and was hoping to receive some assistance with my issue, which is as follows:\n\n\n[LIST=1]\n[*]I have a MOI license belonging to my late father, which has a .32 ACP pistol on it, which as far as I know, is considered NPB in Pakistan. Both the pistol and the license reside in Lahore. \n[*]A secondary issue is that this license has not been renewed after 2013. I wish to know if there is any circumstance in which I can rectify this. From what I read, if it''s been over 2 years, the license stands cancelled. I don''t know whether I should renew this before applying for transference under inheritance, or after, or if it''s not necessary at all. \n[*]As an added issue, there''s also a .22 caliber rifle that''s in Karachi. This, however, is missing documentation. It is quite possible that my father did not have this transferred to him after the death of my grandfather. As it stands, the license is not present, and I need to get this on my license after the MOI license transfer goes through. I''m unsure whether this will go on the same MOI license or not, as the information in the archives is slightly confusing (it can''t on one license but can on a booklet). I understood the booklet to be a single license, but if it isn''t, perhaps someone could shed some light onto this? The MOI license my father had is a booklet. \n[*]Somewhat of a minor concern at the moment, but the allowance for cartridges in the MOI license is 100. Should I increase this, or will this be set to a new limit after the transfer? \n[/LIST]\n\n [FONT=Calibri]I''m aware that this is a long post, but I am quite concerned about getting these firearms under my name legally, the method for which seems pretty convoluted here. Please understand that I''m not very familiar with the workings in the country, so terms such as DGI etc. (I noticed many more in the archives) may fly over my head.\n[/FONT]\n  \n  [FONT=Calibri]Procedurally speaking, the archives suggested that going to a dealer would be the best option. I don''t have any idea of where/whom I should contact for this scenario. If memory serves, the name of a dealer stamped on the license is H M Butt or something.\n\nI appreciate the time you gentlemen spent reading thus far, and look forward to reading your responses.\n[/FONT]', ''),

Go figure, the bullets are 11,5 mm and there was and is nothing to blame on this gun!\nIf my shooting is more than 18mm I''ve to blame it just on me and my skills. \nThis is same for a serious clay shooter who wants to win in competitions and its ok but they would never give a damn to a Baikal even if impressed by it and its abilities.\n\nBest regards\nMathi', ''),

It has "U.S. Army" and "United States Property" written on it. Is it legal to own? Will there be a problem getting it on my license?\n[ATTACH]36409[/ATTACH]\n[ATTACH]36410[/ATTACH][/quote]', ''),

(656171, ' [QUOTE=ajmal virk;493790]As per international law you cannot own this gun as this is property of USA army and they have international agreements no one can own [/QUOTE]\n\nThe US Government stamps almost everything as "US Property."  They sold off almost all of their 1911s to the civilian market, not to mention ones they gave to foreign governments.\n\nHowever, Remington Rand 1911s are quite highly desirable and collectible in the USA.  Though the US government will have no interest in it, if you were to bring it to the US you would be plagued by collectors offering you money or trades.  You might have to shout or throw sticks at them.\n\nFrom the pictures the one you found looks to be in good shape.  If the price is right, it''s a piece of history you can own with pride.\n\n\n[sometime in the late 1960s the US Navy sent a submarine up into the Soviet north, under the ice between the Soviet mainland and the arctic ice cap.  Divers worked at extreme depth and freezing temperatures and found a military telephone cable connecting parts of the Soviet Rocket Defense Force bases and spliced a recording device into the cable.  At intervals the sub would return to download all the information from the device.  This worked fine until some Soviet communications technicians determined there was a fault in the cable, and when their divers arrived to try to fix it, they found a big box with "PROPERTY OF THE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT" stenciled on the side.  The Soviets instantly filed a protest against the American government, but the device was so secret it took the White House several days to find anyone who knew anything about it...\n\n"It''s the government.  It doesn''t have to make sense."]', ''),

(656280, ' Yes Afzaal,\n\nthis is true and the reason why the lower barrel didn''t sometimes fail with the weakened spring while the upper bbl is ok with the same spring (I interchanged them for testing).\nOne thing makes me wonder! If someone has the original and not altered springs with a tremendous force in his gun there might be very much power on the hammers to ignite each cartrigde sure. Why is then a slightly prolonged firing pin in need? Does this been owed to the fact of manufacturing tolerances in fp lenght, this would be the only reason to explain it to me? I checked mine by pressing them with a finger in and the fp sticks far wide enough out of the hole. My concern was rather to make them too long. I exp. this when repairing a broken fp in a friends 50 years old u/o. I cut away the pikes remain and drilled a 2,5mm hole some mm deep into the shaft. then I used an outcasted dull 2,5mm spiral drill shaft and made new fp from it. At first try it was half a mm too long and protrudes this out of the hole, leaving a rubb scratch on shells bottom  and caused the gun hard to open. Then I shortened the new ignitor for this 0.5mm to fit close to the hole when in rest position and then everything was fine. and the repair works well since then.\nSo your prolonged fps are only in need, my guess, if they are too short and don''t fit flat with the receivers holes.\n\nThanks and best regards\nMathi\n\nOh another reason for extra long fp came just into my mind:\nNot only manuf. tolerances are due to this but many shotguns are badly manuf. in fittig the barrels exactly plain to the receiver hinge and so there is a more distance often at the lower area, almost invisible to see and therefore the fp down needs more way to reach the shell. This can also happen to a widely used and sort of worn out hinges. So the proposed test to check the tightness if placing a money bill into the gap and then closing the the gun shows failure in thinking. If you can pull out the bill from the locked gun it is too loose but if the bill sticks the gun is tight enough. This test will only show a very wobbly gun which is not longer safe to fire but this does not prove the wobble in the lower area.\nI hope I made it reasonably clear what I was talking bout,guys!', ''),

(656283, ' Addition:\nThe money bill test for tightness and safeness of a shotgun remains from the times when sxs (side by side) are more common than o/u. This would not be a problem to test sxs by this because the bbls are same level. So this is different to a o/u where the lower bbl is deep down and so this methode can lead to wrong conclusions and mostly the lower bbl is much more fired than the upper.\nEven if the lower bbl is no longer tight there is often nothing to notice while the back blowing gases or even the shells broken bottom or protruding cap is covered inside the closed gun.

(656290, ' Hi!\nFrom reloading handgun ammo I know (even with different brands of factory ammo) there is the Federal primers to be the thinnest tin and so there is not mucgh need of a harder impact. Shotgun ammo is also different in primers. Maybee shimming your hammer springs as I did now would cure the igniting failures.\nWell I shortened the ejector springs as many times suggested for 5 coils and it was better then. Since I never use ejection but the extraction (easy to grab the empties and not supposed the look for thrown shells on trap range) the was very much easier to close then and checked ejection was only some feet away and working best.\n\nThe reason why I cutted the hammer springs was my feeling the original are way to touch as the other springs in that gun. So I did it as I always do with by me worked up 1911 and CZ75 types to make a crisper and cleaner trigger action. I think I explained this very before. My mistake was to do this in my Baikal with the brand new and not setted hammer springs and after thes have been set the lower one was to weak then.\nFor sure is that weaker hammer springs cause the gun in opening easier either because the cocking bars need less power to cock the hammers.\nI''ve reed elsewhere that a guy took 1911 hammer springs which fit and work very well in his Baikal. If my repair would not have been sucessful I had planned to try this. I have a huge supply in different 1911 springs, the factory gun has 23 but there are many lighter hammers springs in my box and I supposed any of them would do the trick.\nBut after all it was not in need because the Baikal ignites and shoots each different ammo I feed it with.\nAs I claimed before always beeing careful when altering some springs and never forget about the gunsmithing rules as I did it in this case. This may help other Baikal shooters especially those who are still waiting for the guns ease up after some thousand shell trough it. Then all springs must have been set enough and some can on shortening some.\nBTW in some firearms is the tip of the striker way oftoo wide or round and it can improve the ignition if slightly altering the tip to more sharp but surely not too much so the primer could be punctured. In worst case if puncturing the striker pin stuck in the primer instead of marching back by its spring pressue and the gun is not open or even breaking the striker off. This is very often the reason for broken striker pins and mostly caused by oiled or gunked up areas where a striker has to fly free forth and back.\n\nBest regards\nMathi', ''),

My scopes include European (Swarovski/Zeiss/Minox), US (Shepherd) and Japanese models (Tasco) - this one just happened to come along and being a Philipine model......seems worth trying on a calibre I dont have.........\n\nThe scopes and single shot AR15 & variants are available in the UK - this scope suggests that longer range quarry, Fox for example, can be ''dialled-in'' without having to guess the holdover beyond the range the rifle/scope is zeroed at.....the .223 calibre has a big following for ''varminting'' (small/medium quarry) in the US - seems to work for them so, in my opinion, worth investigating.\n\nPretty sure there are a lot of riflemen/hunters in Pakistan so wondered who has used one and any experiences.......\n\nL[/QUOTE]\n\n\nI haven''t seen or heard much of anyone shooting .223 with anything more then a 9x magnification scope. \n\nMost quarry is taken at 50-140m anyway. IMHO the 12x is overkill. \n\nThere are lots of hunters in pak, but here the main play is with shotguns. Those who do own bolt actions, they tend to be old, and with 2-7x optics or the such on them. Clarity matters more then other things. \n\nMost people here take canaries as game, with air rifles and shotguns, and for the larger game shotgun slugs are used. Rifles don''t have much of a presence here.\n\nAside from the FB group i linked you to, don''t expect to find much help regarding this matter here. \n\nI would ask on some international forum regarding this.', ''),

Some extra ponds is not a bad trade if those extra ponds give me the ruggedness I need in these moments ( I am not, necessarily, talking about AK 47 aka 7.62x39 which has , no doubt, a bulky ammo , rather , I am talking about AK platform that includes AK74 aka 5.45x39 , which nearly weighs and recoils the same as 5.56x45.)\nThe American infantry men are fortunate enough to have the cutting edge technology at their disposal but what they would have felt when their guns get jammed and the barrels of their guns melt during the moments they were confronting the enemy. The battle of wanat in Afghanistan is a single example where AR platform caused the deaths of US servicemen.\nI may be wrong but I would love to have my CQA (Chinese clone of M4) or even Military issue Colt M4(if I could ever get my hands on it) for recreational shooting , but for serious business , I would always prefer a gun of AK platform.\nThe muzzle device of this gun was not snug so it was matter of concern for me .

The best option for buying a handgun in the 30k range is a chinese TT or if you''re lucky a used a cf98. \r\nYou''ve written in this thread that u''ll buy it tomorrow, and in the other thread you said you already bought it. :D so which one is it??\r\n\r\n@Shaheryar11 bro... a welcome to you too.... \r\nFirst off, firing 500 shots is NOT a benchmark to test a handgun, especially if the production is not consistent, which holds true for MOST locally manufactured weapons. No testing, no QC, no metallurgy testing..... This is why one gun MAY last for some time and another may just blow up in the shooters face. Who is going to be responsible if something like this happens because you advised it??? What I dont understand is, you''re paying 29k for something that doesn''t even cost 10k to the maker... and not willing to buy a time tested and battle proven handgun like the TT for less. \r\nAlso, in the other thread, you wrote that you''re happy that you didn''t buy a cz costing 5 times more :) ..... well IMHO the cz shouldn''t cost that much, but if you''re paying 29k for a "HIT OR MISS" then I guess all those people that have (knowingly or unknowingly) caused this price hike are also right in their own way because at least they are not putting themselves in danger.....something to think about :)\r\n\r\nLast but not least....

(656353, ' [QUOTE=Kamranwali;493966]Salam All,HMK86 bro, welcome to the forum. If you search the forum, you''ll find similar queries as yours.... handguns in different price ranges. The best option for buying a handgun in the 30k range is a chinese TT or if you''re lucky a used a cf98. You''ve written in this thread that u''ll buy it tomorrow, and in the other thread you said you already bought it. :D so which one is it??@Shaheryar11 bro... a welcome to you too.... First off, firing 500 shots is NOT a benchmark to test a handgun, especially if the production is not consistent, which holds true for MOST locally manufactured weapons. No testing, no QC, no metallurgy testing..... This is why one gun MAY last for some time and another may just blow up in the shooters face. Who is going to be responsible if something like this happens because you advised it??? What I dont understand is, you''re paying 29k for something that doesn''t even cost 10k to the maker... and not willing to buy a time tested and battle proven handgun like the TT for less. Also, in the other thread, you wrote that you''re happy that you didn''t buy a cz costing 5 times more :) ..... well IMHO the cz shouldn''t cost that much, but if you''re paying 29k for a "HIT OR MISS" then I guess all those people that have (knowingly or unknowingly) caused this price hike are also right in their own way because at least they are not putting themselves in danger.....something to think about :)Last but not least.... Guns and Ammo are NOT TOYS or anything to be taken lightly... you need to be careful in this regard, if you''re equipment is faulty you are putting yourself and people around you in danger.Regards.[/QUOTE]I ll show you guys what i bought in a week .', ''),

Also, apart from 5 bullets testing, the company is going to offer me 15 rounds tests and I''ll be testing the gun for like initial 500 non-stop rounds. Chinese redbox and definitely not Zololololo :p. After that, I''ll give my review. I''ll be uploading a video on YouTube and if the moderator allows me to spit out name of the manufacturer and price, I will then. Let''s see how it all goes.

Since TRAP shooting is done with a PRE-MOUNTED gun,means the shooter mounts his\n                               gun and keeps it ready towards the exit point of the clay at 15-mtrs.\n                               whereas in skeet the shooter must keep his gun low and starts to move & mount on the\n                               first sight of the clay as it comes out of the High or low house.\n\n                                So it is always good to spend your money on a single (CLAY event) which the shooter feels would\n                                earn MEDALS for him or her in the future.', ''),

(656442, ' [QUOTE=HMK86;494061]Khan  i am waiting bro!!! SAM DUZAY UKHAYA KHALKO TA!![/QUOTE]\n\nFirst of all Kamran Wali, thanks for taking out this much time and replying me in such a great detail. \n\nLet''s start with my age. I am 28 years old and won''t call myself to be a 100% of a guns expert. I have a great interest in hand guns, fighter jets and basically everything that my family hates :)\n\nI have my fair share of firing and learning experiences. I know how a good gun looks, feels, sounds and shoots like :)\n\nI understand everything that you just wrote. In fact, the only thing that I hate about Beretta is the cut-open slide. Not because of some explosive risk, but because dust particles can destroy the finishing of the barrel if a few are caught in the wrong spaces. \n\nI wanted to go for an NP-22. But I am more sort of a man who learns by experience rather than caution. I like taking risks that are calculated. Now I know I am buying a clone, but I''ll be buying those Oakley ballistic glasses and ballistic gloves too. And let''s see if that manufacturer''s piece is actually worth it or not. I went to a legendary Beretta maker (won''t take his name) and I was shown a Glock, a Beretta and even a copy of CZ P07 Duty. Beretta was like total junk, light weight, bad finishing, bad color, and internals were not smooth at all. I knew it''s a cheap 3rd class quality thing the guy is trying to sell on me. Then I checked Glock and CZ P07 Duty. I was blown away with the built quality of Duty. Exactly like original (because I happen to play with it every other Sunday). However, I found an issue with its safety. Upon hitting that safety, the hammer didn''t drop so I couldn''t achieve double decocking. :) It just disengaged the trigger while the hammer was still hot. Kinda like cocked and locked except the trigger was moving. I was taken away with that. Also, they were claiming to use 4140 grade steel "Iktalees Chalees", however, all I could find were some pirates of the Caribbean like junk pistols and huge lots and lots of it. And I was sure they are not gonna get wasted. \n\nSo today, in this company where I went, I took a tour. They showed me the soft steel, alloys for their own genuine design (looks like polymer, weighs like polymer, but it''s an alloy). Kher. Then I was shown bars and pipes of 4140 grade steel. And apart from just a CNC machine hall, I was also taken to a lab where they were stress testing their steel and what not. I was sold. I confess. I really was because this kinda attitude I only expected from companies like Daud Sons. The export order that they referred to me was to a European country and was basically given to this company via Pakistan Hunting and Sporting Arms Development Company. Kinda like a tender. \n\nNow let me take a risk, and check this thing out for everyone. I opted for the version the parts of which can be replaced with original Beretta.\n\nAs for testing limit of 500 bullets let me share what I believe. I have seen guns like genuine glocks, berettas, smith and wessons and many other great handguns blowing up because of a hundred reasons (especially bad rounds). Let me tell you a incident that happened a couple of years ago in Shah kas. We tested two guns. A locally made Tokarev and a Norinco made Tokarev. But the local made Tokarev was a special order. Costed 14k back in 2013. Both the guys started shooting different rounds. From all manufacturers. After like 30 minutes of restless speed firing, Norinco''s barrel cracked up. The local one was still firing. \n\nMy point is, there are A LOT of factors for a gun to blow up. Mainly the kind of ammo, the design of the bullet, the gun powder, its age, etc. I have fired a slug with a desi 60 years old single barrel that was made in Sialkot back in 1948. It didn''t blow up on me :) \n\nBut I do agree that all the local manufacturers have this story of export quality, considering others thieves, life time warranties and guarantees which I don''t give a frick about. The real thing is the process. Let''s hope my investment doesn''t go in vain as I would one day want to proudly say that I can rely on this particular local handgun of mine (which doesn''t involve underwater firing tests and mud tests and all those special ops tests because I am an ordinary person, not a commando :p). I am applying for another licence once my current ones comes. This time, I have either NP22 or a CF98 in my mind.', ''),

I am still learning, and will keep on learning.\n\nNow coming to your questions. Unfortunately, there are no tests or hidden stamps/marks on gun parts that can tell you straight away whether the gun is original or not. If there were any such marks, trust me our local manufacturers would have copied those as well :D\n\nThe only way that I know off telling original from a copy is to disassemble the gun and compare the doubtful parts to a "KNOWN/CONFIRMED" original. The overall finish can also be compared. If you know some dealer who has an original piece, you can request him to compare it to the gun you''re buying. He might even be able to give you his opinion on it as well. Also, pictures can never tell the complete story, so this comparison needs to be done live.\n\nRegards.', ''),

(656616, ' [QUOTE=Abbas;67093]Salams,\n\nThe old MOI thread had gotten too messy and was almost impossible to read with over 1400 posts. I''ve started this new thread with all the relevant information regarding MOI. Please post all future MOI queries here. Please note [B]we strictly prohibit any discussion of P.B licenses.  [/B]\n\n[SIZE=5][B]Important Update: For all those friends who have questions regarding MOI (book) to Nadra (Card) Licences. Read this for more info:[/B][/SIZE]\n\n[URL]http://www.pakguns.com/showthread.php?2288-The-MOI-Arms-Licenses-Thread-%28All-Pakistan%29&p=210349#post210349[/URL]\n[U][B]\n\n\nSTATUS:[/B][/U]\n\nAs of right now, [B]N.P.B licenses are CLOSED[/B] but some old applications are being issued. \n\n\n[U][B]REQUIREMENTS:[/B][/U]\n\nThe general and easy procedure to get a license made is go to a firearms dealer with:\n\na). Copy of your CNIC\nb). Two Passport size photographs\nc). Filled out form (Available at [URL]http://www.pakguns.com/armsform.pdf[/URL]\n\n\n[U][B]COST:[/B][/U]\n\nCost of the licenses vary from city to city with Islamabad being the cheapest. Approximate rates for major cities are:\n\n1). Islamabad = Rs. 13,000\n2). Lahore = Rs. 14,000\n3). Karachi = Rs. 15,000\n\n\n[U][B]TIME:[/B][/U]\n\nTime for getting a license varies depending on your dealer''s agent but generally it does take about 30 to 40 days. An efficient agent can get one made within two weeks, a less connected agent will take two to three months. \n\n\n[B][U]AMMO LIMIT:[/U][/B]\n\nThe standard ammunition limit on MOI N.B.P licenses is 100 rounds per year. This limit is also the maximum amount of ammo you can legally carry with your weapon. Ammunition limits can also be enhanced with an application to MOI along with reason for request example sport shooting etc. More commonly is it done though dealers who charge about Rs. 2 ruppee per bullet increase. i.e getting it increased to 500 bullets a year will cost you Rs. 1000. I strongly suggest doing so as 100 bullets a year is useless for any enthusiast or sports shooter. \n\n\n[U][B]VALIDITY:[/B][/U]\n\nMOI licenses are valid for 5 years from date of issue, after 5 years renewal is required which is a simple matter of paying fees for the next 5 years.\n\n\n[U][B]LEGAL LIMITATIONS OF A MOI LICENSE:[/B][/U]\n\nThe MOI license is all Pakistan which means you can transport and use your weapon legally in all provinces of Pakistan. This is unlike provincial licenses which are only valid within the province issued, so as soon as you leave the boundaries of that province the weapon becomes illegal. \n\nAll other rights/obligations/status of both kinds of licenses are the same. \n\n\n[B][U]144 Status and MOI[/U][/B]\n\nMOI licenses get no special treatment during imposition of Section 144. Don''t ever carry your weapon on your person during it, it will get confiscated if found. If you need to carry one, then go to your provincial home department and ask them to issue you a 144 permit. If however you are not carrying but rather transporting your weapon (to the range, to another city etc) during 144 then unload your gun and magazines and put them and your ammunition in separate locked bags in your trunk and have your license handy for any checking. There is no ban on transportation of unloaded weapons. Loaded weapons which are ready to fire and carried on the car or on person are problematic during 144.\n\n\n[U][B]I GOT MY LICENSE, NOW WHAT ?[/B][/U]\n\nWhen you get your new license you have 30 days from the date of issue to register it in the main branch of your local National Bank of Pakistan branch. For example in Lahore it is the one on Mall Road, next to GPO, in Isb it is in Aabpara.\n\nThe bank official will register your license in his computer and file, write the N.B.P registration number on your license and sign and stamp it. This is usually done on the first page of the book. A date stamp is also applied.\n\nNext you have a six months or in rare cases a three month grace period to purchase your weapon. This can be found on page 10 of your MOI book.\n\nWhen you find and decide on your weapon of choice then simply go to a firearms dealer, present your license and he will make an entry of the gun serial number on it, along with his dealer stamp and date. He will also give you an original sale receipt of the purchase. \n\nYour last step is presenting your license along with original sale receipt to the D.C.O office within 30 days. They will keep the original receipt, make an entry into their computer and return your license stamped saying your weapon has been registered with them. Ideally your license should be returned the same day and cost nothing but in pursuit of ''Chai Pani'' your perfectly valid firearms license will get stuck and take forever unless about Rs. 300 to 500 is presented to the lower staff to move things along.   \n\n\n[U][B]My license says "One N.P.B", What does it mean ?[/B][/U]\n\n\nOne N.P.B stands for One Non Prohibited Bore weapon. In a nutshell you can buy any semi automatic pistol or revolver on the market, any pump action or semi automatic 12 Gauge shotgun or a .22 rifle. In some cases like Sindh the Provincial Government there also allows Bolt action rifles in other calibers like 7mm.  \n\n\n[U][B]MOI License Verification:[/B][/U]\n\nGenerally with the N.B.P registration and the D.C.O office, you really don''t need anything else. Just MAKE SURE YOU DO THESE TWO THINGS YOURSELF. Licenses that come stamped with N.B.P and or D.C.O are suspicious and probably fake.\n\nFor the more paranoid, you can call MOI and follow their guidelines.\n\n\n[U][B]Recommend Dealers / Agents: [/B][/U]\n\nFor the time being we are [B]not [/B]recommending any dealers or agents. I would suggest checking out our dealer review section for guidance.\n\n\n[U][B]How to Transfer A Gun from One License to the Other:[/B][/U]\n\nThis is a simple procedure. Take both licenses and the firearm to a registered firearms dealer and ask him to transfer the gun from one license to the other. He will do it for you and also give the buyer a sale recipt. Dealers charge around Rs. 1000 for this service. The buyer will have to deposit his license to the D.C.O office like normal for registration of the new weapon. The seller must also keep in mind that if he''s buying another weapon on the same day then no procedure is required, if however he buys a weapon at a later date then he will have to ask his dealer to send his license to the D.C.O office for extension, that costs around Rs. 500/1000 and takes a few days. There is no grace period of even a single day.\n\n\n[B]Here is the form for Grant of new Arms License[/B] [B]:[/B][/QUOTE]\n\n\nSalam,\nI have Question i need to make a license.\n1) what is the minimum age to apply for a arm license\n2) Is there any need for NTN number or something like that ?\n3) someone told me license from HD are closed you can apply license from nadra after than you can take 144 permit from near police station SHO to carry your pistol.

Here in my country they will almost fetch the same amount for just one item, if available. So I can spread the word for Mandel chokes from UK but I can''t tell what they will charge for shipping to Pakistan.\nI needed only these two chokes because my gun is only for trap but if someone uses the shotgun for sports and even for hunting and is using and switching to some different constrictions it makes sense to order the full range of six chokes for 129.96 GBP.\n\nBest regards\nMathi', ''),

They where clean as surgery fingers when they came in but I only trust my own deeds. So I tried to use a strong neodyme magnet to collect any but the choke metal is nonmagnetic. I oiled it all with some BreakFree and then screwed in perfectly and smooth.

The Mandel chokes turned out very well and the maintainance and cleaning after session is quite easy.\nI don''t hit as much and I think this is owed to the tigher shot from lower barrel. Before this I used the Baikal choke with half const. and the chance to hit a clay with some grains at the rim is bigger than with the new and tighter choke. All experienced trap shooters I know use this combination but for a beginner is it much harder to hit when swing and body aim is not that perfect and the chance to hit a clay right in the middle and full with the shot is not given.\nSo my conclusion is that I have to practice much more to get the skills but a good shot will be very satisfied with these new chokes.\n\nBest regards\nMathi', ''),

Now take it out and see how it shoots.\n\nIf you''ve never fired a 1911 before you need to do a web search for "1911 hammer bite."  If you hold the gun so the web of your thumb overlaps the tail of the grip safety, the hammer will pinch you very hard.\n\nAlso, while the official purpose of the lever on the left is "slide release", the notch the lever fits into is very small, and can suffer wear.  Many people use the "slingshot" method; use the other hand, pull the slide back a few millimeters until the release lever disengages, then let the slide go forward.  It''s also a fairly common technique used by target shooters who aren''t blessed with absurdly long thumbs and don''t want to shift their grip with releasing the slide.\n\nAfter you shoot it, I still encourage you to take the gun completely apart for cleaning and inspection.\n\nNOTE: you have a "government model" 1911.  It was designed to shoot US Army .45 caliber "ball" ammunition.  If it successfully feeds, fires, and ejects such ammunition. the gun is functioning correctly.  If it doesn''t, there''s a problem.\n\nIf you are using anything OTHER than US Army issue ammunition or an identically-loaded copy, the gun might not be reliable.  The 1911 wasn''t designed to feed hollowpoints, wadcutters, or flat-nosed bullets; if it doesn''t feed then, the fault is with the ammunition, not the gun.  *MOST* 1911s will work okay with modern "defensive" ammunition, but if it won''t properly feed SCREAMING NINJA DEATH CLAW THROATRIPPER MEGA BLASTER ammunition from Pancho''s Pizzeria and Ammunition Emporium, don''t assume the problem is with the gun.', ''),

The problem is the lack of my practicing. You are right I''m shooting olympic where you can aim with gun before you call and not the here in Germany so called "hunting trap" which is some meters closer to the  engine but the clays are slower and they have to rise the gun to shoulder when clay is called. The (better said my) problem is to get quick aim when the clay comes out, picking her up, swing, follow and shoot in the first 30% of clays way. And I never know in which direction the clay goes, straigh, high or flat, to left or right. When I consider this the clay often is too far. The half of my hits are first, but the other half i a miss with first and a hit with second shot. A bystander who is able to see where my shoots really are (youself shooting can hardly see what happens with the shot) told me my swing is not in line with clay and the first shot often is above the clay. The second one hits because I got the swing with the flying clay correct.\nSo what I lerned: I need more practicing and as a rentiree i''ve got time enough during this season. So I''m confessed I''ll be back next season with presentable results.\n\nBest regards\nMathi', ''),

It was done for corrosion resistance since hunts or safaris might involve staying in the field for days or weeks, sometimes in the rain.\n\nNowadays we''d use stainless steel, but stainless steel wasn''t commonly available until after WWI, half a century after gunmakers adopted gold plating.  Some modern gunmakers still use plating; it''s a very traditional industry.\n\nAs well as gold plating, some gunmakers provided complete spare trigger groups, which were called "locks" back then.  For some reason I never quite understood, old-school gunmakers preferred leaf springs to coil springs, and leaf springs are notorious for breaking.  And "best grade" rifles were frequently hand-made using tools and procedures little different from Darra; if a part broke you had to ship the gun back to Birmingham or London and someone would make and fit a replacement part using chisels and files.

And I am a new come to shotguns in general,  I had my heart set on the vepr 12 but it was out of my budget so got this instead and sooner or later will get my hands on my vepr 12 aswell I.A.  It came with 2 magazines 1 5 rounder and 1 10 round magazine.  I''ve not had a chance to test it out.  In general is there any do or don''ts when it comes to shotguns to watch out for like don''t use certain shells etc?  I''ll add more pics soon and let you know when I get a chance to test it.\r\nI did currently add a flash light to it and thinking about a sight on top but not sure if I will need that as most people have told me it''s pretty point and shoot with a shot gun.

I am so surprised at some of the replies to the 308 vs 30-06 debate specially at the replies by Avais and other gentlemen participating.\nI just saw Avais''s question as to why the armies all over the world use the 308 which spawned from the 300 savage basically.\nWell the Sniper Rifle requires to qualify  following essential Parameters;\n\n1. It must be able to use the same ammo available to the field troops of the same unit (All armies use 7.62X51 or 308 Win in MGs and some like us as the standard round in rifle as well.\n2. It must have the same Wpn signature as the standard wpns of its organic unit.\n3. The Barrel life should be at least 3000 rds at peak accuracy and one MOA till 4-5000 ads\n4. Soldiers must find it easy to train on and light to carry (upto 14 pounds without scope and bipod and about 18 pounds with all accessories.\n5. The ammo should be cheap.\n6. Accuracy has to be 1/2 MOA or less.\nThe 30-06 makes the weapon heavier as short actions are used for 308s while the 0'' 6 requires a long action and is arguably not as accurate as the 308. Besides the 308 can be made to shoot at much higher velocities due to around 26 inch long barrels and long throated chambers which are made use off by seating bullets well out and loading an extra couple of grains of powder.\nBullets like the 175 gr Sierra Match King are the norm and for competitions even 185 gr Berger Juggernauts are shot at 2750-2850 ft sec from 30 inch barrels seating the bullets out to 3.1 inch COAL ( I regularly do it ) A word of caution only in long throated heavy barrels with slow powders.\nThe US army till to day uses the 308 as its primary sniper round but now moving on to the 300 Win Mag to gain a range of 1200 m, whereas the 308 is limited to 800-100 m as its bullets go trans sonic at about that range limiting accuracy. ( Trans sonic Range occurs between Mach 1.2 to Mach 0.8)  just to give you an idea if the Vel is 1125 ft/sec under given conditions then it will occur at 1340 ft/sec   i.e. 20 % of the speed of sound.\nNow this is my experience as well as Avais also mentioned; the 308 hunting rifles rich notice ably more than an 0''6 it is due to 22 inch barrels and much lighter rifles than the 24 inch and much heavier rifles made in the 0''6.\nThe US army rejected the 338 Lapua after extensive trials and the new 230 Berger Litz bullet with a high BC goes Trans sonic at 1400 m and it is now useful till then, the 338 gave the range of 1600 with twice more expansive ammo, a much heavier rifle and different cal and different signature.\nThey do do use .50 BMG based sniper rifle for specialised troops mounted in boats or ATVs as these weigh between 35-40 pounds each and extend the reach to 1800 m.\nWell some factors relevant to the ever green debate and why is the 308 still used as a sniper round.', ''),

(657032, ' Well, sharing knowledge is one of the reasons PakGuns exists.  The handful of Pakistani reloaders get their components *somewhere.*\n\nBack when smokeless powder cartridges became common most gun manufacturers designed their own cartridges, similar in performance to their competition, but not interchangeable.  The goal was to lock the gun buyer into the gun manufacturer''s own ammunition line.\n\nSince the gun manufacturers outsourced the manufactured of their proprietary ammunition, they ran into the usual problem - the ammunition makers began selling to the public directly.  And there was little the gun manufacturers could do about it, and finally most of them got out of the ammunition business and left it to the ammunition companies.\n\nThe ammunition companies controlled the brass, primers, and powder, which they assembled into ammunition and sold at a fat profit.  But some accountant figured there was a market for selling the components separately.  It took a few decades for this to become really common, but there was profit there - sales of ammunition dropped only a small amount, but the components became a profitable sideline.', ''),

(657197, ' Salam,\nKASHFROMLHR, bro few things you should know. The mentioned gun has a retail of $40 in the US. The dealer is selling it for 5x the price. The gun has a barrel that''s not rifled, so you cant fire pellets, even if you could, they wont be accurate beyond 10-12 yards. These are basically guns for small children.\nMy advice would be to put in some more money and buy a Diana 34. \n\n@FA226, hope you''re good bro. Everyone has their own opinions, but I would like to share mine :) You see, I came into this airgun game very late, having the same opinion that you have right now... now when I think about it, it makes me smile. I have had so much fun in the last few years using my airguns. Few things to know....\n\n1. Airguns, even though they don''t use powder as a propellant, are precision tools for really tiny targets for up to 50 yards.\n2. Airguns are good practice, they can be shot in your backyard, or any safe open space.\n3. Airguns teach you the basic marksman skills like breathing control, trigger control, follow through, mil-dots etc.\n4. Airguns give you good knowledge about long range shooting, like hold-over, wind drift etc. \n\nNow, I have "real" guns (as you might say), but there are numerous problems. First off, where to shoot... I can easily arrange to shoot in different places, but those arrangements have to be made... and I have to drive to get there..etc \n\nAlso, the cost of ammo limits the amount of practice you can get. Another thing is the initial cost of equipment... if you want to get into long range shooting just imagine the ridiculous amounts of money that you''ll need. Now Airgunning isn''t cheap either, but at least manageable. \n\nOne of the common misconception about airguns is that they are not accurate.... well this is usually because the person shooting cannot shoot. Airguns are really accurate, you can expect 1" groups at 30yards from a good gun, if the shooter is really really good(not me :D ) maybe even out to 50 yards.\n\nThen there are tuning, optics, ballistics and I can go on and on (maybe even for days).... and to be honest, like with any other hobby, this is just the tip of the ice-berg.\n\nNow, coming to the point.... I know that you have enough "real" guns :) , so a request.... Please get yourself an airgun. The gun will cost you around 30-32k, the scope and mounts another 7k and some good pellets for about 2 to 2.5k for a tin of 500. Start shooting and tell us what you think. :) I am sure you''ll be thanking me later.\n\nBy the way, out of all the guns that I own(air and powder), I have shot the Diana 34 the most.... around 6k rounds. I don''t think I''ll ever shoot any of my "real" guns this much, ever. \n\nLastly, a few days ago I shot one of my guns after a long time..... and even though I consider myself an average shot, my consistency has drastically improved which I attribute to the ''follow through'' practice that I have had with my air-rifles.\n\nRegards.', ''),

It does have a decent look and feel to it.  At first I thought it was very cheap plastic stuck on it and didn''t have too much confidence it its strength abilities but so far fired only 5 rounds and the good news is the plastic used is very good quality as the torch stayed put on the rail with out moving and also when I removed the torch to look for wear where the flashlight holder bolt goes through so far there was none.  But the bad news is the 3rd Round fired failed to eject properly and I had to throw it out by hand the rest fired flawlessly.  So already not sure about its abilities as it could be the break in period or its a just not good.\r\n\r\nI paid 65k for it he was asking closer to 70k originally but since I bought this with a pistol and some ammo and accessories at the time he gave me discount he said.

Initial focus is on Air rifles/pistol and Archery.

[URL="http://www.kraiglabs.com/"]Kraig Biocraft Laboratories,[/URL]  a firm from Ann Arbor, Michigan, genetically altered silkworms to  manufacture a fiber that is just like pure spider silk. Last week, the  firm [URL="http://www.kraiglabs.com/kraig-biocraft-laboratories-announces-contract-with-u-s-army-to-deliver-ballistic-shoot-packs/"]announced[/URL] a U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) contract to test this genetically engineered silk, which they are calling [B]Dragon Silk[/B]™ for potential use in body armor.\n\n There is a reason that silk from worms  is affordable but you possibly can’t purchase dresses made out of spider  silk: spiders are cannibalistic and territorial, which makes farming  them for material manufacturing ridiculously exorbitant. Enter the wonderful new marvel that’s called genetic engineering. In 2000, researchers [URL="http://science.sciencemag.org/content/287/5457/1477.abstract?ijkey=b9ac49b3eae7142824cd21cca23bf87115f806c0&keytype2=tf_ipsecsha"]first isolated[/URL] and sequenced the key proteins that create spider silk [COLOR=#ffff00](ampullate spidroin-1, spidroin-2, and so on.)[/COLOR]  That allowed scientists to reproduce spider silk proteins in E coli  bacteria, yeast and other substances in somewhat the same method as  pharmaceutical firms produce proteins for medicine. However, these  techniques didn’t yield spider silk in large enough quantities.\n\nRead more: [URL="https://gadgtecs.com/2016/07/19/u-s-military-testing-genetically-engineered-spider-silk-for-armor/"]U.S. Military Testing Genetically Engineered Spider Silk for Body Armor[/URL]', ''),

Just out of curiosity, why on earth would you want to have an almost identical handgun as "backup"? IMHO, the backup for a full sized handgun should be a compact CCW handgun if I''m not wrong. And a backup should be on person not in the back of a car or home.\nAs for the light, it''s your personal choice, however, I''d never fix one on a handgun that is my go to CCW. Its just not practical. I''d rather have a dedicated flashlight instead. But then thats just me. YMMV.\nAs for those who are worried about the finish wearing off from the picatinny rail, well, better keep the guns back in the safes.', ''),

And let not the Pakistani manufacturers produce the world''s best designs, but also, and quite cheap. This is confirmed by one of the latest developments of the local company Daudsons Armoury, which submitted a self-loading pistol under the DSA Trushot popular 9x19 mm caliber cartridge.\n\n\nThis may seem strange, but Pakistan is now one of the most liberal countries in the world in terms of weapons legislation. Moreover, in the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa residents are not forbidden to have in a private property is not only small arms, but even heavy weapons, which include rocket launchers and mortars. The reason for such unprecedented freedoms are the local culture and traditions. For example, for the Pashtuns to be the owners of the AK-47 - a sign of special respect and honor. At the same time the cult of weapons plays a very important role in almost all nationalities living in this country, it is at the Baluchis, Sindhis and Punjabis. Many weddings or large celebrations in this country can not do without shooting into the air. According to Michael Palin, the famous British geographer and writer, weapons for the inhabitants of Pakistan - it is a social necessity. Residents of Pakistan carry weapons in the same way as the citizens of London are umbrellas.\n\n\nBuy a firearm in Pakistan is not difficult. In some regions of the state, primarily in the north-western province of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, and operate plants producing real homemade weapons. Local craftsmen have learned to copy the rifle in the years of British colonial rule, and the real flowering of local arms business has experienced in the years of the Soviet military presence in neighboring Afghanistan. It was then and there formed a huge market of weapons. To this day, entire areas in the tribal areas live trade in small arms. Many local gun stores that operate both legally and illegally, under the guise of corrupt local authorities, it is possible to purchase the different weapons - saber from the time of the Mughals to the types of weapons of World War II and modern assault rifles.\nYandex\nThe drug is to increase growth!\nIn reality, the current drug of 12 cm for 6 months. The technology was created in the United States\naktigrol.ru\nIt is not a cure\n\n\nPakistani 9-mm pistol DSA Trushot\n\n\nOf course, the Pakistani market of small arms is represented not only handicrafts and contraband that comes into the country from Afghanistan. Pakistan''s military industry is well developed. One of the largest companies in the country that specializes in the production of small arms is Daudsons Armoury. The production capacity of this company is located in the city of Peshawar in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, which has traditionally been a center of arms production in Pakistan. The company was founded in 1954 and currently is one of the contractors, the Ministry of Defence of Pakistan, producing quite wide range of products. The company specializes in the production of small arms and artillery weapons. Today DSA enterprises produced 120-mm and 80-mm mortars, 40-mm automatic grenade launchers and hand, Single-barrel shotguns and pump action shotguns 12-gauge, a variety of rifles and pistols. Do here and the issue of ammunition from various mines and grenades for grenade launchers RPG-7 and bombs of various calibers. It also produced a large amount of ammunition for small arms, shells and shell casings and gunpowder.\n\n\nDaudsons Armoury Company has also developed sector for the production of civilian weapons, including non-lethal. Here collect small-caliber self-loading rifles, shotguns and Single-barrel smoothbore pump action shotguns. Notable is the fact that, unlike military products, which often is a copy of the Soviet, Chinese, American and German technology, weapon models, intended for the civilian market, are own developments of the Pakistani companies.\n\n\nThese developments include the 9-mm semi-automatic gun DSA Trushot, which is the first example of handguns, which was independently designed by the designers of the company Daudsons Armoury. The gun is aimed primarily at the local arms market, but given the fact that Islamabad is a major arms exporter, supplying it to more than 40 countries in the world, we should not exclude the option that the gun DSA Trushot will be shipped overseas in third world countries . Also, do not doubt that the new pistol was developed in Pakistan, will be the subject of keen interest among collectors of exotic weapons from around the world. Especially, taking into account the fact that the company Daudsons Armoury already introduced the pistol, made in including in traditional oriental design (pistol was lavishly decorated with engraving). this gun performance may seem very tempting for lovers of unique firearms.\n\n\nPakistani 9-mm pistol DSA Trushot\n\n\nExternally, a Pakistani gun is somewhat similar to quite popular SIG Sauer 226, but with numerous technological and design simplifications. This DSA Trushot has a good balance and makes an impression strong enough weapons. For automatic pistol Pakistani designers have chosen the traditional pistols of the caliber of the barrel with a short course of locking due to its imbalance. The total length of 9mm self-loading pistol is 189 mm and the weight of the weapon without ammunition - 900 grams.\n\n\nBarrel of the gun has a length of 105.6 mm, inside it is chrome-plated and has 6 grooves with a pitch of 254 mm. The high-quality chrome steel of 4140. This steel has a high elasticity, heat resistance and fatigue resistance, so is quite widely used in the automotive, aerospace, oil and gas and defense industries, where this steel was chosen as the material for the barrel used for the production of spindles, shafts, torsion bars and other highly loaded parts. In this case the weapons became common as steel for the production of barrels and as a material for the blades of knives. Tray chambering was carried out large, it provides reliable chambering of ammunition used with all types of bullets.\n\n\nFrame pistol is made of aircraft aluminum alloy and, like a pistol barrel was protected by trademark special scratch-resistant coating DSA ScratchlessTM. Housing and other external parts 9mm pistol have a traditional matt black oxidised finish. Swinging-gate housing is not observed, it was fitted very well with small tolerances. The slides are made of black resin and provided with corrugations in the form of points. On the gun used trigger mechanism with an external hammer double / single action. There is also a slide catch. On the housing-gate was located a two-way lever type fuse. In the closed position separates the fuse between a trigger and the trigger blocking as drummer. DIL store for this gun holds 14 rounds, and it is more visible in the latch button located at the bottom of the trigger guard. Trigger guard is not fully familiar with the notch for the second hand, the value of which, to be fair, sometimes contested.\n\n\nPakistani 9-mm pistol DSA Trushot\n\n\n9mm pistol DSA Trushot was equipped with three-point gun, c green dot sights on the unregulated and two red dots on an adjustable rear sight in the lateral direction. Under the barrel of the gun it is standard for the installation of various tactical accessories. Performance and quality finish details do not cause problems, while remaining quite good, significantly exceeding the quality of Chinese-made pistols, which are widely spread on the arms market of Pakistan. At the same time weapons manufacturer underlines the fact that the gun is made entirely in accordance with ISO standards and NATO standards. Consumer gun DSA Trushot comes in a neat case of plastic and supplied with two shops.\n\n\nPakistani 9-mm pistol DSA Trushot has surprisingly good accuracy and stability when shooting. At the same time an effort to self-cocking the shutter and move the hook in the single action mode, this gun could be better, though far superior to its closest Chinese competitors, which include gun CF-98 models and the like, according to the specialized website all4shooters.com.\n\n\nGun DSA Trushot is very reliable and has a high survivability. In particular, the manufacturer says that after the 5000 drop shots muzzle velocity of just over 2%. People shoot out of the gun, as it highlights one interesting feature: even when firing rapid series of gun barrel is heated so small that to him calmly and without fear can be touched by hand. This feature, apparently, is due to the very thick walls of the barrel.\n\n\nPakistani 9-mm pistol DSA Trushot\n\n\nOf course, by its technological and technical level Pakistani gun DSA Trushot can compete confidently with modern pistols from leading manufacturers, but in the lower price segment, in particular on the criterion of price / performance, the gun may well assert themselves in the international arena. On the Pakistani market price of the 9-mm pistol is from 27 to 30 thousand Pakistani rupees, which is about equal to 230-250 euros.\n\n\n\n\n\nComments\n\nThe comment has been deleted.\n  1\nLieutenant AvatarMladshy\n Stormtrooper June 24, 2016 07:44 &#8593;\nIt is better to decorate the engraved gun?

Today DSA enterprises produced 120-mm and 80-mm mortars, 40-mm automatic grenade launchers and hand, Single-barrel shotguns and pump action shotguns 12-gauge, a variety of rifles and pistols. Do here and the issue of ammunition from various mines and grenades for grenade launchers RPG-7 and bombs of various calibers. It also produced a large amount of ammunition for small arms, shells and shell casings and gunpowder.[/COLOR]\n\n\n[COLOR=#333333]Daudsons Armoury Company has also developed sector for the production of civilian weapons, including non-lethal. Here collect small-caliber self-loading rifles, shotguns and Single-barrel smoothbore pump action shotguns. Notable is the fact that, unlike military products, which often is a copy of the Soviet, Chinese, American and German technology, weapon models, intended for the civilian market, are own developments of the Pakistani companies.[/COLOR]\n\n\n[COLOR=#333333]These developments include the 9-mm semi-automatic gun DSA Trushot, which is the first example of handguns, which was independently designed by the designers of the company Daudsons Armoury. The gun is aimed primarily at the local arms market, but given the fact that Islamabad is a major arms exporter, supplying it to more than 40 countries in the world, we should not exclude the option that the gun DSA Trushot will be shipped overseas in third world countries . Also, do not doubt that the new pistol was developed in Pakistan, will be the subject of keen interest among collectors of exotic weapons from around the world. Especially, taking into account the fact that the company Daudsons Armoury already introduced the pistol, made in including in traditional oriental design (pistol was lavishly decorated with engraving). this gun performance may seem very tempting for lovers of unique firearms.[/COLOR]\n\n\n[COLOR=#333333]Pakistani 9-mm pistol DSA Trushot[/COLOR]\n\n\n[COLOR=#333333]Externally, a Pakistani gun is somewhat similar to quite popular SIG Sauer 226, but with numerous technological and design simplifications. This DSA Trushot has a good balance and makes an impression strong enough weapons. For automatic pistol Pakistani designers have chosen the traditional pistols of the caliber of the barrel with a short course of locking due to its imbalance. The total length of 9mm self-loading pistol is 189 mm and the weight of the weapon without ammunition - 900 grams.[/COLOR]\n\n\n[COLOR=#333333]Barrel of the gun has a length of 105.6 mm, inside it is chrome-plated and has 6 grooves with a pitch of 254 mm. The high-quality chrome steel of 4140. This steel has a high elasticity, heat resistance and fatigue resistance, so is quite widely used in the automotive, aerospace, oil and gas and defense industries, where this steel was chosen as the material for the barrel used for the production of spindles, shafts, torsion bars and other highly loaded parts. In this case the weapons became common as steel for the production of barrels and as a material for the blades of knives. Tray chambering was carried out large, it provides reliable chambering of ammunition used with all types of bullets.[/COLOR]\n\n\n[COLOR=#333333]Frame pistol is made of aircraft aluminum alloy and, like a pistol barrel was protected by trademark special scratch-resistant coating DSA ScratchlessTM. Housing and other external parts 9mm pistol have a traditional matt black oxidised finish. Swinging-gate housing is not observed, it was fitted very well with small tolerances. The slides are made of black resin and provided with corrugations in the form of points. On the gun used trigger mechanism with an external hammer double / single action. There is also a slide catch. On the housing-gate was located a two-way lever type fuse. In the closed position separates the fuse between a trigger and the trigger blocking as drummer. DIL store for this gun holds 14 rounds, and it is more visible in the latch button located at the bottom of the trigger guard. Trigger guard is not fully familiar with the notch for the second hand, the value of which, to be fair, sometimes contested.[/COLOR]\n\n\n[COLOR=#333333]Pakistani 9-mm pistol DSA Trushot[/COLOR]\n\n\n[COLOR=#333333]9mm pistol DSA Trushot was equipped with three-point gun, c green dot sights on the unregulated and two red dots on an adjustable rear sight in the lateral direction. Under the barrel of the gun it is standard for the installation of various tactical accessories. Performance and quality finish details do not cause problems, while remaining quite good, significantly exceeding the quality of Chinese-made pistols, which are widely spread on the arms market of Pakistan. At the same time weapons manufacturer underlines the fact that the gun is made entirely in accordance with ISO standards and NATO standards. Consumer gun DSA Trushot comes in a neat case of plastic and supplied with two shops.[/COLOR]\n\n\n[COLOR=#333333]Pakistani 9-mm pistol DSA Trushot has surprisingly good accuracy and stability when shooting. At the same time an effort to self-cocking the shutter and move the hook in the single action mode, this gun could be better, though far superior to its closest Chinese competitors, which include gun CF-98 models and the like, according to the specialized website all4shooters.com.[/COLOR]\n\n\n[COLOR=#333333]Gun DSA Trushot is very reliable and has a high survivability. In particular, the manufacturer says that after the 5000 drop shots muzzle velocity of just over 2%. People shoot out of the gun, as it highlights one interesting feature: even when firing rapid series of gun barrel is heated so small that to him calmly and without fear can be touched by hand. This feature, apparently, is due to the very thick walls of the barrel.[/COLOR]\n\n\n[COLOR=#333333]Pakistani 9-mm pistol DSA Trushot[/COLOR]\n\n\n[COLOR=#333333]Of course, by its technological and technical level Pakistani gun DSA Trushot can compete confidently with modern pistols from leading manufacturers, but in the lower price segment, in particular on the criterion of price / performance, the gun may well assert themselves in the international arena. On the Pakistani market price of the 9-mm pistol is from 27 to 30 thousand Pakistani rupees, which is about equal to 230-250 euros.[/COLOR]\n\n\n\n\n\n[COLOR=#333333]Comments[/COLOR]\n\n[COLOR=#333333]The comment has been deleted.[/COLOR]\n[COLOR=#333333]1[/COLOR]\n[COLOR=#333333]Lieutenant AvatarMladshy[/COLOR]\n[COLOR=#333333]Stormtrooper June 24, 2016 07:44 &#8593;[/COLOR]\n[COLOR=#333333]It is better to decorate the engraved gun?

For those who don''t know, it looks pretty much identical to a CZ-75.  The finish is satin chrome and the frame is aluminum.  I don''t know what the weight difference is between the aluminum and steel frames, but I can tell you that it''s definitely noticable.  The L-120 came with two factory magazines.  The magazines hold 15rds each, but it''s a fight after you get to about the 10rd.  I had to use a CZ magazine loader or I simply wouldn''t have been able to do it.  I noticed that the catch holes on the magazines look identical in size to those on my EAA Witness magazines, so I brought along a couple of those to see if they would work.  The Witness magazines would hold 16rds each.\n\nI brought 50rds of Geco 124gr FMJ, 50rds of Remington 115gr nickel cased FMJ, and 50rds of CCI Blazer Brass 124gr FMJ.  All of the fired ammo fired and cycled perfectly.  The accuracy of this pistol is outstanding.  It would put the shots where I aimed them so long as I did my part.  It doesn''t seem that the pistol gave up accuracy do to its lighter weight.  The only complaint that I can muster up is that the trigger return seems a little weak.  Spent cases were expelled with enough velocity to easily clear the pistol, but they were not tossed in to orbit either.  This tells me that they have the proper weight recoil spring installed.  I did notice a couple of oddities.  Sparks would fly out the muzzle when I shot the Geco ammunition.  The guys in the lane next to me even noticed it.  I''ve shot this ammo in many other pistols, so I don''t know what to make of the sparks.  It didn''t seem to cause a problem though.  The other odd thing is that the Blazer Brass cases ended up with soot on about 1/4 of their sides.  Again, I''ve never noticed this before with this ammo, but it didn''t seem to cause a problem anyway.  They''ll clean right up when I reload.  Finally, the Mec-Gar EAA Witness magazines functioned perfectly.  They look generally the same as the factory Mec-Gar magazines, but are slightly different in details.  It kind of makes me wonder why they didn''t just use the same stampings, but it really doesn''t matter so long as they work.\n\nBottom line: This pistol is great and I wouldn''t hesitate to recommend it.  Quality appears every bit as good as the CZ and EAA Witness pistols.', ''),

[As it  turns out, the originals were also made in China]. We tested the  original and various copies, and found absolutely no difference in the  quality. After a while, the copies stopped carrying the [I]Ian Sinclair[/I] logo to avoid copyright infringement, but the design remained the same.\n\n[IMG]https://latestgadgets.tech/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/credit-card-knife-2.jpg[/IMG]\n\nRecently, we came across another ingenious design of knives that were  disguised like key.

Although a  bit thicker and bigger than an average key, the design and performance  isn’t very bad. We were easily able to cut vegetables like a tomato and a  carrot, though cutting meat and steak was possible, but not exactly  very easy.

The handful of Pakistani reloaders get their components *somewhere.*\n\nBack when smokeless powder cartridges became common most gun manufacturers designed their own cartridges, similar in performance to their competition, but not interchangeable.  The goal was to lock the gun buyer into the gun manufacturer''s own ammunition line.\n\nSince the gun manufacturers outsourced the manufactured of their proprietary ammunition, they ran into the usual problem - the ammunition makers began selling to the public directly.  And there was little the gun manufacturers could do about it, and finally most of them got out of the ammunition business and left it to the ammunition companies.\n\nThe ammunition companies controlled the brass, primers, and powder, which they assembled into ammunition and sold at a fat profit.  But some accountant figured there was a market for selling the components separately.  It took a few decades for this to become really common, but there was profit there - sales of ammunition dropped only a small amount, but the components became a profitable sideline.[/QUOTE]\n\nHere in Pakistan, components are an almost non existent rarity.

(658699, 'Lucky Star arms market survey # XIII (I think) Its being ages since I did one of those market surveys with a fresh license. I still have an empty rifle license and what the Sindh Home Dep euphemistically refers to as ‘big bore’ permit. (Read permission to buy .222/.223) on it. It’s being 3 years I have been lugging that license/ permit combo. With CQa prices touching 250k + there is no point in even thinking bout an imported weapon. In spite of my extreme reluctance, I realized local is the only way to go.  Or I can sit and twiddle my thumbs till there is yet another ‘notification’ and ET viola the permission is scrapped.  Since it took me almost 3 weeks of relentlessly hounding the Section officer of arms section of the Home department before I got the darned permission, I really don’t want to let it go. With my mind made up, I went to the market accompanied by my fellow stalwarts Skywatcher and Deathrow. \r\nHM Traders\r\nFirst port of call was HM Traders (Abbas) who morosely proceeded to inform us that Tauruses prices are well above 100k and we won’t find anything under 110k. There we also ran into fellow member Fahad Dawra looking for an NP 34 which was ‘short’ in the market.  (It being a market rule that whatever you want will automatically be ‘short’ irrespective of how plentiful it was 2 weeks back) Abbas told us to check out the khi chapter of “moonstar arms’\r\nMoonstar arms co. \r\nThe good uncle at moonstar tried to convince me that my permit was not valid since I acquired my license ‘after’ I go the permit.( Exactly how I managed to do that was beyond my limited abilities of comprehension.. specially since my permit already had my license number on it.) Than he after a lot of reluctance showed me a .223 local made that looked liked it would fall apart if I looked at it funny, H e also proceeded to tell me how his weapons took off the hand of someone who used it. And that it might just do the same for me as well. In which case he will replace the barrel and the other spare parts (of the gun that is, not me) since I consider my spare parts to be pretty.. Well irreplaceable I decided not to take his offer.  \r\nThe gun’s leaf sights s did not have the customary dip though which u could aim. Moreover, the receiver was kinda thin looking and full of rivets. Asking price for the whole shindig was 45k irrespective of flavour (i.e .222 or .223) \r\nFamous arms\r\nThen on to Famous arms. Mr. Khaki had a couple of used Taruses in .45 acp. A 24/7 and a millennium around 65 to 70% condition both.  Asking price for both 80k. Yes u read it right. A .45 24/7 in 65% for 80k!!! If not for the fact that grown men don’t cry (and also cause I did not have a hanky) I left all my tears unshed.  Ammo cost for .45 nornico and armscor FMJs 125 a pop discounted to 100 a pop. (Guess it was our combined cry baby looks) \r\nHowever, the local .223 and .222 he had were a whole lot better than the moonstar contraptions. The receivers looked heavier and better made.  And he also advised me to get hold of a ‘full block’ receiver weapon. I.e without any joints and rivets, milled from a single block of metal.  I like that idea.  His asking price was 50k irrespective of .223 or .222. I am seriously thinking of getting one. As regards accuracy.\r\n  He also had a B6 almost NIB piece he was willing to let go for 45k.  But Skywatcher was more interested and would be able to guide you people better. \\\r\nSaddlars\r\nHussain at Saddlers sold us perma blue (Birchwood Casey) for 2k. That stuff is pretty cool. Deathrow blued my trust but rusty NP 42 till it looked as good as brand new.  \r\nGuns and accessories\r\nPreviously I and Deathrow had also gone to Guns and accessories at Zamzama.  There had bought Stony Point ear muffs. Did not like them and returned them and got Berretta ones. They were nice enough to take em back even though the blister pack had been opened and they were used.\r\nG an A has everything in 5.56 from Vepers to locals.  However their locals were 65k NIB. Which seemed a trifle expensive to me?  \r\nTailpiece:\r\n144 permits are open once again.

Moreover, it had to endure1,350 field stripping and 150 detail stripping. Further, to demonstrate the interchange ability of parts, any number of P-01 pistols could be randomly selected, disassembled, their parts mixed and the guns reassembled with no failures permitted. Safety was evinced by the guns being dropped from a variety of angles onto concrete from a height of 1.5 meters (54 times) and 3 meters(five times) with no failures (a failure being a discharge). The guns were then required to fire without being serviced.\nThe necessary durability was proven by having the pistols fire after being frozen for 24 hours at 32 degrees F, and again after being heated for 24 hours at 126 degrees F.

Day after day of sitting in his office looking him straight in the eye till he relented and made me my permit. (Courtesy a phone call from a fellow member that did not allow him to basically throw me out of the office)  The permit coupled with a computerized rifle license from the home dep. was a dream come true. \r\n\r\n\r\nBut alas as with all dreams one wakes up. And i did the same when I found out the price of my beloved CQA. Waited all these years for it t become affordable. Annnddd it went from 130k to 260k within months this year. :( \r\n\r\nI realized that there is every likelihood that the new S.O would simply refuse to entertain my 3 year old purchase permission letter. or may even cancel it altogether. \r\n\r\n\r\nI applied for and got the permission period (Thankfully) for one month to make my purchase. \r\n\r\n\r\nNow my budget is around 45k or so for either a .222 or a .223 rifle. In that budget I can only manage a “localistan” (As Skywatcher) calls em. \r\n\r\nI saw a few in my last survey, some of em seemed pretty well made while others looked flimsy.  I was advised to get one made with a ‘single block 1 piece’ receiver rather than one with rivets.  \r\n\r\nAs regards calibre, I have been advised to go for .222 since our local craftsmen have been doing AK 74 clones since like forever. But the price of a single round is around 150 a pop. On the other hand the .223 ammo is around 60 a pop or so. But our people don’t have that much experience of making those in their AK 47 platform rifles. \r\nI like to shoot so i would prefer the .223, but on the other hand in terms of craftsman experience the .222 fits the bill.  \r\nI would like a few recommendations before we hit the market to make a purchase this weekend.  I am sure there are quite a few of savvy enthusiasts who have used both.\r\n\r\n\r\nHelp!', ''),

As events unfold, Salahuddin meets Jeena a cunning woman played by Ayesha Khan who manipulates Salahuddin into an engagement.\n\n\nAs both Mannu and Salahuddin’s lives become intertwined, their sorrows and love for each other do not diminish over the years.\n\n\nUdaari\n\n\nPerhaps one of the more controversial dramas produced in Pakistan, this gripping drama written by Farhat Ishtiaq touches on some taboos in Pakistani society.\n\n\nStarring big names such as Ahsan Khan, Urwa Hocane and Bushra Ansari, these talented actors deliver outstanding performances.\n\n\nMor Mahal\nThis extravagant and grand portrayal of a Mughal lifestyle, stars Umair Jaswal as the alpha male and head of his harem and husband of three wives.\n\n\nCompetition for his affection and time which arise between his first wife Meesha Shafi and his pregnant second wife Fiza only escalate when a new bride enters the scene.\n\n\nTo complicate things further, this new bride attempts to run away and places her Bandi (maid given with marriage) in her place who the Prince falls in love with.\n\n\nThis extraordinary tale, along with breathtaking outfits and majestic settings are well worth a watch.\n\n\nDil Lagi\n\n\nMehwish Hayat and Hamayun Saeed star in this romantic drama set in the simple backdrop of ordinary people in Sindh.\n\n\nAnmol played by Mehwish leads a simple and ordinary life, until her father’s death. Despite him paying off a debt to local money lender Kifayat Ali, with Anmol’s mother without any proof of repayment, the family is in turmoil.\n\n\nWhen Kiyafat employs Mohid played by Hamayun to evict the family, the drama then centralises upon the conflict between Mohid and Anmol.\n\n\nBheegi Palkein\n\n\nDirected by Furqan Khan, the cast of Faisal Qureshi, Ushna Shah, Affan Waheed, Faryal Mehmood, Shamin Illahi and Ismat Zaidi, star in a dramatic romantic drama.\n\n\nWhen the poor young girl Meherbano played by Ushna, meets Umer played by Affan, the audience is taken into a dramatic romantic story.\n\n\nTelling the story of poor and rich, love and family politics, this familiar yet often popular style drama has gained many fans in Pakistan.\n\n\nTum Kon Piya\n\n\nThis drama marks the return of actress Ayeza Khan to the small screen opposite the popular and charismatic Imran Abbas Naqvi.\n\n\nThis story of star crossed lovers already had audiences anticipating the drama even before its release. The story is an adaptation of Maha Malik’s novel, and so expectations for this drama were high.\n\n\nWhen the rich boy falls in love with the poor girl, once again social class and societal pressures are highlighted in this drama.\n\n\nMein Sitara\n\n\nThis retro drama, takes the audience back to the golden era of Pakistani entertainment.\n\n\nSet against the backdrop of Lollywood in the ’60s, the story follows a poor young girl who dreams relentlessly to become a star.\n\n\nWith Saba Qamar playing the lead role of Sitara, the audience gets to see heartthrob Mikaal Zulfiqar as Farhad.\n\n\nWith the likes of Meera and Noman Ejaz starring in this retro drama, the star cast an intriguing drama is surely one to watch.', ''),

It is a good quality and reliable handgun. The bore axis is slightly high and would require practice for the shooter to achieve good results. The Polymer frame means lighter weight. There’s option to go for 17 round magazine thus having good capacity. The finish of internal as well as external parts is very good and I haven’t been able to find any burrs. The barrel life is 25,000. With a 3 dot sight system its easy to aim and shoot. It is based on the CZ 75 design so this explains its reliability. The Sarsilmaz B6 from POF Wah offers very good value for money. I will update the post after visiting range and shooting with this handgun.[/FONT][/COLOR]\n  \n\n[/COLOR][/FONT][/CENTER][/CENTER]', ''),

The breech and barrel assembly incorporates a quick change system that allows for any of the four calibers (.177, .22, .25 or .30) to be used. All that is required is an extra barrel and pellet probe for each caliber. The air metering system is custom tunable, with an outside adjustable air regulator, power wheel hammer spring adjustment and valve return spring tuning. This rifle has no limits in its flexibility to be used by the hunter or target shooter. The FX Impact comes standard with features that airgunners have come to expect; like an adjustable recoil pad, cheek rest, foster quick fill connector, Picatinny rails, air regulator, and a new ultra quiet shroud system. Setting this new rifle apart from its competitors is the AR15 grip design that allows for a wide range of readily available accessories. Other notable features include the match winning Smooth Twist barrel, a 480cc weight saving carbon fiber air bottle, AR-15 style safety, large capacity magazine, pressure gauge, and a cocking lever that has been ergonomically placed so the shooter can actuate and fire without loosing the sight picture or cheek weld. This tactical, compact, high power, lightweight wonder gun will be a benchmark for years to come. With all these features wrapped into one rifle, the FX Impact is sure to make just that…a huge Impact in the airgun', ''),

I am hoping someone will be able to help me figure out the best possible shotgun that can be bought within my restricted budget but also fulfills my needs that revolve around shooting regular Skeet, Trap, and Sporting Clays. In addition, I expect it to also serve me well on occasional hunting trips. \n\nBasically, I intend to buy an all-purpose shotgun that won''t break the bank. I am leaning towards a SPORTING shotgun such as the Baikal MP-27E&#1052;-1C. I wouldn''t mind buying a Side-by-Side, Single Barrel Semi-Auto, or any other type but I feel a decent Over-Under Double Barrel shotgun would prove to be a safe bet that would cover all disciplines mentioned above including occasional yearly hunts. \n\nI would be grateful if someone could share their opinion regarding my query, and provide best possible options that fall in the following price ranges. \n\n1. Best Shotguns under < Rs 50,000 (Ideal Budget Range)\n2. Best Shotguns between Rs 50,000 and Rs 100,000 (Extended Budget Range If Nothing Available in <Rs 50,000\n3.

I am willing to extend my range to about Rs 100,000, if a worthwhile handgun can be bought in this price bracket. \n\nI am however unwilling to pay several times the cost of the actual worth of the weapon in the international market, like sadly some people in Pakistan pay ridiculous amounts in the case of $500 Glocks.

Or should I search for the above mentioned handguns from the PakGuns price list in the market first and see if I can find a decent weapon with a reasonably digestible markup considering the prevalent ban on imports of weapons in Pakistan.\n\nThe only negative I see with the SAR B6 is that it will be hard to Carry Conceal due to its size.', ''),

Or should I search for the above mentioned handguns from the PakGuns price list in the market first and see if I can find a decent weapon with a reasonably digestible markup considering the prevalent ban on imports of weapons in Pakistan.\n\nThe only negative I see with the SAR B6 is that it will be hard to Carry Conceal due to its size.[/QUOTE]\n[SIZE=4]\n[/SIZE][SIZE=4][FONT=Calibri][COLOR=#000000]Bro we cannot compare prices with international market inPakistan they have different way and issue to import weapons in the countrythey have to put wheel on their import files to get the weapons, the prices onPG forum is quite old I think last updated in 2013 , prices in Pakistan changedrapidly according to market flow, even some times due to shop keeper mood , [/COLOR][/FONT][/SIZE]\n[SIZE=4][/SIZE][SIZE=4][FONT=Calibri][COLOR=#000000]The bottom line I will advise you whenever you have to buythe weapon by the best one which your pocket allow don’t be in hurry , I regretonce brought weapon in flying position  [/COLOR][/FONT][/SIZE]', ''),

I will look for Muffadil at Buksh Elahi, and Fiaz at Hira Arms as suggested by you. Will also see what Orient, Hira and Para have in stock. \n\nPersonally, I am almost settled on buying an Over-Under for myself this time around. So far Baikal MP-27E&#1052;-1C SPORTING seems to be the best bet. I might settle for Baikal MP-153 if I can''t find my initial choice in the market. MP-155 is last option in my mind, if neither MP-27EM nor MP-153 end up being available. I think the Turkish shotguns in the lower price bracket are inferior quality as compared to the Baikals. \n\nIdeally speaking, if I can find Baikal MP446 Viking and Baikal MP-27E&#1052;-1C SPORTING anywhere in the Lahore, I will be more than happy with this Handgun and Shotgun combination for at least a few years. But considering both are imported weapons and with recent ban I would have to be extremely lucky to find both of my choices in the market. And that too at rates that are not complete ripoff. \n\nThanks once again for your advice. I will do a market survey close to Eid, and hopefully will purchase something that will serve me well within this month. \n\nI will share my market research with all of you here once I am done.', ''),

But this shouldn''t be the case. The rates for which some are sold in our market are simply promoting black market culture like it was once with the infamous cinema tickets. Nowhere in the world anyone can profit 200%/300%/400% or even higher at times for a mass-produced arm. \n\nOnly collectible ones that are not in production anymore go into auctions and can fetch several times their initial value due to their rarity and antique value. People who pay 5 or 6 times the value of a Glock in Pakistan are simply helping this black market attitude flourish. The government''s approach isn''t helping either but still there shouldn''t be any excuse to charge such extortionate prices for a weapon that is considered a solid reliable budget weapon the world over.', ''),

Add to that the fact that I at least find racking the slide a whole lot easier due to its front sarrations which r lacking in the B6. \n I have fired the Salsilmarz Klinic 2000 a lot (courtesy fellow member deathrow) Basicaly the same weapon as the B6 but with full steel forged frame, And have found it a bit too big for my hands and for cc. \nMoreover, the Klinic has glow sights which the B 6 does not.

(659358, ' [QUOTE=Kalimi;496950]I do not want to hijack this thread but I have exactly these 3 guns in mind as my first weapon so I am taking advantage of the on going thread instead of creating new. Yesterday I handled NP-42 and Np-22 at a gun store and I felt Np-22 to be bulky and heavy while Np-42 fit well in my hand and light weight. I did not find B-6 at the shop instead Sarsilmaz CM-9 was available which I liked but it was priced about 80K and I don''t want to spent this much on my first gun. Shop owners and my friends who are in to guns are recommending me not to go for POF guns which also includes POF-Sarsilmaz B-6. Reading senior members reviews in favor of Np-22 is putting me in a dilemma. I have nearly ordered Np-42 but I can change my order with in Eid holidays. What do you guys suggest should I go for Np-22 and cancel my order of Np-42 or otherwise? All metal thing of Np-22 is giving me a sense of this gun being more robust and can absorb my novice mistakes. Thanks in advance.[/QUOTE]\n\nBro Kalimi the models which you have mentioned above I have no experience on it I have spend most of my time with supports pistol which are not good for SD and HD , but I can give you few tips which will help you in choosing pistol In my opinion grip is very important it should fit in your hand when you hold trigger from the middle of your 1st tip of your finger the rest of the finger should not touch the pistol body and the upper side of your hand palm should be tightly touching the frame and the bottom part of your palm should be not out of grip then bring the gun quickly to your eyes level and check the sighting alignment if it is quickly done by slightly moving shoulder or wrist then ok if you have to adjust by moving your hand to up and down then leave it', ''),

The ones you are talking about is Lahore Garrison Shooting Gallery, which is still under construction and on my last visit it gave me the impression that it will take another 6 months to become fully active. The construction of the main building is still in its initial stages. Doubt it will be operational before another 6 months even if the pace of the construction is beefed up for early completion. \n\nSecondly, they are charging Rs 750,000 as membership fees from civilians. Highly doubt they will be able to sell many at that rate. They were asking Rs 10,00,000 at the beginning but reduced it in the first week or so. I don''t think it''s worth it at that price. \n\nThe other range at the Mehfoozpura Garrison is still there for sure. They are charging Rs 25,000 as membership fees and I believe Rs 1000 a month to use it. But I am still collecting information on how to proceed with its membership since it''s Military Run facility. \n\nRegarding the range at Shami Road going by the name of Lahore Rifle Club, I have been told by the relevant authorities that it has been closed indefinitely. The authorities are creating the currently under-construction Lahore Garrison Shooting Gallery so that such sensitive activities are kept outside of the centre of the city. Whatever information I have regarding Lahore Rifle Club seems to indicate that it has been closed for good. At least for civilian use. Serving military personal might still be allowed to use it. Maybe I end up being wrong in the end. \n\nI hope someone can help me figure out the correct way to obtain membership to use the range at Mehfoozpura Garrison. Since, there are no other operational ranges in Lahore at the moment besides the one at Mehfoozpura Garrison that accommodate civilians as well. There must be countless others strictly for military personnel, I assume.', ''),

Firstly these days CZ999 is not available in the market. I would suggest that you go for NP42 / CF 98 as it is lighter than the NP 22/34 and has a manual decocker plus safety feature. The CF98 / NP 42 contains all the safety features which are available in the modern handguns. If you want we can further discuss it in detail but in a nut shell i would recommend you to go for CF98 / NP 42. I own one for the last 5 years and i think i would not let it go ever, because it is a very reliable handgun in the lowest possible price range. these days it should be around 42K in peshawar and lahore, pindi price would be around 2 k more.

Personnel over there will call the concerned office and inform you accordingly.\n\n              Secondly, I totally agree with you about the membership rates of the new range. It should not be more\n              than 100,000 for civilian members and should have an option for immediate family members to enjoy the\n              facility. There are many ways to run the club on commercial basis, but few consultants in the team have their vested interests and don''t want to consider any suggestions at this point of time.\n\n              If you ask me whether, I would pay them 750,000 PKR for acquiring the membership only, I would rather prefer to:\n\n              1.

So, the same military authority is handling Lahore Rifle Club, Mehfoozpura Garrison and the currently under-construction Lahore Garrison Shooting Gallery. \n\nLahore Garrison Shooting Gallery is being built as a SUBSTITUTE of both Lahore Rifle Club and Mehfoozpura Garrison specifically for CIVILIANS and retired Military Personnel. As far serving military officers there are plenty of places up and down the country. Lahore Garrison Shooting Gallery will be run as a money making commercial entity. \n\nBut I agree with you on the rest. No one will pay that much amount for military run shooting. Gun Club in Islamabad is a posh private place hence they find it easy to attract the elite crowd of Islamabad and other cities who wont mind paying that much for the environment. \n\nOn the other hand, military run places are seldom setup to attract the wealthy. Their environment is more for the general masses. And no one from the masses will pay Rs 750,000 for a club membership. I will be surprised if they will be able to attract the elite crowd at the Lahore Garrison Shooting Gallery as the Gun Club in Islamabad does. \n\nLets wait and see what happens. I think, they will change their membership structure once they fail to attract the elite crowd. And change membership direction towards attracting the masses instead by allowing membership at affordable rates. As you said, anything under Rs 100,000 will bring in a decent amount of Mango people to shoot at the new range.', ''),

Don''t worry this is not the first time I will be visiting the market. And kindly don''t just turn into holy cows. They are just Asla Dealers, it''s nothing worth showing off or being arrogant about. But I do know that some small dealers are rather impatient with buyers who are just starting out as they don''t want to waste their time guiding them in the right direction. Which in fact is the wrong way of dealing new starters. They should be guiding them in the right direction because tomorrow they will likely become their customers. \n\nI personally feel that one should do a little research before buying the weapon especially when no further changes are being entertained once you convert your booklet license to computerized Nadra card. So, buying in a hurry would be stupidity because you would be stuck with a wrong weapon with no option to change weapon till government allows that. And with no possibility of new licenses from Punjab, there wont be an option to buy another one to put on a new license. So, at the moment, one should be a little careful about purchasing new weapons. \n\nAnd don''t worry about gun dealer attitudes. They are the way they are. You can''t do much about it. I would suggest you to stick with bigger and more renowned arms dealers and avoid small shops if you want to experience better and friendly attitudes. Small shops are frustrated because they can''t make ends meet and find it difficult to survive when the bigger players are around getting all the sales. So, when they see a newbie walk into the shop they see him as another time waster who has no money to spend. That behavior is because of that frustration. With no new licenses and ban on imports of new weapons, it''s extremely difficult for small arms dealers to financially survive. This is the only reason they behave in such a way to unknown faces. \n\nGo to the big ones like PARA and Buksh Elahi, and they will always treat you in a welcoming manner. Because they are khatey peetey dealers with big sales. It doesnt give them any headache if you are just window shopping. They have enough sales to be profitable. Small dealers survive on small sale numbers and need genuine customers to come in and not window shoppers. Too many window shoppers and small traders will go hungry and will have to close their shops altogether. Hence, their attitude towards newbies.', ''),

(659517, ' Gentlemen, some misconceptions I would like to clear:\n\n1- Hammered pistols that come with manual safeties and de-cockers are now considered old school in the west. Striker fired polymer frame pistols with trigger safeties comply with the modern pistol philosophies... why? it''s a long debate.... However, again thats a matter of preference. There are still many, like me myself who prefer the single action / double action pistols or those, who prefer the single action alone pistols such as the 1911, which is over a 100 year old pistol design.\n\n2- Having a manual safety and / or decocker is all matter of preference. It does not make one pistol superior to other, just different. All self defense carry Gurus strictly recommend to use a pistol WITHOUT a manual safety, which basically means a stricker fired pistol or a pistol with decocker alone. Again there is an exception of a rare population that believes in carrying with hammer down and safety engaged or some who are daring enough to carry cocked and locked. Manufacturers make pistols with different safety features so as to meet the varying preferences of people\n\n3- Pistols such as Kilinc and B6 can easily be decocked manually with a little bit of practice. I do it every single day and I am a man with family and kids around. Its not unsafe, just requires practice. If one is not confident about his firearm then he should not keep one in the first place\n\n4- Rail or no rail, go and try finding a laser that would stay on the pistol and hold the zero after taking couple of shots. Secondly, where exactly does one plan on using that laser except for looking and pretending to be tacti-cool? I have a brand new laser lying around with me for past 5 years or so almost.\n\n5- No professional shooter in the world uses the loaded chamber indicator to check if his weapon is chambered or not.Why? simply because we as humans always trust on human inspections or insticts over the features of weapon. As a shooter or conceal carrying, if you don''t know what condition your weapon is on, you shouldn''t be carrying in the first place. Secondly if you want to clear a weapon for what ever reason, you will never just look at that loaded chamber indicator and consider the weapon to be clear. You will always always always take the magazine out and rack the slide to make visual inspection to ensure the weapon is clear. \n\n6- I can''t commend on b6 since I have only held is couple of times and never shot it, But I personally own a Kilinc and have shot it quite enough. I have also used the Np42 many many many times, and Cf98 and other variants of chinese pistols. Here''s my honest take on comparison without any favoritism: The NP42 is an excellent pistol and extremely reliable and accurate. The trigger of the pistol is manageable but does vary from pistol to pistol. The manual safety is rather stiff and if you carry the np42, a very serious advice will be to NOT carry it with the safety engaged because it is almost impossible to disengage it in critical times. Those who do  own NPs, do a little test next time you go to the range. Try to draw your weapon from concealed position, rasing your garment with the left hand, drawing the pistol with the right hand, disengaging the safety and then take position to shoot from a double action mode. NP42 can also turn out to be an ergonomic nightmare if you have big hands like mine. The NP42 is very easy to rack compared to alot of pistols since the serrations on this pistols are both at the rear and front, and also aggressive. Overall, this pistol is excellent value for money.  The kilinc on other hand (which is the forged steel version of b6) is much more accurate than NP42 for a number of reasons. It has a longer barrel, the trigger is much better, excellent ergonomics since its the same design at CZ75 and the weight of the pistol provides excellent balance, the sights on the kilinc are much better than np42. At 25 meters, all these factors result in a much better group with the kilinc. The magazines of kilinc are much better and same as Np42. Filling up the magazines is extremely easy. The kilinc is a little bigger than np42 but the side profile is slimmer. Despite being a 1kg weapon, I carry the kilinc very easily. Something about this pistol, the balance of the pistol I suppose...Somehow you just dont feel the weight of the pistol. The manual safety on kilinc is pretty smooth and can easily be engaged or disengaged using a right hand thumb\n\nlastly, I would not recommend the TT or Tokerov to any new shooter or someone without sufficient firearms handling experience. That pistol has no safety features at all. There is no firing pin safety due to which sometimes the pistol shoots while the slide is being racked. Many many accidents have happened on this platform.  I am not saying that one should not buy a tokarov, I myself wish to get one someday, but NOT as an every day carry weapon or for someone who has insufficient knowledge and understanding about the shortfalls of the platform.', ''),

I know people who have successfully made their Nadra card out of a back-dated manual license. So, what you are saying is nothing but fraud. A fake arms license book is a different case altogether.

The fake copy ones will indeed be fake and have no documentation and record at DCO office, therefore, will be rejected at re-validation. \n\nAnd I don''t know which arms dealer in the market is still getting back-dated licenses made because as I said before the register on which back-dated entries were made have been scanned by the higher authority. So, the scanned copy now confirms the last entry made on a specific date. So, now no more entries of new back-dated licenses can be made since they will be clearly proven fake after scanning of the page. \n\nDealers were getting these licenses made till the mid of last month.

Pakistan is too corrupt a country to have corruption completely finish in any department or walk of life even after computerization. If REAL Nadra identity cards can be issued to foreigners who are NOT Pakistani illegally then sale/purchase of arms/ammunition is no big deal either. \n\nRandom surprise checks are made by HUMANS.

Some do corruption of 5 rupees, some of 100, some of 1000s and some of millions or billions. But it''s all the same. CORRUPTION. No one can live in Pakistan without paying bribes every now and then. \n\nBut yes, the process will be much tighter now.

If you have not had experience with firearms before, my advice would be keep the bullets away from the weapon...like completely.... keep all your mags empty.... if that rule is established, next you are start playing around with your weapon and get used to it and the way it functions...\n\ntry to disassemble your gun, regardless of whatever the gunshop guy did to the gun... take help of yotube and search how to fieldstrip np42.... the disassembly and assembly might seem really tough in the beginning but do it again and again... Don''t hesitate... understand the chambering procedure, decocking and engaging on / off the manual safety procedures...\n\nanyhow, once you have opened your pistol, wash your barrel carefully to free it of any packing grease or gun powder or whatever.. for this you will need a bore-brush for 9mm and NASA will do just fine...after wash the entire gun with NASA and clean it with a toothbrush... But make sure you dont spray in NASA in the firing pin area. google to figure out its location...\n\nOnce done washing with NASA, wipe the entire gun dry with a clean cloth....clean it completely... next get some white machine oil (which is transparent in reality but called white).... apply very gentle layers on barrel, the rail and the mechanism of gun.... very very gentle quantity... do not over-oil your weapon as it can result in gunk built-up and cause jams.... Most of the weapons have jaming problems not because they are over dry but because they are over lubricated... you just want to provide some support to all the moving parts of your pistol.. thats about it..\n\nFor now, stick to this routine....', ''),

Even bought a name plate or "takhti'' for it. The years turned to decades till eventually, the takhti ended up bearing the epitaph on his grave. But he was never able to buy his dream home. \n \nSince I had no wish to emulate that dude. I decided to do the next best thing. \n\nWith imported weapons going though  the roof and no sign of em coming down. And a permit that might be declared useless anytime by any new S.o .. if i had to keep my dream alive I had to act accordingly. I.e buy within my own budget. Of course, said budget is good only for protecting my ( as you put it oh soooo euphemistically) Nokia  1280 and my "expired" ID" card.  \nThen that is what I would go for , rather then staring at a permit and license combo till i end up like the man in "Takhti" \n\nYes.. My humble "Nokia 1280" may not be worth much, nor my rifle for that matter.. But they are all i have and would try t make do with em to the best of my abilities, rather then making castles in the air. Or making another ( by now) ubiquitious ''tahkti" \nI understand of course that my twice repaired "Nokia 1280" can in no guise compare to the Apple 7 of course. But dont worry i wont grudge the saat number soneri saib walas their happiness.. :)', ''),

Not everybody is matured enough or honest enough , to speak truth about himself with regard to to the things what he actually can afford . Some of the people , if speak truth about themselves , they deliberately add a grain of salt  in it or create an ambiguity in shape of joke in that statement just to hit two birds with one stone ie to tell the truth at the same time ( for those who know them ) and  hiding it ( for those who know then through their posts and screen name ). Please note I am not pointing at any one particularly\nI have found ED to be one of the rare commodities who speak truth about themselves. From the beginning  I saw him looking around  ( and posting) about local made weapons for himself and he never tried to hide it . It’s not a taboo for him . He does not present that fact with a grain of salt to us , rather takes us to the world of clones made by Darra craftsmen and he never hides the fact that he can’t afford a branded gun . There are really a few people honest and mature enough as I have find him through his posts and face to face . And he is mature enough to bear and reply, cheerfully, any joke thrown to him. But if such a mature and large hearted person is hurt , it means there is really something that  hurts  him.', ''),

That''s why the piston seal usually gets nicked when they are being assembled. The seal can also be damaged while pulling it out of the gun, especially in your case where the metal is badly gouged. So once the spring has been safely removed, make sure you file the rough edges out....you can use sand paper too, but the gouges definitely need to be filed smooth. Then carefully take the piston out. \r\n\r\nThe problem doesn''t look too bad, the cocking arm needs to be polished and then the steel sheet that you see inside the piston, hammered(worst case) or may even simply be rotated so that smooth surface may be exposed(best case).\r\nAlso, if you do open the gun, you can slightly lube it(with the correct lube). It''ll change the whole feeling of cocking and also improve the shot cycle.\r\n\r\nYou''re a little far away from me, or I would have done all of this for you myself as I love tinkering. :)\r\n\r\nIf you need any further guidance or don''t understand anything, lemme know.

[/QUOTE]\n\nThanks for your kind response dear Deathrow!\n\nThe gun got damaged purely because of my careless mistake. I had removed the gun from its wooden stock and was applying gun oil on the outer body of the cylinder. Thats when I tried to slightly cock the gun just so that the gun oil i applied on the bolt that holds the barrel assembly could seep in.\nI believe the cocking arm end was not properly placed in the cylinder groove and excessive force by me (i thought it required extra force because of lack of stock) is what damaged the gun.\n\nYou are very right... Disassembly however is indeed a tricky task... I have been thinking of having a basic fixture made for this purpose... Will keep you guys posted with the updates...', ''),

Peshawar is one of my most favourite cities so if it comes to that, who knows I might even come your way... waisay bhi I have plenty of spare time these days :)\n\nI was actually thinking along the same lines myself. The cylinder (main tube) groove (can be filed and polished) and the piston (can be carefully hammered) itself should be repairable. The thing i am just not very sure of is the rubbing sound i am getting if i try to cock the gun at the moment (please do mind I havent attempted to cock it all the way - just 20% to 30%)\n\nI believe all will be clear and real damage assessed once the gun gets disassembled completely... For this either I must have a proper fixture or I will have to take it to some gunsmith...\n\nAnother interesting development is that I sent an email to Diana directly and they have responded to it. They have recommended replacing all three parts i.e. the cocking arm, piston and cylinder (main tube)... Upon further inquisition they also said that the cylinder might be reusable though however they cannot confirm this based on pictures only. The communication is still ongoing so I will update you guys of how this one develops..\nI just hope the spares aren''t crazy expensive...', ''),

There might be something wrong with the cocking arm but that too is highly unlikely. If there is something wrong then you''ll have a real hard time finding these things, but like I said IMHO it wont be that bad.\nThe seal, which I was talking about in my earlier post, is available in Lahore, and you might also be able to find it in Pindi. Just to be clear, the piston seal has nothing to do with what has happened with your gun, I was merely pointing it out since you''re going to open the gun anyway, better have a spare at hand.\n\nRegards.', ''),

(661065, ' MY SCOPE FRUSTRATION..\n\nI bought this UTG Leapers 6-24x50 scope with Sports Match single block mount about three years ago and soon after putting this on my 350 Magnum, I damaged it by over tightening the rear ring screws while trying to shim the scope for barrel droop compensation (a bit silly on my part).\n\nThose days I was shooting at 25 yard distance and was more interested in my group size rather than dropping the pellets on bulls eye. I shot about 1000 pellets with scope on the air gun and when I tried to zero it on bulls eye, I found that the POI was too low while the elevation adjustment turrets on the scope were all the way UP.\n\nI put the scope today on my gun again and shot 6 groups from 15 yard distance all having three shots. The result is the same as a couple of years ago but this time I recorded it by taking snapshots. The details are as following;\n\nGROUP 1\nELEVATION TURRETS  IN THE MIDDLE (260 clicks / 2 = 130 clicks UP)\n\nGROUP 2\nELEVATION TURRETS 130 + 30 = 160 clicks UP\n\nGROUP 3\nELEVATION TURRETS 160 + 30 = 190 clicks UP\n\nGROUP 4\nELEVATION TURRETS 190 + 30 = 220 clicks UP\n\nGROUP 5\nELEVATION TURRETS 220 + 30 = 250 clicks UP\n\nGROUP 6\nELEVATION TURRETS ALL THE WAY UP 250 + 10 = 260 clicks UP\n\nOne thing that I noticed last time and today as well, is that groups are tighter when the elevation turrets are in the middle. As I go UP from the middle, the groups start to expand horizontally while windage adjustment turrets remain in the middle (260/2=130 clicks) during all exercise.\n\nCan anyone with knowledge of scopes on springers advise me as to what is happening here?\nIs my scope of no further use or is there any chance of solving this problem?\n\nAnother thing I observed while visually inspecting the fitted scope is that due to dent in the tube, the rear section of scope seems a bit lower than the front section. Could it be contributing to this problem?\n\nI am comfortable with this air gun without having a scope and achieving acceptable groups with open sights. It''s just my curiosity that is pushing me to use a damaged scope again in pursuit of answers to the questions that I raised here.\n\nCan any experienced member help my find the answers?\n\n[ATTACH]36834[/ATTACH]\n\n[ATTACH]36835[/ATTACH]\n\n[ATTACH]36836[/ATTACH]\n\n[ATTACH]36837[/ATTACH]\n\n[ATTACH]36838[/ATTACH]\n\n[ATTACH]36839[/ATTACH]\n\n[ATTACH]36840[/ATTACH]', ''),

(661246, 'Recommendations for Ear Protection [FONT=Verdana]Salam All![/FONT]\n\n[FONT=Verdana]I was just wondering and so googled what noise levels one''s ears are exposed to when a standard 9mm round is fired.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=Verdana]Being an engineer myself I am exposed to high industrial noise levels on routine basis. Good things about an MNC (multi-national company) is that they maintain good safety standards for everyone working for them or with them. High noise protection is one of the very real hazards one is exposed to in the industries.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=Verdana]Now comes the interesting and alarming part. My little google research revealed that [B]a standard 9mm round without a silencer produces noise levels of up to [/B][/FONT][B][B]160d[/B]B!! [/B][FONT=Verdana]Lets put this in some perspective by referring to the table below:[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=Verdana]Sound (Sound Pressure Level) is measured in decibels (dB).[/FONT]\n[FONT=Verdana]0 dB Complete silence\n10 dB Barely audible – breathing\n30 dB A quiet whisper at 6-feet\n40 dB A quiet library\n50 dB A typical home\n60 dB Normal conversation at 3-feet\n70 dB Vacuum cleaner at 6-feet\n80 dB Curbside of busy road at 15-feet\n90 dB Diesel truck at 30-feet\n100 dB Outboard motor, Power lawn mower\n110 dB Beginning threshold of pain, Car horn at 3-feet, Live rock music\n120 dB Close thunderclap, Chainsaw at 3-feet\n130 dB Painful, Military jet take-off from aircraft carrier with afterburner at 50-feet\n140 dB Very painful, Aircraft carrier deck[B]\n150 dB Jet takeoff at 75-feet, Potential eardrum rupture\n[/B][SIZE=2][I](reference: http://modernsurvivalblog.com/security/hearing-protection-during-indoor-self-defense/)\n[/I][/SIZE]\nSo, effectively every time we shoot a 9mm round without ear protection, we risk rupturing our ear drum.\n\nImportant medical fact: Our ears can sustain high noise of a certain level for a certain time only without getting permanent damage. Beyond that threshold of time and loudness of sound the ears sustain irreparable damage. This damage accumulates over the years eventually resulting in perceptible hearing loss.\n\nThe most pertinent question now is: [I][B]What ear protection to use?[/B][/I]\n\nAppreciate if expert members here could shed some light on what ear protections they use and recommend? And where new shooters like myself could get their hands on good ear protection gear easily.\n\nThanks[/FONT]', ''),
