(620229, ' The 5.56x45 vs 7.62x39 debate, as being discussed here, is just as much an AR vs AK debate. One is a bit more accurate, and one hits a little harder. Remember, they are both intermediate rounds: a 63 gr 5.56 going about 3000fps will produce just over 1300ft-lbs of energy. A 123gr 7.62 doing around 2400fps produces about 1600ft-lbs. Yes, there''s a bit of a difference. But consider this, take a full size rifle cartridge such as the .308 which can go a bit faster than 2600fps with a 175gr bullet, and it will produce over 2700ft-lbs of energy, which is a clear step above the intermediate rounds. \n\nThe bottom line is, 5.56x45 and 7.62x39 both have their individual strengths and weaknesses, but at the same time, they are very comparable... and that''s why they''re compared so often :)', ''),

(620564, ' I believe responsible gun enthusiast are getting rarer by the day with increasingly thinning patience from non-enthusiast. And one of the major reason for something happening like this is due to Exhibits like Ashir_FMJ and Karinkov06. What they don''t tend to understand or realize is that their irresponsible behavior and boasting statements provide basis for all those anti-gun lobbyists who create a certain stereotype image for us gun-lovers. \nI might be quite fortunate as I don''t face any resistance from anyone living around me with respect to my love for guns but I am sure the same might not be the case with many others. Sometimes very near and close ones who love you with all their heart would go to any limit to stop you from adopting this passionate love for firearms and the examples they quote or refer to amazingly resembles the like of the above mentioned two personas. It is our utmost responsibility as gun-enthusiasts that if we want to carry on with this love of ours, we should never indulge in anything which should reflect in a negative way on firearms or its be-lovers. I wish some of our new members would realize this fact and act accordingly.\nCheers', ''),

According to senior officials ( i think 18-19 grade officers are counted in senior officer ranks and can be relied on) "Only differenciate by auto is pb and semi is npb, below and equal to .45 is npb above is pb, klashan goli (as stated by mohrer) (ie 7.62) is pb... Regardless of barrel length and mag capacity... The guy at dc office confirmed that special permission is rquired to enter semi auto rifle above .22 caliber.. And its not a problem if one carry drum mag"\nnadra guy has no information regarding pb and npb except auto and semi auto..\nNote:\nPlz dont rely on information stated above by me as it is not supported by any written notification rather i would say it was more of an informal discussion... S.O arms reffered me to check it through arms act.. But again he doesnt have any copy of that too.. I dont disagree with faraz bro ( he is very senior, nobl and well reputed member) as he have collected this frm S.O directly... Anyone (like me) who has doubts can directly /personally visit or confirm frm concerned dept..\ni am finding some one in customs from whom i can get final wordings may be he can be of little help..[/QUOTE]\n\n[QUOTE=FA226;458354]bro even the notification Fraz has posted is official as he said but still most of the offices are not fully aware of new laws and as you said even police is differentiating by full auto and semi auto and calibers.and i think that''s how it should be ,they should not confuse us by magazine capacity and barrel lengths.the problem is by making these notifications officials want to:look busy do nothing:[/QUOTE]\n\nSir basically it does not fall in the domain of NADRA, it is the job of Home Office and DC staff to check if the weapon you have purchased is according to the law and NPB or not, NADRA only has to maintain the record. HD and DC staff are un aware themselves. This notification was issued in June 2013 and ever since new lics have not been issued to general public. Hence the staff may not have been reading this stuff (this is the only logic i understand). You are right about the general description of PB and NPB but one can get it trouble if the policeman you come across is aware of this law. But God forbid if one gets in a legal dispute in a court there the situation would be very different as the court would interpret PB and NPB definitions from this notification. Please note that in this notification the PB definition says that rifles with mag capacity of more than 30 rounds are PB, it should mean that 30 or less should be NPB but they are stupid enough to write in a separate paragraph that upto 22 bullets it is NPB. And i have been through the thread where the notification you are talking about was shown, that was a draft and it had a limit of 20 bullets on that. This notification was issued after that. \n\nto be on the safe side i would advise that all people possessing the MOI licences should follow MOI''s definition of PB and NPB. Those possessing provincial issued licences should follow their HD''s definition of PB and NPB. This is the safest approach i think.\n\nP.S Zia bhai im not noble in any way :) thanks for the kind words.

I have purchased earmuffs from Metro Islamabad for 450 have not tried them yet. Normal earmuffs are cheap as there is no rocket science in them.

What they don''t tend to understand or realize is that their irresponsible behavior and boasting statements provide basis for all those anti-gun lobbyists who create a certain stereotype image for us gun-lovers. \nI might be quite fortunate as I don''t face any resistance from anyone living around me with respect to my love for guns but I am sure the same might not be the case with many others.

I also cleaned the gun as i usually do everytime i shoot. \n\nSo i thought i''d take the grips out to get a better view of the mag release mechanism, and to my horror i found a lot of black slimy stuff under the handgrip, on the frame of the gun. I just sprayed it with my gun cleaner and wiped it all clean. Sprayed behind the grips and cleaned them too. I''m not sure what the stuff was. My guess is that the grips may have melted whilst in storage (my father stored it somewhere as he came to Pakistan when i was in the UK). \n\nI haven''t had a chance to go out and fire the weapon so i will go tomorrow. I hope the issue was the slimy stuff, as this gun has never missed a beat. If it doesn''t sort the issue i''ll take it to a gunsmith.', ''),

Do you follow this method and how much is it effective? [/QUOTE]\nLead just means shooting in front of a moving target. Consider this: say you want to shoot a clay or bird, and say you put your sights right on the target. It takes you several fractions of a second to decide to shoot, several fractions for your brain to send the signal to your trigger finger, add to that "lock time" which is the time between pressing the trigger and  cartridge ignition, then there''s the several more fractions for the shot or bullet to get there, and by that time the target (which is in constant motion) has already travelled beyond your point of aim. That''s why you have to shoot in front of, or lead, the target.\n\nAs 12GAUGE said, there are only two methods of shooting a moving target, as far as I know anyways. What 12GAUGE described were different methods of leading the target. The second way of shooting a moving target is called the "ambush" or "trapping" the target. Although not applicable to clay or bird shooting, what it involves is anticipating the target''s direction of travel. Then you put the sights where you think the target will go, and when it gets there, pull the trigger.', ''),

I think most of the guns are reliable after some break-in period. As far as the durability is concerned for HD guns, then it does not matter much because you have to rarely fire it. Thus reliability obviously is the top priority and looks does matter as well because you have to intimidate somebody with the gun and aerial firing rather than firing at point blank.\nMKA 1919 is a turkish gun and is very happy to fire heavy loads even slugs. It can not be used for SD because its very big gun and is hard to carry, for SD Pistol is the best option.

(620887, ' [QUOTE=12GAUGE;451647]AoA Everybody.\n\nKindly allow me to offer my two cents on the subject:\n\nhow to clean your firearms actually varies and depends upon the number of rounds that have been fired.\n\nfor general / routine cleaning: \n\nyou may use kerosene. I prefer diesel cause its has slight lubricating properties to it and doesn''t leave metal bone dry.\n\nfor really nasty and stubborn carbon deposits you may resort to harsher chemicals/solvents. the best and probably the cheapest is ordinary carburetor cleaner or brake cleaner depending upon which is easily available and cheapest of the two.\n\nnow in my humble quest to find better cleaning solutions I have learned that it is always better to employ manual labor (self) then making use of the harsh chemicals cause 1. they are hazardous and 2. they are expensive\n\nwhat I am trying to say is that I would rather use force and repetition instead of strong (and mostly carcinogenic) solvents and remember! most firearms are actually destroyed by solvents than anything else.\n\nso...how should one clean the barrel of their firearms. well.... I have mostly converted to using simple and ordinary automotive polishing compound. works like a charm. doesn''t leave a single scratch or residue in your barrel (including your lungs, kidney etc.) and cleans your barrel to the point of "new in box/never used".\n\n[B]as far as lubrication is concerned:\n\nwell....to be honest, anything works. so why waste money on expensive lubricants that work just the cheap and often no-name products.\n\nthis is what I do: we like to call this "PG-Lubricant"\n\nmix equal parts of:\n\n1. ZIC Dextron 3 ATF\n2. ZIC XQ 5w-40 synthetic motor oil\n3. Kerosene\n\nin the end, you just cannot get a better lubricant than this as long as you  stick to blued, parkerized and plated (chrome, nickle etc) surfaces and avoid painted surfaces.[/B]\n\nRegards.[/QUOTE]\n\n12Guage brother, may I ask couple of questions?\n\nI presume yes ;)\n\nOk, brother what do you mean by automotive Polish compound? \nBecause, there is one automotive polish (polish in simple words) like formula or other brands... and there is other thing called compound,  which is used by painters or polishers to remove scratches from cars..\n\nplease elaborate. \n\n\n2ndly, you said for pg solvent we have mix equal amount....\n\nand its best unless used on certain surfaces.... I want to ask that how if we use diesel instead of kerosene?  Because I think (just a guess) kerosene will damage certain surfaces... so substituting diesel with kerosene make it a universal solvent and also gun paints will withstand it comfortably.\n\nPlease enlighten us.

The ammo is loaded with just enough powder to: 1-cycle the gun, and 2-make the "power factor" (fps x bullet weight) the competitor wants to score at. The bullet only has to go through a cardboard target or ring a metal plate, so no one makes "extra hot ammo" for handgun competition because that just means making your gun harder to control for no reason, as it will recoil more and take longer to get back on target.\nWith the parts, "for competition" usually means lighter and faster, not heavier and stronger. Scored is awarded according to accuracy and time, it''s not war, so a good "competition part" will sacrifice some durability for performance. In competition where speed means winning, lighter is always better. Taking a quote from F1 racing: the perfect engine will blow up as it crosses the finish line and wins the race... meaning, components only need to be strong enough to last the length of the race, match, or game. If it lasts longer than that, its too strong, too strong means too heavy, weight could have been saved, and performance enhanced.\nAlthough that may not be entirely applicable to firearms, since you dont want your gun blowing up at anytime, just look at Moeen bro''s project guns as an example. Would they have been stronger without the modifications? Probably. But on the other hand, are they now faster and easier to shoot? Definitely!', ''),

Yes, it is such an excellent marvel of craftsmanship that words wont do justice to it. Its mechanism is so simple that you just need to do it once to master it. Everything sits in its place without any problem and I guess that''s why these 1911s are so sought after. When I was going through the reviews of US&S 1911A1, I came across some which stated that these 1911s have a better fit than the Colts or Remington and I always wondered what exactly were they referring to but then last night when I stripped it completely, I was in a state of awe for quite some time to see the level of finish on these internals. If I had not done my thorough homework wrt the originality of this particular piece, I would have led myself to believe that it was not actually made in 1943, rather this craftsmanship is most probably a decade old. lol. I am also led to believe that those 1000 women workers out of a total of 1100 in US&S manufacturing plant did a mighty fine job with the fit and finish of these 1911s. \n\nPS: It was reassembled soon after. \n\n[QUOTE=1245adefender;458747][B]One of the joys to me, and Jbiz, of owning a precision firearm is to tear it all apart, [/B]marvel at the workmanship of all the little bits that make it go boom reliably.\nI always take apart any new gun I get so I can learn "what makes it tick"!\nJbiz,,,   you got an obscure and rare piece of 1911 history...

IMO.\n\nAnd thanks for sharing availability of extra mags... how much a extra mag cost you?\n\n\nMay this weapon serve you well and May Allah SWT keep you blessed and safe. Aameen[/QUOTE]\n\n\nWell the weight would obviously come down if you shorten the barrel.\n\nI am a fan of Zastava products and have previously owned a CZ999 and a M57. In the case of Zastava EZ9 Compact I think the company is deliberately misleading the customers. They shortened the barrel by 10mm (hence weight reduction of .05 kg) and called it a Compact.\n\nThe company claims on its Zastava EZ9 Compact web page that "the ballistic performances of the basic models are preserved". I disagree. The slightly longer barrel of EZ9 will be more accurate, even if minutely.\n\nMy question to you is if one chops off 10mm from the barrel of a Glock 17 or 1911 does it make it a compact ? Does chopping off 20mm from barrel make them a sub-compact?', ''),

(621273, 'Muggers got caught!!! AoA All\n\nYesterday I was out with my family near Khadda market karachi. To our horror we saw a Toyota corolla jump from the service lane to onto the main road with head on traffic, after two loud bangs, we saw another Toyota indus ramming into a CG125 on the service lane from the opposite direction. My car was just few meters away from all the action. I quickly parked my car a side and ran to check if everyone was okay in the 1st Toyota that was half way on the road while the other half on the footpath. What I saw was a women in her middle 30''s on the front seat while a man in his late 20''s on the driving wheel, both of them petrified in horror and the women broke into tears feeling immense shock. To everyone''s relief (Thanks to Allah) they survived and the shots fired were just inches away from them into the hood of the car. I can recall how both of the passengers where shaking due to effect of shots fired at them at point blank.\nAfter making sure they were not hurt my attention went to another car (Toyota indus) and a CG125 on the road just few meters away and a mob surrounding two boys, to a closer inspection I was shocked to see two Afghan/Pashtoon boy aged in between 14 to 16 being held up. Apparently they were trying to rob that lady in a moving car and upon drivers resistance they opened fire, to avoid getting hit the driver banked his car to right on the main road jumping over the footpath, while kudos to the drive of Toyota indus who upon seeing all this rammed his car into the bike, which made the robbers fell of their bike and lose their weapon (Darra/Chinees TT most prolly 30bore) upon all this the bystander got hold of them and gave them a good beating (I joined them too). Later police came inn and took the boys in their custody.\nGod for bid we all hope that no one is put into this situation but I was wonder if someone is, and he carrying and he gets the chance to shoot those thugs clean off, how would one console his conscience after all they are just boys of very young age. But today to my horror I found out that this was not their first time, they had already killed a women just two days back, made me rethink rats like these should be wiped out for good.\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]32212[/ATTACH][ATTACH=CONFIG]32213[/ATTACH]', ''),

(621309, ' Among other things, Glock pistols are known for their polygonal rifling. The lands and grooves of traditional rifling transition at square edges, like steps. Polygonal rifling differs in that the transitions are rounded, flowing from high to low points. Instead of steps, the lands and grooves of polygonal rifling are more accurately described as "hills and valleys".\n\nProponents of polygonal rifling argue that it prolongs barrel life, provides a better gas seal, deforms the bullets less, increases velocity, and results in a stronger barrel.

(621464, ' Very sad incident may God bless her soul.\n\nNeed to share something with my dear PG members. Please DO NOT KEEP WEAPON OR CARRY WEAPON with you or in the car even if you have 144 permit etc. it makes little difference to Police.\n\nI am Deputy Medical Superintendent at Mayo Hospital, Lahore and by grace of God in Grade 18 at age 34. I have evening duty from 2 PM to 8 PM with my home at 32 Km distance ( across the other site of city ). Those who live in Lahore and familiar with Engineer''s Town ( Further 5-6 Kms from Valancia ) can appreciate how dangerous is last 10 Km from Mayo to my home and by the time I reach that dangerous zone it is already past 9 PM. Main defence road has no lights two or three almost blind road curves with a fairly bad track record as far as the crime goes.\n\nUnder the above circumstances it is ''supposed must'' for me to have one good reliable handgun with one full extra loaded magazine with me in my car and I do have 6 handguns in my firearm cupboard. But very sad fact is I CAN''T carry it in the car. I can only carry it to the LRC firing range in daylight but not so is the case at odd time in the dark when it is really needed.\n\nNow, I tell you the reason why you should not carry weapon in car. Occasionally Police Pickets are there on the road usually after a recent crime and they definitely stop everybody and although they never searched my car ( uptil now, do not know about tomorrow ) but they definitely ask for Identity, reason of travelling at that odd time etc. the conventional police questions you all know and then they let me go. But if I do have weapon and is spotted by police it will definitely be confiscated by Police as they are blocking the road at recent crime scene. Well Recent Crime Scene and any person caught with a weapon...... you can do the maths....\n\nInspite of all your good Credentials, Gazetted Post & Position, Nobel Profession, ......... Police is Police and even a minor Police Sipahi can get you in the Jail with your precious weapon in police custody for many months and chances are you are never going to get it back and even after many months of Khawari and many many Safarish etc. they are never going to give you back your Glock or HK that is for sure they will hand you over 9mm Foriegn Made as stated on your license. Just take this hard fact it is a reality and you may have to spend few or many nights in custody if the recent crime was a murder.\n\nSo, last point on which some of Gentlemen will say\n "No you have to be alive to face Jail & Court so if your life is in sure danger shot the Bad Guy"\n\nIn fact you can call me Coward it''s okay but I would prefer to be killed by BG rather than facing Pakistan''s Court Kachahri System !!!!!!\n\nEvery system has improved in our country take it I.T. , Telecom etc. but Police Wala culture has never ended in this country and will never end.\n\nDo not attempt to do things which you see in Tactical response James Yearger or some other good Tactical firearm expert & trainer tells to do remember they are talking of ususally situations arising in USA mainly. No body has ever commented whether to carry or not in Lahore or Karachi.\n\nNow, not for fun but for real need I do need to carry weapon but I dont instead I started using 2010 model car ( Alto ) instead of any new ones and keep about 4-5 K cash in my wallet with no ATM card and all other cards colour copied ( including Government Gazetted Officer Card and Hospital Card ) . Basically the wallet contains only that reasonable cash that they might not shoot out of anger. Few Medical Books, White Medical Coat and a Stethoscope. \n\nHopefully and with 90% confidence I can say I am safe with these simple measures forget about rest of 10% as God is always there to protect all of us. But from this Police you have to protect yourself by not letting them a chance to have them give you a tough time.\n\nRegards', ''),

Area is pitch dark with more chances of confrontation with a typical "Police Wala" than a BG.\n\nIn other words BG is no one but those patronized by Police themselves and Police Checking in the name of recent crime can take anyone into trouble with a weapon even we are talking about legal weapons only here.\n\nHave discussed the matter in a bit more detail in another post in "off topic" section. Occassional police checking is a different story but if you have to cross the 10 Km danger zone on daily basis with weapon in a crime high area and weapon spotted by Police after a recent muder than they are not going to behave nicely and will never let you go alongwith your weapon that is for sure, your weapon in Police hands without receipt is like a death warrant with your finger prints all over the weapon they can easily misuse it.

Believe me I never even try to taste that cake or whatever. With the same token I do not invite and do not myself go to the Police Walas house for any social event party, birthday etc. \r\n\r\nWith due apologies and very sorry to say I do not consider them as Human beings at all. \r\n\r\nIn hospital when they accompany some very sick criminal ( some of them have been sentenced to death but ban on capital punishment making things more unclear ). Believe me or not we are not afraid of any criminal whether he is in hancuffs or just roaming around on his own BUT we are definitely scared of Police Walas 3-4 AK 47 rifles hanging in many different barrel positions sometimes the barrel is pointing at duty doctor or staff nurse. Either these people are very ill trained or they do so deliberately to scare us and they are successful in doing so.\r\n\r\nGentlemen samething many of you have also noted while you are stopping your car at a Red signal and sometimes it happens behind the Police Hilux with the last two police walas carrying their Rifles in their naps like a laptop with barrel of one or both pointing exactly to you ( the car driver and the one on the passenger seat of the car just behind the police Hilux ) again harassing the normal public and it is against the law, against the constitution and against your basic human rights.....but my dear this is Pakistan unfortunately there is no such thing like following law and considering human rights.\r\n\r\nIn my view Police is the largest "Ghundda/Jagga/Bhai Log" (whatever the terminology you can use ) in our society.

(621570, ' [QUOTE=Jehanzeb Mahar;459315]If a robber is fleeing with our property, i.e. mobile phone, which he has robbed of us at gunpoint, and we have a gun, does the law allow us to shoot him in the back? In my view, the clause of PPC which is most relevant to this situation is, "The right of private defense of property against robbery Continues as long as the offender             causes or attempts to cause to any person death or hurt or wrongful restraint or as long as             the fear of instant death or of instant-hurt or of instant personal restraint continues."\n\nWhat is meant by ''wrongful restraint'' and ''instant personal restraint'' in this context? Lawyer members, specially those having experience of criminal cases, are requested to guide, not just in the light of the section of PPC given above, but in the light of all the knowledge of Pakistani law you have.\n\nP.S. I know most of the members would say that we shouldn''t  shoot a robber just for the sake of a mobile phone, but I just want to know what the law has to say about it?[/QUOTE]\n\n\n\nDear Brother\n\nJust to give you gist of the law related to Right of Private Defense in Pakistan, my humble submission is as follows, hope it will be of help, In Sha ALLAH\n\n\nBasically, no one is allowed to take the life or hurt another person even if that other is a criminal... law related to Right of private defense of body or of property is among exceptions provided in PPC. Its only a last option available to a person attacked or to be attacked to protect himself, his property or someone else or someone else''s property...\n \n\nSubject to following restrictions: Under Section 99 PPC.\n\n1. There is [B]NO right of private defense in cases in which there is time to have recourse to the protection of the public authorities.[/B]\n\n\n2. [B]There is no right of private defense against an act which does not reasonably cause the apprehension of death or of grievous hurt, if done, or attempted to be done by a public servant acting \nin good faith under colour, of his office, or by or under his direction, though that act may not be strictly justifiable by law[/B]\n\n\n3. The right of [B]private defense in No case extends to the inflicting of more harm than it is necessary[/B] to inflict for the purpose of defense.\n\n\n4. When an act is performed in pursuant to the right of Private defense, the [B]person who exercised the right of private defense has to prove in the court of law that he acted in Private defense and thus his action falls under exception clause of PPC.[/B] And Onus is on him to prove his innocence.\n\n\n\nHence in its very nature its available only in a situation when a person is unable to approach the authorities for his or others protection, only then he is allowed to act in self defense otherwise [B]primarily its the job of LEAs specially of police to safeguard the life and property of the citizens...[/B]\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd the [B]right of private defense of body extends to cause death to the assailant ONLY in 6 cases... none else[/B]...  as provided in Sec 100 PPC\n\n1. When Death is apprehended from the assault if right of Private Defense is not exercised\n2. When Grevious hurt is apprehended from the assault if right of Private Defense is not exercised\n3. Against an assault with the intention of committing rape; \n4. Against an assault with the intention of gratifying unnatural lust. \n5. Against an assault with the intention of kidnapping or abduction. \n6. Against an assault with the intention of wrongfully confining a person, under circumstances which may reasonably cause him to apprehend that he will be unable to have recourse to the public authorities for his release.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow as far as [B]right of private defense of property[/B] is concerned, again law provides [B]4 situations[/B] where one can kill the assailant, these are: Section 103 PPC\n\n[B]When the right of private defence of property extends to causing death:[/B]\n\n\n\nThe right of private defence of property extends, under the restrictions mentioned in Section 99, to the voluntary Causing of death or of any other harm to the wrong-doer, if the offence, the committing of which, or the attempting to commit which, occasions the exercise of the right, be an offence of any of the descriptions hereinafter enumerated, namely:- \n\n[B]1. Robbery,\n\n2. House-Breaking by Night,\n\n3. Mischief by fire committed on any building, tent or vessel, which building, tent or vessel is used as a human dwelling or as a place for the custody of property;\n\n4. Theft, mischief or house-trespass, under such circumstances as may reasonably cause apprehension that death or grievous hurt will be the consequence, if such right of private defense is not exercised[/B]\n\n\n\n\nHowever, in other crimes and forms of assault one is not debarred from exercising the right of private defense if the situation arises, rather in other form of crimes, one is only prohibited from causing death of the assailant but one can cause any other harm other than death to the assailant... subject to the restrictions mentioned above.\n\n\n\n\n\nNow, as far as your query is concerned regarding [B]shooting a criminal when he is fleeing after the commission of crime, it does not fall in self defense[/B], because you are no more under threat of life or grievous hurt... when the offender left the crime scene, now legally one is bound to approach police and put the law in motion and thereafter police will investigate and bring the culprit to justice... (at least, this is what law says)\n\n\n\nNow about what wrongful restraint mean?\n\nWell, Section 339 PPC defines wrongful restraint and hopefully it will clear the meaning of the term...\nSection 339 PPC provides that whoever voluntarily obstructs any person so as to prevent that person from proceeding in any direction in which that person has a right to proceed, is said to wrongfully restrain that person.\n\nTake the example of a mobile snatcher, if he puts a victim on gun point and orders him not to move unless his specific demands are met... the criminal would be wrongfully restraining that victim. Instant personal wrongful restraint means immediate restraining of any person wrongfully and illegally.\n\nIn simple words if a person is forced to stop from moving or proceeding to any direction, in which direction he has a right to move or proceed.. then person forcing him to stop has wrongfully restrained that victim.\n\n\nHope this will help. If you have any question feel free to ask.\n\n\n\nThis is my humble view, However, our respected and dear Asif Jhammat and SadatPk brothers will guide you more appropriately.

(at least, this is what law says)(unquote)\n \nSo, when you are saying this, aren''t you talking about the private defence of our body only. What about the private defence of our property, for which there are at least two dedicated sections in the PPC? The PPC doesn''t use the phrase of ''Self defence'' even once; uses the words of ''private defence'' of body and property.\n\n\nWe have read many cases in the newspapers when security guards shot and often killed the robbers who were fleeing with the looted property. Does the law make any discrimination on the basis whether the looted property is worth millions or thousands. The offence is the same: armed robbery. I know very well that civilians are not allowed to shoot a robber or thief who is fleeing empty handed after an unsuccessful attempt, only the LEAs have this power, that too with some conditions, as far as I know.\n\nFinally, the section which both you and me missed in our posts:\n\n[B]Section 105 says[/B][B] "Commencement and continuance of the right of private defence of property:[/B]\n\n1.The right of private defence of property commences when a reasonable apprehension of             danger to the property commences.          \n          2.The right of private defence of property against theft continues tilt the offender has             effected his retreat with the property or either the assistance of the public authorities is             obtained, [B]or the property has been recovered.[/B]          \n\n          3.The right of private defence of property against robbery Continues as long as the offender             causes or attempts to cause to any person death or hurt or wrongful restraint or as long as             the fear of instant death or of instant-hurt or of instant personal restraint continues.          \n          4.The right of private defence of property against criminal trespass or mischief continues as             long as the offender continues in the commission of criminal trespass or mischief.          \n          5.The right of private defence of property against house breaking by night continues as long             as the house-trespass which has been begun by such house-breaking continues". \n\nPlease read the second point and especially the words written in bold letters carefully.\n\nThank again for replying', ''),

And I would conceal carry (unchambered) on self (a good IWB holster) through that area instead of keeping in the glovebox or under the carpet. I would also find a strong reference and through that reference meet the local SP/SSP and explain that this is a dangerous route I commute daily hence I''d be carrying a weapon for SD.\n\nOR I''d create a custom section in the car where weapon is kept that police will have a tough time finding. Customised doorcard is one way.\n\nI''ve been pulled a few times and had no issues with even Islamabad police near the red zone. And I always handover the weapon empty with mag in my possession. Many policemen don''t know jack about safety precautions when handling a new weapon.\n\nOne thing to note is the attitude one shows when pulled over. Smile, be polite, ask ''kaisey hain janab?'', and when they are going through your documents say ''sir search karni hai to bahir aa jaoon?''. This usually,  for me anyways, concludes that interaction and they move to next car. Once these guys were adamant on searching the full car in Lahore around 3am, with my brother in the car, and I was conceal carrying on self (driving), we switched off the car, both stepped out and fully cooperated in the search and they never patted us down (so far only patted down once in PK, and that''s because I was cocky and used firm language with the policeman). After that the policeman blatantly asked for ''sir, khushi se chaiy pani'' and we respectfully declined and drove off swearing all sorts. We know they pulled us over because of the car as Corollas etc were being let through and guessed earlier on they wanted cash but patience, fake smiles (cursing within) and cooperation got us through, albiet 10 minutes wasted.', ''),

(621637, ' The Gyrojet was a firearm invented in the ''60''s. What really made it special was the ammo. Instead of gun powder enclosed in a case, the bullets known as "Microjets" were rocket powered. It was a recoilless system and although they were able to achieve a velocity of over 1200fps, it took a while to accelerate. That made the gun all but useless at close ranges. It is said that within several yards, you could literally swat the projectiles out of the air, as one would a fly. \n\nObviously, the idea failed, but the guns and especially the ammo have become very sought after by collectors.

When you say AR, that''s just a platform... there a a LOT of companies that make DI ARs that will survive a water test like that. The reason for the kb in that vid was because the water wasn''t drained completely, the HK was designed in a manner that allows quick drainage. It has nothing to do with the gun''s strength, or the piston... water does not compress, when push comes to shove, water will destroy any metal (ever heard of waterjet cutting?) \nYou mention heat and dirt: you want the heat back at the bolt with a big gaping ejection port and moving bcg to cool it, or all contained up front at the piston... where your hand goes?

On the left side of the receiver, there is a threaded hole and some grooves machined in the shape of an upside down "T" (you can see it if you zoom into the picture on the previous post); I''ve highlighted rails on the mount that fit into those grooves. Even just sitting in the T rails without being screwed down, almost all forward and back movement is eliminated. The arrows indicate where two bolts go to keep everything solid. One screws into the pre drilled receiver, but that mount also comes with an anchor that replaces the clip guide, and another screw goes into it.\n\nCompare that with the mount on the left. Effectively it is only held in place at just one point, the arrow indicates where that bolt goes. I also circled two more screws, but they don''t actually screw into anything, but rather just push against the receiver to adjust the angle the mount sits at.\n\nImo the best design (not pictured), is the kind that actually replaces the rear sight. There are alot of different scope mounting options out there for the M14, but some are clearly superior, whereas others are utterly worthless. \n\nAnyways, can''t wait to see your new rifle!', ''),

So they don''t use DI AR rifle (as per my knowledge) or just say any weapon with reliability issues[/QUOTE]\nThat is not official information, and do not say DI is not used, they merely list a bunch of weapons SEALS have at their disposal... including revolvers. Also, your illustration neglects the fact that when gasses and carbon go back to the chamber, it''s ventilated by a gaping ejection port, vs a tiny hole of a gas port if vented at the piston. Don''t get me wrong, I''m not offended, but you make such a definite statement that you think a piston system is better, but haven''t given any argument besides just saying its superior and so many companies make them. \n\nI''ll tell you why I like DI...\nAll things being equal, they''re lighter. They run cooler. They suppress more efficiently. They''re more accurate. The barrel is free floated. Piston systems actually allow more external debris into the action due to openings for the op rod. They handle better during rapid fire, whereas a reciprocating piston above the barrel will torque the rifle off centre during recoil. Lastly, parts for milspec DI guns are standardized and are therefore all interchangeable, whereas every piston system is a proprietary design.', ''),

I think it is a good inssurance.\n\nPlus keep two up to date Photostat copies of your daily carry weapon and place one at home where every responsible family member knows where it is and a second one with your lawyer. I am saying it because in case of confiscation of weapon and license you must have atleast photostat proof of your licensed firearm.\n\n@ehalin\nMore scared of Police than BG that is for sure atleast for me, yes you are right it takes more effort to actually shoot a BG but there is no plan of doing so only need to fire a couple of shots close to them just to let them know you are also armed and if circumstances are very odd and you have to choose between getting killed or shot the BG then it take real nerves, no doubt about it !!!!!\n\nAnd you are very right unattended unconscious road traffic accident victims, firearm injuries of all sorts, someone injured in road traffic accident and noted the no. of car etc. and want to press charges ........ and the list is long. But to cut it short they are all Medico-Legal cases and definitely involve Police. \n\nMay God protect us all from both BG''s / Police\n\nRegards[/QUOTE]\nThat''s a very good idea bro to have a lawyer on hand round the clock .

I mean it''s control with remote device is better.\n\n[/INDENT]\n\n[/COLOR]\n[/COLOR]\n\n\nSir, heli with double rotor (one rotor on top of the other) is called coaxial RC Heli. I agree it is easy to control.\nBut there are few limitations. \nLimited manuers i.e only forward backward and left right movement.\nLess powerful (can not be flown in open fields even if there is a little bit of wind) mostly flown indoors.\nLimited Signal Range. If you want to just have fun for a week or two then this is the one for you.\n\nWhere as the one flies on the fuel can be flown inverted and all kind of manuers that a man can imagine are possible. Has more power and can be flown in acceptable windy condition. The transmitter has range as far as you can see the heli.\nLooking at the cost involved you need to think very carefully before getting involved in it. You need to consider if you want to keep up the hobby in long run. \nI takes at least few months even if practiced daily in the presence of the coach just to be able to fly it confidently without any assistance and to safely land it.', ''),

If you don''t mind, could you tell us a little bit more about the controls, and your equipment, perhaps in the "other hobbies" thread, or just start a new one? I''d be really interested to know more about this activity.[/COLOR]\n\n[COLOR=#333333]I used to race nitro powered rc cars, and it always boggled my mind when I saw the guys with helicopters. They had so many switches it seemed more complex than a real helicopter. I mean, it looked like there was a lot more going on than just throttle, pitch, and roll.[/COLOR][/QUOTE]\n\nIf you are talking about the switches on top of the transmitter. \nThen I will give you idea about the common function/usage and why do we need them.\nIn most of the transmitter these are interchangeable like you can select what function you want to assign to which stick.\nTheir function is to adjust (increase/decrease) the travel limit of a specific component and also can be programmed to increase the RPM to certain limit in certain conditions/[COLOR=#3E3E3E]manuers[/COLOR]. More RPM = More stability and also More RPM=More fuel/battery consumption.\nFor example in a normal flight (Sport Flying) for a 60 size helicopter 1700RPM more than enough to keep it flying and stable.\nBut when you want to do those crazy upside down [COLOR=#3E3E3E]manuers (3D flying) you need more RPM therefore you need to program that specific switch to increase the rotor RPM when the switch is engaged.[/COLOR]\n\nThere is a switch for Gear, this can be used in RC Plans for landing gear. \nAnd in RC Heli this is used to change the mode of the Gyro Sensor from Normal to Head Hold (HH).\nGyro is the sensor used to control the Tail by automatically adjusting the angle of the Tail Rotor Blades in response to the wind blow.\nWhen the Gyro is in Normal Mode then you need to constantly control the tail with the help of control sticks on your transmitter. But when the Gyro is switched to HH mode then it will automatically compensate for the wind blow and hold the tail in which ever direction you put it. And will save the heli from spinning or blowing the tail from one side to another.\n\nIf you want to setup lights on the heli a switch can be assigned to turn the lights on and off while the heli is up in the air.\n\nThe more channels you have on your transmitter the more switches and switch positions you will have on them.\n\nBut it is not necessary to use all of them if you are not into 3D flying.', ''),

MP5 K  semi auto only will be available on NPB licenses. At the moment the demand for this weapon is so high in the US,  the POF is rolling out to meet this.\r\nThis is a benchmark, an achievement by the POF as it is next to impossible to qualify the ATF  and compete in a free market. It is basically a military weapon and may lack the cosmetic make up, but the inner parts are of Un matched accuracy and finish. These are tested for hardness, heat treatment, accurately gauged and then test fired for accuracy and endurance. These go through destructive tests when 6000 rounds are fired at full auto in 30 shot magazines alternated with semiautomatic fire. At 6000 Rd  these are re tested for accuracy and wear of parts. It is an engineering marvel, of course made by Heckler and Koch / Rhine metal,  Pakistan wisely bought the plant and established factories to build the H&k family of weapons in 1960 s.\r\nTo day Pakistan is exporting Machine guns to Germany and MP5s to US, and DMRs to several other countries.\r\nThe guns are very sensitive to reputation, once bad ammo or a weapon misbehaves the stigma seems to last for ever.\r\nThe MP5 went through this due to some bad lots of ammo, this happens all over the world,  that situation has been corrected and the gun is now a delight to shoot.\r\nKeep your licenses ready these will be available at very attractive prices.[/QUOTE]', ''),

On the left side of the receiver, there is a threaded hole and some grooves machined in the shape of an upside down "T" (you can see it if you zoom into the picture on the previous post); I''ve highlighted rails on the mount that fit into those grooves. Even just sitting in the T rails without being screwed down, almost all forward and back movement is eliminated. The arrows indicate where two bolts go to keep everything solid. One screws into the pre drilled receiver, but that mount also comes with an anchor that replaces the clip guide, and another screw goes into it.\n\nCompare that with the mount on the left. Effectively it is only held in place at just one point, the arrow indicates where that bolt goes. I also circled two more screws, but they don''t actually screw into anything, but rather just push against the receiver to adjust the angle the mount sits at.\n\nImo the best design (not pictured), is the kind that actually replaces the rear sight. There are alot of different scope mounting options out there for the M14, but some are clearly superior, whereas others are utterly worthless. \n\nAnyways, can''t wait to see your new rifle![/QUOTE]\n\nThanks for being so helpful.

Don''t get me wrong, I''m not offended, but you make such a definite statement that you think a piston system is better, but haven''t given any argument besides just saying its superior and so many companies make them. \n\nI''ll tell you why I like DI...\nAll things being equal, they''re lighter. They run cooler. They suppress more efficiently. They''re more accurate. The barrel is free floated. Piston systems actually allow more external debris into the action due to openings for the op rod. They handle better during rapid fire, whereas a reciprocating piston above the barrel will torque the rifle off centre during recoil. Lastly, parts for milspec DI guns are standardized and are therefore all interchangeable, whereas every piston system is a proprietary design.[/QUOTE]\nFudgepacker, your info is not accurate about the AR15 D.I. system. The D.I. system injects gas directly into the receiver and into the bolt carrier. In the early days of the AR being used in Vietnam war, this gas residue caused many guns to jam up, and many soldiers were killed as a result. Later generations of AR''s mostly got rid of this problem to a certain extent, but it still happens occasionly. I was issued an M16 in 1969 when I was sent to Vietnam, and was also given several classes on how to prevent problems with the M16. #1 was to limit full auto firing, #2 was to clean at least once a day, or more if it was real dirty. #3 was to place a plastic cap on end of barrel to keep out debri.\nPiston system does not allow more dirt in than D.I., as the piston enters the receiver in the same place as the old gas tube, and is the exact same size as the gas tube. The piston does not torque the rifle off the sites. Impossible for that to happen. It''s very easy to convert an D.I. AR15, remove the gas tube and front site, install new site made for piston, install long metal (piston)rod thru front site and into front of receiver gastube hole, install gas system to barrel in front of front site and tighten screws. Takes about 30 minutes. I can try to upload some pictures in the next day or 2 of my AR15 thats been converted to Gas Piston. My AR15 is in a hybrid caliber, 7.62x40. It''s made from .223 brass cases that have had the neck opened to accept .308 bullets. I use it to hunt deer and wild pigs. It knocks the pigs on their butts!', ''),

In fact it says it has to be registered in local National Bank branch within 60 days or it stands cancelled. The inspection period of license/weapon is mentioned as SIX MONTHS from date of issuance. So it is really 60 days period for purchase/registration of weapon?\n\n2. The number of ammunition. The maximum for possession at a time is 25 while per year is empty right now. Someone told me that I cannot possess more than 25 at a time which is obvious but then I was told that I cannot have any less than 25 either or the Police will have a problem with this too. \n\n3.

To everyone''s relief (Thanks to Allah) they survived and the shots fired were just inches away from them into the hood of the car. I can recall how both of the passengers where shaking due to effect of shots fired at them at point blank.\nAfter making sure they were not hurt my attention went to another car (Toyota indus) and a CG125 on the road just few meters away and a mob surrounding two boys, to a closer inspection I was shocked to see two Afghan/Pashtoon boy aged in between 14 to 16 being held up. Apparently they were trying to rob that lady in a moving car and upon drivers resistance they opened fire, to avoid getting hit the driver banked his car to right on the main road jumping over the footpath, while kudos to the drive of Toyota indus who upon seeing all this rammed his car into the bike, which made the robbers fell of their bike and lose their weapon (Darra/Chinees TT most prolly 30bore) upon all this the bystander got hold of them and gave them a good beating (I joined them too). Later police came inn and took the boys in their custody.\nGod for bid we all hope that no one is put into this situation [U][B]but I was wonder if someone is, and he carrying and he gets the chance to shoot those thugs clean off, how would one console his conscience after all they are just boys of very young age.

At the moment the demand for this weapon is so high in the US,  the POF is rolling out to meet this.\nThis is a benchmark, an achievement by the POF as it is next to impossible to qualify the ATF  and compete in a free market. It is basically a military weapon and may lack the cosmetic make up, but the inner parts are of Un matched accuracy and finish. These are tested for hardness, heat treatment, accurately gauged and then test fired for accuracy and endurance. These go through destructive tests when 6000 rounds are fired at full auto in 30 shot magazines alternated with semiautomatic fire. At 6000 Rd  these are re tested for accuracy and wear of parts. It is an engineering marvel, of course made by Heckler and Koch / Rhine metal,  Pakistan wisely bought the plant and established factories to build the H&k family of weapons in 1960 s.\nTo day Pakistan is exporting Machine guns to Germany and MP5s to US, and DMRs to several other countries.\nThe guns are very sensitive to reputation, once bad ammo or a weapon misbehaves the stigma seems to last for ever.\nThe MP5 went through this due to some bad lots of ammo, this happens all over the world,  that situation has been corrected and the gun is now a delight to shoot.\nKeep your licenses ready these will be available at very attractive prices.[/QUOTE]\n\nwhen ? and at what cost brother ?', ''),

To our horror we saw a Toyota corolla jump from the service lane to onto the main road with head on traffic, after two loud bangs, we saw another Toyota indus ramming into a CG125 on the service lane from the opposite direction. My car was just few meters away from all the action. I quickly parked my car a side and ran to check if everyone was okay in the 1st Toyota that was half way on the road while the other half on the footpath. What I saw was a women in her middle 30''s on the front seat while a man in his late 20''s on the driving wheel, both of them petrified in horror and the women broke into tears feeling immense shock. To everyone''s relief (Thanks to Allah) they survived and the shots fired were just inches away from them into the hood of the car. I can recall how both of the passengers where shaking due to effect of shots fired at them at point blank.\nAfter making sure they were not hurt my attention went to another car (Toyota indus) and a CG125 on the road just few meters away and a mob surrounding two boys, to a closer inspection I was shocked to see two Afghan/Pashtoon boy aged in between 14 to 16 being held up. Apparently they were trying to rob that lady in a moving car and upon drivers resistance they opened fire, to avoid getting hit the driver banked his car to right on the main road jumping over the footpath, while kudos to the drive of Toyota indus who upon seeing all this rammed his car into the bike, which made the robbers fell of their bike and lose their weapon (Darra/Chinees TT most prolly 30bore) upon all this the bystander got hold of them and gave them a good beating (I joined them too). Later police came inn and took the boys in their custody.\nGod for bid we all hope that no one is put into this situation but I was wonder if someone is, and he carrying and he gets the chance to shoot those thugs clean off, how would one console his conscience after all they are just boys of very young age. But today to my horror I found out that this was not their first time, they had already killed a women just two days back, made me rethink rats like these should be wiped out for good.\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]32212[/ATTACH][ATTACH=CONFIG]32213[/ATTACH][/QUOTE]\n\n\nSomeone do this country a favour and kill these rat bastards....junkies and thugs dont deserve to live.', ''),

They have been around for the last few years. \nStart out with a cheapo toy coaxial * MAKE SURE IT IS A 4 CHANNEL MODEL * ( with two sets of blades ) It will be a nice and easy entry into the hobby and a painless exit if you dont fancy it.  Fly a good 30 or so flights with it, should take 1.5 weeks to get a feel for it and the controls. If you play video games with a controller, youve got a advantage here. by that time the brushed motors in it will have burnt out already, throw it away.\n\nfollow that up with a Fixed pitch/ FP RTF( ready to fly ) helicoper, a small electric in the 100-300 size range. Youll have to buy it from a hobby shop, or do like i do in canada, buy it off hobbyking.com  .\n\nThe final step this is very important. Do not buy a CP ( collective pitch helicopter ) Yet, Or at least for the next 3 months. instead get a good simulator ( pheonix flight and realflight are good options ) and practive practive practive. every time you crash, had it been a real cp heli, thats at LEAST 150 dollars down the drain. belive me, the 100 or so you will pay for a simulator will save you so much in the long term, you have no idea. \n\nAfter you have learned it, all normal flight except for 3d, go buy a trex 450 from rotorquest or a assult 450 from hobbyking. Make sure they are RTF, And even if they are RTF, they need some tools and setup. Make sure to read up on it. so from now, if you started right now, to learn the hobby and get into it the quickest and cheapest, \nit would take you about 2 months if you video game on a console, and 3 if not. \nand in terms of cash, \n30 for the coaxial toy thing, 100 for the FP helicopter, 100 for the simulator, and finally 400-600 for the full fledged 450.', ''),

(622154, ' Yup, I know PGW. If you ask me, I would rather get a Savage 110BA. IMHO, for the same money as the PGW (around $6k), the Barrett MRAD-Multi Role Adaptive Design, is a much better rifle, with much better design, from a much more reputed brand. I''m not saying the Coyote is not good, I''ve handled one and its build quality is impeccable, but its still overpriced. What isn''t advertised is that they don''t make a lot of the components. If a company is just assembling parts, no matter how high end they are, you gotta admit it''s different than a "manufacturer" who designs and builds everything from the ground up, and can thus control 100% of the process. My point is, for that money, there are much better choices, you can get an Accuracy International, or even an M99 50BMG for less! Another benefit of the MRAD is its modularity, you''re good to go from 308 to 300Win Mag to 338 Lap Mag, and I don''t know how long the current wait is to get a Coyote, but you can go down to the store right now and come home with a Barrett or AI. \nAnyways, just my $0.02 :)\n\nBtw, if you don''t mind showing off your 7mm, I''d love to see it!', ''),

(622162, ' An aluminum action is a risky proposition if you ask me... The idea has been around since the 60''s but there were many challenges. Although ideal for aircraft structures due to its light weight, and when formed in the proper shape it is indeed sufficiently strong for structural components, aluminum remains a relatively soft metal compared to steel. Furthermore, the action of a firearm doesn''t involve the use of braces, honeycombs,  or other various support structures, but is essentially a hollowed out block of metal that relies on the strength inherent in the material itself. To this day I don''t think any major manufacturers mass produce an aluminum action for a bolt gun, but they are available from select custom manufacturers. Nonetheless, I personally don''t like sacrificing strength to save a little weight,  in fact in that application, I would rather rather carry a little extra weight for more strength and rigidity.', ''),

I created this post to boil it all down to the biggest features you should focus on when comparing long-range scopes. Of course you are likely going to have to make trade-offs between different features, unless you are willing to pay $3,000+ for a scope (which many shooters do). But if you’re on a budget like most people, this list should help you make sense of all the different specs, give you an idea of which are more important, and help you filter out some of the marketing noise when researching rifle scopes.[/FONT]\n  [B][FONT=&amp]Most Important Features To Look For In Long-Range Riflescopes[/FONT][/B]\n  \n[LIST=1]\n[*][B][FONT=&amp]Quality Glass[/FONT][/B][FONT=&amp]      – High-end glass cannot be overvalued in a long-range scope. It is the      biggest difference between a $200 scope and a $4000 scope. Clear, sharp      glass can make it easier to see at lower power magnifications. This is      especially important for reading mirage, which is how you can judge what      the wind is doing at the target. In long-range shooting, the wind may be      very different at the target than it is at your shooting location.      Unfortunately there isn’t really a good spec that quantifies how good of      glass a scope has. It is just a subjective factor, but is usually obvious      when you compare scopes side-by-side. I once thought “Light Transmission”      was an emperical way to compare this, but there isn’t a standard test      methodology for that and most manufacturers really game the system on that      to make themselves look better. After talking with multiple scope      manufacturers, my suggestion is to ignore that spec all together. The best      way to go about this is side-by-side comparison with your own eyes, but      when you don’t have that luxury … the next best approach is to stick with      one of the manufacturers that is known to use high quality glass: [/FONT]\n[LIST]\n[*][FONT=&amp]Schmidt & Bender[/FONT] \n[*][FONT=&amp]Swarovski[/FONT] \n[*][FONT=&amp]Nightforce[/FONT] \n[*][FONT=&amp]U.S. Optics[/FONT] \n[*][FONT=&amp]Premier Reticles[/FONT] \n[*][FONT=&amp]Higher-end Leupold models[/FONT] \n[*][FONT=&amp]Higher-end Zeiss models[/FONT] \n[/LIST]\n  \n[*][B][FONT=&amp]Milling Reticle[/FONT][/B][FONT=&amp]      – You need a reticle that has evenly spaced dots or hash marks (in either [/FONT][URL="http://precisionrifleblog.com/2013/07/20/mil-vs-moa-an-objective-comparison/"][COLOR=blue][FONT=&amp]mils or MOA[/FONT][/COLOR][/URL][FONT=&amp])      along the vertical [I][U]and horizontal axis[/U][/I]. Essentially for long      range shooting, most people “hold for wind” and “dial for elevation”.      Dialing for elevations means you estimate or measure the distance to the      target, calculate what the drop would be, then rotate the turrets on the      scope to account for the drop so that you can put the crosshairs dead      center on the target like it was at 100 yards. However, people “hold for      wind” because wind changes so fast, that you can’t really turn the turrets      for the adjustment and get back on the gun in time to fire the shot before      the wind changes (especially in west Texas). So they make the adjustment      on the scope for vertical drop, which allows them to hold dead center on      the vertical axis … but just hold a little to the left or right to account      for wind (always in the direction the wind is coming from). They calculate      how much they need to adjust for a 10mph wind for example, and maybe that      adjustment is 3 mils at whatever distance they are shooting. But right      before they pull the trigger they feel the wind die down just a little, so      they shift to a 2 mil adjustment at the last second and hit dead center.      If they would have kept the 3 mil hold they originally had in mind, they      may have missed the target completely. The diagram below shows what      “holding 2 mils” would look like in this example.\n     [/FONT][FONT=&amp]\n     If you look at the different reticles below, there are only two that have      marks on the horizontal axis. The Bullet Drop Compensation reticle has a      few on the vertical axis, but that doesn’t help you “hold for wind”. That      just makes it so that you could “hold for elevation” and in long range      shooting most people don’t do that. I personally prefer the finer hash      marks and “floating crosshair” like the Nightforce MOAR reticle shown.\n     [/FONT] \n[*][B][FONT=&amp]Zoom Range/Power [/FONT][/B][FONT=&amp]–      I think you need at least 18x for long range shooting. The difference      between 18-25 is not as much as you think it would be. If you are using      the rifle for hunting, the low end of the zoom range is important too. If      an animal pops up at 50 yards it is hard to find in a scope that can only      be zoomed out to 8x. The sweet spot is probably 5-25.[/FONT] \n[*][B][FONT=&amp]Elevation Adjustment Range[/FONT][/B][FONT=&amp] – This is simply how much adjustment does the scope      allow internally. When you are shooting long range, the more the better. I      prefer something with at least 100 MOA (27.3 mil) of elevation adjustment.      If your ballistics say you need to adjust by 55 MOA for the shot you are      about to take, but your scope bottoms out at 50 MOA of adjustment … uh oh.      You end up having to hold for elevation for 5 MOA, and if you are also      holding for wind you end up with the target floating out in the middle of      nowhere in the reticle. It is difficult to make those shots. One thing that      can help the amount of elevation adjustment available is a larger tube      diameter. Common scope tube diameters are 1”, 30mm, 34mm, and 35mm.      According to OpticsPlanet.com, “The larger main tubes are most useful for      allowing for a greater range of elevation adjustments, [I]not greater      light transmission[/I]. In fact, most 30mm scopes have the same size      lenses that are in one inch tubes.”[/FONT] \n[*][B][FONT=&amp]Objective Size[/FONT][/B][FONT=&amp]      – More light is always better, so it makes sense that a larger objective      lens (56mm) would be able to gather more light than a smaller one (40mm).      But there is a diminishing return the benefits of a large objective size,      and once you start getting over 50mm the only scenario where you might      notice a slight difference in the amount of light is in very low-light      conditions when the scope is set to the highest power. Of course for      hunting, low-light conditions are the most critical (dusk and dawn), so      that does matter some. There is also the problem of being able to mount      the scope low enough to get proper eye alignment. Without a stock that has      an adjustable cheek rest, its hard to get good alignment with the bigger      objective lens sizes. I personally prefer a 50mm objective, although 56mm      are more popular among long-range shooters.\n     [/FONT] \n[*][B][FONT=&amp]Matching Reticle & Turrets[/FONT][/B][FONT=&amp] – If you decide to go with a mildot reticle, you      should make sure the turret adjustments are in mils (typically 1/10th mil      clicks). If you get a MOA reticle, you should make sure the turret      adjustments are in MOA (typically ¼ MOA clicks). Lots of scopes      (especially low to mid-range scopes) have a mildot reticle with MOA      adjustments … that doesn’t make a lot of sense, and can make life a lot      harder. Essentially if they match, you can watch your bullet impact … and      if you were off, you can measure the distance using the reticle then make      that adjustment to the scope. If they don’t match, you get to do a lot of      complex math and/or have a dope sheet with both units. There is no major      “inherent advantage” to the mil or MOA system (see [/FONT][URL="http://precisionrifleblog.com/2013/07/20/mil-vs-moa-an-objective-comparison/"][COLOR=blue][FONT=&amp]MIL vs MOA comparison[/FONT][/COLOR][/URL][FONT=&amp]      for more details on this), but whichever one you pick … make sure the      reticle and turret adjustments match, either MOA/MOA or mil/mil. The only      argument that might be able to hold water between the two systems is that      MOA is more natural if you think in “yards” and mils are more natural if      you think in “meters”.[/FONT] \n[*][B][FONT=&amp]Front Focal Plane[/FONT][/B][FONT=&amp]      – This is a debatable point, but is a big feature on long-range scopes.      Reticles are on either the front focal plane or the second focal plane,      which just means it is located in front of or behind “the zoom” on the      scope. On front focal plane scopes, when you adjust the zoom on the scope      the reticle will appear to change size. When you zoom in it will get      bigger, when you zoom out it will get smaller. That might mean the reticle      is “too thick” when zoomed all the way in, which can obscure the target …      or it might be “too thin” when zoomed all the way out, which can make it      hard to see, especially for closer, quick reflex shots. The advantage to      front focal plane scopes is that the lines are always the same relative      distance apart. If you are using a mildot scope, the dots are always 1 mil      apart regardless of the zoom setting on your scope. This is a big deal,      because it essentially takes out one more thing you have to check or think      about before taking a long range shot. On second focal plane scopes, when      you adjust the zoom the reticle remains the same size. However, that does      mean you have to be at a very specific zoom setting for the marks to be      the correct size. That is just one more thing to remember before you take      a shot, but some people prefer it in order to avoid the too thick/thin      reticle issues.\n     [/FONT] \n[*][B][FONT=&amp]Other Features[/FONT][/B][FONT=&amp]      – There are a lot of other wiz-bang features marketing tries to get you to      focus on, like Zero Stop, Locking Turrets, 1/8 MOA adjustments, illuminated      reticles, and a million other things. Some are cool, but none are in the      same class as these features. I do like the Zero Stop for using a long      range setup in hunting scenarios. I hate 1/8 MOA adjustments … most people      can’t shoot between those numbers, so ¼ MOA is almost always enough fine      control and is more speedy and less error prone to dial the correct      adjustment. I have a scope with an illuminated reticle, and I never use it      … ever. It’s one of those things that seems like a good idea, but you      probably won’t ever actually use.[/FONT] \n[/LIST]\n  [B][FONT=&amp]Best Rifle Scope For The Money[/FONT][/B]\n  [B][FONT=&amp]Under $500:[/FONT][/B]\n  [URL="http://www.midwayusa.com/product/123107/nikon-buckmasters-rifle-scope-6-18x-40mm-side-focus-mil-dot-reticle-matte"][B][COLOR=blue][FONT=&amp]Nikon Buckmasters 6-18x40mm Mildot[/FONT][/COLOR][/B][/URL][FONT=&amp] ($275 street) – Without a doubt this is a huge value.

Honestly, it might have been luck … but it shows this scope is capable of a lot for the price. Again, this one has a mildot reticle with MOA turret adjustments, which isn’t ideal … and also a 1” tube and 40mm objective, which are a little small. But the glass is good (not great), and the zero is fairly repeatable … not like a high-end scope, but better than most in this class. This scope is another huge value for the money.[/FONT]\n  [B][FONT=&amp]$1000-1500:[/FONT][/B]\n  [FONT=&amp]This is a hard spot for me.

I actually have the Zero Stop option on mine, which adds about $200 …      and I’m not sure if it’s worth that much now that I’ve been using it for a      while. The image clarity on these are great through the entire zoom range,      although not as clear as the Schmidt & Benders. I have compared      side-by-side on multiple occassions and that is just the truth. The zero is      very repeatable, even if you adjust all the way out and then back down to      zero … you are dead on. They have high-speed turrets, which have 20 MOA of      adjustment per revolution. It is also available in a 56mm objective for      the same price, although I prefer the slimmer 50mm. I’ve looked through      both side-by-side and there is very little difference, even in low light.      Nightforce also came out with a new [/FONT][URL="http://www.eurooptic.com/nightforce-atacr-5-25x56-zerostop-25-moa-moar-c445.aspx"][B][COLOR=blue][FONT=&amp]ATACR 5-25x56mm[/FONT][/COLOR][/B][/URL][FONT=&amp] model for $2300 street, which uses a 34mm tube instead      of the 30mm that the NXS uses. It supposedly uses ED glass, which is      supposed to be a little better than the NXS model. However, I have a good      friend that owned several NXS models and bought an ATACR only to be      disappointed. He didn’t think it was as good of a scope as the NXS series      and ended up trading it in. You can get the NXS or the ATACR in mil-based      reticles as well, with the MLR being the most popular. There are a ton of      serious shooters out there like Bryan Litz that swear by Nightforce      scopes. In Bryan’s new DVD training he mentions that he has seen a lot of      bad scopes in his career, but he has never had a single Nightforce scope      that didn’t track well. They are machined from a single piece of aluminum      that is thicker than all other scopes out there (that I’m aware of), so      they are very rugged as well.

The problem with most long-range scopes is that it can be almost impossible to engage targets that pop-up at close ranges unexpectedly. Nothing is more frustrating than bumping up a trophy animal at close range, and struggling to find them in your scope to take the shot. There are a couple other options for handling the combination of long-range and close-range shots with the same gun, and I explain a few options in this post.[/FONT]\n  \n  [URL="http://precisionrifleblog.com/2013/07/20/mil-vs-moa-an-objective-comparison/"][B][COLOR=blue][FONT=&amp]MIL vs MOA – An Objective Comparison:[/FONT][/COLOR][/B][/URL][FONT=&amp] There are a lot of articles and forum threads out there comparing MIL and MOA, but most either aren’t objective or they’re overly complex. I’ll try to avoid both of those pitfalls in this article. Includes contributions from Bryan Litz, author of Applied Ballistics for Long-Range Shooting and Chief Ballistician at Berger Bullets.[/FONT]\n  First, there are some [B]reticles [/B]that are calibrated to a certain ballistic curve. Essentially you have standard mildot reticles (aka milling reticles) and then you have ballistic reticles (aka BDC or Bullet Drop Compensation reticles). Here is a diagram that shows the two side-by-side, and points out a couple general things to look for to help you differentiate between the two.\n     \n  Another “ballistic calibration” approach is to have a [B]custom elevation turret/knob[/B] made to match a particular ballistic curve. In that case the knob will have special marks on it. Normally a knob would have marks for 1 mil, 2 mils, 3 mils, etc. and those would all be evenly spaced. But a ballistic turret would have marks for 100 yards, 200 yards, 300 yards, etc. That means if you know the target is 300 yards away you don’t have to look up what the adjustment should be for that distance on your dope card, you just dial to 300 and pull the trigger. This is how the Mark AR works. It has a standard mildot reticle, but a knob “calibrated for a 55gr bullet” with a typical BC and muzzle velocity. What is different about the Mod 1 though is the knob also has standard mil marks on it as well. So you can just ignore the ballistic marks, and it works just like any other standard milling scope. What I did was pay $50 for Leupold to send me a custom knob without the ballistic marks on it.\n  \nsorry for the pics brothers............', ''),

The committee had taken up the matter of federal government ban on issuance of arms licenses (non-prohibited bore (NPB) licenses and prohibited bore (PB) licenses) and the security of Chinese working at various development projects in Pakistan. The senior officers of the National Counter Terrorism Authority (NACTA) and the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) also participated in the meeting. The committee said that it would also recommend the federal government to lift a ban on the issuance of arms licenses, both NPB and PB.\nThe Ministry of Interior raised many eyebrows when the additional secretary told the meeting that the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa government had issued as many 79,266 NPB licenses during the last one year. He also said that Sindh had issued 19000 PB licenses followed by Punjab 2482 NPB and Balochistan issued 1132 NPB licenses during the last one year. He said that Punjab had also issued 133 PB licenses for the security of Nandipur Power Project and according to the information sent by the provincial home departments, no other province had issued PB license other than Punjab. However, the chairman Committee Senator Talha Mahmood of JUI-F was of the view that the information provided to the Ministry of Interior by the KP Home Department was not true, as the province had also issued PB licenses. He said that the issuance of around 80,000 NPB licenses by the PK government was even alarming and needed to be investigated.\nThe committee was informed that provincial governments of KP and Singh have passed their own legislations on issuance of arms licenses in the light of the 18th Amendment and were stressing that the federal government had no concern with the arms licenses. The Additional Secretary said, "KP is issuing arms licenses having validity for all Pakistan."\nUnder the new policy, no person having criminal background and non-tax payer would be issued any arm license. The SHO of the concerned area would verify the credentials of the applicant. Under the policy, the provinces can issue NPB licenses and the authority to issue PB licenses would remain with Prime Minister. In Islamabad Capital Territory (ICT), Deputy Commissioner Islamabad would issue NPB licenses.\nThe additional secretary said, "The Law Division had advised the ministry either to amend the Constitution in connection with the devolution of arms licenses to the provinces to take the power back to the federal govt or go to the Council of Common Interests (CCI) to have the consent of the provinces and make a policy while taking on board all the provinces." He said that at present the federal government had put a ban on the issuance of all kinds of arms licenses. Director General National Counter-terrorism Authority (NACTA) sought a separate in-camera briefing on the law and order situation of the country saying the matter was sensitive in nature.\nThe DG informed the committee, "Total 8956 Chinese were working in Pakistan in various developments projects and 12,596 personnel had been deployed to provide them security." The security personnel include army, Frontier Corps, Frontier Constabulary, Rangers, police and private security guards. He said that the government was trying to revamp the security model to provide standard security to the foreigners including Chinese. He said that Gilgit Baltistan Scouts, a paramilitary force, had recruited 1530 for security of under construction Pak-China corridor. "An additional wing of GB Scouts was being raised for the security project of Diamir Basha Dam," he added.\nHamid Khan, Additional Secretary gave a different version said, "After going through the record of IBMS (Integrated Border Management System), the ministry has ascertained that 16000 Chinese were working in Pakistan and 9400 were working in the development projects."\nHe said that security was being provided to the Chinese under the special instructions of Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif and army was involved in it. He said army and other law enforcement agencies were providing inner cordon security of Chinese and private security companies were providing out cordon security.\nChairman Committee Senator Talha Mahmood put a question before the ministry that what security steps the government had taken for the security of Chinese who were involved in 100 billion dollars Pak-China Economic Corridor project.\nThe committee took serious notice over what the Ministry of Interior had given wrong information to the Prime Minister office over the issue of boycott of the committee by the officers of the ministry and the minister of interior himself. A member asked to take action against Minister of Interior Chaudhry Nisar Ali Khan under the rules and proposed that the PM should be written for action against the minister.\nThe committee asked the FIA to give the report on the law and order situation of Sust Dry Port, located in GB, and what illegal activities were going on there as Chinese were involved in the project.\n\n[/FONT][/COLOR]', ''),

What is the difference between the expensive ones and the cheap ones?The Walkera Super CP caught my attention. I like the transmitter and the spare parts and batteries it comes with. What do you think?[/QUOTE]Nope. Nope. NO.ill correct your...misbehavour first then ill answer your Qs. one by one..\n\n Get that silly head out of the 3D helo section boy. Those are another way of saying CP helicopter. imagine.... your helo is a ball, placed on the top of slightly curved bowl, that is inverted. Or a plate with a curved bottom. ANY input be it enviromental or your input will make the ball go off in one direction. So to do anything at all, you have to constantly correct your own inputs; let it go off too far on one side, and your copter inverts and poof. Its freakishly hard. Ive been playing video games and am used to analoge controllers, been playing with them ever since i was six, for no less then 4-5 hours a day. And even i consider it to be a hard task. So behave and follow the guidelines; Your wallet will thank me later.\n\n In electric copters, the 100-200-300 etc etc refers to the rough dia of the rotor blades. I.E, the blades on a 450 trex are 450mm, or 45 cm in diameter ( from the tip of one to the tip of another ) The bigger you go, the more payload capacity if you want to get into aerial photography, drone work etc, or if you wanna stunt, the bigger it is the more "hang time" you get due to inertia to make input movements when changing direction or doing stunts. however, i must stress, these are not toys, and even if people think it is a toy, just pack up and leave. Do it for your own sake. Speaking in terms of your conscience and legally. A 450 size copter can take off a wrist if given the chance and the right circumstance, and a 700 size, well, a trex 700 recently decapitated a teenager in europe ( and thats not even the largest size available today, the trex 800 just came out) . Just google it. imagine the legal hell if some idiot kid came and tried to screw with you during flight?\n\nthe super CP is a money dump. Thats a full fledged hobby copter, which is a CP ( collective pitch ) helo. Way above your skill level.Even with all the spares, with you experience itll be in the garbage by nightfall.  Pick up a walkera super FP or a hobbyking FP 100. make sure to buy spare blades, tail booms, a tail motor+ wires and landing skids, along with a extra canopy if you want, those parts will be the first to go in a crash.\n\n But flying a FP copter is not hard. its just slightly more difficult then a toy coaxial. the purpose of this is not to make you feel how a cp helo is like, only to make you familiar with the added dimensions of control. provided you fly......3-6 times a day, youll be prepped after a week. Hand it off to some kid as a present when your done.\n\n Now onto your Qs. Expensive and cheap....itll be a while till you get a actual feel for it, but ill explain as best i can. All of the hobbyking stuff is china made. Its not made to handle serious stuff, but can get you started. Aside from the RTF stuff ( good-ish, will get you started cheaply and without hiccups ), if you make a copter out of a kit from HK, there will be some obvious quality issues. sometimes a main shaft wont align properly, or maybe some other small issue. This wont make it completely useless, but you will have to retrofit and modify some to get it all to work, but it will not function as well as something from a real company.\n\n Imagine it like a car made from scrap parts, that were all new. Some retrofitting is required, some work and modification, and it works, but with the occasional hiccup or issue that you wouldent face in a properly set up, and manufactured machine. Thats only talking about HK parts. pretty much everything there in the helo section is their own china stuff, or stuff they are reselling.\n\n But lets say you say **** HK, i want something nice. you pay 100 bucks more, and pick up a helo from a company like ( the popular and good quality ones are here= align( its the samsung of the helo world. Parts available everywhere and sold everywhere; quality is good, and sells for quite a bit less then the rest. They make the T-rex line of copters.), thunder tiger( main dominion is nitro helis and in asia only. Has a almost no foothold in Europe/N.america, walkera ( Namerica only) , blade, ( Nmerica only ) , and finally, SAB ( german company, operates in EU and Nmerica only, very high quality stuff, very expensive, very good looking. )\n\n After that the if you want to go higher you have to build your own custom setup, buying the frame;etc everything seperate. The real performance/specialized machines are made here, for extreme stunts, for scale models of real copters, and for aerial photo/video.That should be descriptive enough.\n\n If you refuse, to go the FP route, you can go directly to a sim ( go for it, you have unlimited tries so WTH do it. ) itll save you the 100 or so on a fp, as you can load FP models into it. I know 100-something CDN is alot for software, but its worth it. I swear to god, DONT SKIP buying a sim. If you do, you will end up leaving the hobby broke, disheartened, and with a broken helicopter. There was a guy like you who bought a CP copter and tried to fly it, he wrote his story on rcpak, and after no less then 15 seconds, he lost his 50k investment. You dont NEED it, as many people have learned without it, but through much wasted money, trial and error. But technology is making your life easier. Go for it. A moderately beefy computer is needed.\n\nIn sims, the best 3 are widely considered to be Realflight, phoenix flight and Heli-X. If you need a Transmitter for it, pick up a specktrum dx6i if the sim supports it, or just buy their own USB custom transmitter for the sim. .( make sure its genuine, there was a thing lately about fake dx6is selling ) Later on, you can buy the BNF ( bind and fly ) version of your helicopter.\n\nHK transmitters with much more channels and value for money are available but they are not compatible or as reliable ( its downright hell to make it work. Believe me, ive tried) Any more Qs, just post em here, but if you want a faster reply, just email me. [EMAIL="ch2shahid@gmail.com"]ch2shahid@gmail.com[/EMAIL]', ''),

Soon the market will be flooded like the other chinese pistols. There will be imports from eastern europe as well as russia but a lesser amount, still their price will also go down. The american ARs will also arrive but will be 3 times more expensive than these ones. Does all this sound familiar? You are probably right in thinking that. The same thing has happened with pistols, since there is no bar on import, the chinese ones are cheap due to availability, Czech and eastern european brands are slightly more expensive whilst the european and american pistols are sky high.

(622405, ' Allow me to dispel doubts and concerns mentioned by some users. As far as safety goes the camera angles are such that the distances are not representative - I can assure you not one dangerous shot was fired in the course of these hunts. Additionally with regards to ducking I suggest people read up on UK driven game and how often ducking takes place there - it is a fact of driven shooting. \nI would also like to say that it shows rather poor sportsmanship on part of some members to immediately pickup on perceived negatives of these fantastic redleg partridge hunts that have been happening with great success in sindh. I say perceived negatives because it is a fact that these birds fly very fast, high and strong and are more of a challenge than our local wild francolin. It is a great shame that not one person here has commented on the fact that this long overdue endeavor is finally taking place in Pakistan and that every reared bird shot goes a long way in saving our valuable wild birds. \nI would also like to add that the esteemed hunters who have shot these birds over the last three years have been Pakistan no.1 skeet and trap shooters, including people like Ahmed Sultan, Zulfiqar Hakim, Mirza Babur Baig, Amin Karamat are just a few of these and most are members of this fantastic forum where outdoorsmen and gun enthusiasts can meet and exchange views - hopefully without prejudice. Without exception all the above sportsmen, who have represented Pakistan on the international level, have been pleased and delighted to shoot redlegs and have welcomed this new and challenging game to the Pakistan hunting scene. Certainly if shooters of such caliber enjoy this game it is good enough for most marksmen. \nHaving said all the above i will say that this game is certainly not for everyone and is expensive, especially when booking a premium estate for driven hunting - simply put everybody cannot shoot redlegs. There simply arent enough of them and not everyone can afford them. However it is a great kudos to the rearers and people who have taken a great risk to create this breeding program successfully that the prices at which redlegs are being shot in Pakistan are half that of international prices and the interest being faced from foreign hunters on seeing these prices is immense. \nAll in all we can be proud that Pakistan now has this option for the discerning hunter who appreciates the art of shooting extremely fast and high driven game at high volumes. Like it or not, redlegs and other reared game are here to stay and very much the future of winged game in this country. The rate at which most are demolishing wild game with no regard to conservation of habitat pretty much ensures that reared game will be essential going forward. \n\nCheers.', ''),

(622407, ' Also it is worth adding that these birds are available for purchase from APF Gamebirds in Sindh at Rs. 2000 a bird and they come packed five to a box ready for transport. Many people purchase them from APF Farms and transport them to a venue of their own choosing and release them to hunt. Many thousands of birds have been sold in this manner and those who have purchased, transported and released redleg partridge have been delighted with the results. \r\nMany farmers in Sindh are now purchasing these birds for either commercial hunts that they sell or to invite guests, and it has resulted in a resurgence of shooting in sindh where stocks of wild birds are harder and harder to maintain. The situation of wild francolin being even worse in Punjab and KPK, it is logical to see almost half the hunters who grace these shoots travel to sindh from upcountry and have a great time shooting high volume driven game. \r\nWhats left to do but to try it?

(622464, ' [QUOTE=Ashes;460224]1911s are known to be high maintenance guns (like most things American, in terms of engineering..) ;)[/QUOTE]\nThat''s a pretty accurate statement. 1911''s are generally not the best choice for beginners or people who just want to shoot their guns and not have to work on them. It is gorgeous, IMO, but keep in mind the design is over a century old and auto loading pistols have come a long way since then. It''s single action only, so for SD, that means having to manipulate a safety, rack the slide, or cock the hammer; processes you can do without in a high stress situation. The single action trigger does make it a delight to shoot however. Yet as a range gun that''s actually going to be used ( instead of just sitting around waiting for an emergency ), it also has to be maintained, and without a doubt the 1911 is one of the most cumbersome handguns to field strip. Although it does makes up for that by being relatively easy to detail strip ( still not as easy as a Glock), and be prepared to be doing that a lot if you want it to function perfectly, 100 % of the time. For a flawless 1911, you will have to work for it. Nothing major, but things like the slide not locking back, tuning extractors, breaking extractors, replacing extractors, tightening barrel lug fitment for accuracy, refitting slide to frame, ammo sensitivity, having to adjust new parts to fit (you [I]will[/I] break parts), and worn out magazines ( I have more worn out 1911 mags than any other type - have yet to wear out a Glock mag). If you use a 1911 for any amount of time,  I can guarantee you will experience at least one of those situations. Don''t get me wrong now,  I''m not trying to turn you off them, I keep several at a time and they''re my favorite guns. But the truth is, they aren''t for everybody. Think of it like a beautiful woman that has to have everything her way before she gives you what [I]you[/I] want... it takes a certain type of guy to tame her, some don''t even want to bother, and others would rather just admire from a safe distance :lol:', ''),

(622507, ' Yes, it is expensive. However right now in UK, France, portugal and spain these birds are between 35-50Euros per bird shot. We have managed to sell them at Rs.2000-2500 from our farm and at about 3000-3500 a bird shot at shoots. This comes to 20-25Euros which is substantially cheaper. Additionally one does not incur the cost of travelling to expensive foreign locations, board, lodge etc. Finally a huge difference is that abroad you may shoot 100 to your gun in a day but you get to take home only 2 birds!! In our shoots in Pakistan hunters take home all they shoot, and shoot them at half the international price in their home country without having to travel abroad. When one sees all these facts one realizes how lucky we are to have such an opportunity finally available to hunters in Pakistan. We are very lucky. The culture in Pakistan really involves hunting for free...a concept which is unsustainable. Without hunters paying for hunting how can farmers manage for wildlife? Keeping wildlife is expensive and doing a rakh involves chowkidars to prevent netting, poaching, it involves keeping forests and scrubland which could be agriculture. Unless there is an economic incentive to keep wildlife habitat in the form of commerical hunting all our game will disappear..as we have seen it do over the years. Gamebird breeding is a ray of hope for Pakistan as well, and hunters who support it are playing a real role in conservation. The resistence to commercial hunting is mainly from those who have the free hunting aspect so firmly embedded that they feel threatened by the idea of actually paying for hunting. After all we spend alot on guns, cars, fuel, hunting kit and so on.....why not spend on the actual hunting to support farmers who wish to conserve game and people who wish to breed game for hunters. This project has no govt support and is a private endeavour which is purely for hunters...if we lose this project we lose the best chance to save local francolin as well.', ''),

All the auto pistols ive played with make you do insane hand gymnastics to do anything at all. Plus add in the fact that the magazine, of all of them were clearly designed by a mentally...deficit person. I mean really? instead of pushing down we have to push at a angle with the rim of the case first, then hope it dosent slip, then push down, then push it forward into the mag. Heavens forbid that you have to load more then one round...the spring gets harder to push down, alongside the fact that you have to push down on the already inserted bullet with a new bullet, which is a very...annoying task as the brass and copper keep slipping. \n\nIn the end ive managed to get them in somewhat reliably, by using the rim of the new bullet and putting it on top of the already inserted bullet, then push down with the joint of the thumb holding the bullet ( rest of hand is holding mag), then slide it in with another hand. This results in loading a bullet at a time, reliably, but it requires enough force that your hand muscles start to shake from the unusual load you''ve put upon them. \n\nMagazine loader contraptions for everyone i guess.', ''),

(622714, 'Our society''s attitude towards armed defence; Our society''s attitude towards armed defence; Asalam Alaikum brothers. I am writing this blog \n\nafter thinking for some weeks about the \n\ndifficulties an ordinary Pakistani faces in \n\ngetting an arms license through legal means, the \n\ncurrent ban on new arms licenses and the ban \n\nimposed by the government of Sindh on carrying \n\nweapons. Reading the posts on this forum, I \n\nfound that everyone, like myself, is criticizing \n\nthe government for it''s anti-gun policies.\n\n    But, since the last few days, something \n\nhas come to my mind which I didn''t think about \n\nbefore and it hasn''t been discussed about much \n\non the forum as well. And that is: while the \n\ngovernment is fully responsible for these anti-\n\ngun policies, our society also isn''t playing \n\nit''s positive part. And by society, I mean the \n\nmiddle-class living in the cities. Because,the \n\npeople living in the rural areas mostly have \n\nillegal weapons and they don''t care about the \n\nrules. The rich people have the money and \n\ncontacts so they also don''t face much problem. \n\nThe poor people are not interested much in \n\nbuying weapons because they don''t have much \n\nmoney and property to protect from the \n\ncriminals. So, it is basically the middle class \n\nin the city which is suffering the most from the \n\nlawlessness. But, amazingly, many of these \n\npeople are not ready to accept the idea of \n\nkeeping weapons for private defence. People say \n\nthings like:"''It''s better to give away whatever \n\nthe robbers ask for, nothing is valuable than \n\nyour life" etc. Those believing in carrying a \n\nweapon outside the home are even less in number, \n\na small minority, and we the members of this \n\nforum belong to this small minority.Even when \n\nthere was no section 144 imposed in Sindh, only \n\na few people carried a weapon, inspite of the \n\ntotal breakdown of law and order. And this thing \n\nencouraged the government to impose this ban. \n\nThen, there are different organizations calling \n\nfor an immediate ban on licensed and unlicensed \n\nweapons in the country and especially in \n\nKarachi. Those living in Karachi must have seen \n\na painting at many places in the city which \n\nshows a person throwing a gun into a dustbin. \n\nMany of my relatives and acquaintances also \n\nbelieve in this unrealistic and illogical slogan \n\nof deweaponisation. I call it unrealistic \n\nbecause the government is least interested in \n\nacting against illegal weapons, and illogical \n\nbecause we have the tribal areas in our country \n\nwhere the Pakistani law doesn''t even apply.\n    \n    So the question is, what needs to be \n\ndone. The answer is: pressurising the government \n\nand persuading the people. To pressurise the \n\ngovernment, we need to write letters in the \n\nnewspapers and send e-mails and letters to the \n\nauthorities. I know there is little chance of \n\nour leeters and mails bringing about any change \n\nbut something is better than nothing. For the 4 \n\nyearold ban on carrying arms in Sindh, a \n\npetition may be filed in the Sindh high court, \n\nbecause defending one''s body and property is a \n\nright given by the Pakistani law. I am a student \n\nbut I am ready to contribute what I can for this \n\ncause.\n    For persuading the people, we need to \n\ndiscuss it with our family, relatives, friends, \n\nacquaintances, relatives etc. If somebody is not \n\nready to carry a weapon, try to convince him to \n\nkeep one at home. Most of the people will laugh \n\nat you when you tell them about armed defence, \n\nbut even if one person changes his mind because \n\nof you, you are successful.\n\n    There are more things to write but it \n\nwould become too long. Awaiting your response \n\nbefore I write the next blog', 'Our society''s attitude towards armed defence'),

(622725, 'birthday shoot A couple of days ago I managed to get to the range to shoot my Remington Model 8.  It was the rifle''s 100th birthday; it was made in August of 1914.  I was a few weeks late, but hey, over the course of a century, what''s a few weeks?\n\n It was the first time I got to shoot it, and I''m pleased to say it functioned flawlessly.\n\n The Model 8 was designed by John Moses Browning, the same Browning who designed the 1911, and other automatics, various lever-action rifles, various shotguns, the BAR, and the Model 1917 and 1919 machine guns.  Unlike those, the Model 8 is almost unknown.\n\n It''s a light carbine with a fixed 5-round magazine.  The action is the "long recoil" type, quite rare for rifles, with the reaction spring wrapping the barrel and covered by a sheet metal tube that gives the rifle a slightly odd "bull barrel" look.\n\n The rifle was first produced in 1900 by FN in Belgium, then in 1908 Remington started producing them in the USA.  They came in four calibers - a .25, .30, and .32 that were the same case, just necked differently, and a larger case, the .35.  All were called "Remington" cartridges here, though they were Browning designs first made in Europe... that''s how marketing works.  Later the .300 Savage was added.  Mine is in .30 Remington.  All of the small-case (.25, .30, .32) ammunition is very rare niche-market stuff; Remington doesn''t make it any more, and brass is hard to find.  I have empty brass and loading dies, so I''ll be loading my own.  The box of loaded ammunition I bought off the internet cost about US$3.00 per shot.\n\n One peculiarity of the Model 8 is that it''s a take-down design.  The "sling swivel" on the forearm is actually the retaining screw.  Remove the forearm and there''s a short lever attached to the receiver.  Unscrew that, and the whole barrel assembly and front trunnion slide out.  At one time there were several companies making leather carry cases, much like the old tubular military map cases, for the Model 8.\n\n The take-down feature is *really* nice, particularly where I live, where it''s not a good idea to let the neighbors know there are stealable items in your home when you''re not there.  Rifle-shaped objects are difficult to get to the car without attracting attention.  This time, I unscrewed the barrel and put the two halves of the rifle in a small cardboard box tucked under my arm.  Everyone at the range thought I had a pistol in there, and they were astonished when I took the parts out and reassembled the rifle...\n\n I''ve been a gunhead for almost 40 years, and I''d never seen a picture of a Model 8 or even heard about one before I first saw one online last year.  Not one magazine, not one book, not one web page.  They''re not *that* rare, but somehow I''d never encountered even the slightest mention of one.  But when I saw it, it was DO WANT!\n\n Oh, the friend I was shooting with had brought his Winchester levergun, which was also a Browning design... he liked the Model 8 better after I let him shoot it!\n\n[url]http://www.forgottenweapons.com/remington-model-8-video/[/url]\n[url]http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remington_Model_8[/url]\n[url]http://thegreatmodel8.remingtonsociety.com/[/url]\n[url]http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XsQXksP-YhI[/url]', ''),

It is removable as a unit, and most importantly, it bears the serial number. What that means is that technically, that one component is "the gun". The purpose being, you can have different frames and barrel/slide combinations in just one gun. That feature is actually quite convenient in Pakistan, where each individual firearm requires it''s own license. So with one license, you can have a sub compact when you need to carry, to a full frame when you go to the range, just by switching accessories.

As many as 49 fake NOCs were  issued.  \nThe panel was told that 80 per cent of the bulletproof  vehicles were imported. Eight local companies were in the business of  bulletproofing vehicles in Pakistan and they are required to obtain NOC  from the interior ministry.\nThe members of the panel were, however, surprised to know that there was no proper law on bulletproofing of vehicles.\nThe  committee was informed that there were 8,956 Chinese working in  Pakistan and the number of security personnel guarding them was 12,596.\nAs  many as 1,530 security personnel had recently been recruited to provide  foolproof security to the Chinese working on Diamer Bhasha dam.\nIt  was decided that the National Counterterrorism Authority (Nacta) will  give an in-camera briefing to the committee on the security of Chinese  residing in Pakistan. \nTwo members of the committee, Aijaz Ahmad  Dhamra and Fateh Mohammad Hasni, took strong exception to the absence of  Interior Minister Nisar Ali Khan from the meeting.\nThey demanded  the chair to ask Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif to take action against  Interior Minister Chaudhry Nisar Ali Khan for his undeclared boycott of  the committee proceedings.\nTalha Mehmood said a letter to this effect had already been written to the prime minister.\nHe  said the ministry had informed the prime minister that the panel met  six to seven times a month and thus it is not possible for the minister  to attend its meetings. \n[I]Published in Dawn, September 26th, 2014[/I][/QUOTE]\nMaybe the senators  need to understand that these are the official licenses that KP is issuing!

(622986, ' [QUOTE=czman;460461]ehhhh? My experience ( very little. Imagine a infant with a gun ) \nled  me to believe the only good mags are...revolvers. All the auto pistols ive played with make you do insane hand gymnastics to do anything at all. Plus add in the fact that the magazine, of all of them were clearly designed by a mentally...deficit person. I mean really? instead of pushing down we have to push at a angle with the rim of the case first, then hope it dosent slip, then push down, then push it forward into the mag. Heavens forbid that you have to load more then one round...the spring gets harder to push down, alongside the fact that you have to push down on the already inserted bullet with a new bullet, which is a very...annoying task as the brass and copper keep slipping. \n\nIn the end ive managed to get them in somewhat reliably, by using the rim of the new bullet and putting it on top of the already inserted bullet, then push down with the joint of the thumb holding the bullet ( rest of hand is holding mag), then slide it in with another hand. This results in loading a bullet at a time, reliably, but it requires enough force that your hand muscles start to shake from the unusual load you''ve put upon them. \n\nMagazine loader contraptions for everyone i guess.[/QUOTE]\nI totally understand where you''re coming from. If you do it more often, it will get easier and less painful as you begin to form calluses on your thumbs. The best technique is to grip the magazine in a fist, push down on the base of the top cartridge with the thumb of the hand holding the mag (it helps to rest the mag on a bench, or any hard surface), then with your other thumb holding the next cartridge parallel (don''t use the edge to avoid slipping and denting the top cartridge), push down on the front of the top cartridge, and slide it in. Nonetheless, no matter how long you''ve been doing it (and I''ve been jamming mags for as long as I can remember) everyone will appreciate how much time and effort a mag loader saves. They really make the task infinitely easier and if you want one, my favourite is the UpLula Universal Magazine Loader.', ''),

I know of KPK, I just filled form, made an affidavit, had it marked to local Police Station from DPO office and then the local Police Station did clearance without any issue (the muharrir did know me personally due to being local). But I don''t think it would have been an issue for even if he did not know me because the Police Station keeps record, if I had a record with problems, they would write that. After that it was submitted to license branch with deposit fee slip and I got it after a few weeks from license office. No agents involved.\n\nI think the Government needs to make these things proper legal, allow license, involve NADRA as well, we do already have state of the art system in place for issuing CNIC/Passports (and now SIMs) so why not arms license? and we as a nation NEED to make a vow that we will not use "agents" for shortcuts/bribes in order to get something fast.\n\nI was surprised to read a blog a year or so ago where the person had mentioned how they had to go through a lot of khuwari in order to make a passport in Islamabad due to rush after which they went through "agent", he took enough fee but it was done for him then. Thank God we back in KPK did not have to do this from the beginning, you do everything yourself there. I did not hear of "agents" for this purpose until I moved.

(623203, ' I love it. Don''t own one... yet, but I''ve researched them, fired 100 rds through one, and intend to pick one up in the future. The earlier ones had some issues with feeding and ejecting but changes were made later on that solved most of the issues. It has a relatively light trigger amd is very easy to shoot, or more importantly, it''s easy to shoot accurately. As it''s name implies, it can hold upto 30rds, but that''s only if you get the full capacity mags. There are 10rd mags to comply with various state and Canadian laws. It is incredibly light, even when fully loaded, but thats partly due to the 22magnum ammunition. One thing for certain, its one of those guns you have to shoot to appreciate. Because there are a lot of plastic parts, first impressions probably won''t be of sturdiness and quality. But shoot it, and you''ll love it, at least i did. Some people compare the 22WMR to the 5.7x28, but IMO its apples and oranges. Yes they''ll both push a 30gr bullet to over 2000fps, but the 5.7 can do it out of a pistol whereas you''ll need a rifle with at least 20" of barrel to achieve those velocities with a 22WMR. Another issue is the reliability of rim fire cartridges, but the magnums are usually of much higher quality than regular lr''s. Its not to say they''re always perfect, but for 22WMR, I only use CCI and I don''t recall ever having an ignition problem. Im not much of a Keltec fan, but overall I like the PMR. Even in USA/CDA, they can be hard to come by and go for anywhere from $350 to as much as $600. I understand the Pak market demands a higher price, but I wouldn''t pay over 100,000pkr, it''s unique but it''s not [I]that[/I] good.', ''),

Only P01 is chrome lined, to be NATO certified.\n\nNone of the TT''s are chrome lined, not even Zastava M57.\n\n cancer_doc ... if chrome lined barrel is a must have, then you''ve further narrowed down available choices for shashka gun.[/QUOTE]\nI agree with all of the above. Even Glock and most Sig barrels are not chrome lined. The military uses it because when they shoot, its mostly at a high rate of fire and for extended periods. Under those conditions it makes a significant contribution to barrel life, and thats with high pressure rifle ammo. With civillians and their pistols, internet rhetoric is the only thing chrome lining, or lack therof, is really good for.\n[QUOTE=cancer_doc;461016]I never knew about it until now. I am not against non chrome lined barrels they are even more accurate but have shorter half life and need extra barrel care after a shooting session, particularly making it difficult to remove lead residues trapped inside of rifling grooves.\n\nStill in favor of chrome lined TT vs non chrome lined TT ( or any other weapon including PT92 ).\n\nIf I knew PT92 is non chrome lined I would have never purchased it in the first place.\n\nRegards[/QUOTE]\nThere''s nothing wrong if it makes you feel better, but I would never let the lining stop me from getting a gun I like. Besides, how often do you really shoot lead out of a semi auto? Most commercial pistol ammo is fmj, so if that''s all you shoot, you''ll never have to worry about "lead residue trapped inside of rifling grooves" anyways.', ''),

I trust no mechanic out here to clean it for me and its my only jewel(other than my TT). GUIDE ME PLZ :sick::help:[/QUOTE]\n\nMohsin brother\n\nI hope experts will answer you soon... However, IMO as you said its simple dust... (which means its dry particles)... then if you use any liquid on the gun... it will make a mixture of dust and liquid...which will stick to the parts... and it will be very hard to remove that specially in tight and small holes and areas...\n\nSo my advise will be to first clean the gun with dry cloth as much as you, then use pressurised/compressed air. Strat from one end and blow away the dust towards other end...also you can take out dust from small holes and parts by putting the nozzle on one end and let the dust blow out from the other side or opening...\n\nEasy way to do this is getting a blower or if not available then go to any tire shop (Puncture/air filling) shop, they have compressed air amd you can easily blow out all the dirt very conveniently and quickly.\n\n\nPlese note that you may need to dissemble your gun first. So take parts with you for better cleaning. .. once all the dust is blown off... then you may use oil or any other liquid for regular cleaning.\n\nIn Sha Allah it will work.\n\n\nRegards', ''),

However, most states require you to have your legal residence within their borders for 30 days before state laws apply to you.  Most firearms laws in the USA are state laws.\n\n A number of states - mine is one - specifically extend the right to carry to any non-citizen, regardless of visa type, as long as they''re lawfully in the USA.  I think most of them still require that you live there for 30 days, but you''d have to check.\n\n Theoretically all states must now allow carrying guns, but this ranges from "Constitutional carry" (no paperwork at all) to "ha ha ha, you''ll never get a licence unless you know somebody."  But we''re working on that, a little bit at a time...\n\n In practice, I think the USA and Pakistan are very similar; Federal law, then the states/provinces do as they please, and then a bunch of local laws and special cases to grab you when you least expect it.', ''),

No offence and my apologies to all if it hurts anyone its very easy to shoot at cardboard targets cause they don''t return any fire but out and about in practical life it stretches out land under your feet if god forbid you have to shoot at any human being . Have used almost every sort of weapons during my service period and trust me brother i still get nightmares about those days keep praying to god to please forgive me for my sins as whatever happened in past was not intentional part of life and duty many of our friends who keep giving long arguments i bet have not even fired that weapon ever so just forget about it and carry on my dear life is too small for happiness how come we get time for all these things enjoy pray to god and thank almighty to keep you and your loved one safe its really hard to live with the memories of your precious moments and people whom you always wanted to be there with you to share .

(623439, ' [QUOTE=Verve;454691].22LR is a very nasty little round, and in ''close range'' it can cause real havoc in the body as the bullet doesn''t stay just behind the entry point. It ricochets inside the body violently damaging tissue and anything soft that comes in it''s way, in the case of non-hollow points. It is nightmare for surgeons to operate to [B]get the bullet out [/B]because the bullet pattern after entering the body is nothing like 9mm or other more conventional pistol calibers.[/QUOTE]\n\nWith due respect Sir, bullet is never attempted to be taken out of the body, it only happens in movies. As a matter of fact Surgeons in ER explore the abdomen or chest ( whatever the site of injury is ) to fix the damage done by the bullet.\n\nAs far as the bullet is concerned no need to worry about it as when it was fired it was of very high temperature making it sterilized and will not do any harm to the body if left unattempted to recover. Attempting to just remove bullet without very obvious indication will do definitely more harm than good. \n\nYes there are few indications where after proper investigations ( but NEVER an MRI due to missile effect/phenomenon ) and consultations it may be removed. And also if exploring the wound created by bullet Surgeon encounters a bullet in the area of injury and the bullet is not wedged in a vital area.....yes then ofcourse it will be taken out.\n\nRegards', ''),

So, as soon as I got 2 weeks vacations, my favorite nearby retreat was UAE which hosts a number of Shooting Clubs including Sharjah Golf & Shooting, Jebel Ali Golf & Shooting Club, Caracal Shooting Facility in Abu Dhabi and Al Forsan Shooting Ranges. Yesterday I visited Rifle Range at Al Forsan International Sports Resort, Abu Dhabi. They have a pistol range with Glock, Beretta & Sig in 9mm caliber and others in .22 & 38 and Skeet & Trap ranges as well. They also have a 300 meter rifle range with 4 lanes. They have rifles chambered in 223, 308 & 338 WinMag. Cost for 10 rounds in 308 is AED 230. As I had one plus one coupon fom entertainer book, I was allowed to fire 20 rounds. There is another discount option, if one has bought Groupon deal 24 hours before, a discounted rate for 9mm is AED 120 including AED 55 entry fee and 30 shots allowance. There is 300 meter rifle range with LOMAH system from Theissen Training. LOMAH acoustic sensors measure the exact position of supersonic rounds as they pass the sensors and are effective with both single shots and bursts from automatic weapons.\r\n\r\nAlthough on website they mentioned they have Browning BAR rifles in 30-06 but it happened to be Winchester 308 rifles in 308 and no 30-06. They also have Blaser LR2 in 223 and Browning BAR in 338 WinMag.\r\n\r\nMy rifle was scoped with Zeiss Victory FL with Rapid-Z 7 recticle.

Could you please elaborate on how the "extensions" are attached. If it actually extends the rifling, something like that really isn''t practical. Even suppressors (which do not contact with the bullet) can throw off a gun''s point of impact. There are a lot of issues with something like a 2 piece barrel. First off, both sections must line up straight. Then the lands and grooves of the rifling must match up where the two pieces come together. Such a setup would also have a very poor harmonic pattern (the natural frequency at which the barrel vibrates/flexes) which would be difficult to tune out. Then there is the issue of heat. If the two pieces heat up/cool down at different rates, there is a potential that one end of the barrel would behave in a different manner than the other end. Add to that the manner in which the two pieces are joined. If they thread together like a suppressor, then you have to consistently make sure that they''re on tight, like a suppressor. Not a big deal if a suppressor comes a little loose, but with an actual "barrel extension", if one piece backs out by a fraction of a turn, the rifling then becomes totally misaligned. \n\n Anyways, that''s why you don''t see two piece barrels. But if what we''re talking is something like a barrel shroud, or fake barrel (that does not touch the bullet), then I understand the styling exercise... a lot of guys like to attach accessories like fake suppressors, just for the look.', ''),

Designs are completely different. And one thing I can say with confidence is that Walther P22Q mag requires a much higher precision engineering than any 9mm/.45/30 etc mags. It is hardened steel that is ultra thin compared to any other mag out there, and not easy and cheap to clone as costing has been carried out already. \n\n22lr pistols are ammo sensitive yes but s&b @ 20rs and all cci 27rs upwards (not difficult at all to get large quantities in Pk if one looks around) work flawlessly in every single P22 I''ve seen. P22Q specifically has a beefed up slide that ironed out early model P22 issues. I modified the feed ramp on my P22Q whereas a friend hasn''t touched it and has yet to experience any fte ftf with s&b and cci. As I said before, Game shock and Standard Eley dont do well in them. On the other hand, in rifles, you''ll find that Ruger 10/22 rifle (probably the best 22 rifle there is) gives fte/ftf issues with same s&b ammo that P22 cycles without a hiccup!!! Ruger 10/22 cycles Standard Eley just fine too.\n\nAnd Walther PPK 22lr pistol is even better! 80k here for 2014 threaded barrel model. That''s one tempting pistol to buy but I''d rather spend than on getting more of 9mm and 22lr ammo.\n\nFeed the ammo that suites the 22lr pistol and rifle, and you won''t have issues. Magazines of reputable and well established 22lr weapons are not an issue. Using the wrong ammo is where problems start. I have not come across a single P22 with magazine related issues. Stick armscore 9mm hp in CZ75b or Omega and it will ftf. Does that CZ75b a crap gun with poorly designed mag? Whereas the cheaper P07 will eat all 9mm ammo.\n\nAs for revolvers, use moisture exposed 22lr ammo and they won''t fire. Yes, revolvers are more reliable but that''s in every caliber,  not just 22lr.\n\nAt 20rs for S&B 22lr bullet, I have no issues with owning a P22Q. I can fire a 100 rounds in an hour of S&B and not encounter any issues. And so can my friend with his much newer P22Q.', ''),

(623681, ' [QUOTE=Verve;461460]Doc sb, it is an unfair comparison to make between 22lr mag and 9mm mag. Designs are completely different. And one thing I can say with confidence is that Walther P22Q mag requires a much higher precision engineering than any 9mm/.45/30 etc mags. It is hardened steel that is ultra thin compared to any other mag out there, and not easy and cheap to clone as costing has been carried out already. \n\n22lr pistols are ammo sensitive yes but s&b @ 20rs and all cci 27rs upwards (not difficult at all to get large quantities in Pk if one looks around) work flawlessly in every single P22 I''ve seen. P22Q specifically has a beefed up slide that ironed out early model P22 issues. I modified the feed ramp on my P22Q whereas a friend hasn''t touched it and has yet to experience any fte ftf with s&b and cci. As I said before, Game shock and Standard Eley dont do well in them. On the other hand, in rifles, you''ll find that Ruger 10/22 rifle (probably the best 22 rifle there is) gives fte/ftf issues with same s&b ammo that P22 cycles without a hiccup!!! Ruger 10/22 cycles Standard Eley just fine too.\n\nAnd Walther PPK 22lr pistol is even better! 80k here for 2014 threaded barrel model. That''s one tempting pistol to buy but I''d rather spend than on getting more of 9mm and 22lr ammo.\n\nFeed the ammo that suites the 22lr pistol and rifle, and you won''t have issues. Magazines of reputable and well established 22lr weapons are not an issue. Using the wrong ammo is where problems start. I have not come across a single P22 with magazine related issues. Stick armscore 9mm hp in CZ75b or Omega and it will ftf. Does that CZ75b a crap gun with poorly designed mag? Whereas the cheaper P07 will eat all 9mm ammo.\n\nAs for revolvers, use moisture exposed 22lr ammo and they won''t fire. Yes, revolvers are more reliable but that''s in every caliber, not just 22lr.\n\nAt 20rs for S&B 22lr bullet, I have no issues with owning a P22Q. I can fire a 100 rounds in an hour of S&B and not encounter any issues. And so can my friend with his much newer P22Q.[/QUOTE]\n\nAgreed on all points, wanted a .22LR handgun lets see what fits better in hand Taurus Revolver or P22. But nowadays P22 is available at Baksh Elahi for 65K a bit on higher side. Sig mosquito is 50-55K. Will survey the market on Monday.\n\nRegards', ''),

Could you please elaborate on how the "extensions" are attached. If it actually extends the rifling, something like that really isn''t practical. Even suppressors (which do not contact with the bullet) can throw off a gun''s point of impact. [COLOR=#ff0000]There are a lot of issues with something like a 2 piece barrel. First off, both sections must line up straight. Then the lands and grooves of the rifling must match up where the two pieces come together.[/COLOR] Such a setup would also have a very poor harmonic pattern (the natural frequency at which the barrel vibrates/flexes) which would be difficult to tune out. Then there is the issue of heat. [COLOR=#ff0000]If the two pieces heat up/cool down at different rates, there is a potential that one end of the barrel would behave in a different manner than the other end. Add to that the manner in which the two pieces are joined.[/COLOR] If they thread together like a suppressor, then you have to consistently make sure that they''re on tight, like a suppressor. Not a big deal if a suppressor comes a little loose, but with an actual "barrel extension", if one piece backs out by a fraction of a turn, the rifling then becomes totally misaligned.

(623879, ' Thanks a lot Zia Raza, I think the price has come down on the MK3 as well last time I heard the price was 675k. InshAllah when I have the budget I will chose the MK3 over the CQA. Thanks again for quoting price. Also I think more are going to come in the coming 3,4 months. I contacted the authorised distributers for ProArms in Peshawar via E-mail and they said that there are sanctions on Pakistan laid down by America and allied countries and they don''t sell to dealers in bulk, a few people bring one or two rifles with them for personal use via private sale but thats about it and such pieces include BCM, LMT, La Rue and Bushmaster etc that don''t even see the light of day in Pak. So more and more eastern european and Chinese ARs will be coming in, in months to come. I think the price on the MK3 is also sure to go down, looking at a few reviews, checking out their website and also watching videos on youtube I have tilted more towards the MK3 it really looks like a well built rifle and its barrel is made by Walther, which certainly gives the barrel years and years of life. I think its a good bargain in a place like Pak. But the CQA is the best thing you can buy for a cheap PRICE, rather the best thing you can get for that price, but not the top in quality. But the build quality and finish of the MK3 seems to be visually better than the CQA. I hope to buy one soon and then one can compare.', ''),

And dont worry you need not to file multiple FIRs for every article/asset you lost. In one FIR, narrate whole incident and the things you lost in detail. Remember to mention Recognising/identifying numbers of your things. Like license number... car registration number, cnic number.. etc... and ensure that they are written correctly and properly in the FIR.\n\nNow as far as you never been to a Police Station,  well, its normally the case with majority of noble citizens... but dont worry, if you can go yourself then give it a try, (advise: take any family lawyer or elder with you preferably some one socially respectable and powerful), otherwise try to engage a lawyer and for registration of FIR. Although, its not primarily a lawyer''s role but he can assit you well and police will also not bother you much.\nFurther if police refused to register FIR (which unfortunately normally they do), then here comes the role of a lawyer. He can force them to register a FIR through court orders. Just remember 22A & B Cr.P.C. that will sort things out. In Sha Allah. But hopefully, things will not go this far and police will register a FIR.\n\nI pray that may you find all your lost items, peace of mind and may you not indulge in any further trouble and remain safe and secure for your entire life.

(623932, ' [QUOTE=Fudgepacker;461454]+1 again to MJ. Could you please elaborate on how the "extensions" are attached. If it actually extends the rifling, something like that really isn''t practical. Even suppressors (which do not contact with the bullet) can throw off a gun''s point of impact. There are a lot of issues with something like a 2 piece barrel. First off, both sections must line up straight. Then the lands and grooves of the rifling must match up where the two pieces come together. Such a setup would also have a very poor harmonic pattern (the natural frequency at which the barrel vibrates/flexes) which would be difficult to tune out. Then there is the issue of heat. If the two pieces heat up/cool down at different rates, there is a potential that one end of the barrel would behave in a different manner than the other end. Add to that the manner in which the two pieces are joined. If they thread together like a suppressor, then you have to consistently make sure that they''re on tight, like a suppressor. Not a big deal if a suppressor comes a little loose, but with an actual "barrel extension", if one piece backs out by a fraction of a turn, the rifling then becomes totally misaligned. \n\n Anyways, that''s why you don''t see two piece barrels. But if what we''re talking is something like a barrel shroud, or fake barrel (that does not touch the bullet), then I understand the styling exercise... a lot of guys like to attach accessories like fake suppressors, just for the look.[/QUOTE]\n\nMeh, tbh I don''t care about the looks. ( its a glock for heavens sake. One of the ugliest pistols known to man. If Minecraft had a gun in it, it''d look just like a full frame glock) \n\nIf its a carbine frame  attachment I would totally go for it. Pistols are capable of much more then the human hand can supply, especially on that grip. If it allowed rifle like wielding of the weapon,along with the proper pitcanny etc rails for optics, id get it in a jiffy. Hell, why even buy a nornico. 22lr m4 copy when you could get this? Plus the copy will not perform as well due to the reason below. \n\n\nBut FP, you failed to address one more concern with a extended barrel. You got my feelings on the matter spot on, but 9mm rounds ( more specifically, the gunpowder inside is of a fast burn type.) Due to the short barrel of 9mm weapons as much energy ASAP must be must be transferred to the bullet. So if you moved from a 5inch barrel to let''s say, 20 inch, all the gunpowder will have used itself up at the 5 inch point, and then the barrel would just be slowing down the bullet,resulting in reduced velocity and accuracy. Rifle rounds have comparativeky slower burning powder to keep pushing till the bullet is clear of the barrel. \n\nThis all wouldn''t be a problem if the barrel was purely cosmetic,as no bullet contact would be made.but as he said its a barrel extension,(hence makes bullet contact) plus with one with no rifiling, what i think is happening is bullet is fired, clears glock barrel well, and while passing through the...pipe  ( thats what it is pretty much) it gets slightly thrown off course, due to inherent 2 piece misallignment, then because of the extra friction , and now nonexistent push from the powder it starts to slow down, and at the same time completely loses its rotation,( the rifling effect is negated. ).\n\nSo your firing a now slower bullet, with less K.E and firing it through a smoothbore, so no accuracy either beyond a few dozen meters. ( assuming of course it hasn''t already been thrown completely off course due to the misalignment.', ''),

(624071, ' Bro congratulations on your purchase, I myself own a CZ P07 Duty and it also has a de-cocker. When you insert a loaded magazine into the gun and rack the slide to chamber a round, naturally the slide will cock the gun and take it into single action mode, meaning the hammer is cocked back and the trigger has become lighter and more responsive since the hammer has a lesser distance to travel now, which makes it dangerous to carry unless you have a safety on. The de-cocker brings the hammer forward changing the action from a single action trigger pull back to a double action trigger pull making the trigger heavier. It can also be done manually by squeezing the trigger and manually riding the hammer forward but the de-cocker just makes it safer and easier, hope that helps.

A local TT.Relesed the mag, playing with the bullets, one dropped into a pile of mud. Picked it up, washed it, and for good measure, attacked it with a bottle of brass polish. Here is the interesting bit. After the polishing the bullet was smoother and shinier then the rest. I put it all back in, and then proceded the rack the slide repeatedly. Unmolested/virgin/unadulterated bullets cycled fine, but every time that polished one came up, it jammed in the mechanism. This confused me because as per my knowledge bullets are not lubed, the lead itself lubes it. And even so a smoother round would cycle better, not worse. Online searching has led me nowhere but sites to buy shiny non functional bullets as jewelry. Also the bullet changed colour slightly, from a full golden/copper to slightly silverish. Maybe the dried polish residue is the issue? Since it was now useless i removed it from its casing with pliers ans threw both parts away. Still wondering what the issue could be.', ''),

Ameen.\n\nThanks zakir bro.\n\nDoktar and Doc (Ameer bro), I did write a detailed process but can''t find the page in this thread to ref to. \n\nYou''ll have to visit the SO Arms in Ministry of Interior building on Constitutional Avenue - he won''t entertain agents or didn''t then. Change of weapon was straight forward (broken/damaged/rusting weapon is a good reason), but change of Cal he resisted initially. Then he finally granted after I said I really had no utility of a 12g shotgun anymore, especially in ISB, and wanted a smaller .22lr pistol instead (change of cal was on one licence, from 12g to .22 pistol). It is all at the discretion of the SO.\n\nAfter he agrees, you write a hand written application to him with your licence numbers, weapon numbers etc and that you want change of weapon/cal etc that he signs. You give that signed letter to his office on same floor and they issue you an official letter with all your details giving the permission to sell your existing weapons to authorised arms dealers and buy permitted replacement cal weapons. Your file number will be on that letter. Make sure you visually verify that file number of the letter and the actual paper file is the same! Their filing system is ... well ... poor!\n\nOnce you''ve done the weapon changes at dealers, you take original dealer purchase and sale receipts (keep copies!) back to the same office and they issue a letter for you to submit to NADRA. This letter states your details, licence numbers and old and new weapon numbers and their respective cals. The letter is electronically submitted to Nadra by MOI. You take the letter to NADRA along with fresh pictures, fill up licence modification forms at the office, and pay 1500rs per licence modification fee and collect your token(s). They will punch your older card licences the same day. \n\nIn a week or 2 you''ll get the demand notices with 2 months validity (but NADRA will extend for one month but don''t risk it!!). Take them back to the dealers for the new weapons to be entered on them, and then to DCO for stamping (get the dco bit done by an agent, for 1k per DN). Once that is done, submit the completed DNs along with copies of purchase receipts to NADRA. 2 weeks or so for new licences to be ready for collection. Make sure you take punched licences, a copy of your CNIC and original tokens when collecting new licences. Modified licences will have ''AB'' followed by same number as punched.\n\nI''m not sure who the current SO is. Last info I had was that due to protests/dharnas etc change of weapons etc was all on halt. This is the process I went through. With MOI, anything change is possible. As usual, dealing with NADRA was straight forward as their SOPs are well defined. Go to G-10 (regional HQ) or Nadra CHQ if in ISB.\n\nHTH', ''),

(627021, ' Hi king,\n\nThanks for your thirst about 350 mag!\n\n350 magnum classic pro. is light, well balanced and sleek. Barrel weight serves as vibration dampener thus enhances precision and helps in cocking. I deliberately installed a solid state 4x32 hawke scope with no zoom and adjustable objective. Lesser the moving parts in scope more the resistance against recoil and light weight as well. 350 has smooth posterior and anterior recoils but its twisting recoil needs some research. Twisting recoil is generated due to unfolding when the main spring expands. Because 350 has longest spring so the unfolding is also aggressive leading to enhanced twisting torque that triggers a radial thrust in the gun which is entirely undesirable. I am doing some experiments to eliminate twisting torque out of a springer gun. If successful, the modification shall be proposed to the R&D sections of Diana, Weirauch, BSA and other top manufacturers. From heavy to light I use H&N baracuda match, FTT, Crosman hollow and dome, diana magnum and sport, defiant, milbro and gamo pro mag pellets. My 350 classic pro play good on crosman, FTT and even the cheaper gamo pro mag pellets. In addition to 350, I have a Diana 35, a vintage BSA under lever and a P1000. I use Combro chronoscope  to chrony my airguns.', ''),

They have been manufacturing quality firearms for quite sometime and are the best local manufacturers for shotguns. I have visited their production facility, located in Industrial Estate, Kohat Road, Peshawar, the factory is equipped with state of the art CNC machines and tools. \n\nWith the increasing popularity of their weapons and launch of Trushot 9mm pistol i think we need to have a separate club for DSA. :) \n\nI own a DSA pump action shotgun which was purchased from their factory, it has a very nice powder coated finish, accessory railing and side saddle for extra ammo.

As it is a clone and adding chokes and extra stuff is out of the question, the only thing attached to the barrel is the muzzle at the end. \n\nI would be a safer call to make, that prior to going for a hunt I should be checking its pattern from different distances with SG/LG shots.\n\nDoes anybody have an idea, can a local made clone fire a slug ?', ''),

(624830, ' [QUOTE=cancer_doc;459275]Very sad incident may God bless her soul.\n\nNeed to share something with my dear PG members. Please DO NOT KEEP WEAPON OR CARRY WEAPON with you or in the car even if you have 144 permit etc. it makes little difference to Police.\n\nI am Deputy Medical Superintendent at Mayo Hospital, Lahore and by grace of God in Grade 18 at age 34. I have evening duty from 2 PM to 8 PM with my home at 32 Km distance ( across the other site of city ). Those who live in Lahore and familiar with Engineer''s Town ( Further 5-6 Kms from Valancia ) can appreciate how dangerous is last 10 Km from Mayo to my home and by the time I reach that dangerous zone it is already past 9 PM. Main defence road has no lights two or three almost blind road curves with a fairly bad track record as far as the crime goes.\n\nUnder the above circumstances it is ''supposed must'' for me to have one good reliable handgun with one full extra loaded magazine with me in my car and I do have 6 handguns in my firearm cupboard. But very sad fact is I CAN''T carry it in the car. I can only carry it to the LRC firing range in daylight but not so is the case at odd time in the dark when it is really needed.\n\nNow, I tell you the reason why you should not carry weapon in car. Occasionally Police Pickets are there on the road usually after a recent crime and they definitely stop everybody and although they never searched my car ( uptil now, do not know about tomorrow ) but they definitely ask for Identity, reason of travelling at that odd time etc. the conventional police questions you all know and then they let me go. But if I do have weapon and is spotted by police it will definitely be confiscated by Police as they are blocking the road at recent crime scene. Well Recent Crime Scene and any person caught with a weapon...... you can do the maths....\n\nInspite of all your good Credentials, Gazetted Post & Position, Nobel Profession, ......... Police is Police and even a minor Police Sipahi can get you in the Jail with your precious weapon in police custody for many months and chances are you are never going to get it back and even after many months of Khawari and many many Safarish etc. they are never going to give you back your Glock or HK that is for sure they will hand you over 9mm Foriegn Made as stated on your license. Just take this hard fact it is a reality and you may have to spend few or many nights in custody if the recent crime was a murder.\n\nSo, last point on which some of Gentlemen will say\n "No you have to be alive to face Jail & Court so if your life is in sure danger shot the Bad Guy"\n\nIn fact you can call me Coward it''s okay but I would prefer to be killed by BG rather than facing Pakistan''s Court Kachahri System !!!!!!\n\nEvery system has improved in our country take it I.T. , Telecom etc. but Police Wala culture has never ended in this country and will never end.\n\nDo not attempt to do things which you see in Tactical response James Yearger or some other good Tactical firearm expert & trainer tells to do remember they are talking of ususally situations arising in USA mainly. No body has ever commented whether to carry or not in Lahore or Karachi.\n\nNow, not for fun but for real need I do need to carry weapon but I dont instead I started using 2010 model car ( Alto ) instead of any new ones and keep about 4-5 K cash in my wallet with no ATM card and all other cards colour copied ( including Government Gazetted Officer Card and Hospital Card ) . Basically the wallet contains only that reasonable cash that they might not shoot out of anger. Few Medical Books, White Medical Coat and a Stethoscope. \n\nHopefully and with 90% confidence I can say I am safe with these simple measures forget about rest of 10% as God is always there to protect all of us. But from this Police you have to protect yourself by not letting them a chance to have them give you a tough time.\n\nRegards[/QUOTE]\nVery Well said and totally agrees. Its much much easy to handle/shoot an intruder/dacoit than to face the police.', ''),

He asked do you have any FIR registered of an attack on your life. I said no. He said then there is a no permit for you. I asked that i need to carry my NPB weapon for security reasons and current law and order situation.

All pakistan permits are issued from MOI and provincial are issued by respective DC office.\n\n\nI inquired about carrying NPB while 144 is imposed. He said if the 144 notification states that Carrying is banned then you cannot carry, otherwise you can carry in concealed manner. In 144 general notification, permits for displayed carrying are suspended. In short he said carrying of NPB weapon is allowed in concealed manner only. For display/brandishing of weapon, permits are issued. And currently none are being issued from MOI and DC office.\n\n\nI asked for the policy document if any.

I took it out, said that i will unload it , unloaded it and handed over to him. just the gun. He had a deep look to it. Asked me to show the license. which i did. he matched the number. He asked about the number of rounds i am carrying. i said 15, he asked for the magazine, which i handed over to him. He felt the weight of the magazine. and handed over the gun and magazine to me and started examining the license. Meanwhile i loaded the gun in front of him and holstered it.

It comes in 12 inch barrel with 3+1 capacity as well. You can order any size barrel, accessory railing, side saddle (for extra ammo holding) etc, Normal shooter can handle slugs but they advise you to buy a slug capable barrel if you intend to fire slugs regularly (slug capable barrels are made on order). I purchased a shooter with \n20 and 28 inches slug capable barrels, railing and side saddle. The best thing about DSA is that you can get any type of authentic customization done directly from their factory, which is not the case with imported guns. As far as reliability is concerned you may take a look on the videos posted by Jibz :) \n\nRegards', ''),

My friend rushed out of his home in the street, where he saw a neighbourhood boy holding the 11 year old, who was unconscious, in his arms. \r\nMy friend shifted the boy to the hospital. But unfortunately, the 11 year old breathed his last before reaching the hospital. Jey called the boy’s family and told them to come to the hospital as the boy was seriously injured. It is common practice in our culture that the news of death is not conveyed to the closed relatives directly. They are first prepared for the news and then the news is broken.\r\nThe boy’s father met Jey outside the hospital’s emergency ward and directed him towards the doctor, who broke the sad news to the boy’s father.\r\nThe boy’s father came out of the ward and started blaming my friend for killing his son as ‘’he is the only person who has guns in the street and who carries them.’’ He even manhandled my friend. Jey came to his home and soon police arrived to arrest him. He was handcuffed and taken to the police station where he was detained in the lock up. After 3 hours of investigation, the police found that the 11 year old boy was killed by his 14-year-old brother. Both the boys were home alone. One of them opened a trunk to find a shirt, where they found a weapon (possibly a revolver). Being curious, they both wanted to hold the gun, which unfortunately led to the sad incident. \r\nLater on the boy''s father apologised to my friend.', ''),

When the frount sight was removed the metal rolled and split. I have had sights replaced a number of times but never had anything like that happen. My smith feels that the slide was not heat treated properly. I sent my Duty to CZ .... They said it was not there problem .... but it took them 6 months to tell me this. Not only did they not offer in any way to help .... includeing not offering to sell me a slide. But they took a long time to do nothing. \nHas any one had any problems like this as well?????\nNeed less to say that now when I go to the range I take my Duty with me, set it out so others can see it and ask questions about it.

(627024, 'SPA GS1250; SPA GS1250; Last week bought a new GS1250. Nitro piston, 0.22 air rifle. With center point scope from Ahmed & Co. Peshawar. Arsalan Ahmed Khan is a nice friendly dealer, can be contacted for all air rifle requirements. Carries all makes and some rare model pcps as well. His cell phone number is 0332 9171694.\n\nWas not sure about Nitro Piston reliability but read review of GS750 by Adam at Pak Guns n decided to go for it. Price quote for Airgun was 12K and Center Point Scope 5K and delivery to Karachi 1.5K. Arsalan was kind enuff to gift one tin Gamo Pro Magnum pellets for free. Believe the entire package is good deal compared to prices in Karachi n Lahore. Did check prices of other air guns including Diana 34 Classic T06, Gamo Shadow 1000 and found that prices in Peshawar are a lot less than bigger cities. The gun arrived to Karachi in 6 days. \n\nNitro piston or gas ram as I read online will fail during first 10 shots or so. N if it does not it goes on for as long as twice the life of a spring powerplant, usually 5,000+ shots. N it does not deteriorate with time, suffers no metal fatigue. Unlike a springer which cntunues to work at lowered velocity, a gas ram gives same power when new. Either it works or stops working. \n\nAfter shooting almost 150 shots, the GS1250 is a lot smother n has pretty awesome power. Achieved close groups at 35 paces after zeroing the scope. It consistently penetrates 1 inch thick chip board sheet placed inside box carton. \n \nSo far GS1250 is a great value for money air gun!! Pretty happy with my purchase.', 'SPA GS1250'),

On front side beneth barrel i tried to peep for machiening quality of frame it was not as impressive either a bit rough.  one thing that i noticed was that the guide rod and barrel tend to lean upwards slightly as i pulled that slide dont know if it is some gun feature sights were white dotted , trigger wasnt that soft as i expected may be because it was new, it had an extra mag with it a cleaning rod and some manual papers etc. after a little look i handed him over.\nHe told me that he has 1 more and one is booked, \none thing that is making me suspicious how come a local gun store who normaly deals in Darra weapons, low quality ammo and weapon repairing come to have a Norinco PX-3 i just dont get it, it doesnot makes any sense now there are only three options left either DARRA manufacturers have gone smart enough to make reverse engineered clone PX-3s , no.2  PX-3 are actualy originaly made by Darra manufacturers in name of Norinco illegaly, or this shopkeeper has started to deal in other stuff also beside locals, i asked from where did you get those he told me he got them from peshawar. \nPrice: i never asked.\nwhat you guys think ........', ''),

Another russian Baikal MP 513m broke spring after few months of usage.\n\nHatsan Sniper had broken spring after about 2 years of heavy usage. While disassembling I have checked the internals.

In fact, I knew about the gun but its purchase was accidental.\n\nI knew about the SPA GS750, some detail found was from russian forums, or trade sites, but I never thought of buying it. One day for some other reason, I went to local air gunsmith and dealer. He told me that he had brought a chinese air rifle from Peshawar which is Nitro Piston. And he showed me a beautiful air gun. I dd not even asked for the price, checked its shot cycle by firing one pellet and asked him to put it on back seat of my car.\n\nIt is 750 fps in 4.5 mm cal.  In 5.5 mm it can be perhaps 600 to 650 fps.\n\nGS 1250 even if it is 900 fps in 5.5 mm cal, that is great but I doubt it. Perhaps 900 fps in 5.5mm with a spring or nitro piston is just at the limit if not beyond that. I will get and check it soon.\n\nAs per my knowledge it is available in Peshawar with some one sole distributor of SPA guns. I got it from Multan. \n\nIt is about 2-3 months that I have got GS 750, It shoots well and accurate. It is hold sensitive, but has a good rifle like recoil and minimum vibration typical of a springer.\n\nPiston has shown no signs of weakening yet after about 1000 pellets. A spare nitro piston is also included in the package by the company, so we have a spare as well.\n\nIf you r interested, I will recommend to buy it.

Even Specs either are exaggerated on webpage ([URL="http://www.china-airrifle.com"]www.china-airrifle.com[/URL]).

Rifling of barrel seen after cleaning was fine.\n\nLightly oiled some pivot joints, etc.\n\nShot few pellets on paper. It has very tough cocking effort ( I don''t think I can do it for a longer period of time).\n\nTrigger is hard (very hard, will take time to smooth out).\n\nShot cycle is rapid, minimum vibration, but with recoil of a shotgun.\n\nMinimum dieseling abated after 5-6 shots.\n\nJust to experiment, I aimed on a metal plate which I had previously shot 3-4 times with my other air guns ( GS750, Hatsan 99 and Hatsan 125). All these guns made good dents on this plate but none of these could penetrate it fully at 10 yards distance. I was thinking that this metal plate is too thick for an air gun.\n\nBut this 1250 with a Gamo promagnum pellet of 5.5 mm ripped it apart.\n\nThese dents on the palte are from other guns, and 1250 penetrated it like a bullet.\n\nI am skeptical, This is too strong a piston, will it last any longer, I don''t know....... \n\nThis time there is no spare piston in the package, but local dealer told me that he will get one for me from distributor of 1250 in Peshawar.', ''),

But one thing I will say and don''t mind me saying this, is from what I feel from your conversation is that you are still confused which in other words could also mean hesitation, whether you should have pulled your gun out or not, and Remember............. The last thing you need in a scenario or situation like that is hesitation as you get literally seconds or less to act and react. If you decide to go for your gun then you have to make sure your bullet hits the BG before they see your gun otherwise there will be an exchange of fire. Never mind them seeing your gun, a couple of years ago my cousin and his friend were robbed on gun point by two BG''s, one pointing an AK47 towards them demanding their Cash, Mobile Phones Wallets etc. My cousin and his friend were on their motorcycle, the BG''s were just standing in the middle of way around 7/8pm (winter) and stopped them. My Cousin and his friend were trying to talk their way out first by saying we are going to the hospital as one of our family members is in critical condition and we need to rush but that had no effect on BG''s and they didn''t care at all and continued with their demands to hand over your valuables. My Cousin is in his early 20ies and a bit hot headed, during the argument he took only 1 step towards the BG and the BG fired 13-14 rounds from his AK, directly in front of his feet warning him to step back and stay where you are, just to scare them off. BG''s only left when they handed their Cash etc and also some  motorbike lights appeared from far away (some random passer by) and stopped when they opened fire, falling off their bikes, the BG''s thought it was the Police constables who often patrol the Canal Side at night, and ran off disappearing into the maize fields.', ''),

Anyway let me summerise the incident for the safety of every one who reads it as well as opinions about the situation. \r\n\r\n[FONT=arial]I  left Expo center lahore and drove towards Johar town Doctor Hospital Canal Intersection to move towards my home. It was just before G1 market on the main road johar town near Choueifat shool that two guys stopped by coming infront of my car on honda 125 and showed me a desi kind of rusted old weapon in battery position. I was talking on phone and the window was a few inches open only, i head him saying "Garii Rocko Masla Haiii". I stopped the car and he said "hand me over the mobile phone or i will shoot" (which was a samsung s5) i tired to conceal and gave him a another old nokia from my other pocket , he said give me the ONE i asked, i said "ok plz point the gun away towards from me" , "you want the mobile phone i am giving you"... and i handed over the mobile phone after picking it from the floor of my car. He then said give me cash too, i said i have no cash you are free to search me , which infact i lied just to take more time ( as i was still sitting inside car with a few inches open window and they were outside) , Then the guys said OK and vanished...in opposite direction.. \r\n\r\nI reported the incident the nearest police station and blocked sim and mobile IMEI . I want to all my friends reading this to be safe and be aware of the area please. \r\n\r\nI just want to know that i had  my weapon at that moment loaded under my seat, which i was thinking to draw but i didn''t , i don''t know why. Please comment at your best what one should do in the situation, God forbid happens to anyone risking his or his families life. \r\n\r\n[/FONT][/SIZE][/QUOTE]\r\n\r\nGlad to hear you are safe brother, and what you did in view of the scenario was the best thing to do... And always remember, you can not shoot someone until you are being shot at (law).

The kind on which it says subsonic on the pack.[/QUOTE]\nSubsonic just means below the speed of sound, so you could just look at the fps to determine whether a particular cartridge is subsonic or not. Sound travels at 1125 fps, so [B]any [/B]bullet slower than that is subsonic. I''ve only seen 22''s that were specifically labeled as such. I don''t remember the brand, but they didn''t actually say "subsonic", it just specified they we''re designed for use with suppressors. The issue with making subsonic 22''s is that they have to be loaded light enough not to exceed 1125fps, even when shot out of a long barrel, but they also have to be hot enough to cycle a semi auto action.\n\nA suppressor just muffles the sound of the primer and gun powder igniting. If the bullet travels at supersonic speeds, it still creates a "sonic boom" (a loud crack), even with a suppressor. In fact, anything that exceeds 1125fps will create a sonic boom, as it breaks the sound barrier. The purpose of using subsonic rounds is to avoid that crack, so with a suppressor, the shot is indeed "silenced" and just sounds like a staple gun.', ''),

Right[/QUOTE]\n  ATA- bro, there it says sporting rifle with bore .22inch "OR" (not and) 7mm bore non automatic rifle;\nThis clearly tells us that they are talking about sporting rifles which have a bore of .22inch rather than just .22LR and as Leon pointed down below that includes a host of different calibers which include .223 semi auto. As far as the action is concerned it specifically states "non automatic" only for the 7mm bore, not .22bore sporting rifles, it is a known fact that .22bore sporting rifles are semi automatic rifles all over the world. Even the pre 2012 laws said the exact same thing how ever there was an exception that I will point out. \nConclusion that can be drawn is, all rifles that have a bore of .22inch and are sporting rifles that are non full auto are NPB which includes .223 semi auto AR-15s. In the past i.e. pre 2012 these guns were not NPB because along with the notification mentioned here there were additions that said "Excluding .223 semi auto calibers specifically". Such a clause is not present in this current notification so .223 semi auto rifles are still NPB according to this notification.\n  As far as the limit on licenses is concerned the limit as per law only applies to those who will get licenses according to this new notification, those are just basics of law. Something that was legal in the past but rules have changed, apply from that point on not that point back. The new licenses when are issued according to this notification a single person shall not be issued with more than 5, but as we know for damn sure it wont be enforced, as you said these rules are decided by dealers and govt alike, they dont want their business and money making machine cut down.', ''),

Thanks God they were there to take your phone or your car and not after you (Remember: short-term kidnapping is on the rise in Lahore). So, be ready next time.\r\n6. While driving, do scan your surroundings. Especially when there is low traffic or too early or late hours. Drive bit fast (of course the road is clear). Try to use busy route even if it is long instead of deserted short route. Pay attention to your surroundings, 90% of the times, you will get the idea before time comes.\r\n7. Do look for traps. Some one touching your car or closing your side view mirror or bike rider falling off (without any apparent reason) could be a trap, set to stop you. Stop at some busy place like fuel station or store where they have armed guard.\r\n\r\n@ MK47,\r\nI read somewhere that law of Pakistan allows you use force until threat is neutralized. It also allows you to recover you belongings if the assailant is fleeing with you goods.', ''),

It really doesnt make a significant difference as far as energy delivered, but a longer barrel does help control the spread of shot, or pellets, allowing you to reach out further with a higher concentration of lead. Yet in all honesty, if you want a better pattern, a good set of chokes will do a lot more for you than a couple more inches of barrel. I dont know how resilient the boars in Pak are, but at ranges around 50m, you''ll do fine with any length of barrel.

Had a detailed discussion with the officer dealing the arms license and carry permits. I asked for the procedure of obtaining carry permit. He asked do u have any life threat. I said no. He asked do you have any FIR registered of an attack on your life. I said no. He said then there is a no permit for you. I asked that i need to carry my NPB weapon for security reasons and current law and order situation. He said that you do not need any permit for carrying NPB in concealed manner whether on person or in car. Permit are only issued for Display of weapon. All pakistan permits are issued from MOI and provincial are issued by respective DC office.\n\n\nI inquired about carrying NPB while 144 is imposed. He said if the 144 notification states that Carrying is banned then you cannot carry, otherwise you can carry in concealed manner. In 144 general notification, permits for displayed carrying are suspended. In short he said carrying of NPB weapon is allowed in concealed manner only. For display/brandishing of weapon, permits are issued. And currently none are being issued from MOI and DC office.\n\n\nI asked for the policy document if any. He said MOI has it.Now I am planning to visit MOI for the most wanted policy document so that we all can know the policy for the firearms handling lawfully.\n\n\nSecondly I was travelling in Islamabad two days back, near Serena, with 2 of my friends in my mehran when i was stopped at checkpost. The police constable asked us to step out. Which i did. He did a body search, before he could feel the weapon on me , i told him that i have a weapon. He asked me to show. I took it out, said that i will unload it , unloaded it and handed over to him. just the gun. He had a deep look to it. Asked me to show the license. which i did. he matched the number. He asked about the number of rounds i am carrying. i said 15, he asked for the magazine, which i handed over to him. He felt the weight of the magazine. and handed over the gun and magazine to me and started examining the license. Meanwhile i loaded the gun in front of him and holstered it. He returned the license to me. I smiled and said thank you to him sat back in car and left. Rangers were also present on that checkpost.\n\n\nthought of sharing this incident with you all.[/QUOTE]\n\nGood to know :)', ''),

This year,  at the IWA & [I]OutdoorClassics [/I]expo in Nuremberg (Germany),  the NORINCO company announces the conclusion of over two years of  research and development with the launch of a new variant of the NP-42  platform.\n\n\n\n  \nDubbed the Qx4, the new NP-42 variant comes  with a reinforced polymer frame, sporting an ergonomic grip and a  manual safety switch; it also features a frontal MIL-STD-1913 Picatinny  rail for tactical accessories, while the massive machined steel slide  sports front slide serrations and fixed sights.\nMuch like many other  NORINCO products, the Qx4 NP-42 version appears somewhat crude, but is  an overall acceptable performer in service and defensive uses, and  appears to be quite solid in construction.\n\n\n\n[B]The  main peculiarity of the NORINCO NP-42 Qx4 pistol is the availability in  a wide array of calibers &#8722; including 9mm, .45 ACP and even the good old  7.62x25mm Tokarev round[/B], still highly regarded in Asia, Africa and the  Middle East due to the wide availability of ammunition and its  undoubtable stopping power capabilities. \n\nThe  pistol will be available in all the different calibers from factory;  the original project dictated for caliber interchangeability through the  replacement of some components, but whether or not this capability has  been retained in the factory version, it has not been clarified by the  NORINCO representatives at IWA.

But if your license says .22 rifle it specifically means .22LR, if your NPB license says .223 semi auto it specifically means .223 semi auto. You purchase a .22LR rifle on a .22LR license and .223 semi auto on a .223 semi auto license, technically licenses are legal according to .22inch barrel caliber being NPB. Previously especially in Sindh .223 semi auto was specifically mentioned as PB. In these rules and the ones before these it was not mentioned, go to home office they will convert your 9mm license to .223 semi auto and they will also register your AR-15 onto that converted license. I hope you get what I am saying. No where did I say you can purchase .223 on a .22LR license. I am saying .22inch barrel is considered NPB and that includes .22LR as well as .223, but if your license says .22rifle it means .22LR rifle if it says .223 semi auto rifle, it means .223 semi auto rifle.', ''),

He asked about the number of rounds i am carrying. i said 15, he asked for the magazine, which i handed over to him. He felt the weight of the magazine. and handed over the gun and magazine to me and started examining the license. Meanwhile i loaded the gun in front of him and holstered it. He returned the license to me. I smiled and said thank you to him sat back in car and left.

So .223 semi auto now PB cannot be compared with full auto PB in terms of prices. Its all demand and supply, lets hope these laws are overturned, frankly I am sceptical.', ''),

(626938, ' On Friday 31 November 2014 i went to Chief Commissioner Office G11 Islamabad. Had a detailed discussion with the officer dealing the arms license and carry permits. I asked for the procedure of obtaining carry permit. He asked do u have any life threat. I said no. He asked do you have any FIR registered of an attack on your life. I said no. He said then there is a no permit for you. I asked that i need to carry my NPB weapon for security reasons and current law and order situation. He said that you do not need any permit for carrying NPB in concealed manner whether on person or in car. Permit are only issued for Display of weapon. All pakistan permits are issued from MOI and provincial are issued by respective DC office.\n\n\nI inquired about carrying NPB while 144 is imposed. He said if the 144 notification states that Carrying is banned then you cannot carry, otherwise you can carry in concealed manner. In 144 general notification, permits for displayed carrying are suspended. In short he said carrying of NPB weapon is allowed in concealed manner only. For display/brandishing of weapon, permits are issued. And currently none are being issued from MOI and DC office.\n\n\nI asked for the policy document if any. He said MOI has it.Now I am planning to visit MOI for the most wanted policy document so that we all can know the policy for the firearms handling lawfully.\n\n\nSecondly I was travelling in Islamabad two days back, near Serena, with 2 of my friends in my mehran when i was stopped at checkpost. The police constable asked us to step out. Which i did. He did a body search, before he could feel the weapon on me , i told him that i have a weapon. He asked me to show. I took it out, said that i will unload it , unloaded it and handed over to him. just the gun. He had a deep look to it. Asked me to show the license. which i did. he matched the number. He asked about the number of rounds i am carrying. i said 15, he asked for the magazine, which i handed over to him. He felt the weight of the magazine. and handed over the gun and magazine to me and started examining the license. Meanwhile i loaded the gun in front of him and holstered it. He returned the license to me. I smiled and said thank you to him sat back in car and left. Rangers were also present on that checkpost.\n\n\nthought of sharing this incident with you all.', ''),

We breached roadblocks that sometimes required bashing through fixed barriers and other vehicles. A car could take an enormous amount of abuse and keep running. We combined driving and firearm tactics, using our vehicles as cover. The wheels and engine blocks afforded the best protection against high velocity rounds. We entered and exited our cars while drawing and firing weapons. We practiced with a variety of firearms, including foreign models, particularly the AK 47 and SKS carbine. Our teams in Afghanistan carried the AK 47 because of the local availability of ammunition and the local profile.

He is being charged under Canada’s Immigration and Refugee Protection  Act with being a danger to the security of Canada, the newspaper said. \nFarooq and police officials did not immediately respond to requests for comment. \nCourt  records obtained by the Globe show that Ansari last year surrendered 10  firearms to authorities, including rifles and several handguns. It said  this was part of a plea bargain to obtain a conditional discharge on  charges of illegally storing lawfully acquired firearms. Those  proceedings did not include allegations of terrorism, the newspaper  said.\nCanadian police have been under scrutiny for their handling of suspected extremists since the two attacks last week.\nLaw  enforcement officials have asked for additional powers to investigate  and arrest extremists in Canada after the attacks, which police say were  committed by radical Muslim converts inspired by Islamic State.[/quote]', ''),

It will be the first 5 issue dates which will count ( Just take my words, I am a Government Officer though in a different Department but basics remain the same ).\n  Even if the matter is taken to court it will be of little help as Firearm rules & regulations are far more strict in majority of world than Pakistan. Our country was a heaven to gun lovers like me but I think it no longer will be. As anti gun lobby & government have sufficient valid points to make these laws even more strict.\n  Sale your weapons at even less price before they are confiscated by the LEA''s ( Provided there is a real notification )\n\nLastly OP is requested to give a link or upload the picture of Notification, it can be just a hoax sort of April fool and nothing more\n\nRegards', ''),

They are a very good value at $300, and I''m very interested in picking one up. However, it''s not available at any of the stores in my area, so I''ll have to order online. The only problem with that is, I will not have the opportunity to handle one before deciding. It looks nice enough in the pictures I''ve seen, but my concern is the grip size. Part of the reason I like TT''s and 1911''s so much is because of their single stack mags, and hence slim grips. I don''t have very large hands, with the 7.62 being a relatively long cartridge and having two columns, I''m afraid the gun won''t fit me.

(626819, ' D3AD! Bro as of yet they are converting 9mm or any other caliber licenses to .223 semi auto. I said "converting" because no new licenses are being issued. Imtiaz Shah is totally correct in stating that this will never be implemented or followed. You are correct where you say that they will use the technical excuse to excuse themselves in court. But right now .223 licenses are readily being converted by home office and in some VIP cases new licenses are also being ISSUED. So this notification is not only ambiguous at .22inch barrel or .22LR caliber (even though it clearly states .22 inch) but it is also unenforceable just like the 5 license limit is unenforceable I know 6 people who have 30+ licenses and have been collecting for the past 30 to 40 years. Lets stick to our basics and enjoy shooting, what ever is issued by punjab govt as a license is a license it will never go away until you do something wrong, a gun that has been registered whether .22LR or .223 semi auto, it is registered and until you do something wrong with it, its all legal. If you convert a 9mm license to a .223 semi auto license legally or get issued a .223 license legally and have a .223 semi auto rifle on it legally, there is nothing illegal or wrong about it, it is there in the flesh in front of you.

(626880, ' [QUOTE=Bhatti1965;464606]Mian jee if you are going into technicalities then the notification clearly states all are PB "except .22 inch". It does not say .22LR, so this includes .223 or 5.56x45 because a .223 also has a .22inch barrel, the caliber is the same as a .22LR only the charge behind it is bigger and more powerful, so in technical terms a .223 satisfies the .22 inch requirement and is therefore NPB. In the past notifications .223 semi auto is specifically excluded, but in this notification .223 semi auto is not, so according to me it is still NPB. But as far as the 7mm bullshit is concerned this obsolete cartridge and these vague rules allow for grey areas in the firearm laws, the govt has not conducted an ounce of research for the last 50 years, to formulate laws that are easy to understand and can be positively followed and allow for licenses issued on previous laws.

A dealer, Mr. Kifayat (Karkhano Market) was asking 175k from a customer of Punjab when I reached his shop last Saturday, but could not stay there to see the final price bec. I was in hurry. But I have one serious reservation, and that is, the Peshawar Dealers are mostly arrogant (may be its my observation) unless you don''t have any relation or some sort of other connection, you don''t get the desired info. from them. They will just ignore you on the first blow when they see you are not buying any weapon. On last Thursday, I visited Sangeen Khan and Fakhr-e-Alam, and for three models of Walther P22, Mr. Fakhre-Alam quoted 3 prices of 75K, 85K & 95K for different models in one breath.', ''),

(630490, 'Some comments about P1000 [QUOTE=hsnmz;467502]Umair bro, the rule is simple, You get what you pay for. That translates mainly in terms of quality.[/QUOTE]\n\nI possess P1000 and have operated some other pcps available in pakistan. So far P1000 is the highest sold PCP in Pakistan. You have official coverage through the representative of Diana in Lahore Pakistan that helps in after sale issues. \n\nThoroughly read manual of the P1000 and comply with instructions. Use dust proof / fog proof pouch to house the gun. Pump have to have moisture management system. Avoid to fill it early morning when moisture in air is the highest and its dew point is close. Though you can fill 300 bars but better stay at maximum 250. It will elongate the age of cylinder as well as seals and valve. After filling the bottle keep it vertically in such a way that its filling port facing ground for an hour or so. Then hold the bottle in hand in the same direction and release a little amount of air with the help of degassing bolt. This will release moisture condensate instantly. Now you can fit the bottle to the gun. Detach the bottle when the gun is not in use. Keeping the pressurized bottle intact put unnecessary pressure on the internal components of the gun.\n\nYou have ample choice of scopes that can be used on P1000 but keep weight in mind besides other features. I am using hawke panorama scope and pretty glade with it. I am not happy with its factory fitted sound moderator. Its baffle holes clearance is high and the distance between baffles is not acoustically efficient. Suppressor of HW100 works very good on P1000 if you manage to fit it through some precised adapter of 1/2 inch UNF thread. \n\nDo not entangle yourself in in doing research on pellets, just use JSB 16gr, 18gr or H&N barracuda match in P1000.\n\nWell after doing a lot of comparative analysis I still suggest that P1000 is a better choice in the available brand new stuff in Pakistan from price, performance, maintenance and the aesthetics point of view. Otherwise passion is passion and there is no limit to it.\n\n\nRegards', ''),

In a one-to-one fight, a phorusrhacid would easily disable a human being with a single beak strike and fatally injure an adult human with just [URL="https://www.google.com.pk/search?newwindow=1&client=firefox-a&hs=TPe&rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&channel=sb&q=phorusrhacid&spell=1&sa=X&ei=C_OBVOuqJNPuaO_JgNgK&ved=0CBkQvwUoAA"][COLOR=#000000][/COLOR][/URL]3-4 strikes. Under the reign of these terrible birds (from 6.6 crore years ago to 2.3 crore years ago), no mammal dared attain large size. When south and north america got united through a thin strip of land around 2.3 crore years ago, large hunting mammals from north america reached south america and killed these horrible, deadly birds.[/QUOTE]\r\n\r\n*raises hand*\r\nProfessor sand-in-pants \r\nWhat made the large hunting mammals decide to move there? Or did they simply evolve into something that could take on the pigeons of doom? \r\nAnd since they were slightly bigger then ostriches, which can be taken out by packs of smaller predators with ease, was it that no mammal had evolved to a social level enough for pack-attacks/wolfpack style hunting or was there simply , no mammal fearsome enough to take it on even with many vs one tactics. Conversely, was it that the birds themselves pack hunted and so took down anything else that tried, leading to the line of thought that the birds on their own were weak. \r\n\r\nHmmm. \r\n*adjusts glasses*', ''),

This is info for those who want to buy a .223 rifle on their NPB licenses just pay 3 to 5k to get them converted to .223 caliber and then go and buy the rifle. As of yet there are zero chances of the rifles going to NPB, the new arms notification if you look closely does not make them PB and the moi licenses even call .308 semi autos NPB so the MOI license will always be open. .223 semi auto rifles are here to stay and will not become NPB any time soon, if it was that uncertain dealers wouldnt import them in the 1000s and lose all their money.

Only late night walks I carry the baton on myself along with the torch. Knives are illegal to EDC (unless there are packed in camping/hunting gear or toolbox) but multi-tool kit knives such as my Kershaw are allowed as EDC depending on what one is doing (eg if I am moving boxes etc), or retained in the medical kit/toolbox.\n\nOf course, in case of an incident use of any tool requires sound judgement. A stainless steel 3 foot long breaker bar is a serious weapon that''s always in the boot of the car, to open the stubborn wheels bolts in need.\n\nOne can be done for using anything as a weapon, even a screw driver or a brick/stone from the pavement. Knife crimes / stabbings are common here, so if I am protecting myself from a knife attacker(s) with a plastic baton, yes police will give me a hard time for it and I''d happily go through that than being in intensive care fighting for my life.

Im not hating on DGI guns, its just that to get a DGI gun at the level of a piston driven gun you have to pay almost double.\nIt takes 2 minutes to change barrel lengths on this rifle, how ever shorter barrels are not available in Pakistan through their authorised distributors, I dont know if others can get them or not.\nA downside to it is that it has its own piston driven bolt carrier and gas system, barrel nut and barrel so those key parts are not interchangeable with any extra cool aftermarket american parts that could be fit to lets say a Norinco CQA.', ''),

Can u explain these marking?\nsecondly [B]why patent pending on grips?[/B]\nlastly [B]glock comes with fixed rear sights, and the one in pic are adjustable! How come?[/B][/QUOTE]\nI can answer some of those questions...\nYou are right ZZ, Tenifer has been discontinued and still is. Tenifer is/was the commercial name for the nitrocarburizing process that Glock used to surface harden the steel in their slides, barrels, etc. In an effort to become more environmentally friendly, a gas nitriding process is now used. For the finishes that result in the grey/black colour, there are two in current production. The more matte looking one is similar to parkerizing and the shinier one, I''ve been told, is something like the teflon used on frying pans. \nRegarding the printing on the grip, instead of listing patent numbers like Gen3''s, the Gen4''s say "patent pending" in reference to the patent application on either the grip texturing, or the back strap system. \nFor the sights, when you place a factory order for a new Glock, you have the option of choosing the standard fixed sights, night sights, or the adjustable ones depicted. When gun stores stock their inventory, they invariably order the fixed sights because they are the least expensive. It''s been a while since I ordered a Glock, but if I remember correctly, the regular plastic sights were around $100-150 cheaper than the other options. Most people just buy what the store has in stock, so thats why most Glocks you see have the standard sights. \nAs for as the markings on the bottom of the trigger guard, I have never seen that before and have no idea what it stands for.', ''),

That''s why you have to shoot in front of, or lead, the target.\n\nAs 12GAUGE said, there are only two methods of shooting a moving target, as far as I know anyways. What 12GAUGE described were different methods of leading the target. The second way of shooting a moving target is called the "ambush" or "trapping" the target.

Cross eye dominance, depending on severity can be a problem requiring one to switch shoulders. I would recommend seeing a local instructor who can properly evaluate you. Generally, in the US good instruction costs about UD$ 100 -200 an hour. Most people take weekly lessons for about a year or two years. This is what I did to learn. Perhaps, you can try offering some of the local top guns this type of money. This is a good idea because eye dominance is just one of several problems you might be having. they can help you correct all of them.

(631173, ' I feel so ashamed....I''m the OP yet I haven''t contributed jack squat. \r\n\r\nSo off the top of my head. \r\n\r\nLasers. You all know them right? \r\nThose cheap 100 rupee red lasers kids screw around with. They have warning labels on them. Not to be directly shined into eye. \r\n\r\nNow in more detail...those things have a electrical energy output of 5mw. Literally nothing. A tap of your finger makes that much power, albeit in mechanical form. \r\n\r\nThat 5mw can cause eye damage. Let''s up the ante. \r\nA 500mw laser is a interesting thing. It''s powerful enough to set fire to physical things , and provided it is focused properly can be seen in excess of a few hundred meters. Just LOOKING at the dot when pointed on a object for long enough can cause permanent eye damage. Specialized laser goggles are needed to just handle them when on. If your unfortunate enough to look at one directly. Have fun trying to see for the next year or so, and heavily diminished vision for the remainder of your days. \r\n\r\nLet''s up The ante further to 1W. Buy a one W led and look at it. Then imagine it focused similarly to a laser. \r\nLooking at the dot with no protection.... Ugh. A direct hit , you are blind for life. The beam itself can be seen from a few km away. \r\n\r\nNow onto WHY lasers damage the eye so quickly. We all know the basic construction of the eye, and the ways light rays are refracted into the retina. And the burning properties of powerful lasers. A already extremely directed beam is refrected further, its all refracted onto one small area, less then a few hundred nanometers cube in area. Then imagine the retina and optic nerve itself burning from inside out.\r\nNot a nice experience. \r\n\r\nNow to scare you all further, lasers of this class are easily available for 100-300USD that are handheld. \r\n\r\n\r\nAnd a small addendum. \r\nThere is a a GUIDELINE for airline mechanics to tell them how many bolts may be missing from the wing before it needs to be grounded. \r\nOh and in most planes the lavatory flush pipe is right next to the drinking water tank.( which I sent cleaned in a looong time ) both of these are filled and emptied together at the same time. \r\n\r\nStay scared ;P', ''),

(631187, ' Shotgun has to be shot with both eyes open and it does not require to be looked down the barrel rather focusing the target, provided the shotgun has a decent fit. With one eye closed, smoking crossing birds from left to right or vice versa where there is lead required, cannot be achieved or it could be troublesome. Secondly, Shotgun is not shot like rifle in general and constant dry mounting overtime till certain level of muscle memory is developed, will deliver a correct eye alignment with the bead or front sight. Also, one has to remember that in shotgun your dominant eye serves as the rear sight as in rifle where you have to align the front and rear sights for aiming. Important thing is to maintain a hard focus on the target and let muscle memory take its course and the gun will point where your eye is looking. One can shoot stationary targets with one eye closed but the pleasure of shooting both eyes opened is quiet different especially the moving targets. Initially, it is quiet difficult to develop this skill but once developed it is a lot easier to control the shooting. Either in hunting, skeet or sporting clays one normally has to shoot the flying birds/clays from the gun down position, therefore the standard technique of Move, Mount and Shoot is generally adopted. One very important phenomenon to understand is of Shot Pattern which is normally of 30 inches approx. at 20 yards with Cylinder Chokes, that further supports shotgun shooting with both eyes open. So, in the nutshell, a little practise in the right direction can greatly enhance the pleasure of shotgunning. Thanks', ''),

I am beginner and only got the license of .22 so can''t buy the other calibers on that license. In .22 my original choice was beretta arx 160 which is not available. So my second choice is this colt .22. I think .22 is a good calibers to start and then move on to heavier one.\n\nabout buying the original stuff. My idea is to slowly make the collection branded things so when I move to bigger riffles these things stands with me. For extra magazine I need it at range and i m doing shooting as a hobby n fun n not interested in hunting or other things.  Maybe I will get myself ready for competition. \n\nI really appreciate your expert advice n shooting tips.', ''),

Poor finish quality and machiening quality. but beware now fake ones are also having quality finishes.\n2. normaly fake copies dont have crisp and soft trigger.\n3. after field stripping the internal surface might not be machiened upto the mark.\n4. the marking signs would not be as defined as originals. (Fake TT-30 marking signs can even dodge experiance handlers may be because our darra arms makers have mastered this pistol)\n5. grip groves and material would be different.\n6. Packaging printing would be different.\n\n*A big renowned and reputable dealer mostly wont sell a fake one.\n*The serial numbers of fake ones cant be tracked via emailing them to manufacturer.\n\nNorinco np22 vs canik 55tp9\n\nNorinco np22 are based on Sig-P226 platform it wont be wrong to say that they are actually copy of Sig-P226 . Sig-P226 is a proven reliable and quality pistol nobody can deny that. so Norinco Np22 reliability wont be a big issue but definatly you would not get Sig quality but Norinco NP22 wont disappoint you either i have personly fired this pistol couple of times at range recoil is manageble muzzle rise is controlable, its pretty accurate trigger wasnt that soft but not that hard and i felt it good in my hands grips were bit large but its all the personal prefferance , No pistol is perfect one that suits perfectly in one handlers hand might be spoiler in others.\n\nCannik 55 tp9:\nall i know is that they are turkish made and very reliable never used one and never fired one so cant gave any personal experiance with them but they are very famous among shooters and many shooters like them. i think they are more expensive than np22 but i am not sure about that\n\nusers can guide you better\n\nI am done.......[/QUOTE]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSir kindly can u tell me that how can i mail the manufecturer and give them serial no.

(631236, ' [QUOTE=Moeen;469008]Salam All,\nThe only reason we MAY get these weapon or the only reason POF is advertising them now is to exploit the market further... as always we come second... These things were designed for the US market where they have been picked up by Atlantic Arms.  If they didn''t want something like this... it would have never been made nor would we be able to see such offerings.  As far as the stocks, expert - no expert - gurus - what ever.... don''t expect any folding stock option for it.  Why?  Again, if you put a folding stock on this thing in the US it becomes a SBR meaning serious offence.  Now before some start jumping and stating in the video they are showing it with stock!  Atlantic Firearms is a Class III dealer/importer, they are legally allowed to any setup they like... they just can''t sell that setup to any civilians except government agencies or other class II or III dealers.  Also the stock shown is a arm support - a loop hole which I am sure the BATF will figure out a way to impose a ban on.\nSo to make a long story short... What was sold to them according to US law is whats going to be commercially available here.  If they want it in Pink... expect that same leftover to be sold here at that price for that same privelage....  If that.[/QUOTE]\n+1 to Moeen bhai', ''),

(631339, ' [QUOTE=Chokes;468978]Shotgun has to be shot with both eyes open and it does not require to be looked down the barrel rather focusing the target, provided the shotgun has a decent fit. With one eye closed, smoking crossing birds from left to right or vice versa where there is lead required, cannot be achieved or it could be troublesome. Secondly, Shotgun is not shot like rifle in general and constant dry mounting overtime till certain level of muscle memory is developed, will deliver a correct eye alignment with the bead or front sight. Also, one has to remember that in shotgun your dominant eye serves as the rear sight as in rifle where you have to align the front and rear sights for aiming. Important thing is to maintain a hard focus on the target and let muscle memory take its course and the gun will point where your eye is looking. One can shoot stationary targets with one eye closed but the pleasure of shooting both eyes opened is quiet different especially the moving targets. Initially, it is quiet difficult to develop this skill but once developed it is a lot easier to control the shooting. Either in hunting, skeet or sporting clays one normally has to shoot the flying birds/clays from the gun down position, therefore the standard technique of Move, Mount and Shoot is generally adopted. One very important phenomenon to understand is of Shot Pattern which is normally of 30 inches approx. at 20 yards with Cylinder Chokes, that further supports shotgun shooting with both eyes open. So, in the nutshell, a little practise in the right direction can greatly enhance the pleasure of shotgunning. Thanks[/QUOTE]\n\nThanks for Share your knowledge ....', ''),

In fact, for any given caliber, the bullets can vary in actual diameter by upto .003"\n\nDue to manufacturing tolerances within and between manufacturers, barrels of the same caliber are not all made the exact same size. For rifles I want to achieve ultimate accuracy with, I do what is known as "bore slugging". The process basically involves taking an oversized piece of lead and pounding it down the barrel. When the lead comes out the other end, I get a perfect impression of that barrel''s rifling. I can then determine the exact barrel size, and select a bullet accordingly. \n\nI know hand loading is not common in Pak, and it''s not necessary to get great results. A similar effect can be achieved with factory ammo. When people experiment with different brands, types, and weights, they are basically doing the same thing... finding a specific bullet that matches a specific barrel.', ''),

I will post pics soon as I am now in the process of nearly refinishing my OEM Rossi grips to New condition again.  Dr Zakir fired it the first time as was and shot the first four rounds in the 10 and the other two in the 9s.', ''),
(631444, ' Salam All,\nI have owned/experienced most .22s on the market over the years.  For the past 8 years I have my trusty P22 Walther that gets cleaned when it starts to jam every two years or so.  I use it at the range often and don''t lube it at all.  I also purchased a SP22 a few years ago... nice gun but a total unconventional feel to it not to mention the disassembly.\nI have loved the Buckmark... but it didn''t feel right for some reason... the trigger guard with the trigger curve felt tight.  I have owned the Contour URX and the bull barrel model with the umbrella sights.  Plus not much out there for this gun. I was disappointed to learn that the aluminum screw that holds the barrel - its threads wear down quickly as it did in the bull barrel of mine.  It doesn''t really offer much as far as trigger adjustments.  \nAlso owned a Smith&Wesson Model 41 - nothing much to boast about there.\nIn the rugers - I have the MKIII Competition model with the volquartsen adj trigger set.  A nice piece, love it.  I used to own a MKIII 22/45 and thats the one I really loved but it was the one with the NON-removable grip panels; hence the grip was too slender and so I sold it.  There is now an optional removable grip panel model i would love to get my hands on.  But straight out of the box nothing kicks ass like a Ruger hands down.\nI also used to own a Beretta Mod87 Cheetah, a very accurate gun.  No problems, but it just sat around the house.  So I just got rid of it.  Also used to own a Beretta 87 Target; a great gun but nothing more than a ''wanna be''.\nHaving said that I will now tell you about a gun I did use for over ten years.  And I would buy it in a heart beat again.  decades ago when I was just buying and having fun shooting I was introduced to .22lr by a range master in the US - a little .22lr pistol.  I looked at it and felt like I was being made fun of.  I mean I was ''The man with the golden gun'' at the range.  I bought my first DE in .44mag GOLD PLATED in 1988.  People talk about getting that now... lolz.  So I look at this little gun and turn to him and say "what in the heck am I supposed to do with this?"  he laughed and told me to take it home and try it for a few days on the farm.  But he clearly stated that he expected it back.  I reluctantly took this pistol back home with me.  I started to fire it the next day.  WOW!  By the end of the week, I had a hip pouch filled with Federal ''bucket of bullets'' and a holster in the same pouch loop.  I was walking the farm and where ever I wanted to I fired.  It was a densely forested area with the nearest neighbor being about 2 miles away.  This little wonder had a fixed barrel, a trigger that glided backwards like the 1911, had rear adjustable sights, and the mag release was at the heel.  And boy was it an accurate plinker.  I will still swear by it.  I returned it back after 5 weeks to a very cross Range Master... God Bless him for introducing me to a great gun and a great caliber.  My search then shifted to the gun itself, I had to locate one.  They are not that readily available - atleast they weren''t back then.  I finally found out that Magnum Research had started to import them in...  I found out while haggling with them to sell me their only gold plated DE they had just started to advertise in firearms magazines.  The gun was a 3.5" or something there Bernardelli model USA.\nThe longer barrel versions are available here.  One of Punjab team''s top shooters has one as well and swears by it.  I tell you it was an inexpensive gun back then but if you can... BUY ONE.  You won''t be disappointed.  As for a proper shooter, I recommend the .22/45 with the 5.25" bull barrel or longer.\nNow the only .22 on my list is the Colt - not the woodsman.  I love it.  There was only one I saw here and it was gone by the time I got there to buy it.  I WANT IT.  \nMatter of fact: If any PG member knows someone who has this Colt please tell me - I will do my best to buy it from that person or dealer:\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]33595[/ATTACH]', ''),

He might even get several boxes and practice a little&#8230; (emphasis added)\n\nNow standing in one corner of a boxing ring with a .22 caliber Colt automatic pistol, shooting a bullet weighing only 40 grains and with a striking energy of 51 foot pounds at 25 feet from the muzzle, I will guarantee to kill either [boxer] Gene [Tunney] or Joe Louis before they get to me from the opposite corner. This is the smallest caliber pistol cartridge made; but it is also one of the most accurate and easy to hit with, since the pistol has no recoil. I have killed many horses with it, cripples and bear baits, with a single shot, and what will kill a horse will kill a man. I have hit six dueling silhouettes in the head with it at regulation distance in five seconds. It was this type of pistol that Millen boys&#8217; colleague, Abe Faber, did all his killings with.

(631460, ' [QUOTE=Fudgepacker;469192]Yes fez, they are the same caliber. In fact, for any given caliber, the bullets can vary in actual diameter by upto .003"\n\nDue to manufacturing tolerances within and between manufacturers, barrels of the same caliber are not all made the exact same size. For rifles I want to achieve ultimate accuracy with, I do what is known as "bore slugging". The process basically involves taking an oversized piece of lead and pounding it down the barrel. When the lead comes out the other end, I get a perfect impression of that barrel''s rifling. I can then determine the exact barrel size, and select a bullet accordingly. \n\nI know hand loading is not common in Pak, and it''s not necessary to get great results. A similar effect can be achieved with factory ammo. When people experiment with different brands, types, and weights, they are basically doing the same thing... finding a specific bullet that matches a specific barrel.[/QUOTE]\n\nwow, I never knew so much science is involved behind taking the bull''s eye :)\n\nThank you very much for explaining so nicely.

(631477, ' [QUOTE=czman;468964]I feel so ashamed....I''m the OP yet I haven''t contributed jack squat. \n\nSo off the top of my head. \n\nLasers. You all know them right? \nThose cheap 100 rupee red lasers kids screw around with. They have warning labels on them. Not to be directly shined into eye. \n\nNow in more detail...those things have a electrical energy output of 5mw. Literally nothing. A tap of your finger makes that much power, albeit in mechanical form. \n\nThat 5mw can cause eye damage. Let''s up the ante. \nA 500mw laser is a interesting thing. It''s powerful enough to set fire to physical things , and provided it is focused properly can be seen in excess of a few hundred meters. Just LOOKING at the dot when pointed on a object for long enough can cause permanent eye damage. Specialized laser goggles are needed to just handle them when on. If your unfortunate enough to look at one directly. Have fun trying to see for the next year or so, and heavily diminished vision for the remainder of your days. \n\nLet''s up The ante further to 1W. Buy a one W led and look at it. Then imagine it focused similarly to a laser. \nLooking at the dot with no protection.... Ugh. A direct hit , you are blind for life. The beam itself can be seen from a few km away. \n\nNow onto WHY lasers damage the eye so quickly. We all know the basic construction of the eye, and the ways light rays are refracted into the retina. And the burning properties of powerful lasers. A already extremely directed beam is refrected further, its all refracted onto one small area, less then a few hundred nanometers cube in area. Then imagine the retina and optic nerve itself burning from inside out.\nNot a nice experience. \n\nNow to scare you all further, lasers of this class are easily available for 100-300USD that are handheld. \n\n\nAnd a small addendum. \nThere is a a GUIDELINE for airline mechanics to tell them how many bolts may be missing from the wing before it needs to be grounded. \nOh and in most planes the lavatory flush pipe is right next to the drinking water tank.( which I sent cleaned in a looong time ) both of these are filled and emptied together at the same time. \n\nStay scared ;P[/QUOTE]\n\nInteresting, \nregards', ''),

(631517, ' [COLOR=#222222][FONT=Times][FONT=arial][SIZE=4]One of the biggest variables affecting accuracy when shooting long ranges is: bullet drop at unknown distances. Some scopes can help eliminate that variable with a series of dots on their retical (crosshairs). The dots are are called mildots and can be used to estimate range. At 100 yards, the distance between two dots is approximately 3.5", at 200 yards it''s 7", at 300 it''s 10.5", and so on. If there is something of a [I]known[/I] height by your target, you can see how many dots it fills up in the scope, and then do the math to figure out your distance to it. For example, a residential door is usually 6.75-7 feet high, if its two dots high in the scope, then we can figure that it''s just over 1100 yards away because at that distance, each dot represents approximately 40 inches.

Who the (presumed) attackers were and why did they commit such a henious and painful crime?\n\nBecause, their children and loved ones were killed too and not simply killed by bullets but often torn into pieces by missile or drone strikes... and not once but their unjustified and brutal killing is continuing from last decade or so... {I am not saying that their this act (if committed by them) is justified but try to understand the problem}\n\nProblem is that tribal people were our asset.. but we made them our enemies by our own mistakes and policies... and revenge and anger is a historical trait of our tribal people. So, problem is not Tribal people or Taliban... they were our strength but problem is our false policies which turn them into our enemies.\n\nSo whats the solution? Solution is not killing them, this will only make both sides weak while our real enemies will benefit... we must address the root cause and that is misguided and foreign dictated policies. If we stop fighting with our own people on the behest of our real enemy and detach ourselves from their criminal alliance, majoriry of the Taliban will stop fighting us.\n\n\nSome of us are just issuing statements out of their emotions and natural anger... However, I very respectfully ask is this anger and grief is on kiling of innocent children?? Yes...!! Really???\n\n\nIf we really condemn killing of innocent children... then did we share same sympathy and agitated in same way when around 80 or so innocent children were martyred and mamy injured in Dama Dola By Missile/drone strike in a religious school (Madrasah)?\n\nDid we mourn for three days when innocent girls were killed and phosphorus was used against them in Lal Masjid...?\n\nThese are just two examples from a huge list... but many of us even don''t remember what that incident of Dama Dola was and when it took place, let alone remembering and condemning it...\n\n\nSo this shows we are not condemning the killing of innocent children on every occasion...! Why we are selective in our approach...?\n\nChildren of APS Peshawar, Lal Masjid and in Damma Dola were innocent and their killing is sad and tragic and those who committed this must be brought to justice... but justice should not be only for children of APS but for evey innocent children martyred whether in Waziristan, Dama Dola, Lal Masjid, or elsewhere..\n\nKilling of innocent children and innocent people is bad and un Islamic... and whoever did this whether America and her ''allies'' or Taliban (if proved) is condemnable.\n\nFor every action there is always a reaction.. but the initiator is more to be blamed than reactionary forces...\n\n\nMay Allah SWT bless all of us to the right path and grant us all and our decision makers courage, will and wisdom to take right decisions in the light of Islamic teachings...!

Pelletier\n Here is a question that came into Pyramyd Air recently. \n [I] I have an RWS model 34 with a BSA scope. Everything is tightened  down securely, but my shots “wander” all over the target even when bench  sighting it. It’s not ME… I shot competitively in the Marines, Also, it  WAS locked in for very tight groups…now I can’t figure it out. Any  advice???[/I] \n [B]Hold it soft for accuracy[/B]\nThe hold you learned in the  Marines for centerfire competition is completely wrong for a recoiling  spring air rifle like the RWS 34. You get away with it when shooting a  centerfire because of the speed the bullet is moving, whether 5.56mm or  7.62mm. If you had been a smallbore target shooter, you would have  learned a completely different hold. \n [B]For best accuracy with an air rifle, hold it this way[/B]\nLet the airgun rest [B]ON[/B] your off hand – nothing else. Don’t grasp the stock with your fingers. [B]DO NOT[/B] rest your air rifle directly on sandbags or your groups will suffer. Rest the forearm on the [B]OPEN[/B] palm of your hand. You [B]CAN[/B] lay your hand on a sandbag, if you like.\n Only [U] [B]TOUCH[/B][/U] your shoulder lightly with the rifle’s buttpad – don’t hold it in tight. And grip the pistol grip with [B]AS LIGHT[/B] a grip as possible. Let your cheek [B]ONLY KISS[/B] the comb of the stock. But try to rest the forearm on the [B]SAME[/B] place and put your cheek on the [B]SAME[/B] place on the comb, [B] [U]EVERY TIME![/U][/B]\n Every facet of this hold allows the air rifle to recoil [B] [U]AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE.[/U][/B] That is the secret to accurate shooting with an air rifle (and with any other smallbore target rifle, as well).\n [B]The “safecracker” hold gets results![/B]\nHold your rifle like a safecracker works a lock – [B]lightly![/B]  That normalizes the recoil and vibration patterns from shot to shot.  With a spring air rifle like the RWS 34, the pellet does not begin to  move in the barrel until the heavy spring-loaded piston has slammed to a  stop! Nobody can hold the gun still against that movement.\n In addition to recoil, your air rifle has many minor vibrations when  it fires. The hold described above allows those small vibrations and the  two-way recoil of the rifle to repeat the exact same way from shot to  shot. When the pellet leaves the muzzle, it’s at the same point in the  recoil/vibration cycle every time.\n If you try to hold the gun tightly, you set up counter-recoil nodes  and counter-vibration nodes that differ from one shot to another and  your groups will be open.', ''),

(631819, ' [QUOTE=D3AD!;469477]... HK417 is very accurate [B]mount a scope and it is a semiauto sniper ready...[/B][/QUOTE]\nMaybe in WWII, but accuracy standards have advanced so much in recent years, it takes a lot more than just mounting a scope to make a "sniper rifle". Today''s sniper rifles ie. M40, M24, M2010, are custom built. To give you an idea, I am actually having a rifle built right now for the sole purpose of putting multiple bullets into the same hole. It will be based on a Remington 700 Tactical by Advanced Armament Corp. I decided on a 223 chambering because it will mainly be used as a training rifle and thus shot [I]a lot[/I], so I needed the economics of a more affordable round. The barrel has a heavy .9" profile to resist warping at high temperatures, and this allows it to put out [I]sustained[/I] accurate fire. The regular profile barrels on milspec assault rifles start stringing shots after about one magazine of rapid fire; which is totally acceptable because assault rifles only need to maintain combat accuracy, or 4 moa, but thats not going to cut it for a modern day sniper rifle. The original barrel is getting cut down from 20" for a more manoeverable length in tight quarters, a manageable length with a suppressor or other muzzle device attached, and for increased stiffness. The final length is still undecided, but I''m thinking 18" would be ideal with a 1:9 twist, because the bullet will then make two full revolutions before leaving the barrel. After the chop job, the muzzle will be threaded and cut with an 11 degree target crown to ensure uniform expulsion of the gasses as the bullet exits. Imperfections from the factory means that the hotter parts get, and the more they expand, the more misalligned they get. This affects accuracy the most where the barrel attaches to the action. So while the barrel is off, its shoulders and the receiver face will be trued to ensure a perfectly flat and even mating surface, regardless of expansion or contraction caused by temperature change. The stock has been glass bedded for a microscopically perfect fit with the action, and aluminum pillars allow the action to be torqued down without deforming the stock. The scope will be a 6.5-20X44 Vortex Viper with 30mm tube and side parallax adjustment. It will be mounted using a pic rail with a 20moa cant built in to extend the range of the scope, along with an integrated recoil lug that hooks onto the ejection port, thus preventing "scope creep". Six hole 0.3125" rings will ensure the lowest positioning and tightest grip possible on the scope. Depending on the scope''s final mounted height, in relation to my head, an adjustable comb may or may not be required. Once the most accurate cartridge is determined, custom turrets will be calibrated for that load. Trigger work is still undecided, but I have specified minimal creep, zero (.001-.002" in reality) overtravel, and a [I]maximum[/I] pull of 2.5lbs. Whether my gunsmith can accomplish that via his own handy work, or whether it will require a replacement trigger group from Jewell or Timney remains to be seen. Thats pretty much all I specified, but it can be taken much, much further. Needless to say, a lot goes into making a rifle accurate. Anyways, I''m very excited about this build and am eager to getting the finished product back soon. I will surely do a show and tell once it''s done :)', ''),

They are the leaves of same tree. The only difference is that some do not directly hit us and some do. Remember, the one who are killing us were once good Taliban. The now good Taliban can turn their guns on us the time they felt that we are not compatible with them.\n\nWho are these Taliban. They were created, funded, trained and equipped by US for their war against Russia. We sold our souls for dollars then. They were then called Mujhaieen. After demise of USSR, US abandoned us. \n\nWe then used these groups in Kashmir. The rest were employed by KSA for sectarian war. But this time, the battle ground was our soil.\n\nThen again US wanted control over Afghanistan, they again gave us dollars and we rebranded those so called Mujahideen as Taliban. When they took over Afghanistan, they stopped listening to Pakistan and US. They thought what they have achieved is due to Allah but they forgot that funds are coming from US.\n\nThen US asked us to help them kill the Taliban which we had created with their funds. We saved some groups we liked (The Good Talban) and left rest of them to die there in Afghanistan (because we did not like them). The groups we left there felt betrayed and tuned against us.\n\nFor last 35 years, we are fighting a war that is not ours. But since our souls are cheaper than dollars, we are in this war. We have misused religion for dollars. We set on fire the neighbors for money. Now that fire has reached home. We deliberately confused people, we proved that war against USSR is ours. We lied that Northern Alliance is our enemy and war against them is ours. It was not our war but since we were getting dollars, that was our war. Our Mulas were getting dollars for Madrissas, so they proved that this war is Jihad. They turned their Madrissa into recruiting camps and training camps. Now they cannot stop that now. They are so used to dollars, riyals and Dirhams that they won''t stop now. \n\nWe have spoken so much lie to ourselves that we don''t even remember that what is right and what is wrong. We have spoiled 2 generations. Some of us think that they are soldiers of Allah. I am just showing them mirror that "No Sir!'' you are just "Mercenaries" who have fought wars for dollars. \n\nTime has come to pay back those dollars with our blood as war has reached home. Now your created Monster is killing you. Now you have to take sides clearly either you are for or against. There is no middle ground.[/FONT][/COLOR]\n[FONT=Times New Roman][SIZE=3][COLOR=#000000]  [/COLOR][/SIZE][/FONT][/QUOTE]\n\n++++1\nGod Bless you Bro, couldn''t have said it better myself. Every word you wrote, is TRUE!\nThere is no such thing as Good Taliban. The thing called afghan jihad was nothing more than a fraud & coverup to destabilise the region & avenge the Vietnam defeat by the Americans. \n\nThese criminals are nothing more than American made mercenaries with no faith or loyalty. Anybody can hire them to do any deed no matter how dastardly. Now these criminals have sold their souls to Indians (RAW)+ other anti Pakistan forces and attacking our cities. It has NOTHING to do with Islam or Sharia. They use this as cover to confuse common Muslims.\n\nAnd to my brothers who are implying that this is the result of some drone attack or something, you are sadly mistaken my brothers!\nThey have been at these dastardly mission of destroying Pakistan for the last 18 years or so!\n\nWhat part did the children of APS play in any attack, drone or otherwise?\n\nWhat part did the children of Hazara community play in any attack, drone or otherwise?\n\nWhat wrong did the Shias do, to these Taliban / Lashkar Jhangvi aka Punjabi Taliban, whom they have been killing mercilessly for last 20 years?\n\nWhat was the crime of religious scholar Dr Sarfraz Naeemi of Jamia Naeemia Lahore, who was murdered by these cowards in suicide blast? This is just one, there are so many others!\n\nWhat was the crime of Sufi elders & Saints, whose graves were desecrated by these criminals in KPK & Punjab?\n\nThese are just a few examples, there are thousands more.\nPlease my brothers don''t be confused!

It gets smoothed out and less hard with use but 2nd stage length remains same. You got to get used to it.\n\nYou said that in 150 shots, it has come down from 960 to about 800 fps. Initially as the dieseling subsides velocity does come down. but it should settle around 930-920 some where. Perhaps a proper lube tune might help, and trigger can also be lubed at that time.\n\nA proper artillery hold is difficult with a gun having a heavy trigger, because a light hold at the pistol grip is difficult with a hard trigger.

(631944, ' Almost all the revolvers we normally come across in routine are [B]Non-gas seal [/B]revolvers. These revolvers have a small gap (known as a flash gap) between the cylinder and the barrel; it allow the revolver''s cylinder to revolve, presenting a new loaded chamber for firing. This necessitates that the bullet jump the gap when fired, which may have an adverse effect on accuracy, especially if the barrel and chamber are misaligned, and also presents a path for the escape of high-pressure and high-temperature gases from behind the bullet.\n\nNow an interesting gas-seal system revolver is [B]Nagant M1895[/B] which was chambered for a proprietary cartridge, [B]7.62×38mmR.[/B] This unique revolver features an unusual "gas-seal" system, in which the cylinder moves forward when the gun is cocked, to close the gap between the cylinder and the barrel, providing a boost to the muzzle velocity of the fired projectile and allowing the weapon to be [B]suppressed [/B]which is [B]an unusual ability for a revolver[/B]. \n[IMG]http://www.christiangunowner.com/images/the-model-1895-nagant-revolver-21251702.jpg[/IMG]\n\nThe [B]7.62x38mmR [/B]cartridge (pictured below along side a 5.56x45), also unique, plays an important part in sealing the gun to the escape of propellant gases. The bullet is deeply seated, entirely within the cartridge case, and the case is slightly reduced in diameter at its mouth. The barrel features a short conical section at its rear; this accepts the mouth of the cartridge, completing the gas seal. By sealing the gap, the velocity of the bullet is increased by 50 to 150 ft/s (15 to 45 m/s). This feature also eliminates the possibility of injury through the dangerous expansion of gases from the cylinder behind the barrel, which are easily capable of severing a finger if the user holds the gun incorrectly (with a finger positioned in front of the cylinder during fire) - a noted safety-issue in conventional revolvers.\n[URL="http://s1341.photobucket.com/user/Jibz77/media/Cartridges/IMG_0823_zpse333b70f.jpg.html"][IMG]http://i1341.photobucket.com/albums/o744/Jibz77/Cartridges/IMG_0823_zpse333b70f.jpg[/IMG][/URL]\n\nHowever, success had its price.

(632016, ' [QUOTE=shahroze;468521]Mian jee those are brenneke slugs. I think we can''t use them in smoothbore shotguns.\nShould I still get them? \nYou can have them if you want to.[/QUOTE]\n\n[QUOTE=Mian Jee;468524]Bhai you can use [B]"Brenneke"[/B] & [B]"Foster"[/B] slugs in any smooth bore shotgun. \nYou are more than welcome to try them in my shotgun any day. \n\n[B]"Sabot"[/B] type are the slugs which are made for rifled barrels.\n\nBuy them if you think the price is right, I''ll have them if you still don''t like them.[/QUOTE]\nI''ve seen a bit of confusion and misinformation regarding this matter on several threads, but MJ is 100% right. Both Brenneke and Foster slugs can be shot out of a smoothbore. The rifling on a slug does not actually spin it. Rather, the rifling is there only so the slug can be swaged (squeezed down to size) as it passes through a choke. I have shot slugs through chokes of all sizes, upto and including full. When you start trying to squeeze them through anything smaller, i.e. an extra full choke, is when things start to get too tight for comfort. \n\nUnlike pistols and rifles, a shotgun operates at relatively low pressures. It is because the barrel is not sealed by the projectile. That may be pretty obvious for buck/bird shot, but even slugs hardly contact the barrel walls and that is why shotgun barrels are so thin, even compared to a 22lr. Therefore, slugs can be shot out of any shotgun, with the exception being: barrels that [I]specifically say[/I] "not for use with slugs", "do not shoot slugs", or something to that effect. But that is extremely rare. The only time I''ve seen something like that was on an old shotgun made specifically for bird hunting, and the light barrel had exceptionally thin walls intended for use only with birdshot. \n\nRegarding saboted slugs, as MJ said, they were designed for use out of rifled barrels, as the whole purpose of the sabot is to grip rifling. But, that does not mean they can not also be shot out of a smooth bore. Doing so will have no adverse effects on the gun or the barrel, [I]however[/I], accuracy will suffer. That is because sabot slugs are designed to stabilize with spin; so without any rifling to impart said spin, the projectile often ends up tumbling through the air. So now, the more astute of you [I]should[/I] be thinking: FP, you just said that the rifling on Foster and Brenneke slugs don''t actually spin the projectile, so how do [I]they[/I] fly true without spinning? Unlike saboted slugs, rifled slugs are designed to fly straight without spin by using drag stabilization. Basically, all that means is that the rear of the projectile is lighter and the front is heavier. So as the slug is propelled out of the barrel, the bulk of the mass (in the front) will maintain is direction of travel, and whenever the lighter tail starts to veer off, wind resistance will bring it back in line with the front. It actually works just like a shuttlecock used in badminton; it doesn''t matter where you hit the birdie, it just always flies front first and the the rear follows. Saboted slugs on the other hand are like American footballs, if you''ve ever thrown one (or watched one in flight), then you know how it simply goes all over the place without a proper spin. \n\nAnother question that often gets asked is; if slugs can be stabilized with just drag and no spin, then why aren''t more bullets designed that way? A bullet that does not spin can technically fly farther, since all of its energy can then be used to propel it forward. Quite simply, its because a spinning bullet is more accurate. A spinning bullet relies on gyroscopic stability to maintain it''s trajectory, and as a result, it is more resistant to outside forces. A simple child''s toy is a good example of the forces at work; just think of a spinning top... you can blow it, push it, or tip it, but as long as it is spinning, it will maintain it''s upright position. \n\nAnyways, I hope that answers some questions and clears up some confusion - at least I hope it didn''t [I]create more[/I] confusion :D', ''),

I have shot over 2000 rounds without any hiccups, I have competed in precision shooting competitions with my Cat and at 15 meters I have been able to score above 185 / 200 a number of times. I have been conceal carrying this full size beast and have regularly used this handgun for tactical shooting drills.I can not even think of trading this handgun for any handgun available in the market below the 100k mark. I would only sell my handgun if I have an opportunity to get my hands on a CZ. The built quality, the features, the bluing, the accuracy and trigger, everything about this handgun is super awsome.

But the thing is that to get the US $ 500 glock the person would have to obtain a export permit from US and then you add the custom duty, freight charges and dealer''s profit so it would go up to at least 120K. It is also very likely that the dealer may take your permit and give you a glock for 150K (I am sure the price would reduce once he knows that we have a lot of permits and we are serious) and he would import something else and sell at a higher market price. \n\nWe can speak to other dealers as well but rest assured that no one can get you a weapon of your choice for an over payment of just 20-30K.

And TN if not handled much would make a great gift for some1''s unborn great grand children.[/QUOTE]\nED, you know I respect your opinion, but the way I see it... this time you''re half right :D\nIMO, with a gun like that (appearances aside), you have an upper that is heirloom quality with a lower that isn''t :lol:\n\nI actually just had a conversation with my father about "heirloom guns". We came to talking about how we both have specific pieces in our collections that are intended for handing down to the younger generations. When he told me about his and I told him about mine, I noticed that not all of them were "$5000, never fired, custom 1911''s" (actually, none of them were :lol:). Indeed some were "safe queens", but there were also quite a few that are regular shooters. So how does a particular gun attain "heirloom status"? What is "heirloom" quality? And what if our descendants aren''t into firearms? \n\nThe first thing I noticed was that price doesn''t necessarily affect a gun''s "worthiness". Looking at the designated pieces, we both had choices that varied from a Nighthawk Custom Heinie Signature Recon 1911(his) and Sig Custom Shop 226(mine) on the expensive side, all the way to a Ruger 10/22(his) and Norinco 1911(mine) on the inexpensive side. Obviously, unique, rare, or custom (ie. expensive) guns, [I]generally[/I] make good heirlooms. But on the other hand, I designated the Norc 1911 as one of my heirloom pieces. It is not my most expensive gun by far, but on the other hand, it is by far the gun that gives me the most pleasure. I have spent countless hours customizing, maintaining, and repairing it, used it to qualify various courses, and even competed with it. I wish I could say it was the first pistol I ever shot; it isn''t, but it is the first gun I ever fully disassembled, it was the first 1911 that I bought (and kept - among many that were bought and sold), it comes to the range with me even if I don''t shoot it, I dry fire it the most, I live fire it the most... and all of that makes it very special to me. The point is, the amount of love, time, and effort invested into an item, could mean even more than the amount of money invested. \n\nNow, no matter how expensive, or how much time one spends on an object if, it is worthless as an heirloom if it can not stand the rigours of time. Again looking at the guns my father and I had selected, something else became apparent: there was no polymer. It was all wood and steel (and some aluminum). I don''t know what my dad''s reasoning was, or if it was just happenstance, but for me it was a conscious decision from the start. This is personal preference, but I don''t impart heirloom status to any of my polymer guns, first because of it''s service life. I know, I know... metals can corrode, wood can decay, and plastic is not biodegradable and it won''t rust... but still, synthetics such as plastic/polymer, even carbon fiber, will fade, become brittle, and generally has a shorter service life than metal. Some may argue the fact and the longevity of polymer is debatable, but the second thing that really prevents me from bestowing heirloom status to synthetics is that they are not repairable. For example, with steel, it can be reblued, scratches can be polished out, dents can be hammered flat, checkering can be recut. Wood also can be similarly restored and refinished. Synthetics on the other hand... not so much. \n\nFinally, regarding the person inheriting the heirloom. It was concluded that their interests are irrelevant. Because what makes an heirloom significant, and what gives it value, is sentiment. For example, I have a watch and a ring from my grandmother. Those items are priceless to me. Not because I can use them for what they are (I don''t wear ladies'' jewelry), but because they [I]were used[/I] by my grandmother. So an heirloom doesn''t necessarily fulfill its purpose by way of its originally designed function, but by serving as a tangible link to the past, as an artifact of personal history, and as a connection to loved ones. \nIf your great, great, great grandchildren are "gunlovers", then more the better :)', ''),

The pistol had not been used  by the security forces personnel while combating the attackers. A  forensic examination of the pistol showed it was licensed and the legal  document of the arm was originally issued from Shahdadkot in Sindh.&#8221;\nThe  findings helped the police investigators track down their four  handlers, who were later identified as Sarmad Siddiqi, Nadeem alias  Burger alias Mullah, Asif Zaheer and Essa alias Master, he said.\n&#8220;They  were arrested in the Tariq Road area and other localities of the  metropolis. The suspects had arranged accommodation in Shah Faisal  Colony for the militants who stormed the Terminal 1 of Karachi airport  on June 8 and had provided every possible logistical support, funds and  arms to the militants,&#8221; the official explained.\nThe development  convinced the investigators to look into this very aspect of the case  and dig deeper to ascertain if licensed weapons were used in the terror  attack only or also targeted killings. Doubts started meeting reality  checks when a forensic examination of several spent bullet casings,  which were seized from the crime scene of a targeted killing, was  carried out, the official said.\nThe findings were later confirmed  to Dawn by the chief of the CID police counter-terror unit and key man  behind the investigations into the airport attack  and other  high-profile cases, Raja Umer Khattab. While terming the trend alarming,  the officer said it could only be addressed through a proper mechanism  of arms licensing currently being computerised in Sindh.\n&#8220;Apart  from that particular case, a few months ago when we raided a hideout of a  banned organisation, we arrested a few suspects and seized four pistols  from them. They all were licensed from Thatta district,&#8221; he said.\n&#8220;Similarly,  it was found that licensed pistols were used in several sectarian  killings this year. Since the investigations are still on, it is not the  appropriate time to disclose details of those killings. \n&#8220;The  Sindh government has taken a very good initiative to computerise arm  licences but loopholes should also be addressed,&#8221; said the CID  counter-terror unit chief. \n\nHe said the use of 9mm pistols in  criminal and terrorist activities had multiplied over the past five  years. While the licensing of 9mm pistols was allowed, the authorities  must also design a process to block every possibility for its negative  use, he said. &#8220;As an urgent measure, the authorities can involve arm  dealers in the licensing process before taking Sindh police&#8217;s forensic  division on board for licensing of every single weapon to keep record of  licensed pistols and their ammunition,&#8221; he said.', ''),

(632345, ' @FA75 My sincere advice since i bought the MP-446 a week ago. Kindly see the gun with a friend or at the shop before buying it. It is not as good looking like other fancy pistols. I visited several arms dealer in Peshawar. Some didn''t even have MP-446. Everything was going in favor of CZ Duty or CZ Rami. But i was determined to buy MP-446. After buying it, i was a little disappointed by the looks of the gun. Once i fired 15 rounds from the gun, my sadness was over. \n\n\nMake sure you see all the guns well before. You must go for a window shopping before buying the guns once. A second visit should be made when you want to buy the gun and you have made your mind for it.\n\nAlso check the following [URL="http://www.pakguns.com/showthread.php?5328-Baikal-Viking-or-Taurus-PT92-AFS/page2&highlight=viking"]thread[/URL]', ''),

AK and 9mm pistols are used by terrorist all around the world so one can''t just come up with a theory that if one is shot by 9mm so it''s licensed no terrorist would like to use a licensed weapon and leave a track behind for LEA to come and track them or catch their handler trust me they are smart enough .

Even over here they are considered very unique, imagine how cool you''d be with one in Pak :D\n\nAnyways, should you decide to go with one of those fancy guns, also keep in mind ways to "support" it. I mean not always, but they [I]can[/I] be finicky. So along with the gun, also get the tools and parts required to work on it, should any adjustments or repairs be necessary. Actually, if you''re going to buy any gun (regardless of how fancy it is or isn''t) that isn''t available locally, it would be a good idea to import all the supporting materials with it. \n\nFor working guns, the FNP 45 is a great choice, I love how it has true ambi controls. You guys may also want to look at HK''s new VP9, I haven''t tried it yet, but I haven''t seen a single bad review and it was voted pistol of the year. I can personally recommend a Springfield XD or Xdm, as I have extensive experience with the type and prefer them over Glocks in most respects. S&W''s M&P''s are also very popular here, although I personally prefer the Springfields. Also, don''t forget the classics like a Colt Single Action Army, Colt Python, or even an S&W Model 29... how can anyone not want Dirty Harry''s gun?! "Do you feel lucky, punk?" :lol: \nSeriously though, there are some very interesting options available now that are a mix of old and new. The Chiappa Rhino is a modern interpretation of the revolver, a "wheel gun 2.0" if you will. It uses high tech materials and updated ergonomics. But in this category, S&W''s TRR8 8 shot revolver is my absolute favourite. Originally designed for LAPD SWAT, it is intended to arm the point man during raids while serving high risk warrants. The idea was to incorporate the utmost reliability of a revolver, with the heavy hitting 357magnum, and high capacity (at least equal to a 1911). It also uses a Scandium frame for light weight and incorporates accessory rails both on top and bottom.\n\nAs for rifles, I don''t know exactly how desirable they are in Pak, but AR''s are ubiquitous over here. There''s good reason for that, but most of it has to do with the aftermarket; if you remove that element, it takes away a lot of the appeal. The SCAR 17 and M14/M1A are great battle rifles. For bolt guns, I would recommend a Remington 700, Savage Model 10/Model 11, Tikka T3 and Browning X Bolt. I have owned all five and still have the Remington and Savages. They are all available in tactical or hunter configurations with various stock/barrel options. Each has its own distinct features and characteristics, and I can''t recommend any single one highly enough. Mossberg has also recently come out with a bolt action with the very unique feature of accepting standard AR mags... 30 round bolt gun anybody? :D The MVP (Mossberg Varmint Predator) has been generally well received and although I haven''t shot it yet, I did take a close look at one and it seems like quality. It has a heavy barrel, fluted bolt, relatively smooth action, and it can even be configured with a laminate bench rest stock, which I thought was very cool! Again, don''t forget about the classics. Single shot falling blocks and lever actions, are very fun options, plus they are unique, timeless, and hold their value indefinitely. Also, everybody with a permit talks about assault rifles, battle rifles, tactical pistols, and high powered sniper rifles, [B]but[/B], don''t forget about the 22! A Ruger 10/22 will provide more fun than any gun just discussed, guaranteed. They can literally be made to be [I]anything[/I] you want....\n[URL]http://tinypic.com/view.php?pic=23uyjv9&s=4#.VKIWJAAAhttp://tinypic.com/view.php?pic=20itfec&s=4[/URL]\n[URL]https://c2.staticflickr.com/4/3035/3063649831_3f41902221.jpg[/URL]\n[URL]http://www.customruger1022s.com/pub/gallery/DSCN1907- 1.jpg[/URL]\n[URL]http://www.ershawbarrels.com/images/common/ruger-charger-web.png[/URL]\n[URL]http://www.rudefatdog.com/tony_c.jpghttp://i.imgur.com/xuYzy.jpg[/URL]\n[URL]http://gordonspecialtyarms.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/10-22K-folded.jpg[/URL]\n[URL]http://www.1022ruger.com/tack-driver-ruger-1022-project-do-it-yourself/[/URL]\n[URL]http://www.gunslot.com/files/gunslot/imagecache/page/images/41548.jpg[/URL]\n...I mean [B][I]anything[/I][/B]!\nThey are [I]affordable[/I] to shoot.

The first time experience with PT 609 was extremely good and its performance was outstanding so I selected 709 slim for easy c.c. as an alternative. But my personal experience 709 was not that good as there was FTF issue with every round. Every bullet above 5th round in the mag was giving problem loading into the chamber as was stucking from the front tip to the feed ramp.

(632505, ' [QUOTE=Fudgepacker;470262]I was just going to suggest a Kimber... or a Nighthawk Custom 1911... those fancy guns are very hard to resist :lol: \nAlso, there are some Sigs from the Master Shop that are extremely beautiful, they have more in common with a work of art than a tool. Even over here they are considered very unique, imagine how cool you''d be with one in Pak :D\n\nAnyways, should you decide to go with one of those fancy guns, also keep in mind ways to "support" it. I mean not always, but they [I]can[/I] be finicky. So along with the gun, also get the tools and parts required to work on it, should any adjustments or repairs be necessary. Actually, if you''re going to buy any gun (regardless of how fancy it is or isn''t) that isn''t available locally, it would be a good idea to import all the supporting materials with it. \n\nFor working guns, the FNP 45 is a great choice, I love how it has true ambi controls. You guys may also want to look at HK''s new VP9, I haven''t tried it yet, but I haven''t seen a single bad review and it was voted pistol of the year. I can personally recommend a Springfield XD or Xdm, as I have extensive experience with the type and prefer them over Glocks in most respects. S&W''s M&P''s are also very popular here, although I personally prefer the Springfields. Also, don''t forget the classics like a Colt Single Action Army, Colt Python, or even an S&W Model 29... how can anyone not want Dirty Harry''s gun?! "Do you feel lucky, punk?" :lol: \nSeriously though, there are some very interesting options available now that are a mix of old and new. The Chiappa Rhino is a modern interpretation of the revolver, a "wheel gun 2.0" if you will. It uses high tech materials and updated ergonomics. But in this category, S&W''s TRR8 8 shot revolver is my absolute favourite. Originally designed for LAPD SWAT, it is intended to arm the point man during raids while serving high risk warrants. The idea was to incorporate the utmost reliability of a revolver, with the heavy hitting 357magnum, and high capacity (at least equal to a 1911). It also uses a Scandium frame for light weight and incorporates accessory rails both on top and bottom.\n\nAs for rifles, I don''t know exactly how desirable they are in Pak, but AR''s are ubiquitous over here. There''s good reason for that, but most of it has to do with the aftermarket; if you remove that element, it takes away a lot of the appeal. The SCAR 17 and M14/M1A are great battle rifles. For bolt guns, I would recommend a Remington 700, Savage Model 10/Model 11, Tikka T3 and Browning X Bolt. I have owned all five and still have the Remington and Savages. They are all available in tactical or hunter configurations with various stock/barrel options. Each has its own distinct features and characteristics, and I can''t recommend any single one highly enough. Mossberg has also recently come out with a bolt action with the very unique feature of accepting standard AR mags... 30 round bolt gun anybody? :D The MVP (Mossberg Varmint Predator) has been generally well received and although I haven''t shot it yet, I did take a close look at one and it seems like quality. It has a heavy barrel, fluted bolt, relatively smooth action, and it can even be configured with a laminate bench rest stock, which I thought was very cool! Again, don''t forget about the classics. Single shot falling blocks and lever actions, are very fun options, plus they are unique, timeless, and hold their value indefinitely. Also, everybody with a permit talks about assault rifles, battle rifles, tactical pistols, and high powered sniper rifles, [B]but[/B], don''t forget about the 22! A Ruger 10/22 will provide more fun than any gun just discussed, guaranteed.

Now the issue is that few days back i was cleaning the piece, that I inherited from my father who inherited the same from his father it was revealed that one of the gun serial no. (last digit)was missing on my licence.I saw my old blue card same issue was there and then the receipt from the arms dealer it too had one digit missing.Most probably its due to serial no. been engraved on breach and the lever was covering the last digit.Only first 6 figures are visible and if we do alot of hassle we can see half visible last digit.Being an imported gun whole serial no. can be traced easily on the fore-grip and barrel.Though the receipt and NADRA record says its exact make and type.Please help what should I do now... request MOI /NADRA with the detail issue stating it as a superficial clerical mistake as the rest of the serial no. along with make and type are correct as per record.', ''),

He stated that process would start from  February 15. Earlier, Jamal Leghari, also a former Senator speaking on a  point of order shocked the House while claiming that nearly 300  children lost lives as a result of recent Peshawar tragedy. Citing  foreign media, he said, the actual toll wasn’t brought to surface and  added that at the moment, when emergency measures were needed to be  taken, no arm licences were being issued to them.\n \nHe said  that under Article 25 of the Constitution, every citizen had the right  to seek arm licence of non-prohibited bore for his security. He stated  that with immense pride, a general statement heard here was that  ‘security situation in Punjab is better than other three provinces.’ On  the other hand, he said all the three provinces were issuing arm  licences to citizens for their security but it wasn’t done here. He said  he had taught his 10-year-old daughter how to use a weapon but even  then she was scary of going to school after vacation just because nobody  would allow her to carry that weapon to school for her security.  Besides, after the explanation by the Home Minister that process of arm  licences would start from February 15, Jamal asked him ‘Will terrorists  also give us time till February 15. Shuja Khanzada, responding to it  stated that almost 1.8 million licences had been issued so far in Punjab  but almost 50 percent of them were bogus. In order to curb this issue,  NADRA would play its role and possess the data of everyone who had been  related with arm dealing. He said the citizens would also be able to get  entire details of their arms through SMS.\n \nLater,  Parliamentary leader of PML-Q Sardar Waqas Moakkel, through a call  attention took up the matter related with the rape and murder of a woman  in Kasur, the minister said three persons had been arrested after this  incident and the case was under investigation. \n \nExpressing  dissatisfaction with the answer, Waqas Moakkel said the incident had  taken place on December 14 but it was strange that forensic lab hadn’t  given the report. Responding to it, the minister said there was a  difference between forensic lab and an ordinary lab where one could get  the report of its choice while paying Rs50. Law Minister Mian Mujtaba  Shuja ur Rehman, while responding to a point of order by Ahmed Ali Malik  told Punjab Assembly that Rs2 billion had been released by the Punjab  government for security of schools and colleges.', ''),

(632574, 'What is life? Where are we heading? Do we know what we want? What do you want to achieve? Have you set your goals? What do you want from life?\r\nBeen through all of this and still am going through. I really can''t understand what do I want from my life. They tell me get good education from a famous institute with good repute and make your life better by getting a making a good career. Well what if i just cant get straight A or a good cgpa. Will people only know me because of my job or what I am? Why do they judge someone like this? If someone can''t get admission in a good university or can''t get a good job does that make him inferior to others does that make him a bad human being? Does that mean he can''t achieve anything in life? Why do others label. That leaves a scar forever. After having been through different highs and lows of life I am still no where.Wake up every day follow the same monotonous routine I think that''s getting the best of me.\r\nMay be because I have become a misanthrope and an introvert. People who are really close to me say i am neurotic.\r\nwell saying people would be exaggerating it and would contradict my own statement. Only two person know that well who have said that, as i generally tend to avoid social gatherings or if i have to i tend to keep keep a small group.\r\nI was not always like this..... like somethings eating you from the inside you get vibes that have you failed life? How can I fail if i don''t even know what is the purpose of life? Before I changed I was really out going really wanted to be help handing still am but not to that extent but people gave me reasons i should not trust them they took it for granted and well I am here now. Still don''t know who to trust, who to call friend. Who to turn to when everything else fails. One thing I have learned is that after your parents the most close you can get is to a person who you are not blood related, others are a mere illusion a temporary image which fades away with time. Sometimes I think we have become heartless souls feeding on to others so you might not feel insecure or you are in identity crisis. Many people I see who hang out with their " Friends " are only because of Money,Fame,connections Or they don''t have anyone else. Its not really our fault we have brought this on our self. All the politics that goes on in families and friends can''t we just stop that and take all the hate and just start on from a new path. Have you ever felt you need someone who could really just understand you. I have been pushed to such an extent I thought giving up was the only option but than my religion tells me its forbidden and in order to avoid this anguish why should i bring more misery and suffering on me. Yes you could say I am weak I don''t have the courage to do it......\r\nSitting in my room as i write this though I had not planned it but it was a impulsive decision. The family and peer pressure really tends to get the best of you. I have become insecure i double think what i am going to say and what the person might perceive it to be and because of this i don''t talk much. Life is complicated I guess. I have to admit one thing which has really kept me going is a quote of our member "skywalker" no matter how bad situation you are in always remember there is someone in worse"\r\nWhen ever i am low and depressed I check pakguns or visit Losmovies.tv That''s the only fun i can get. Life has pushed me on the edge and I am hanging on. Things have not been working out good lately I wish we all could get rid of the hate and just put our egos aside and be humans. But I read somewhere Humans crave conflict that''s what makes us humans if we were all so good there would not be any purpose of this life. Sometimes I tell myself i want to become a skeet shooter but than i think that''s it? Is that all i want from my life? What Life is depends on the person living it. Everyone would have a different definition of life, I for one cant just end life at a worldly acquisition or a designation. Ill have to go deeper but like the person I am I might never find anything about the mystery called life. \r\nWhen you read this just think back, what you did today from morning till now. How many lies you spoke intentionally and unintentionally what did you learn and who did you hurt. Lets change for the good. I want to write on and on but the feelings i have cannot be expressed. Tonight call someone you have hurt or have not been in contact with because the one who says sorry first is the bigger person. Let us end the conflict we have put ourselves in.\r\nMay we become good people and stop judging others........\r\nHakuna matata.', 'Life.');

The 9mm mechanism is not made to handle the pressure of .30. Since the .30 generates lot more pressure fitting ammo in 9mm desi mechanism can kaboom the poor thing. Our Darra Brothers usually make one copy of 9 mm Clone in 30 to boast their sales as 30 ammo is cheap and easily available.

On the inside, they''ve incorporated some nice features, like double action with second strike capability, built in take down tool, true ambi mag release, and short reset trigger(so they claim). But on the outside, it''s a complete knockoff of Glock, from the serrations, locking lug, extractor, trigger guard and sights, right down to their slogan: "Tara Perfection"? Come on now! That may appeal to some people, but it''s a total turn off to me. Even their logo is just an upside down Mercedes Benz star.  I do wonder what it''s price point would be in other markets, where the big three (Glock, Springfield, and S&W) can all be had for less than 75k... Maybe if they had an original look, they could sell themselves as being different, or [I]better[/I].

(632703, 'Reflections on American &quot;Gun Culture&quot; Friends,\n\nI''m trying to get this disseminated as widely as possible.\n\nAs non-Americans--See how many of the Cultural References you can recognize.\n\nFor instance, I have no idea how many 50s and 60s Black and White Television "Westerns" {Cowboy Dramas} you may have been exposed to in Pakistan.\n\nI''m trying hard to get this short Essay Viral--so please post it any and everywhere...\n\n\nWhat is "American GUN-CULTURE"...?\n\n\nWell first of all, let us admit that part of our unique heritage is based on Myth, Legend and what not. So I will mix real historical personages with actors and fictional characters without pausing to distinguish...\n\n\nFor my purposes, it matters little and it isn''t worth pausing often to say. So don''t get the idea that I''m reality challenged.\n\n\nThink of the many tales of Daniel Boone, Davy Crocket and Natty Bumpo or the many iconic drawings of the Pilgrims with their Blunderbusses.\n\n\nFast forward to the American West.\n\n\nWhat a bunch of Hoo-Hah...but Legend needn''t be true to be powerful.\n\n\nA.} Guns, particularly Revolvers were quite expensive back then and Ammunition was comparatively more expensive relative to the gun.\n\n\nBack when a Colt Single Action Army was $20, $20 was an average month''s pay for a cowboy--and cowboy''s were relatively well-paid as Manual labor goes.\n\n\nStill, many of the more expensive handguns go for $1000 nowadays and that''s close to a month''s net pay for many.\n\n\nBut yes, there were quite a few cowboys who had no pistol at all and who didn''t feel terribly disadvantaged.\n\n\nMany who did walk around with a six-shooter would have been challenged to shoot a horse while hanging onto its reins.\n\n\nFor every five Colts that were around back then, there were about three S&W Breaktops but until recently there weren''t modern S&W Style Breaktops available to Movie Prop Departments.\n\n\nThe cheaper Webley Bulldogs may have rivaled the Colts for pure numbers.\n\n\nI read an article maybe twenty years ago that said that more cowboys carried .22 rim fires than all the centerfire models combined.\n\n\nWhat did most cowboys carry a pistol for?\n\n\nTo use as noise-makers to celebrate, get cattle moving or to head off stampedes. To kill snakes at spitting distance. To make a fashion statement and to discourage troublemakers by the sight of a weapon.\n\n\nFor the cowboy who wasn''t a dedicated pistolero, .22s would do all that just as well and both Gun and Ammunition was Cheaper.\n\n\nB.} Duels weren''t fought in the "High Noon" fashion.\n\n\nI think that I read that much digging wielded one such Duel that was fought that way.\n\n\nC.} Some of the First Restrictive Gun Laws were passed by Cattle Towns.\n\n\nNever mind.\n\n\nWhen I was a boy, there were old Roy Rodgers and Cisco Kid movies on every weekend. Lone Ranger was on the TV every afternoon. "Gunsmoke", "Cheyenne", "Branded", "Bonanza", "The Virginian", "Laramie" were all Prime Time favorites.\n\n\nFast forward in history:\n\n\nWe''ve all read and heard about Bonnie and Clyde, John Dillinger, Elliot Ness...\n\n\nSgt Alvin York, etc.\n\n\nJohn Wayne carried a Colt Peacemaker in most of his movies. Then a generation later Clint Eastwood came along.\n\n\nDick Tracy carried a short barreled .357 Magnum. Mike Hammer was known for his .45 Automatic. A score or more of TV Detectives--Public and Private--carried Snub-nosed .38s.\n\n\nAnd who can forget Dirty Harry''s iconic .44 Magnum?\n\n\nThe first Gun that I ever bought was a .44 Magnum--that I hadn''t even known existed until I saw the Movie "Dirty Harry".\n\n\nNow everyone in America is not a member of the "Gun Culture" sadly...\n\n\nBut all these ideons go into the mix.\n\n\n{Nowadays we''re more likely to say "Memes."}\n\n\nBut when we get into real Gun people:\n\n\nWe read and greatly admired Elmer Keith, Mel Tappan, Jeff Cooper, Skeeter Skelton, George Nonte...\n\n\nColonel Askins, Chuck Taylor, Finn Aggard and Bill Jordan were a few of the lesser luminaries.\n\n\nAnd we live in America!\n\n\nCorrect me if I''m wrong, but I believe that America is the only Kun-Tun-Rhee on Earth that recognizes--in much curtailed practice, but still recognizes the Principle--that everyone has the Inalienable RIGHT to bear arms...\n\n\nAnd I think that America is the only Country that recognizes the RIGHT to go armed as a means to defend life and property.\n\n\n{O yeah India recently commissioned their ONE State-Owned Gun Factory to turn out 1000 gritty triggered Webley Breaktops downsized to .32 ACP to arm all India''s women against rape...}\n\n\nI love Webleys, Breaktops and .32s and I''ll bet that I could smooth and lighten the DA Trigger Pull...\n\n\nSo if I had $1800 laying around and had scratched most of my other Gun Itches, I would like to have one of those Indian Lobstrousities--so long as it was offered in such a way that I wasn''t depriving some poor Indian woman of the chance to own one.\n\n\nA year or two ago, the Irish Parliament passed some more anti-gun laws in the Prime Minister''s words:\n\n\nTo pre-empt the development of an American Style Gun Culture.\n\n\nI''m sorry dude, but it takes a century or two to develop an American Style Gun Culture.\n\n\nAn American once asked a Briton:\n\n\n"How can we create an American Oxford"?\n\n\n"You need adequate physical infrastructure, Great Professors, Cream of The Crop Students, Lavish Research and Fellowship Grants...\n\n\n"And 400 Years of Tradition."\n\n\nIreland won their Independence largely by means of Bowler-wearing, Bicycle Riding Assassins who used .455 Webleys. If they had put a "Right to Keep and Bear Arms" Plank into their fledgling Constitution, they could be well on their way to developing their own Gun-Culture...\n\n\nBut sorry Ireland, the day you put the Right to Keep and Bear Arms into y''all''s Constitution starts day number One on your hundred year count-down to Gun Culture. \n\n\nIF and I say IF American Gun Culture is Wiped out, whether all at once or by Attrition, I sincerely doubt that there will ever be anything like it again in the history of Mankind.\n\n\nO some future Society might decide to codify the Inalienable Right to Bear Arms into their political constitution...\n\n\nBut it takes more than that to have American Style Gun Culture.\n\n\nSo we are in a Grim "No Quarter Asked; No Quarter Given" War to preserve our Culture from Total Annihilation.\n\n\nAnd sometimes I hear myself adopt Stances that seem Bleeding Razor-Edged Radical even to me.\n\n\nSometimes I question my Fanaticism...\n\n\nAnd then I realize that we are in a Vast Cosmic Conflict for an Existence that is Far Weightier than mere Physical Existence.\n\n\nY''all--Please do everything in y''all''s power to help fight this good fight.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n.....RVM45', ''),

(632720, ' For the last 200 years, Holland and Holland, along with James Purdey''s and Sons have been known as the two finest makers of sporting guns in the world. Both companies offer a variety of brand new finished guns for sale, but a bespoke gun is one that is made specifically for the client. In this context, the firearms are configured either as a SxS shotgun, OU shotgun, or a double rifle. Bolt action rifles can also be commissioned, but are much less common. Aside from being hand crafted, possessing exceptional levels of finish, perfect fitment of parts, and using the finest materials, what makes these guns truly special is how they are fitted to the individual. Aside from standard measurements such as cast, drop, length of pull, and comb, elements such as how the client''s finger falls on the trigger, how the gun balances in his arms, which is his dominant eye and how it lines up with the barrel, and other special considerations are also accounted for. For the best examples, it will take from that point on, over 600 man hours, and 7 specialized craftsman to complete the gun. There is a barrel maker, action maker, lock maker, an engraver, stocker, ejector man, and a finisher. Then finally, before delivery, there is the small matter of $100,000US... give or take (some engravings alone have been known to cost upwards of $100,000). \n\nI was once lent a Holland and Holland to shoot a couple rounds of trap with. It was one of their lower (probably lowest) end examples, a single barrel 12 bore which "only" cost the owner about $8000. I have also visited the Holland and Holland "Gun Room" in New York, and while there, had the pleasure of handling some of the finer examples of their work. Beautiful wood, gorgeous engraving, and buttery smooth actions, they were $50,000-$75,000 guns. If you asked me whether or not it is worth it, I would tell you without hesitation, absolutely not, not even for $8000. Having said that however, if I won the lottery tomorrow, you''ll be sure to find me at 33 Bruton Street in London... getting measured up for a brand new Royal Over Under :D', '');

Infact I havn''t written on any forum in a very long time... my scribbling skills feel a little rusty but lets see how this one goes...\n\nAfter much hustle and bustle I for the second time decided to purchase Gamo Shadow 1000, why? well few are my observations below:\n[/COLOR][/FONT]\n[LIST]\n[*][FONT=arial]This is the best possible package in it''s price. I got my Gamo Shadow for 15k about a month back, currently prices in Karachi are 13.5k and in Peshawar 10k. Those in Peshawar as always are enjoying the best weapon rates as compared to anywhere else in the country[/FONT]\n[*][FONT=arial]This gun is amazingly accurate. You shall observe once I`''ll start sharing the groups I have got from this gun. I know a very very senior airgun shooter who moved from Gamo to X to Y to Z and then in the end his verdict was that Gamo Shadow is all that any airgunner (springer) should ever need. (anyhow, everybody has the right to disagree, that was his own personal opinion)[/FONT]\n[*][FONT=arial]Gamo Shadow is capable of delivering up to 16.3 foot pounds of Energy (approx. 690fps with Gamo Promag pellets) which make it a strong enough airgun for bird and small game hunting from ranges up to 50 meters (that''s the farthest that I have tried my Shadow, it might be capable of doing more)[/FONT]\n[*][FONT=arial]Even though this airgun might look very feeble but it''s not.

You will not be allowed to carry weapons around but you can keep and use them at farm. But you have to have membership of relevant business association and you have to be income taxpayer. In your case, the membership of dairy farmers association would be required. The income tax requirement may be waived due to agricultural nature. Go to your DCO Office and try meeting him in person and explain your case. Present him relevant document and copy of FIR of the robbery.\n\nThe application of section (dafa) of penal code depends upon Police on case to case basis but the law authorize to use lethal force to safeguard the property and life. But the rule of thumb is that the robber was shot within the boundary of farm.\n\nSince, it is a farm which is open area, there would be place beyond effective range of shotgun, the rifles are preferable even bolt action. If you can get license for rifle, go for 222 or 223 or even 7mm bolt action. Otherwise, get shotguns.

Is it proprietorship or partnership? A registered partnership make things lot easier.\n\nAnyway, for business, you can get licenses in the name of business e.g. XYZ Dairy Farms. The issuance of licenses for business never stopped. You will not be allowed to carry weapons around but you can keep and use them at farm. But you have to have membership of relevant business association and you have to be income taxpayer. In your case, the membership of dairy farmers association would be required. The income tax requirement may be waived due to agricultural nature. Go to your DCO Office and try meeting him in person and explain your case. Present him relevant document and copy of FIR of the robbery.\n\nThe application of section (dafa) of penal code depends upon Police on case to case basis but the law authorize to use lethal force to safeguard the property and life. But the rule of thumb is that the robber was shot within the boundary of farm.\n\nSince, it is a farm which is open area, there would be place beyond effective range of shotgun, the rifles are preferable even bolt action. If you can get license for rifle, go for 222 or 223 or even 7mm bolt action. Otherwise, get shotguns. But whatever you buy, avoid desi weapons (DSA is exception) and buy good quality imported weapons.[/QUOTE]', ''),

Also another thing, I have owned some very powerful chinese airguns before as well but the issue is as you mentioned already in the long run.

(633111, ' When preparing a cartridge for accuracy, handloaders are concerned with something called "runout". That refers to how centered a bullet sits in the case. It is measured in thousandths of an inch with a special micrometer, so even a bullet with very poor runout will look completly normal to the naked eye. A perfect cartridge will have the exact center of its primer, case, and bullet all in complete alignment along the same axis. But most regular factory produced cartridges are rarely perfect, which is why custom ammo is essential for ultimate accuracy. Inconsistent case wall thickness, improper resizing, uneven case trimming, manufacturing tolerances, and poor bullet seating are some of the things that could affect runout.', ''),

(633169, 'Browning Maxus Hunter Premium Grade 3 [B]In the box\n\n[B][ATTACH=CONFIG]33726[/ATTACH]\n\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]33727[/ATTACH][/B]\n[/B]\n\n  Like all Browning semis the Maxus kit provides its new owner with  everything they’re likely to require. Sling swivels, stock shims, a [B]full  set of flush [/B]– [B]fit Invector chokes plus an extended ½ that adds two  inches to the barrel[/B], a trigger lock and a [B]small case of alternative  Hi-Viz bead[/B] inserts all accompany the Maxus in its[B] plastic travelling  case[/B]. The only other option is as to which of the four Maxus models they  opt for. Apart from this, you’re up and running from the moment you  open the case, the only remaining choice being to fit a scope to the top  of the dovetailed alloy receiver. \n\n\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]33728[/ATTACH]\n                                 \n[ATTACH=CONFIG]33734[/ATTACH]\n\n  [B]Assembly point[/B]\n\n  The Maxus goes together in the usual fashion of inserting the barrel  extension into the receiver until it’s fully seated and by sliding the  fore-end down over the mag tube. Its at this juncture you notice the  first difference. \n\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]33735[/ATTACH]\nWhat’s described as the ‘Speed Lock’ fore-end is more  akin to that usually found on an over-under shotgun, in so much as the  profile is more angular and the familiar mag cap has been replaced with a  latch style locking mechanism. By pushing the unit firmly into place,  the metal lever situated at the end of the fore-end is then pushed down  into place, locking the fore-end and barrel to the rest of the gun. \n\nConversely, to remove, the small square button in front of the latch  is depressed which then allows the lever to unlock the fore-end and  barrel assembly. Very neat, very tidy and far quicker to manipulate when  compared to the screw cap system, the downside is that the mechanism  precludes the fitting of an extended magazine tube.\n\n\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]33732[/ATTACH]\n\n\nLike the stock, the fore-end woodwork is nicely grained with a  semi-matte oil finish. A large panel of stippled chequering wraps around  the lower section of the fore-end, whilst two large and small fillets  of the same modernistic yet very effective stippling repeat on both  sides of the semi-pistol grip. \n\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]33730[/ATTACH]\n\n[B]The stock[/B] itself which, like the rest of  the Maxus is indicative of Browning’s new dimensional directive  culminates with a soft, pliable and noticeably effective Inflex recoil  pad.        \n\n[B]Metal to metal[/B]\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]33731[/ATTACH]\n\n  Dependant on the grade the [B]alloy receiver’s finish[/B] is either camo,  black or brushed satin. Similarly, the Grade 2 and 3 engravings both  depict game birds, the 3 accentuating them with gold coloured inlays.  Moving inside the receiver the now time proven two-piece, single-claw  bolt takes care of the detonation process whilst the first of the Auto 5  cues comes into play. \n\nThe Maxus can be [B]loaded[/B] in the usual fashion by  dropping the first shell into the ejection port and allowing the bolt to  slide into battery by depressing the bolt release on the right-hand  side of the action. \n\n  Alternatively, using the ‘Speed Load’ system by pushing the first  round into the magazine, the mechanism automatically chambers the first  round whilst cartridges two and three then enter the new lightweight  magazine tube in the usual fashion. On the left side of the action the  Auto 5 style magazine cut-off lever allows the shooter to discharge the  round chambered or remove it by operating the bolt by hand, the next  round that would normally cycle automatically remaining firmly in the  magazine when the cut-off is pulled rearwards. Conversely, by turning  the Maxus upside down and pushing down on the shell lifter with the left  thumb, a gentle push on the small lever on what is now the left side of  the inverted receiver allows the rounds in the magazine to feed  smoothly back into the shooter’s other hand.\n  The only other control is the safety, the usual although in this case  oversized cross-bolt arrangement situated to the rear of the enlarged  trigger guard, just behind the non-adjustable trigger-blade. Moving  forward, with the fore-end removed the ‘Power – Drive’ gas system is  unusual in that the new larger gas valve is integral with the slide  which in turn increases the cyclic travel by 20%. Whilst smoothing out  the overall feel of the Maxus when the system is in motion, Browning  claim it cuts down on residue build up, a claim that’s fully justified  since even after five hundred rounds the entire mechanism remained  remarkably clean.\n  Lastly the 30” back-bored, chrome lined, steel proofed barrel that in  this instance utilised a 3” chamber. The gloss black tube is topped off  with a 7mm vented rib that culminates in an oft criticised triangular  Hi-Viz bead, moans and groans that don’t stand up to scrutiny. Leaving  Browning’s Portuguese Viana factory with a green triangular bead fitted,  you can, courtesy of the tube of supplied alternatives, change it for  either bright red or solid white. Equally, if the triangular shape  doesn’t suit, a full set of round ones are also provided.         \n  [B]Taking stock[/B]\n  like most wooden stocked semis the dimensions of the Grade 3  Maxus have been well thought out. Here are the exact measurements (at  least for the wooden furniture); drop at comb and heel are an exact 1½”  and 2 3/16” combined with a 14 3/8” length of pull and 7lbs 11oz weight  of pull. \n\n     \n\n    The reason these dimensions work well with the Maxus is that to a  degree they’ll fit most average sized shooters. Combine these with the  evenly, open radiused grip and the Inflex recoil pad and you arrive at a  semi-auto that provides the user with a near perfect view along the  rib, a gun that when correctly mounted is comfortable along with stock  angles and a mechanism that significantly add to the ease of control and  recovery for the next shot. What felt recoil there is, becomes directed  horizontally and uniformly along the length of the gun, and is  dissipated by the overall 7lbs 6oz weight, giving an extremely user  friendly shotgun that will happily digest magnum loads whilst still  remaining soft to shoot.\n  [B]Mixed lot[/B]\n  Used with a variety of loads under an eclectic number of  environments, the Maxus has upheld its rapidly acquired reputation.  After a few minutes with an Arrow Laser Shot - confirming that this  Maxus is one of the more flat shooting single-barrelled semis - it was  initially shot around Rishton SG and Yorkgate GC. Using a selection of  28g Express Supremes and World Cups with ½ choke, the Maxus was on the  mark from the off. With the balance point situated directly beneath the  chamber and even mass distribution, the gun pivots squarely between both  hands. This means the Maxus is both easy to move even on diametrically  opposed targets whilst smooth at all times resulting in a shotgun that  retains its refinement, whilst the new ‘Lightening Trigger’ that’s  claimed to be 24% faster than the rest is still quicker than you’ll ever  be. \n  Moving onto pigeon, crows, squirrels and an unsuspecting ‘Charlie’,  the Maxus continued to impress, all aspects of the gun quickly becoming  familiar especially the magazine cut – off. Loaded up with 36g Express  Supreme Game, the appearance of an unsuspecting fox was quickly dealt  with by pulling the catch backwards, ejecting the game cartridge and  replacing it with a 50g BB. Job done and ‘Charlie’ dispatched, the game  load went back in without having to empty the magazine tube. Similarly,  at the end of the evening, the magazine dump allowed the tube to be  quickly emptied without having to manually keep cycling the action. \n\n\n  [B]All in all[/B], the Maxus proved its worth and adaptability under a  variety of situations and conditions whilst living up to all the claims  Browning have made. As an all rounder it’s my opinion that the Maxus is  probably as near as you’ll get; a single-barrel that can turn its muzzle  to whatever target you’re hunting without having to resort to gadgetry  or abstract designs.     \n\n\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]33733[/ATTACH][TABLE]\n       [TR]\n         [TH="colspan: 2"][B]Technical Specifications[/B][/TH]\n       [/TR]\n                 [TR]\n         [TD="width: 110"][B]Model	[/B][/TD]\n         [TD]Browning Maxus Grade 3\n[/TD]\n       [/TR]\n         [TR]\n         [TD][B]Calibre[/B][/TD]\n         [TD]12 bore[/TD]\n       [/TR]\n           [TR]\n         [TD][B]Action[/B][/TD]\n         [TD]Gas operated semi-auto[/TD]\n       [/TR]\n           [TR]\n         [TD][B]Capacity[/B][/TD]\n         [TD]3[/TD]\n       [/TR]\n           [TR]\n         [TD][B]Barrels[/B][/TD]\n         [TD]28”\n[/TD]\n       [/TR]\n           [TR]\n         [TD][B]Stock[/B][/TD]\n         [TD]Walnut sporter[/TD]\n       [/TR]\n           [TR]\n         [TD][B]Weight[/B][/TD]\n         [TD]7lbs 6oz[/TD]\n       [/TR]\n           [TR]\n         [TD][B]Chokes[/B][/TD]\n         [TD]Flush – fit Invector multi   [/TD]\n[/TR]\n[/TABLE]', ''),

(633233, 'Webley &amp; Scott 912k The Webley &Scott 912k is now for Rs. 180000 in Lahore . Is this price reasonable?  Are you aware of any dealer in Islamabad who has this gun for sale?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSpecs:\r\nGuage- 12 \r\nweight- Approx 3.6 kgs\r\nTrigger- Single Selective in Gold ( trigger pull 3.7 lbs for upper and 3.5 lbs for lower barrel as claimed by manufacturer)\r\nEjectors- Yes\r\nRibs- Ventilated at top and middle\r\nChokes- Cyl, IC, M, IM and Full.\r\nMy first impression was that from outside the gun appeared elegant but little large. It had a top mounted safety lever which functions both as safety and barrel selector. Here the manufacturer could have done a better job for the sake of the optics. The gun employs a conventional Box lock action built on mono block principle. The Box lock action is with minimal no of parts with considerable simplification in cocking and ejecting. The muzzle is threaded to accept extended choke tubes which when installed protrude 25mm ahead of muzzle end. each choke is marked for steel or no steel. The forearm and the buttstock are nicely finished in Turkish Walnut with a little darker shade . The front sight is an illuminated bead which is good for easy acquiring. The recoil is considerably good and recovery for the second shot is perfect.\r\nI have been taking this gun out at the Skeet Range for last three weeks (once a week) and my impression is:\r\nAs far as the looks are concerned it is better than average however it does offer all the features which are currently popular in sporting guns. The balance is good and being a little heavier gives a good follow through. The trigger pull is satisfactory compared to beretta and the ejection is smooth and good (threw empty shells slightly over a meter). The performance of the gun made me comfortable since I have been achieving an average result of 22-23 out of 25 at the range.

In fact almost every Law enforcement agency and army  in the whole wide  world uses this calibre. \n\nAnd it depends what u want to penetrate? A .30 (7.62x 25) round can penetrate a BG and hit the neighbour ''s kid playing hopscotch down the street. While teh 9mm is less liable to do that. \n\nIf you want to penetrate human flesh then the 9mm will certainly do the job.

The stones will depend on the kind of steel we intend to sharpen with it. For example, 154cm is a good steel, but is difficult to sharpen. Once sharpened, it may hold the edge longer than cheaper steels, but that there''s a huge "IF" in between :D\n\nAlso, since this is a very difficult task, like hmd bro said, I think it makes more sense we get local made knives and learn how to keep them sharp.\n\nI am planning to take a few classes from a butcher. Then I am planning to check various Chinese knockoffs, check how they sharpen, and how long they hold their edge. I will then compare them to local knives made from materials that have no specs, rather are classified using jargons given by our local "mistris" :)\n \n\nRegards.', ''),

Even with such unique requirements, I can still choose between a Glock, Sig, CZ, Smith & Wesson, Springfield, HK, or even a Tara.

Stores discounted them 50% ($2000 is what they should have been priced at originally) and they started to move, but Zeiss didn''t want to sell them at that price point so they discontinued the line instead. Nonetheless, it''s still a very nice piece of equipment.\n\nAnyways, I wish you luck bro and hope you''re able to get it mounted soon. Is it possible to get someone to custom make a set? Regardless, you got a great combination and I can''t wait to see it!', ''),

The reason for price hike was "it is used as sniper". :)[/QUOTE]\nEven over here, some [B]genuine[/B] Mosin snipers in great condition and all matching numbers can fetch up to $2000. [I]Genuine[/I] meaning the 91/30''s that were originally configured for sniper use, not just any Mosin with a scope. The original scopes are designated "PE". They use a Zeiss design, and can be identified by their fixed 4 power magnification, an adjustable focus eyepiece, and it is centre mounted, right on top of the receiver (unlike the later side mount systems). It''s interesting to note that those PE mounts can be used on modern optics with a 30mm tube.  A PE scope can also be identified by it''s length; starting at just past the rear sight and ending right before the closed bolt. In the later 30''s, the system was upgraded to the PEM (PE Modernized). Changes include exclusive side mounting, and the focus adjustment was removed in order to speed up production and also because there were complaints that the bad seals on the focus rings resulted in moisture entering the scope. \n\nThe PU scopes that most people are now familiar with were adopted from the 40''s onwards. They are much more common, but again, genuine originals in good condition can still fetch up to $1000. The PU''s have a little less magnification at 3.5X, are much shorter, and smaller. It is known as a "flat" design, where the diameter is practically the same throughout, from the objective lens, to the tube, to the eye piece. The PU mounts also sit higher than the PE''s. This allows more access to the chamber and a better view of the iron sights, but the downside is, it prevents a proper cheek weld. Also, with all of these scopes, although they have windage and elevation adjustment, it''s interesting that only the reticle moves! Unlike what were used to with modern scopes, where the whole sight picture moves, when you make adjustments on these Mosin scopes, you can see the reticle move around in the eyepiece! Anyways, that pretty much sums up my knowledge on the "Mosin Sniper''s", hope it helps!', ''),

Imo, the most important things on a (sporting) shotgun are at the two ends. That is, the stock at the back, which is how the gun fits you and affects your aim.

That''s what I do on my rooftop as well...I only wish our old PG member Naweed was still active. Him, Khilji and Jog3ee have been my inspiration and mentors as far as airguns are concerned. What is really interesting is the technique I have been using. As per theory you are not suppose to put any pressure on the airgun during your hold and let the gun twang as per its natural cycle. However I press down the butt into my shoulder with a certain pressure. If not then the pellets fly all over the place. Increasing the pressure shifts my POI below and decreasing it shifts it above the POA. I have noticed this over and over again and again. So as far as my technique is concerned, I don''t go 100% by the book.', ''),

However I press down the butt into my shoulder with a certain pressure. If not then the pellets fly all over the place.

These rifles were called Dunger. Some  years back, conversion of old rifles with 308 MG barrels have started. Again economies played the role as 308 ammo is relatively very cheap. I have one rifle with 7MM Brno action & MG barrel. Rifle is capable of MOA accuracy with reloaded or quality ammo. However it will shoot 2MOA for whole day with POF  or LC ammo. Which is quite acceptable for hunting wild boars & general plinking. Cheap Ammo has certainly increased Range time & fun. As 5.56 Ammo is history lowest at the moment, We are planning to get one rifle build in this caliber. Receiver will be used from an old Brno rifle in 222Remington. \nThere are two big names in this conversion Ustad Aseel Khan from Peshawar & Sardar naseer hazara fro Quetta. They are building these rifles from last two decades & have their own set of expertise in the conversion. I have ordered a Head space gauge from Brownells in 223 for project.\nGas ports are electric welded & barrel is usually turned on lathe to change the shape. Barrel shank is re cut according to receiver. Sardar naseer conversion is reversible to previous caliber as all the machining is done on the pipe with tweaks to action for smooth extraction & feeding.\nI will try to document this project in a new thread when it will started but rifles & specially BA rifles have little audience here when most of them are interested in hand Guns.', ''),
