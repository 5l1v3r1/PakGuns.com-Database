I guess that''s the impression you probably got when you read a review about this gun, what people actually mean when they test accuracy is  :''How well I shoot this gun'', not how accurate the gun is. There is a Huge Difference b/w the two.\nFor reference, check the Following image and description.                 \nThese were both shot a 15 yards, off-hand in an &#8220;I&#8221; stance. The group on the right is 5 hits out of 5 shots with a group size of 0.79&#8221;. Now I&#8217;m not about to claim I can do that every time, but if you look at the group on the left, it&#8217;s just as good except I missed the group with one shot (you can see it just kissed the target at about 3 o&#8217;clock), still, including the miss, it''s a 1.27&#8221; group.\nYou see how the grouping opened up, not becuz of the handgun''s supposed inaccuracy but becuz of the Shooter error.And all it took was one shot to take a sub 1" group to above 1". So accuracy in review threads is subjective, Not a matter of fact.\nTo be honest accuracy assessments should just be ignored for the most part.\n\n[b]All of that being said, Its a great gun, and it will server you well.[/b]', ''),

(454695, ' [QUOTE=francolino;292458]This one is "Common Snipe" and its sound file is below - sound that you''ll recognize well when it takes off noisily. Normally hunters mix word Snipe with "Common Greenshank" or "Common Redshank" which are also common here & have interesting whistling sounds. Common Snipes are the toughest to shoot if walked up and flushed, treading slowly in shallow marshes (feeding grounds) and ideally require a 24" barrel shotgun with an open choke like e.g. IC and 9# 31g cartrg with very fast reflexes to be shot consistently. If a shooter lets it go after the initial flush, the quarry is more likely to be missed...it has to be taken just after the initial flush. If the shooter waits a bit longer to let it get stable in flight (like we do with quails normally), snipes flip left & right very fast as if delibertely trying to dodge the shooter ;). On the contrary, quails have to be taken with a bit more patience as they get stable in flight after the initial spring from ground. Normally hunters miss quail because of this factor i.e. taking hurried shots immediately after the initial flush. Thus I consider Common Snipes as the toughest wingshooting targets here, but relatively much easier if shot from blind during duck hunting...as they sometimes accidently bump into you approaching towards blind during early mornings on route to their feeding spots. And, their meat is quite good too.\n[URL]http://www.avibirds.com/html/Snipe.html[/URL][/QUOTE]\nNice Information francolino bro. Thanks for sharing.', ''),

(454732, ' [QUOTE=francolino;292458]This one is "Common Snipe" and its sound file is below - sound that you''ll recognize well when it takes off noisily. Normally hunters mix word Snipe with "Common Greenshank" or "Common Redshank" which are also common here & have interesting whistling sounds. Common Snipes are the toughest to shoot if walked up and flushed, treading slowly in shallow marshes (feeding grounds) and ideally require a 24" barrel shotgun with an open choke like e.g. IC and 9# 31g cartrg with very fast reflexes to be shot consistently. If a shooter lets it go after the initial flush, the quarry is more likely to be missed...it has to be taken just after the initial flush. If the shooter waits a bit longer to let it get stable in flight (like we do with quails normally), snipes flip left & right very fast as if delibertely trying to dodge the shooter ;). On the contrary, quails have to be taken with a bit more patience as they get stable in flight after the initial spring from ground. Normally hunters miss quail because of this factor i.e.  taking hurried shots immediately after the initial flush. Thus I consider Common Snipes as the toughest wingshooting targets here, but relatively much easier if shot from blind during duck hunting...as they sometimes accidently bump into you approaching towards blind during early mornings on route to their feeding spots. And, their meat is quite good too.\n\n[URL]http://www.avibirds.com/html/Snipe.html[/URL][/QUOTE]\n\nVery true bro. These snipes are one of the hardest birds to shoot.', ''),

(455059, ' [QUOTE=francolino;292458]This one is "Common Snipe" and its sound file is below - sound that you''ll recognize well when it takes off noisily. Normally hunters mix word Snipe with "Common Greenshank" or "Common Redshank" which are also common here & have interesting whistling sounds. Common Snipes are the toughest to shoot if walked up and flushed, treading slowly in shallow marshes (feeding grounds) and ideally require a 24" barrel shotgun with an open choke like e.g. IC and 9# 31g cartrg with very fast reflexes to be shot consistently. If a shooter lets it go after the initial flush, the quarry is more likely to be missed...it has to be taken just after the initial flush. If the shooter waits a bit longer to let it get stable in flight (like we do with quails normally), snipes flip left & right very fast as if delibertely trying to dodge the shooter ;). On the contrary, quails have to be taken with a bit more patience as they get stable in flight after the initial spring from ground. Normally hunters miss quail because of this factor i.e.  taking hurried shots immediately after the initial flush. Thus I consider Common Snipes as the toughest wingshooting targets here, but relatively much easier if shot from blind during duck hunting...as they sometimes accidently bump into you approaching towards blind during early mornings on route to their feeding spots. And, their meat is quite good too.\n\n[URL]http://www.avibirds.com/html/Snipe.html[/URL][/QUOTE]\n\nNice Brief Advise Dear. Nice share', ''),

We acknowledge the fluctuation in the Price of Caracal Pistols in Pakistan. It is mainly because we haven''t finalized the dealers for Punjab and Khyber Pakhtunkhawah. It is the process. Regarding the price, our Karachi dealer being the only dealer has sold most of the Caracal Pistols between the cost of Rs.\n135, 000/ to Rs. 165,000/. We have now restricted the Dealer to not to sell Caracal Pistols above the retail price of Rs. 85000/. The factory price, shipping, various situations with customs, import license cost, banking cost and huge duty structure add to the cost. As per my knowledge and documentations presented to me, the Caracal Pistols cost between 65000/ to 70,000/ to the dealer when reached in Pakistan.  \nThe dealer has to make money, then the transfer money to other cities and then the retailer makes his profit. We don''t know who is your friend and where he bought the Caracal Gun from and how close he is with the dealer who sold him around the cost price. We cannot force the dealer to sell at his cost price. We can only monitor that the retailers do not sell above our suggested price of Rs. 85000/.\n \nHowever, by realizing your ambitions we will see that if we can arrange to sell the three pistols to you at the rate of Rs. 70,000/ from our own import which we do to sell the weapons to Army / Police Officers at discount prices. But it will take sometime because we have just started the import process for lahore only yesterday. It can take about 20 days till the weapons come out of the custom.

Azhar who can be coordinated in this regard.\n  \nRegards,\n \nDr. Kaiser Rafiq - (MBA, Ph.D)\n \nManaging Director/Partner\nRoyal Emirates Group\nPrincipal Advisor / General Authorized\nHis Highness\nSheikh Butti Bin Suhail Al Maktoum   \nOffice No. 804, Saeed Tower 1\nSheikh Zayed Road, Dubai, UAE.\nOff: 00971-4-3806223\nFax: 00971- 4-3295950\nMob: 00971-50-8738389\n[url]www.royalemiratesgroup.ae[/url]\n[email]dr.kaiser@royalemiratesgroup.ae[/email]\n[email]advisor@sheikhbuttialmaktoum.ae[/email] "\n\nthis mail was recieved in april 2012 thats another story that i got my caracal c in less then that without involving any higher up from royal emirates group :)', ''),

Always remember Allah is our sole protector, not ourselves nor our guards neither our firearms thus a first weapon of choice before leaving your home is Aytal ul kursi and a firm believe.\nComing to the thread, I see pretty sensible comments by most of the members here esp. ED. Jokes apart regarding BGs, there is a point where i tend to disagree with most members. For me life of a BG is not worth a penny let alone\na cell phone. No matter how poor or professional he is, a BG is a BG he chose the path he is walking down himself no\nmatter at what circumstances thus he should also stand responsible to bear the consequences of his choice. The problem of the matter is we as a society have just stopped giving a damn about what is happening around us,\nesp. in the case of street crimes. we are often told to stand down and hand over everything we have irrespective of how cheap or expensive it is because it’s not worth it. This mentality of ours have given\nthese mother F***ing BGs a clean chit to mugged us at free will day in and day out with no or very little resistance from the victim. This is an alarming situation we have to change this mentality for\nthe right start, like a member said everyone has his own faith and believe but there is a Hadith summing it up " If one sees any unlawful act, one must try to stop it by the power of his hand, if he is weak, he should\nspeak out loud condemning it as unlawful, and if the person is weak to the extinct that can’t even raise his voice than should surely believe in his heart that the act is unlawful and un justified, surely it''s the\nweakest sign of eman." And with all due respect we as proud firearm holders are strong enough to use force against this unjustified act. Playing macho is not what is am asking for, but for me killing a BG is "sadqha e\njariyah" these pple are a cancer to our society, who knows how many pple this one BG is gona rob and shot tomorrow who just mugged you today and you had the power to stop him but you didn’t for in your mind you thought it was not worth it.\nWe have to stand up for this cancer someday. Atleast we have to define some clear red lines and for me the red line is when a guy points out a gun blank at you. Of course no one should be that stupid and try to be a macho when the BG\nis pointing a gun at your face, but one should have situational awareness all the time and should act accordingly when the time is right. As far as our corrupt police is concerned well yes they will bug you if you kill a BG, but then again that is the only thing that we expect them to do.\nMoral if we can install generators and UPSs to curb electricity shortages in our homes as the GOP has failed to do so, we can surely arm ourselves with licensed weapons and defend our lives and valuables with it since the GOP has\nfailed at it too.\nJust my two cents.', ''),

We acknowledge the fluctuation in the Price of Caracal Pistols in Pakistan. It is mainly because we haven''t finalized the dealers for Punjab and Khyber Pakhtunkhawah. It is the process. Regarding the price, our Karachi dealer being the only dealer has sold most of the Caracal Pistols between the cost of Rs.\n135, 000/ to Rs. 165,000/. We have now restricted the Dealer to not to sell Caracal Pistols above the retail price of Rs. 85000/. The factory price, shipping, various situations with customs, import license cost, banking cost and huge duty structure add to the cost. As per my knowledge and documentations presented to me, the Caracal Pistols cost between 65000/ to 70,000/ to the dealer when reached in Pakistan. \nThe dealer has to make money, then the transfer money to other cities and then the retailer makes his profit. We don''t know who is your friend and where he bought the Caracal Gun from and how close he is with the dealer who sold him around the cost price. We cannot force the dealer to sell at his cost price. We can only monitor that the retailers do not sell above our suggested price of Rs. 85000/.\n\nHowever, by realizing your ambitions we will see that if we can arrange to sell the three pistols to you at the rate of Rs. 70,000/ from our own import which we do to sell the weapons to Army / Police Officers at discount prices. But it will take sometime because we have just started the import process for lahore only yesterday. It can take about 20 days till the weapons come out of the custom.

(455417, ' Hm, interesting.  Reloading/handloading seems to be much less popular in the USA than it used to be, possibly because of the containerloads of cheap ammo in popular calibers that are being imported from the former Soviet bloc.\n\n I got started because my very first firearm was a 7.65x53 Argentine Mauser and no commercial ammunition was available for it back then.  I had to shorten .30-06 brass to the correct length, swage the shoulder back with the sizing die, fireform it with fast powder, then reload it normally.  After all that, reloading any ordinary cartridge was very simple.\n\n Actually, my wife does all the pistol-caliber reloading.  I''ll set the dies up and she will crank through two or three hundred rounds at a time before she gets bored.\n\n When I was learning how to reload I bought a book called "ABCs of Reloading" by Dean Grennell.  There''s another out there now with the same title.  Grennell assumed you were reasonably intelligent and motivated, but you didn''t know anything about reloading.  So he told you what to do.  The best part was the pictures of what happened if you did something wrong.\n\n At the beginning of the book he said, "Many people get into reloading because they think it will save them money.  In reality, you just get to shoot more for the same money you were going to spend anyway."\n\n\n Reloading lets you shoot guns you otherwise can''t find (or afford) ammunition for, and even for popular calibers, it lets you find exactly what your gun likes for maximum accuracy.  For me, making precision ammunition is part of shooting, like building my own guns.', ''),

(455635, ' [QUOTE=Salman_Ahmed;292796]Agreed , I apologize, I was unaware that this specific handgun is Short, that being the case what I said in my original post is , I don''t think ( personally) this weapons is a Best value purchase at 65k, it ceases to be that the moment it crossed the 55k mark, For me! You definitely value it more than I do.       A couple of things here , 1.Are you planning on shooting Cheap local Pakistani ammo i.e Darra hand and hammer reloads? or do you mean POF Ammo , becuz if its the former, Pls for the Love of 12G...DONT!!!   2.Well it does have deficiencies.I wont go into what I don''t like about it( since you''ve already bought it now), but One huge problem for me is the current price.( which IMO is inflated for no reason other than ''hey I''m the only dealer that has it, if you want this then You pay however much I ask'' )  3.Best accuracy ? how, when, where, compared to what? I guess that''s the impression you probably got when you read a review about this gun, what people actually mean when they test accuracy is  :''How well I shoot this gun'', not how accurate the gun is. There is a Huge Difference b/w the two. For reference, check the Following image and description.                  These were both shot a 15 yards, off-hand in an &#8220;I&#8221; stance. The group on the right is 5 hits out of 5 shots with a group size of 0.79&#8221;. Now I&#8217;m not about to claim I can do that every time, but if you look at the group on the left, it&#8217;s just as good except I missed the group with one shot (you can see it just kissed the target at about 3 o&#8217;clock), still, including the miss, it''s a 1.27&#8221; group. You see how the grouping opened up, not becuz of the handgun''s supposed inaccuracy but becuz of the Shooter error.And all it took was one shot to take a sub 1" group to above 1". So accuracy in review threads is subjective, Not a matter of fact. To be honest accuracy assessments should just be ignored for the most part.  [b]All of that being said, Its a great gun, and it will server you well.[/b][/QUOTE]  Agreed you are 110% right brother i bought this gun for 46K and @65K i should consider other options to. i have a thought that dealers are closely observing our forum and prices of the guns are changing according to the reviews and likeness of our forum regarding any specific gun. For example start posting positive regarding any gun and within next few days prices of that gun will start increasing with dealers. That is what i m thinking at the moment i may be right and may be wrong. Other members Please comment.', ''),

(455646, ' A little research for PG brothers\n\n 	[B][I]Characteristics[/I][/B]\n  	 \n  	[B]Type: [/B]Single Action \n	[B]Chamber: [/B]7.65mm Luger/Para, 9x19mm Luger/Para \n	[B]Weight unloaded: [/B]\n	[B]Length:[/B] 230 mm (with 102 mm barrel) \n	[B]Barrel length:[/B] 98 mm, 102 mm, 152 mm, 203 mm and others \n	[B]Capacity:[/B] 8 rounds\n  	 \n  	The [B]Parabellum[/B] pistole was developed by Georg Luger in Germany, ca. in 1898. The Parabellum name comes from ancient Latin saying [I]Si vis Pacem, Para bellum[/I] -  if you want Peace, prepare for War. The Lugers'' design is based on  earlier Hugo Borchard idea, but Luger re-designed the Borchards'' locking  system into much smaller package. Most pre-WW II Parabellums were  developed by DWM company in Germany, with some being manufactured under  license in other countries. During WW II, many companies, such as Mauser  werke and others, also produced Lugers.  	The first country to adopt Lugers was Switzerland - they adopted the  model 1900 Lugers, chambered in 7.65mm Luger/Para[bellum] round. In 1902  the DWM, along with Luger, by request of German Navy developed new  round, 9x19mm Luger/Para[bellum], one of the most common pistol  cartridges of the world, by re-necking the case of the 7.65mm Luger  round. The Luger model 1904, in 9mm, was adopted by German Navy,  following the German army (Reichswehr) in 1908. Since then, the Lugers  were adopted by many countries and servred untill probably the 1950''s or  so.  	All Parabellums are recoil-operated, locked breech, semi-automatic,  striker fired handguns. All Lugers featured unique locking system,  consisting of two tilting-up bars and short moving barrel. Some early  Lugers featured automatic grip safety at the rear side of the grip. All  lugers also featured frame-mounted manual safety at the left side of the  gun. Lugers were manufactured with different barrel lenghts - standart  german army Pistole 08 (Luger M1908) had 102 mm barrels; Navy models  featured 152 mm (6 in) barrels, and Artillery models featured 203 mm (8  in) barrels. Commercial models were manufactured with barrels ranging  from 98 mm up to 350 mm (14 in), some in ''carbine'' versions, with  additional forward handguard and detachable buttstock.  	All lugers were very erconomical and accurate pistols, especially for  the period those were developed in. However, all Lugers were too  sensitive to fouling and for loose manufacturing tolerances, as well as  too pricey, when compared to more modern designs, such as Browning High  Popwer or Walther P38. \ni was surprised to see that this pistol is a collecter item all over the world and prices of the used ones are ranging from $ 1,300 to $ 5,000. Although outdated, the Luger is still sought after by collectors both  for its sleek design and accuracy, and for its connection to [URL="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_Empire"]Imperial[/URL] and [URL="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazi_Germany"]Nazi Germany[/URL]. Limited production of the P.08 by its original manufacturer resumed when [URL="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mauser"]Mauser[/URL] refurbished a quantity of them in 1999 for the pistol''s centennial. More recently, Krieghoff announced[SUP][URL="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luger_P08_pistol#cite_note-6"][7][/URL][/SUP] the continuation of its Parabellum Model 08 line with 200 examples at $17,545.00 apiece.', ''),

(455934, ' The design of the Model of 1911 was specified by the United States Army over a hundred years ago.  Browning and Colt had produced pistols in various designs for the civilian market.  The Army''s requirements were mostly driven by its cavalry users.  The design the Army liked was the Model 1905 Colt, which didn''t have a safety at all.  Browning figured if you wanted to shoot, you just pulled the hammer back and you were ready.  Lower it with your thumb if you changed your mind.\n\n The Army first wanted Browning to add the grip safety, which was already a feature on some European guns.  They figured if a soldier sitting on a horse dropped the gun, it would be a good idea.  Then they decided that since a rider would have the reins in one hand and the pistol in the other, cocking the hammer one-handed might be awkward when wearing gloves or in very cold weather.  So they requested the safety lever.  The gun would be cocked as soon as it was loaded, and the safety set.  Moving the safety lever was much easier than cocking the gun one-handed, and didn''t have the "oops!" problem if the hammer slipped out from under your thumb.\n\n Yes, the Army requested two safety features that weren''t present on the civilian model.\n\n There wasn''t much of an idea of "product liability" a century ago.

A gun that didn''t shoot when the trigger was pulled would obviously be defective.\n\n The Army spent a lot of time training soldiers how to use the 1911, specifically because revolvers and most other automatics didn''t have such a thing, and they didn''t want some soldier getting killed because he forgot to flip the little lever while under stress.', ''),

Since HP refuses to sell this ammunition to the public, and only produced L7A1 in 1990, 1991, and 1992, and only for the British contract, that means that the entire world''s supply consists of 10,000 cases.\n\nLikewise, within several months of release, BATF banned the importation of the ammunition, due to its being unsafe for use in handguns.

The easiest way to tell that the ammunition is forged, is the absence, or poor application, of a red sealant ring around (and slightly onto) the primer.\n\nAny ammunition marked "L12A1" is either a forgery or stolen, since HP produces it exclusively for British MOD.\n\nThe only other manufacturers of "SMG" ammunition (to my knowledge) are:\n\nIsrael Military Industries (IMI), who produce the ammunition packaged in either plain brown boxes or boxes with the " UZI " logo.

This is how reasonable asking price is determined.\r\n\r\n1. Base Price: 80% of Current Market Price = 35,000 * 0.80 = 28,000\r\n2. Add Demand Premium 10% = 1.10 * Base Price = 30,800\r\n3.

(456137, 'Hatsan Escort Not cycling Properly Dear All, \r\n\r\nI have a Hatsan Escort shotgun, that I bought two years ago, and have fired about a 1000 rounds through it.  I used it on a shoot two days back, and I noticed it was not cycling properly. it would eject the fired cartridge, but but not load  the new cartridgeinto the breach. The new cartridgewould come up, but the bolt wouldnt close shut, pushing the cartridge all the way into the chamber.  This happened about 5 times during 70  odd shots. \r\n\r\n So when I returned home, I disassembled the and found a lot of fouling inside it. The piston was extremely dirty, and the rest of the internals werent too clean either. So I first sprayed it WD 40, and used an old tooth brush too loosen the black gunk. Then I sprayed carb cleaner to blast way even the smallest speck of fouling, after I which I sprayed WD 40 again and let the gun drip dry. This process I repeated 2 hours later until it was absolutely clean, and the lightly oiled the moving parts, and friction areas with Hoppes gun oil. \r\n\r\nThen yesterday, I used the gun again, firing another 60 cartridges, and once again it failed to cycle properly, and on three occasions I had to pull back the bolt to load the new cartridge.  On my return home, I opened up the gun once again, and saw that the fouling was minimal. \r\n\r\nNow the question that comes to my mind is that, why is this gun not cycling properly?  I have been using local Eley cartridges in it. and I used them last year too without any issues. \r\n\r\nDo you think its because of the cartridges, or am I doing something wrong, or is there something wrong with the gun.\r\n\r\nI would appreciate your feedback, especially the gurus of shotguns such as Denovo, 12gauge and numerous other gentlemen.\r\n\r\nThank you!', ''),

(456164, 'Getting The Most Out Of Your Baikal O/U Shotgun - Part 4 [B]AoA Everybody[/B]\r\n\r\nA few months ago I was given a Baikal O/U Sporting for some serious modifications on the request of a friend who wanted to employ his newly acquired Baikal IZH27-EM-1C "Sporting" in the field for upland hunting or atleast make it a dual purpose shotgun. The kind of a shotgun which is easily adaptable to field use as well as sporting use such as skeet.\r\n\r\nAfter a detailed discussion I convinced him that it is pointless to convert a sporting gun into a field only gun. why would somebody buy a Corolla and spend some more money on to it only to convert it into a Mehran? The best modification goal should be to make it a dual purpose shotgun.\r\n\r\nNow when we think of a field shotgun what is the first thing that comes to mind? weight, right? and what is the first thing that hits you when you pick up a Baikal Sporting? its weight, am i right?\r\n\r\nThere you go, we now have a mission or a goal (take your pick:) ). Our goal here is to reduce the weight of a Baikal IZH27-EM-1C "Sporting" to such a level that it can be used for upland as well as sporting purposes with only a slight level of difficulty in either scenario.\r\n\r\nOur goal was to convert this 8.6Lbs beast into an under 8Lbs gun. In simple terms, the mission was to (weight wise) convert a Baikal Sporting into a Baikal field model.\r\n\r\n[B]This is what we did But first a Disclaimer as usual:[/B]\r\n\r\n[B][I]The following content is for informational purposes only.

It is still a bit heavy for field use but we have made it a little lighter for long walks during upland hunting.\r\n\r\n[B]This is what the gun looks like after the modifications:[/B]\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i998.photobucket.com/albums/af103/12gauge-pakguns/Baikal%20Sporting%20Modifications/Pic10.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i998.photobucket.com/albums/af103/12gauge-pakguns/Baikal%20Sporting%20Modifications/Pic11.jpg[/IMG]', ''),

(456180, ' [QUOTE=Salman_Ahmed;294299]Is this the Post you were referring to ? \r\nTrue Hirtenberger L7A1 is pretty rare stuff (only 10,000 cases released to the public, and much of that not allowed for import into the US), and the Pakistanis also COUNTERFEITED Hirtenberger L7A1 as well (which is probably what you''ve seen)....\r\n\r\nA little cut-and-paste fu:\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nHirtenberger has produced two types of SMG ammunition. Both were developed on request for the British Ministry Of Defence:\r\n\r\nL7A1- This ammunition was produced between 1990 and 1992. Many samples exceed the NATO maximum chamber pressure specification for small arms, which is 50,000 PSI (345 MPa). For this reason, the British MOD ceased to use it. It was replaced with:\r\n\r\nL12A1- This ammunition is substantially similar, but uses a slightly reduced charge in order to stay under the 50,000 PSI NATO maximum pressure specs.\r\n\r\nBoth of these rounds feature a 124-grain FMJ ball bullet, and produce a maximum velocity of about 1,500 fps.\r\n\r\nContrary to popular belief, these rounds were not designed for arctic conditions, nor were they developed for the Sterling SMG. They were designed for use in H&K MP5 series SMGs. Although they were undoubtedly tested under arctic conditions, the use of the term "adverse conditions" in its designation is more euphemistic than anything else.\r\n\r\nIn terms of the commercial availability of these rounds, the MOD released 12 million rounds of L7A1 ammunition as surplus. Since the ammunition is packaged in a 1,200 round case, this means that 10,000 cases were released. Since HP refuses to sell this ammunition to the public, and only produced L7A1 in 1990, 1991, and 1992, and only for the British contract, that means that the entire world''s supply consists of 10,000 cases.\r\n\r\nLikewise, within several months of release, BATF banned the importation of the ammunition, due to its being unsafe for use in handguns. This second fact makes the ammunition even more rare in the United States.\r\n\r\nIf offered this ammunition for sale, view the offer skeptically, as the above-mentioned facts limit the actual availability of such ammunition- and likewise, a considerable amount of the ammunition imported into the United States has undoubtedly been fired already by its owners.\r\n\r\nBeware of attempts to sell ammunition which is falsely advertised as " Hirt SMG ammo ". Many dealers, either due to ignorance or fraudulence, will sell standard Hirtenberger ammunition and claim that it is the SMG rounds.\r\n\r\nL7A1 ammunition can be identified by its headstamps:\r\n\r\n''HP'' (for Hirtenberger Patronen)\r\n''90'', ''91'', or ''92'' (year of production)\r\n''L7A1'' (ammunition type)\r\nNATO proof mark (a circle with a cross inside)\r\n\r\nIf the headstamp doesn''t contain "L7A1", it is NOT the SMG rounds.\r\n\r\nSome forgeries of this ammunition have been produced in other nations (particularly in Darra, Pakistan, where many forgery firearms and ammunition are produced for the black market). The easiest way to tell that the ammunition is forged, is the absence, or poor application, of a red sealant ring around (and slightly onto) the primer.\r\n\r\nAny ammunition marked "L12A1" is either a forgery or stolen, since HP produces it exclusively for British MOD.\r\n\r\nThe only other manufacturers of "SMG" ammunition (to my knowledge) are:\r\n\r\nIsrael Military Industries (IMI), who produce the ammunition packaged in either plain brown boxes or boxes with the " UZI " logo. These rounds are black-tipped, but the black tip designates them only as high-pressure, not specifically as SMG rounds; and\r\n\r\nRemington, who have produced a 9mm SMG round loaded with a standard JHP (not Golden Saber) bullet. Any company advertising Remington SMG Golden Sabre rounds is falsely advertising.\r\n\r\nNote that Remington only produces the SMG rounds on a per-request basis, and only for government agencies. Likewise, IMI produces the SMG ammunition rarely (mostly for Israeli and American military contracts) and very few samples of it are in circulation in the US, mostly in the hands of collectors.\r\n\r\nSMG-specific rounds are NOT SAFE to fire in any handgun. There are a few handguns designs which can tolerate it SPARINGLY, but I do not recommend this practice. Remember, the SAAMI maximum chamber pressure for 9mm +P rounds is 38,500 PSI, and the NATO maximum chamber pressure for small arms, including rifles, is 50,000 PSI. SMG-specific rounds meet or exceed the 50,000 PSI mark.\r\n\r\nNote also that SMG rounds are likewise unsafe to fire in many submachineguns, and virtually all pistol-cartridge carbines, since both are usually engineered for 9mm pistol ammunition. Only a very few models of carbines and submachine guns are suitable for firing the ammunition in; if in doubt, contact the manufacturer and ask them about the use of L7A1 ammunition in their guns."\r\n\r\nFound this info on the net.\r\n\r\n[url]http://www.uzitalk.com/forums/showthread.php?66853-Any-L7A1-Ammo-Still-Around[/url][/QUOTE]\r\n\r\nTHIS IS .32 Hirtenberger HP packing:\r\n[IMG][IMG]http://i1063.photobucket.com/albums/t511/gunfreak2/09c2ed49.jpg[/IMG][/IMG]', ''),

(456335, 'Lucky Star Arms market Survey series part VIII Lucky Star arms market survey part VIII\r\n\r\nIn the past few weeks I have been doing the rounds of the market with a number of fellow members who have been kind enough join me. Since I have all but given up hope of getting my hands on a used CF 98. I have now turned my attentions on  local copies.  (I will be sharing a detailed review on local handguns later on)\r\nFirst port of call:\r\n\r\n[b]Javed Armoury[/b]\r\n\r\n\r\nWillys 52 told me about this dealer and I decided to check him out. He had a Zigana F asking 28k and a local Betty clone asking 24k. His Zigana sport looked so like the real thing that I mistook it for an original turk. He informed me that iwas a clone and he was asking for 24k for it. The local betty (matt black) looked nice but he said Zafar-Alam betties wil be coming in the next lot a few weeks later. \r\n\r\nI made a mental note to visit him but I am really not sure if it would be Zafar alam or just another gun that he would claim is a zafar alam.. (After I had expressed my interest in the betty in the window  he said it’s a made-to-order) weapon.)\r\n\r\nI then turned my attention too the AK lookalike shotguns in the market. They looked pretty well made asking price was 24k.. So I looked around some more and he got a tad frustrated. Aap ko lena kia hai (What is it that you want to buy) I guess I was behaving a bit like Ahmed 82 here.  And I know how annoying that can be.. So I left. \r\n\r\nBut in the imortal words of Arnold SWhaz-whatisname “I will be back” No wait. I guess that was General Eisenhower.\r\n\r\n[b]Five Star Arms Company..[/b]\r\n\r\nThis chap showed me a betty clone for 25k and said he will give a lifetime warranty for its barrel. Claiming it wlil not explode. However if its barrel were to explode then the warranty would be the last thing on my mind since I will have other more important things to worry about, therefore I did not give it much thought. He had no idea who had made it though.  Also showed me the Ziggy sports. But refused to tell me the price. He had figured out that I had been doing the rounds of the market and wanted to know what I had been offered.  (If he wanted to know what his competitors were selling he should do it the old fashioned way and get himself a spy). He said he does not do any paperwork. Which means I have to run around and get the weapon registered and try and get a 144 permit on my own.  When I dared ask about the shotguns he plucked the Ziggy from my hand, put away the box and immersed himself in paperwork. I realized I should go. \r\nI left.\r\n\r\nNext day I went to the market with fellow members Zaheer and Usama. And I would request them to add anything that I might have missed.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe met up at [b]Pioneer Arms[/b] Lucky Star Branch. While they were busy talking to Adeel Bhai I was oogling the display case. It has A Glock, A Cf 98, a few ziggies and betties and a sigma along with other goodies.. I got a proper shock when deel Bhai told me they were all copies.. Copies they may be but pretty neat ones. Asking price for most of em were 24k or there about. However Adeel bhai told me that I should not trust the decockers of local weapons. \r\n\r\n[b]Next we all went to Shangai Arms:[/b]\r\n\r\nWe had an interesting chat with Irfan bhai the dealer there. He did not have much to show except some really really neat Shotguns and a few TTs. He also said that new stock will be coming in the next few weeks. He had a Yes an HONEST-TO-GOODNESS Veper 12 MOLOT Clone. At last a  Vepr at an affordable price. So far the only one in the market.   They checked out a few other pieces but heck.. The world tends to lose focus when I cradle a Vepr in my arms. \r\nIt was a prototype though which is why he did not have any more of em around.. And as such the display piece. Unlike the Ak-47s and some werd shapes that I have never seen before that were going for 17k final  he offered the vepr for 20k. He could see how difficult it was for me to put her down.  His version of the Vepr had small accessory rails on both the sides as well. I saw  a drum mag with a capacity of 12 rounds. He told me that yes it can be modified to fit the Vepr. He said that he will take my shotgun as a gift if I buy the Vepr without paying anything for it. I do not like giving gifts to people I don’t know.\r\nAnother person I will definitely be visiting once his fresh stock comes though.\r\n\r\nWe then left for Zaheer Bhai’s home. Where he showed us the rest of his arsenal and treated us to some scrumptious samosas and rolls. \r\n\r\nThanks a lot Zaheer bhai! \r\n\r\nAfterwards,  we left for Usama’s placefor a cup of Tea where he ‘cured’ me of my near pathological terror of all handguns without external decockers courtesy his CZ P07 Duty.  I now think that guns without decockers are neat too. Just not as neat as guns with decockers. \r\nAfterwards, when I was leaving we found to our consternation that I had a flat tire. And my Jack was lost. I would have been in a pretty pickle indeed had Usama Bhai not helped me procure one and indeed helped changed the tire in spite of his bad back. \r\n\r\nThree Cheers for Usama Bhai. (The Dude Rocks)\r\n\r\nIn Part nine I will attempt to highlight some of the malpractices that the dealers indulge in along with dealers to avoid.', ''),

Normally its not very difficult but some times it is.  I have learnt it to such a minimum level that I offer all the Diana airgunner that I am willing to help them.\n\nOur local gun makers dont know what grease and other lubricants should be used and resultantly the gun does not perform well. \n\nI can also help for scopes and mounts.\n\nI am not doing any business, this is 100% free of cost offer.

I''d like to strip it apart and improve performance. Also, I hear about real world FPS performance, how on earth do you measure that?[/QUOTE]\n\nThere may be a lot of things in tuning.\n\nBasic Tune is also called lube tune.  Many guns come from factory bone dry. Its better to properly lube them before using them.  When the gun is opened, there are found many such parts which need to be deburred.  So in basic tune, the deburring and proper lubing of moving parts is included.\n\nThen there are some upgradation.  In such kind of tunes, some better made springs and guides than OEM spring and guieds are fitted.  \n\nThem smoothes the short cycle.  Smothnes in short cycle help precision shots which translates into accuracy.\n\nThere are many more things in tuning. But here it will become too long story.\n\nI dont have the chrono to measure FPS.  One I got it from a friend for a few days.  But now I dont have.  Neither I can afford to purchase it right now.\n\nProper measuring of FPS can only be done through chrono.  But for thumbp rule purposes, we can se the difference in penetration of pellet in telephone directory before and after the tune.\n\nTune is not always for power improvement.  That depends what one needs from a tune.', ''),

(456518, ' @Maverick\nBoth pistols have different POU''s. The PT92, although being quite accurate, is meant to be a service/combat pistol, while the Zigana Sport is meant to a dedicated competition gun. As an analogy, you could say that the PT92 has a similar POU to a CZ75B, while the Zigana Sport has a similar POU to the CZ75 Tactical Sport.\n\nThe PT92 is a great all-round gun and good for everything, while the Zigana Sport excels at target shooting. If you want a gun that you can use for HD/SD and relatively decent target shooting, then definitely get the PT92. If you want a gun to compete in target shooting, then the Zigana is the way to go.\n\nIf budget is not an option, then I would personally recommend getting a CZ75B for SD/HD and the CZ75 TS for competition shooting; both guns excel in their respective POU''s!', ''),

He gave me a few tips, will try them out next week inshallah.\n\nAnd finally, we come to the climax of yesterday''s excursion: [B]RMIshaq[/B] suddenly had the idea of busting thoothis with his TP-9.

All our previous misgivings about the TP-9''s sights & trigger went out window; the sights do take a bit of getting used to, but once you''re sighted in, they''re [B]extremely[/B] easy to line up with the target, and the trigger is now butter smooth after the gun went through a 300-round break-in (which is typical of all Caniks).\n\n[B]Bottomline:[/B] The TP-9, once broken in, is a sheer joy to shoot! :D[/QUOTE]\n\ngood to know ;)', ''),

(456631, ' Brother Tarjan,\nJust to give you an idea the service charges for static guards are Rs/15,000 per guard X 02= Rs 30,000 per month. Both the guards will be civil with a local TT or pump action. You can get exarmed forces guards, ssg even with imported weapons also. It all depends on how much one wants to spend.\nPersonal speaking I trust myself only when it comes to security; while keeping a low profile having my own gun with 144 permit would do the job. Hiring a guard is like exposing yourself to danger. Once you hire the guards you will have to keep them because you have already exposed yourself. This SHUSHKA is not good at all, it in fact is a very dangerous thing to do.\nI also agree to my brothers that in majority of the cases guards are untrained. \nTo me an untrained guard armed with weapon himself is a security threat. Unfortunately what the Govt doesn''t realize is that security has become an industry. Everywhere in the civilized world verification of individuals/citizens is state''s responsibility. There are numerous issues those need to be addressed by the Govt which effects the end user directly.\nJust see for yourself we at least have a medical, theory and a practical test to get a driving license but don''t have to pass any exam to get a WEAPON license. It is so unfortunate that majority of the incidents take place because the individual who is issued a license had never gone under weapon handling training. \nAs per my knowledge no training procedure for an individual to get arms license exists in our country.\nPlease correct me if I am wrong.', ''),

So long as the gun has a DA mode (which in itself is a safety against an ND), a decocker IMO is ample safety.\n\nAs for the TP-9, the entire package is quite attractive. The major concern was the performance of the gun itself. Admittedly, when it was fired straight out of the box, it wasn''t something to write home about; the sights needed adjusting and the trigger was quite lousy (atleast for me, considering I have no experience with striker handguns). Both [B]RMIshaq[/B] & I were pretty initially disappointed. But we stuck with it and, after having shot a good 300 rounds, the trigger was smooth as silk; the initial teething problems and inconsistent pull was completely gone.

The major concern was the performance of the gun itself.

As PG is a discussion forum, healthy discussion is a good sign here and provides the learning oppertunities for all of us. \nAs per my [B]personal[/B] opinion few submissions (though there are lot more factors in detail discussion):\n1. Eley is one of the best cartridge in the World with consistent quality of its pattern, load, smooth feeding and ejecting and hardly misfires  if used in compatible gun.\n2. Shaheen is also a good cartridge in its price when compared to the prices of imported ammo in the market. However its quality control is very poor in batch to batch production. Ordinance Factory is in-consistent in the quality of shot gun cartridges. Misfires, Feeding and Ejecting issues are normal in some production lots. Imagine the situation of a shooter who attempts a mallard or partridge and the cartridge does not fires.\n3. As fasr as No.4, 6 or 8 is concerned, it depends upon the shooting envoirnment, target, gun choke and personal confidence of the shooter.\n4.

Taurus PT99 - This I was looking for some time (discontinued by Taurus) and when the dealer called me up that a near perfection condition one has just arrived, I was there in a shot, inspected fully, fired a few rounds and deal was closed. I abs love this pistol - single hand shooting it hardly has any recoil and it is a pleasure to hold (& look at) such a smooth shooter. Firing pin hits precisely in the middle of the bullet every single time leaving a perfect ''o''!\n\n2. Stoeger Cougar 8000F - this was my first purchase and is my daily CC. I de-blued the barrel to this finish myself - looking for high heat resistance chrome plater. Dealer said I have reduced the market value with barrel mod but there are no plans to sell this very very good SD pistol.\n\n3. Akdal MK1919 - still ''pin pack'' (as the term used by dealers) but will take out at some point. Picture here is not of my weapon. Have some modifications planned for this such as a folding butt.\n\n\nNot pictured:\n\n4. Zastava (Serbia) MK57 - booked & waiting for licence arrival\n\n5.

Unfortunately, my target papers were blown away by wind and some of them landed in muddy water. There was so much information on them that I can not recall it fully but from what I have left and remember, Armscor Subsonic 36gn resulted with the best group followed by Federal Game Shok, Winchester Super X & then Amercan Eagle.\n\nInitially the gun was zeroed during Ramadaan by brother Mustanir on his very sturdy bench-rest. First zeroed at about 30 meters with Armscor Subsonic that gave one inch above the bull at 80 meters with Armscor high velocity ammo. So, the rifle was fine-tuned at 80 meters with Armscor High Velocity at the bull. I continued using the same zero on my first day of off-hand shooting but fine-tuned the zero at 85 meters again with subsonic ammo as Brother Mustanir is a left-hand shooter and I am right-handed.\n\nAs i do not have a sturdy & stable rest, My zeroing was more based on the ''clicks'' after calculating variation between POA & POI.', ''),

Maybe i lack vision , but the only part of the story that made an impact on me was the Humble way of Life of Prophet (PBUH ), which even though we hv been told of many time, i personally keep forgetting and End up indulging myself in this Rat race Of Money/material posessions = happiness.\r\n\r\n2. Certain things abt this story i can''t digest :[b]All of these are directed at the reporter of this Udru Piece which was originally published in Urdu Times, Mumbai, as far as my limited internet search could tell me. [/b] \r\n\r\nThis Article includes No names Of the Author''s Or Reporter''s or references to source material. Credibility? \r\n\r\nNow lets get something Straight : This Article seems to suggest that Isreal , a country, whose neighbours had a stated Aim to remove it from the world map , was discussing whether or Not to buy arms ? had already fought 3 wars with those same countries, and needed convincing to buy weapons ? sounds totally reasonable to me (not)\r\n\r\nThe American resupplying Effort in that war was partly AID, not bought as suggested by the article.\r\nFor reference : the actual issue wasnt Whether or not to buy weapons:\r\n[url]http://hnn.us/roundup/entries/9565.html[/url]\r\nEarly on Yom Kippur day, in the hours between the Mossad&#8217;s war alert and the actual outbreak of fighting, Golda Meir, who admitted that she did not know what a division was, had to make two critical military decisions. Her major military advisors, Defense Minister Dayan, Israel''s most prominent war hero, and Chief of Staff Gen. David Elazar, disagreed with each other over whether Israel should launch a pre-emptive air attack against the Arab forces and whether it should order a general mobilization of all its reserves. Elazar proposed both these moves. Dayan, who was still not convinced the Arabs would attack, rejected them. The two battle-scarred generals left it the 75-year-old grandmother to decide between them. Falling back on common sense and political instincts, she backed Elazar on full mobilization and backed Dayan in ruling out a pre-emptive strike. The Americans, she noted, opposed pre-emptive strikes and Israel might be needing American materiel and political support, she said. Retrospectively, both her decisions proved correct. Although visibly pained by the high casualties, she bore up well during the war. She let her generals manage the fighting but whenever her intervention was needed her judgement proved sound.\r\n\r\nThen-U.S. Secretary of State Henry Kissinger later confirmed Meir''s assessment by stating that if Israel had launched a pre-emptive strike, Israel would not have received "so much as a nail".\r\n\r\nSimilarly the article suggests she said this : Your doubt are well founded, but if we win this war, and defeat the Arabs, history will remember us as the victors, and in history, once a community is know as the victor, it forgets how many eggs they ate and how many times they had food. Whether there was jam, honey, butter on the table, and how many holes they had in their shoes. Or whether the sheaths of their swords were new or old! A conqueror is a conqueror." \r\nHow come i can''t find any reference to this quote anywhere? if its been Said in senate then there should a reference to this.\r\n\r\nThis Article like many others other in urdu print media should always be taken with pretty much a Whole load of Grain[b]S[/b] of Salt.', ''),

(457088, ' [QUOTE=Enigmatic Desires;295313]The license is a non transferable document. That is to say that it is as transferable as your CNIC or your pass port or your driving license. Ergo the gun registered on it is equally non-transferable.  Don''t think of it as a car bro. Think of the gun/ license combo as a  CNIC. Can u transfer yours to anyone else?\n\nAs regards NADRA. Well.. The MOI  will verify your antecedents and check  your records and only then issue a demand note. The weapon will then be transferred to the demand note and subsequently entered at the MOI. \n\nAnd then the demand note will end up at the NADRA office where they will issue the card within 30 to 90 days. In Karachi some dealers handle the process and charge around 25-30k and take a few months or so for completion of the process. But remember they are essentially facilitators. The process has to be followed. Weather u take the help of a dealer or do it on your own. There are NO shortcuts to the process. \n\nSorry and all that. but talking about a gun and holsters is pretty superfluous till u get a license.[/QUOTE]\n\nOf course I know that the license is non-transferable, I''m just confused as to all the different procedures i''ve been hearing/reading.

Maybe some1 can help me understand.[/QUOTE]\n\nAgree. We need to check the authenticity/veracity of what is narrated. At times, people have even made up ahaadeeth to suit their own purposes. We should be wary of that and cite sources (and context) when narrating something as important as hadeeth or an element of sunna''.\n\nFurther, even if upon investigation we come to the conclusion that what is stated is, indeed, correct, we need to examine things in their context. What the prophet said and did has to be considered in context (and, not in isolation) in order to draw lessons for ourselves.\n\nThe lessons that I draw (and there may be many others) from the quoted narrative is that the Holy Prophet (SAWS) lived a simple life. That he did not consider it appropriate to accumulate wealth and, therefore, had few possessions (amongst which were his weapons).\n\nHowever, the fact that he had few possessions and that his weapons were amongst those few possessions, should not be taken as an automatic affirmation of the (and, here I am borrowing from macroeconomic theory) "guns versus butter model". \n\nThe Holy Prophet (SAWS), through what he said and how he lived his life, in addition to other things, also underscored the importance of feeding the poor and educating ourselves. \n\nSo, yes, indeed, defense has to be catered to but, equally, we must educate our children, provide health facilities to care for the sick, and feed our poor. \n\nAnd, to understand things we must look at religion and the examples set by the Holy Prophet (SAWS) in totality rather than taking isolated incidents or quotations (i) without investigation and (ii) without context.\n\nThere are other things to note here, as well. From what we see on TV (of Arab and our own rulers'' lifestyles), and from what is narrated in the Golda Meir story, it seems that Golda Meir lived more simply (for e.g., she made tea for her visitor, herself) than the followers of the Holy Prophet (SAWS). \n\nAlso, if the story is true, then we must appreciate Golda Meir''s propensity to learn good things even from those she disagreed with in terms of religious beliefs. And, we may consider the following excerpt from a Forbes magazine article ([URL]http://www.forbes.com/2007/08/05/india-higher-education-oped-cx_prg_0813education.html[/URL]) to assess if there may be something we could learn from Israel in terms of the importance of education and the fact that they did not choose guns over all else but also gave education top priority:\nQUOTE\nIndia''s real infrastructure problem--with no solution in sight--is not airports or electricity; it is the virtual nonexistence of graduate education and research in information and other crucial technologies. Consider this for starters: The U.S. produces about 1,400 Ph.D.s in computer science annually and China about 3,000. By stark comparison, India''s annual computer science Ph.D. production languishes at roughly 40. That number is about the same as that for Israel, a nation with roughly 5% of India''s population size. \nUNQUOTE \nLastly, some less illustrious proponents of "guns versus butter" - just to give us all some fruit for thought:\n\nIn a speech on January 17, 1936, Minister of Propaganda [URL="http://www.pakguns.com/wiki/Joseph_Goebbels"]Joseph Goebbels[/URL] stated: "We can do without butter, but, despite all our love of peace, not without arms. One cannot shoot with butter, but with guns." Sometime in the summer of the same year, [URL="http://www.pakguns.com/wiki/Hermann_G%C3%B6ring"]Hermann Göring[/URL] announced in a speech, "Guns will make us powerful; butter will only make us fat."\n\nSo, in conclusion, I would humbly suggest that we discuss weapons and weapons related stuff on Pakguns and avoid subjects, which may be perfectly good subjects to discuss elsewhere, but which may detract from the specific purpose and objectives of this site. Religion and politics are very important parts of our lives but there is a time and place for everything. Feel free to start a new forum (the domain [URL="http://www.Paklives.com"]www.Paklives.com[/URL] is already taken, though) but, if you wish to avoid sermons from me, pls stick to the objectives of Pakguns on this forum :-) \n\nWa''assalam', ''),

(457976, 'CARACAL CARACAL CARACAL F Review/Project... Salam All,\n \nCaracal, Caracal, Caracal is all I have been hearing lately from everyone.  Then here on PG a new thread called the Caracal Club...  I had seen and checked out this gun about three to four years ago.  The so called official agents for Caracal then wanted somewhere in the neighborhood of about 3500/usd for a piece.  I laughed and stated to them back then - its not a Glock and nor will it ever be.  Sooo, having said that should the next logical statement be that the gun is no good?  Absolutely not, it is a great gun, its ergonomic grip feel is better than most.  The trigger though smooth initially has a longer take to ignition than some others but then those some others out there in the market were imported with high powered springs.  Anyways, I am not going to dwell on whose better. \n \nA while back I was bored with nothing to do so I decided to make this Caracal F my project.  I wanted to go out and buy and then see what all the hype is really about.  Why the Caracal F?  I have always been a fan of full size pistols.  Anyone will tell you that in SD or for sporting purpose world - size matters.  Caracal F in my opinion is small enough as is and there shouldn''t be a need to go smaller.  I can holster and hide the Caracal well as I can many other handguns with ease hence I am Big & Sexy... lolz.\n \nAfter two days of ownership and dry firing, I realized that the trigger on Caracal can be made better and more smoother.  I started to search out You Tube websites to see if there have been any dis-assembly videos done on this gun, I found one but not too detailed.  I did pay attention to the parts in the video which stated that some items need to be installed properly for working.\n \nI also noticed that I didn''t like the rear sight set-up.  This has been my biggest peeve with this gun.  I don''t like being told that this is it about anything, I like options.  And when it comes to sights, there should always be options.  So the rear sight had to go.  So what sight should go on it as there are no custom sight manufacturers out there who make stuff for this gun?  Although, accurate, its a combat gun, if Caracal manufactured a sports version then an adjustable sight would be perfect; however, this is meant for combat and  a fixed sight will have to suffice.  I decided on a clear-wide/deep notch fixed sight.  Why?  As one starts to age, the vision also goes, that so called "I can see the target, front sight and the rear sight clearly at the same time" also begins to deteriorate.  A person can only focus on one thing at a time and when we are young, our focus on these three things is very quick giving the impression that everything is seen clearly.  As we age, this back and forth focus slows down.  This is why we are told to always leave the target and the rear sight blurred and focus only on the front sight.  Also the light bars one see between the front and rear sight need to be more pronounced.  Most combat guns don''t have the clear light bars, most competition guns do whether its for fast shooting or for target shooting.  I needed to address this issue for me.\n \nLastly, I wanted to work on the grip.  I am wondering why with all the funding Caracal has over any other company(s) who all started out small - would they make a grip which has the same problem as most other polymer guns out there...  traction on the grip.  In humid climates, the hand slips and slides.  I see many at the range re-adjusting their hand/grip after each shot.  There are many option(s) (textures) this company could have and should have chosen to make the grip texture more aggressive meaning anti-slip.\n \nHmmm, what else?  Well, nothing, Caracal is a great gun and there is nothing else for the average user to worry about or dwell over.  I wish there where more options for Caracal not only in production but also in parts accessories.  I guess all is due in time.  The lines are very rounded and lean giving it a nice look and feel.\n \nI couldn''t wait anymore for the right day so on the fourth day of ownership, I decided to go ahead and take the slide apart.  After three hours or so, I decided to proceed and work on the frame parts... including the grip.  I was done with the slide, frame and grip by about 2am.  The sight work required milling and was a task for another day.  The trigger was tried out the very next day as I couldn''t wait.  Glockcohlic was there, and saw me shoot plates over and over again, single handed, at 25 meters.  Yes, that last sentence is correct.  Aside from that, I had three instances where the gun had FTF, that problem was solved by polishing the inner lips of the magazine towers.\n \nCaracal is a great gun.  It should not be compared with other guns.  Just like other guns its trying to find its own place in the market.  If it was made just like a Glock or S&W or a better example is the 1911, then and only then would you compare it to the other.  I was thinking about doing a proper shootout between a first gen Glock and the Caracal F for comparison but after going through it realized its not necessary, one cannot compare apples to oranges - those who think they can should visit me for a lecture.\n \nUAE has come up with a good concept.  I would like to see them add to it.  There should be a longer slide model with adjustable sights (plain black).  It would be great to see a Compensator target model.  I would like to see the trigger safety changed - its the same as Glock... wobbly.  It should have been more like the Steyr M9 design - thick as like the custom triggers offered for Glock to eliminate play.  I know its originally designed to be a strict combat pistol but I am not talking about the Caracal F now I am talking about the theoretical models which if made CAN and WILL exceed in civilian sales over military sales.  Certain items need to go as there is no need for them as I say they are just gimmicks and they are the cocked indicator and the color coding grip strip.  Caracal also does need to update their service quality, I sent them an email over two months ago regarding a part and have yet to receive a reply.   Yet again, I will state its a great gun.\n \nOkay, my hand are now hurting, its been a looong time since I typed so much at one time.  I will let my video and pictures do the teaching/talking.  I apologize for the poor picture quality thanks to I phone.  AND if anyone at Caracal management does see my video and likes it - I would like to have them send me TWO fiber optic front sights as gift along with those nice black Caracal logo t-shirts (xxl please), my email address is [EMAIL="paradigms67@hotmail.com"]paradigms67@hotmail.com[/EMAIL] for further correspondence... lolz.\n\n[IMG]http://i1109.photobucket.com/albums/h427/pyramids99/1001.jpg[/IMG]\n\n[IMG]http://i1109.photobucket.com/albums/h427/pyramids99/1012.jpg[/IMG]\n\n[video=youtube_share;ei6-1Sqb1rI]http://youtu.be/ei6-1Sqb1rI[/video]', ''),

The difference between the original and clone is that the metallurgy on the original has been carefully thought on, while on a clone its more of a hit or miss (Read miss in over 90 percent cases). \r\n\r\n@ALL, please avoid clones, especially 92 clones.\r\n\r\nRegards.', ''),

(457672, 'Gas Ram or Springer [FONT=Arial][SIZE=4][FONT=Arial][SIZE=3]Dear Friends,\n\nI thought that there should be a separate post containing discussion of Gas Ram.  Following  may be interesting for you.\n\nRegards,\n\nUmair Bhaur\n[B]\n\nFollowing is an extract from one of my American expert with some modifications[/B]\n\nRam driven rifles can be good hunters. \n\nThey normally do not achieve the reliability, consistency and accuracy a good  metal-springed gun can.  \n\nThere are TOO MANY variables in the shot cycle when using several  O Rings, one valve, and lubricants that are "finicky" with temperature  and pressure. \n\nJust feel the difference  between summer and winter?\n\nSo taking a few shots now and then (as in hunting or  plinking) is OK. Taking 10,000 to 30,000 shots per year is a no-no for gas ram. \n\nIf a metal spring breaks you  usually get some reduction of power, some sounds tell you that something  is wrong, but you can still shoot. When a Ram dies, that''s it. It  is a catastrophical failure. Some of them may be re-built, but not all  of them. Many die overnight. \n\nIF you have a rammed  rifle in your collection of 5 or more  airguns and you use it more or less regularly for hunting or plinking,  they are OK. \n\nIf you shoot ONLY ONE gun, then you''re better off with a steel-springed rifle. \n\n[B]From an other airgunner[/B]\n\n[/SIZE][/FONT][/SIZE][/FONT][FONT=Arial][SIZE=4][FONT=Arial][SIZE=3]I had one in a  Patriot for a time. I prefer the coil spring over the ram if you are  willing to tune the gun. The ram is a tune in a box as far the spring  goes. You will still get forward recoil just no buzz just a solid thunk.  They will not give you a velocity increase. They are also quite  expensive and they do need replacement after a time. Mine leaked down  after about 5 years[/SIZE][/FONT][/SIZE][/FONT]\n[FONT=Arial][SIZE=4][FONT=Arial][SIZE=3]\n\n[/SIZE][/FONT][/SIZE][/FONT][FONT=Arial][SIZE=4][FONT=Arial][SIZE=3][B]extract from one of my American expert with some modifications[/B][/SIZE][/FONT][/SIZE][/FONT]\n[FONT=Arial][SIZE=4][FONT=Arial][SIZE=3]\n[/SIZE][/FONT][/SIZE][/FONT][FONT=Arial][SIZE=4][FONT=Arial][SIZE=3]Gas Rams, Gas  Springs and Gas Struts are all the same. Some of them are Air/Gas shock  absorbers, so they will have a controlled leak in them with the spring  and the means to return to stable operation after a while. \n\nWe need to remember that the first TRULY SUCCESSFUL Gas Ram was made in  Argentina, some 25-27 years ago and that it was only Theoben''s bullying  (in no small measure aided by the Falklands War outcome) that got the  Argentinians to stop making their version. \n\nSo, they have been here for a long time. \n\nWhat is different now are the materials. Seals are better, shafts are  better, lubricants are better, gases are more controlled. So that makes a  difference. And, if anything, that is what is truly patentable. Most  other aspects wouldn''t stand a chance in an international patent court. \n\nYou also need to ALWAYS bear in mind that 90% of the airguns sold, get  used a few times when they are new and then get put away and not used  for a substantial amount of time. Sometimes decades. VERY VERY VERY few  really get used the way we use ours. So manufacturers also bank on that.  Something may fail, but only when used and by then the warranty will  have expired or the paperwork lost. \n\nThere are commercial GasSprings manufacturers that make GasRams suitable  for most airguns [U][B]without a center stem. OUR problem with the Diana  layout is that all pistons, to my knowledge, have a center stem and it  is very difficult to make a Reliable, Hollow, Gas Ram. I am not saying  it is impossible, just very difficult. But, who knows?[/B][/U] it MAY be just  around the corner. \n\nGas Rams have a "novelty" factor. They also have a marketing behind  them. Who has read of the new silicone steel wires that are now used in  the metal spring''ed guns? I bet that only a handful. And what about  the newer and even better materials? Some of them even having Niobium,  Aluminum, Copper, Molybdenum, Vanadium and even rare earths as minute  percentages in their alloys? \nWe can now alloy steel with things that would not have dreamed of a decade ago. \n\nPersonally, having owned a few Gas-Rammed rifles, I would not go back to  them. They are hard to cock, they are not reliable, they are not  efficient (A Diana-52 needed 45# of cocking effort instead of the 35# that  it requires with a metal spring to provide the same Muzzle Energy; An RX-2 needed  controlling and re-filling to get back to specs every quarter). So, I do  not see a reason for them. The "leave it cocked crowd" can certainly  have my sympathies and my best encouragement to improve on their  field-craft. But, not for me, thanks.  \n\nFor NOW. \n\nAs materials get more advanced and as mechanizing and fitting become  more and more perfect, I may still find someone to make a GOOD Gas Ram. \n\n\n\n\n\n[/SIZE][/FONT][/SIZE][/FONT][FONT=Arial][SIZE=4][FONT=Arial][SIZE=3]\n[/SIZE][/FONT][/SIZE][/FONT]', ''),

Than You Can Get good Bag Even With Desi Guns Or Sunshine Cartridges Too. I have believe In It. Actually In My Opinion True Hunting sports Guns Are S*S or over Under. Still A large Numbers of Good hunters In Europe Specially Like to Shoot Birds With Fix Chokes Side By Side or Over Under. Even Bretta Auto Loaders mother Land is In Europe. USA Is The Country Where Most common Wing shootings guns are Auto loaders.[/QUOTE]\r\n\r\nMasroor sb, u r lucky indeed to have seen those kind of waterfowl waves back in 1988 and around. Since when have these birds become this scanty as we see nowadays during migration especially. \r\n\r\nMigration times should not affect those waves as all ducks HAVE to pass our routes and then reach Sind waters....BUT this does not happen now. Now either too high flights are seen passing over your blinds or, few days (very few) available for those ideal duck migration and decoying. By that, I don''t mean no duck shooting opportunity now... I have had some really good shooting myself in the last few years including last season too, but, situations are quite competitive and dicey now... DICEY meaning they can shift either way anytime unexpectedly - in b/w khawari & a good shoot.\r\n\r\nYes, reason for autoloaders in USA is: steel shot and magnum etc cartrgs for waterfowling, & even turkey hunting. Thats where the real advantage of repeater is. Europeans are as I know more into upland, grouse, quail, pheasant. In USA there is a duck/geese craze both which require semis. No harm with semis actually. But the pleasure of shooting a classic SxS English for example with fixed (say 1/4 & 1/2) chokes and double trigger is matchless. But Masroor sb, who will pay 10 lacs plus for such guns nowadays and go into hunting areas which have additional security problem always. These classic guns are beyond one''s budget in general, if bought new. Majority in use are inherited by hunters from their seniors. So the world is shifting to practicality & economies of scale with soaring labor costs and that has a certain cost to it. Even in England and Europe, these so called classics (SxS, NIB) are afforded by Lords/Nobility there, not the commoner. But then there is another issue ....What is the weapon one is so used to firing since childhood? You would have been using a SxS since start probably. I have been using for example autoloaders since start (Remington 1100 at early age, then Ber A303 & then Teknys)... How can a person so used to the feel of a single sighting plane since childhood, suddenly adapt to double guns such as SxS even if he does. So, there is another angle to it too.\r\n\r\nAlso, the gunfit issue??? SxS or O/U unless properly fitted to a shooter especially LOP/DAC/DAH/Cast...will create problems with one''s shooting espec at flushing game which essentially requires the perfect gunfit. Aya#4 or Aya#2 e.g. have a certain fixed dimensions. Except the LOP, nothing can be changed whereas majority of repeaters have shims etc for that purpose.

[I](The funny part is you identify the BG in front of him very openly so that he can be well aware of who identified him)[/I].  every time they had some new nonsense faces and nothing concrete. a clear wastage of of time and energy and money as well.  you know "Isko Day, Usko Day" during the court proceedings.[/QUOTE]\n\nSorry to hear that bro. Sounds very frustrating but I know the score back home aswell. Talking about the UK, I actually work for the world''s biggest and a globally established security firm. Instead of disclosing my role or going into too much details lets talk about the Security Officers and Security Industry in the UK in general.\n\n People working within the Security Industry in the UK must go through very strict screening and vetting process. Anybody applying for a job must do proper training in order to obtain a Security Industry Authority Licence or known as the "SIA License", and then there are different types of that License each individual has to do the appropriate training according to their roles they wish to undertake etc. The training for the SIA License entails different units which are taught during the course and one must pass atleast 4 solid exams in order to obtain an SIA License. The main units contain topics like, UK Security Laws and regulations, other related Laws, Conflict Management, Physical Intervention/ Self Defence, Different types of equipments I.e types of Fire Extinguishers and Fires, Chemicals, Maunual Handling, Types and Methods of Communications etc. \n\n A CRB check or a Criminial Record Buereu is also a must requirement. This is to check their previous criminal record or history. Any one that has any previous criminal convictions are often denied an SIA License, depending on the nature of offence and how long ago it took place. One of my friends who went to school with me had a conviction for ABH (Actual Bodily Harm) but was stil granted a license because the offence took place when he was a young teenager and still at school so It was just a school fight but now he is a responsible grown up and since then has never been in trouble with the Law. but incase of any serious offences like Robberies, Burglaries, Rape etc, one will not get an SIA license. \n\nOnce the SIA License is granted they can then start applying for jobs. When a company for example our company is interested in you after reveiwing your application you ar then called for a properface to face interview where you are grilled with many different questions and scenarios by asking things like what would you do in this situation that situation, or how would you handle a situation where your colleague might be under attack or their might be an emergency etc. Then customer handling questions, Cummunication Skills both written and verbal, Role Plays daccording to different circumstances and situations, Smell Test (where they make you smell a lemony smelling object and something else and ask you which one was what, they do that so they know when you are working somewhere on a site and incase if there is a gas leak or fire smoke so you can notice it imediately, Data Protection Act questions etc and many more are asked. There are sometimes hundreds of candidates and only 1 or 2 positions but you have to fight your way in and then they only select the one who they think is the most suitable for the role taking their previous experiences into account. \n\nAfter the interview their previous record is checked via a CRB check or a  (Criminal Record Bureu), also all your previous employers are contacted for previous employment reference. You then also need to give two prsonal references outside work too and have to put down all the previous addresses you had lived at during the past 5 to 10 years. Once you are successful you receive a phone call or a letter informing you of the interview outcome and folowed by a contract to sign and send back via the post and an induction day is also arranged. Then once you start work further training takes place and the first 6 months is your probation period where your learning skills the way you do your duties, customer service skills and punctuality etc is closely monitored, should they not be happy with you, the probation can be extended for another 3 months, If you improve you are made permanent, if not then its a hand shake and bye bye. \n\nA regular criminal check is carried out on all workers each year, and if you are convicted of any offences outside work you will stil lose your job even if that had nothing to do with your job or work place but because of the fact you now have a criminal record they still dont want you no more. It happend a colleague of mine 2 weeks ago. A fight outside work or whatever it was took place 2 years ago and he must have been charged/ convicted but he kept quiet about it so he did get away with it for a year or two but a recent CRB check during his promotion revealed that incident so he lost his SIA licence hence the job too but when you loose your license you can no longer work for any security industry in the UK. \n\nThis is what a British (Security Industry Authority) License looks like.\n\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]12427[/ATTACH]\n\nAll Security Officers in our company have to be First Aid Trained. Our Training First Aid Certificate is valid for 3 years, after 3 years you are sent for a refresher or a renewal course to Warrington or Glasgow, you get put in the Holiday inn hotel or other top class hotels for 4 Days all inclusive, incl your travel cost, meals, taxies breakfasts everything. The First Aid Training is quiet intensed you do non stop role plays on dummy patients I.e giving them CPR''s, Using Defiblerators, practise bandage techniques to use on heavily bleeding casualties or dealing with imputated body parts, shock treatments, calling for help or emergency services etc. There is also an exam at the end of the course which you to pass. You only get two chances, If you fail twice you fail the course and then you can no longer continue to do the job that you are doing as you have to be First Trained so you automatically lose your job too. \n\nYou also get physical intervention training when training for the SIA License but UK Security Officer or even the Police Officers dont carry any guns. Except the Armed Response Unit, they only come when there is a need for it I.e if the attacker has a gun or an offensive weapon like a sword etc. No TT''s or Pumps are given to any one working within the Security Industry in the UK.', ''),

(457844, 'Tokarev TT-33; Pics n Range Report Last week i bought a Russian TT, the 1952 made TT-33 Tokarev (last of the production line years). It was more of a collection item to me, til i found its greatness at the range. These are produced in huge numbers between 1933-1952. It was eventually replaced with 9x18mm Makarov in 1952, but still remains a heart-throb for many gun-enthusiasts. \n\nThere are 2 models in the Market, one with WIDER SLIDE SERRATIONS and another with SMALL SLIDE SERRATIONS. Both are genuine, the only difference is that post WW2, the models were produced with small slide serrations. Like other Russian Handguns i have noticed, there are proof-marks and multiple numbers stamped on different parts of the pistol. Every part is given a number. Its visible in some of my pics.

(457847, ' The Differences Between Men and Women\r\n\r\nLet''s say a guy named Roger is attracted to a woman named Elaine. He asks her out to a movie; she accepts; they have a pretty good time. A few nights later he asks her out to dinner, and again they enjoy themselves.\r\n\r\nThey continue to see each other regularly, and after a while neither one of them is seeing anybody else.\r\n\r\nAnd then, one evening when they''re driving home, a thought occurs to Elaine, and, without really thinking, she says it aloud: "Roger, do you realize that, as of tonight, we''ve been seeing each other for exactly six months?"\r\n\r\nAnd then there is silence in the car. To Elaine, it seems like a very loud silence. She thinks to herself: Geez, I wonder if it bothers him that I said that. Maybe he''s been feeling confined by our relationship; maybe he thinks I''m trying to push him into some kind of obligation that he doesn''t want, or isn''t sure of.\r\n\r\nAnd Roger is thinking: Gosh. Six months.\r\n\r\nAnd Elaine is thinking: But, hey, I''m not so sure I want this kind of relationship, either. Sometimes I wish I had a little more space, so I''d have time to think about whether I really want us to keep going the way we are, moving steadily toward ...I mean, where are we going? Are we just going to keep seeing each other at this level of intimacy? Are we heading toward marriage? Toward children? Toward a lifetime together? Am I ready for that level of commitment? Do I really even know this person?\r\n\r\nAnd Roger is thinking: ...so that means it was ...let''s see ...February when we started going out, which was right after I had the car at the dealer''s, which means ...lemme check the odometer ...Whoa! I am way overdue for an oil change here...\r\n\r\nAnd Elaine is thinking: He''s upset. I can see it on his face. Maybe I''m reading this completely wrong. Maybe he wants more from our relationship, more intimacy, more commitment; maybe he has sensed -- even before I sensed it -- that I was feeling some reservations. Yes, I bet that''s it. That''s why he''s so reluctant to say anything about his own feelings. He''s afraid of being rejected.\r\n\r\nAnd Roger is thinking: And I''m gonna have them look at the transmission again. I don''t care what those morons say, it''s still not shifting right. And they better not try to blame it on the cold weather this time. What cold weather? It''s 87 degrees out, and this thing is shifting like a goddamn garbage truck, and I paid those incompetent thieves $600. \r\n\r\nAnd Elaine is thinking: He''s angry. And I don''t blame him. I''d be angry, too. God, I feel so guilty, putting him through this, but I can''t help the way I feel. I''m just not sure.\r\n\r\nAnd Roger is thinking: They''ll probably say it''s only a 90-day warranty. That''s exactly what they''re gonna say, the scumballs. \r\n\r\nAnd Elaine is thinking: Maybe I''m just too idealistic, waiting for a knight to come riding up on his white horse, when I''m sitting right next to a perfectly good person, a person I enjoy being with, a person I truly do care about, a person who seems to truly care about me. A person who is in pain because of my self-centered, schoolgirl romantic fantasy.\r\n\r\nAnd Roger is thinking: Warranty? They want a warranty I''ll give them a damn warranty. I''ll take their warranty and stick it right up their ....\r\n\r\n"Roger," Elaine says aloud.\r\n\r\n"What?" asks Roger, startled.\r\n\r\n"Please don''t torture yourself like this," she says, her eyes beginning to brim with tears. "Maybe I should never have ...Oh God, I feel so....." (She breaks down, sobbing.)\r\n\r\n"What?" says Roger, totally perplexed.\r\n\r\n"I''m such a fool," Elaine sobs. "I mean, I know there''s no knight. I really know that. It''s silly. There''s no knight, and there''s no horse."\r\n\r\n"There''s no horse?" says Roger.\r\n\r\n"You think I''m a fool, don''t you?" Elaine says.\r\n\r\n"No!" says Roger, glad to finally know the correct answer.\r\n\r\n"It''s just that ...It''s that I ...I need some time," Elaine says.\r\n\r\n(There is a 15-second pause while Roger, thinking as fast as he can, tries to come up with a safe response. Finally he comes up with one that he thinks might work.) "Yes," he says.\r\n\r\n(Elaine, deeply moved, touches his hand.) "Oh, Roger, do you really feel that way?" she says.\r\n\r\n"What way?" says Roger.\r\n\r\n"That way about time," says Elaine.\r\n\r\n"Oh," says Roger. Still hoping he''s on the right track he responds, "Yes."\r\n\r\n(Elaine turns to face him and gazes deeply into his eyes, causing him to become very nervous about what she might say next, especially if it involves a horse. At last she speaks.)\r\n\r\n"Thank you, Roger," Elaine says.\r\n\r\n"Thank you," says Roger.\r\n\r\nThen he takes her home, and she lies on her bed, a conflicted, tortured soul, and weeps until dawn, whereas when Roger gets back to his place, he opens a bag of Doritos, turns on the TV, and immediately becomes deeply involved in a rerun of a tennis match between two Czechoslovakians he never heard of. A tiny voice in the far recesses of his mind tells him that something major was going on back there in the car, but he is pretty sure there is no way he would ever understand what, and so he figures it''s better if he doesn''t think about it. (This is also Roger''s policy regarding world hunger.)\r\n\r\nThe next day Elaine will call her closest friend, or perhaps two of them, and they will talk about this situation for six straight hours. In painstaking detail, they will analyze everything she said and everything he said, going over it time and time again, exploring every word, expression, and gesture for nuances of meaning, considering every possible ramification. They will continue to discuss this subject, off and on, for weeks, maybe months, never reaching any definite conclusions, but never getting bored with it, either.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Roger, while playing racquetball one day with a mutual friend of his and Elaine''s, will pause just before serving, frown, and ask: "Norm, did Elaine ever own a horse?"', ''),

(457943, 'Trail Cruiser - Another 4x4 Love Story While restoring & modifying the [URL="http://www.pakguns.com/showthread.php?9660-1975-(BJ40)-A-Love-Story"]1975 Land Cruiser BJ 40[/URL], I learnt many new things. Made some mistakes too. Many new ideas & concepts crossed my mind as well.\n \nWhat I learnt during the due course was, it is always practical, efficient & economical to use a bone stock vehicle without any modification for restoration, modification or upgrade projects. As, the vehicles dimensions are not tempered with. Main body structure & frame stands in their original lines. Therefore, balancing body panels while denting & putting bolt-on components, may it be original parts, body panels or aftermarket (vehicle specific) accessories is a piece of cake.\n \nThe vehicle mentioned above that went thru some modifications & upgrades already would have been a sheer waste of time & money spent already on that machine.\n \nHence I decided to get a stock & unaltered vehicle in genuine condition. Where to find one? Yup, the Pakistan Army auctions. As we know, they are the least used, least abused & absolutely unaltered vehicles available here. Even after almost 3 decades in service, the structural & design integrity of these vehicles is just perfect. Except those that get involved in accidents and are rare cases.\n \nSo, in quest of finding a better specimen for resto-mod, I ended up buying three auctioned FJ40 over a period of few months. By the time, the work on the first one had already started and the third being the best in condition, I sold out the 2[SUP]nd[/SUP] vehicle as it was.\n \nPlan was to restore one of the vehicles to absolutely factory specs and make it look as close stock as possible. That would have been my prized vehicle (like a collection thing) as I love this shape. But while it was taking shape, my uncle (father-in-law as well) requested (ordered) that vehicle to be transferred to his possession as he also likes them very much. Though I knew he will never drive it as I wouldn&#8217;t have, and it proved true later on, I had to give it away. Now it stands in his garage covered.\n \nThe second vehicle was my hobby vehicle and I had some plans queued for it. So, eventually build-up process of both vehicles started somewhere in 2011.\n \nI have summarized most background details that are scattered on different built threads on Pakwheels & IJC for my dear fellow readers.\n \nHere is the link to the 1[SUP]st[/SUP] vehicle build-up that is in stock specs. :\n \n[URL="http://www.pakwheels.com/forums/4x4-clubs-off-roaders-suv/152067-2-more-fj-40s"]Pakwheels &#8211; 2 more fj 40s[/URL]\n\n [ATTACH=CONFIG]12463[/ATTACH]\n\n\nAnd here is the one for my favorite Trail Cruiser:\n \n[URL="http://www.pakwheels.com/forums/4x4-clubs-off-roaders-suv/172676-toyota-fj40-trail-cruiser-build-up"]Pakwheels &#8211; Toyota FJ40 Trail Cruiser Build-up[/URL]\n\n [ATTACH=CONFIG]12464[/ATTACH]\n[I][B]Sincere note[/B]: This is the best time to get hands on auctioned Toyota Land Cruiser 40 series vehicles as most or all of them have been auctioned by Pakistan Army & because of abundant supply of them in the market, the prices & choices are at their best.

Center point and Leapers are the same scope with different markings. These are made in China but the best Chinese products!!!!!!\nMany companies selling scopes at 1/4-1/20 the prices of other good scopes get them made in China but they don''t lack in anything and are as good (of course maybe not feature wise)\n\nI think Chinese Bushnell replicas are very common here and they may be of varying quality made by different companies/factories. As Gamo stamps they''re name on Chinese scopes they get good ones of invariant quality as even Al Sayad sells them. So Gamo would be good for the airguns as airguns have more recoil than .22s, and if the Bushnell is with more magnification it can be utilized on the .22.', ''),

The Stingray, however, is a very rare beast; I have only seen two here in Lahore, one at Orient Arms last November (asking was 50K) and one at Buksh Elahi in June (asking was 55K).\n\nStingray\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]12469[/ATTACH]\n\n\n[B]PRICE RANGE: 55K-70K[/B]\nOnly one pistol falls in this range, Canik55''s latest offering, the TP-9. The price actually varies from city to city, but a general rule of thumb is, the further north you go, the cheaper the firearm/ammo becomes. For example, [B]RMIshaq[/B] bought his TP-9 from Chaudhary Arms here in Lahore for 55K, whereas [B]Enigmatic Desires[/B] bro reported the TP-9 going for 70K in Karachi.\n\nTP-9\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]12470[/ATTACH]\n\n\n[B]PRICE RANGE: UNCONFIRMED[/B]The price ranges of the following Caniks is relatively unconfirmed; as in, I personally haven''t seen them so as to confirm their availability/price.

(457996, 'Peep sight or aperture sight for airguns is a very good choice Here is an extract from "pakistan first" post of "Rifle" forum.  It is so good that there is no need of much amendment so I reproduce some part of it.\n\n[U]"Open rear sights came into use centuries ago. Nothing fancy -  just a spring steel ramp with a sliding stepper to elevate or lower the  common V/U opening. The only usable/meaningful improvement was a slider  ramp with about twenty graduations for indication of elevation setting -  not a precise mechanism, in most cases requiring a screwdriver for  adjustment.\n \nCompetition shooters have long known the benefits that peep sights offer  - refined adjustment of 1/4 MOA (1/4 inch at 100 yrds) or even finer  adjustment capability. Add to this the even more important necessity -  repeatability. You can move the elevation/windage knobs up and down and  be able to come back to the original setting, if needed. This  exceptional benefits is derived from the fact that these sights are the  micrometer-type, based on precisely threaded screws that are used to  move the elevation and windage directions. Repeatability of of this  level is not available in optical sights - no matter if they cost  thousands of dollars. You can have the optical manufacturers claim  debunked by asking if their elevation/windage is based on precise  threaded screws.\n \nOpen sights require alignment of rear sight to the front sight and both  sights in turn to the target. With peep sight you only need to align the  front sight to the target and pull the trigger. With a peep sight, the  eye instinctively centers itself in the peep hole - thus requiring only  the alignment of the front sight to the target.\n \nMany rifles come drilled and tapped to accept commercial peep sights.  Sights are also available for receiver bases that are customarily used  for mounting optical sights. Over the years I have used Lyman and  Williams peep sights with delight. Try a rifle with peep sight. Shift  the elevation/windage knob just one click and see the resulting minute  impact point movement on the target. You will be impressed what a peep  sight has to offer."[/U]\n\nBased on my personal experience, I recommend all those airgunners who do not have access to good airgun rated scopes to use peep sights.  \n\nYou really do not need to purchase expensive peeps rather you can make home made peep in just a few hundred rupees.\n\nIt will give you consistantly the accuracy which a 3x to 4x scope can give.\n\nHere are some pics for your interest.[ATTACH=CONFIG]12473[/ATTACH][ATTACH=CONFIG]12474[/ATTACH][ATTACH=CONFIG]12473[/ATTACH][ATTACH=CONFIG]12474[/ATTACH]\n\nRegards,\n\nUmair Bhaur', ''),

What happens is when you fully relax the elevation knob, it does not apply adequate pressure on the scope tube and it relaxes; then if you fire some shots the relaxed tube is prone to move within the scope hence hampering your accuracy. On the other hand If you fully tighten the elevation knob it may put excessive pressure on the tube, hence damaging it.\n\nDoes you airgun have a barrel droop issue?? try shimming if you suspect it to be a drooper (many break barrel springers are droopers). Google to find out more about barrel droop n shimming.\n\nHope it helps, if not change the scope immediately and wait for those centerpoint ones to be back in stock', ''),

Removable sights. Trijicon/Tritium/Adjustable/Novak as options.\n2). The slide realize should be extended a bit. Perhaps make the whole area on the left side of the frame where it says "Caracal F" a slide release.\n3). The loaded chamber indicator should be colored not plain black.\n4). The disassembly lugs should be made or atleast coated in polymer.\n5). The extractor needs redesigning. I''ll attach a sample CZ extractor design compared to the Caracal. Although the Caracal one might be more robust/efficient it is at times erratic.\n6). The belly of the slide / firing pin area should be covered / enclosed and ideally the firing pin should be easily removable like the CZ Shadow.\n7). The trigger assembly needs to be made more resilient to sand and specially mud. It needs to be protected.\n8). Quality of stamping on the Slide could be improved.\n9). The magazine springs are too rigid, almost impossible to load the 18th round by hand. \n10). Glock like 33 round extended magazines would be great. [/QUOTE]', ''),

They''re not wrong, but that method has its drawbacks. In a stress situation, fine motor skills evaporate. Operating a small, oddly-positioned lever with shaking, sweaty hands will be problematic at best.\nFor competition purposes its probably faster to use a slide release than sling shot the Slide, But in the context of a combat pistol , I think its  a perfectly ok as it is. \nHowever this would be a good place, where After market , or factory made options can come in handy. \n\nNo. 10 : I think that has been sorted out already :[url]http://www.caracal.ae/new/highlights.php[/url]\n"Some of the CC10 features are a short travel trigger, magazines with 15, 18 or 30 round capacity (magazines are interchangeable with the Caracal pistol family) "\nJust need to get those imported.', ''),

Finally, I took it out, took out the mag, checked to see if it was empty, locked back the slide, and gave it to the guy who had started the topic. He checked it, gave to the guy next to him and he gave it to the next guy. Now you see, three guys handled the weapon, anyone could''ve silently slipped-in a round in the chamber, you never know! Now the third guy who had the weapon put it to one''s balls and fired. I went breathless! I immediately took it from him. I was so stupid that I again handed it to the first guy. Took it from him again, checked if it was empty, put the safety on, put the mag in, and holstered it.\n\nNow this is something that one should never do, take out one''s weapon to show it to his friends, and that too at a public place. You see, now all those people know I have weapon and where I keep it, and you never know who might get any "bright ideas", including the so-called "friends". Now I''m scared; because I go to that place alot and people can easily spot you if you''re a regular.\n\nMy first point in this thread is, never take out your weapons while with friends unnecessarily.\n\nMy second point was to ask for advice about if I shpuld go to that place again and act like everything is normal, or should I "disappear" for some time for people to forget this episode where they found out that "this" guy carries a firearm? And also, should I avoid seeing this group of friends for some time so that they also forget about this for the same reason?\n\nI would like feedback from all, especially seasoned and trained army and police personnel because they are "trained" in every aspect.\n\nThank you all.\n\n\nAs-Salaam Alaikom!', ''),

When I am in Pak[/FONT][/COLOR][COLOR=#222222][FONT=Verdana] I never leave home without my handgun no matter wherever I go. Not that I am scared, but it has rather turned more into a habit now. And I did notice one thing that exposing or flashing your weapon in front of your friends, or even cousins or so called relatives, intentionally or unintentionally, in most cases it achieves nothing but an unwanted &#8220;high profile&#8221; . The so called friends andeven some relatives could be quite hypocritical. They''ll often make you feel asif you doing something very wrong by carrying a gun but they''ll often do it themselves. [/FONT][/COLOR][COLOR=#222222][FONT=Verdana]\n[/FONT][/COLOR][COLOR=#222222][FONT=Verdana]\nIn future It is best to keep your weapon or gun concealed for many different reasons. Forexample to keep a low profile and plus also the last thing you want or need is let your enemy or a BG, Dacoit or whoever know that you are armed, because Godforbid If someone is planning something against you and they mean business, they will do it anyway but the only difference will be is that they''ll come well prepared for younknowing the fact that you are armed. I am not referring to you directly but just giving you a general example. In any kind of defense scenario whether its SD or HD Youshould always surprise and shock your enemy with an unexpected surprise that they are not expecting and are not prepared for, that&#8217;s when you get one overthem.\n\nAlso passing your gun around, people usually tend to have a habbit of fiddling around with the gun once they have it in their hands, like un-necessary blow backs, chambering/ de-chambering it playing with the hammer and trigger etc which could be a major safety threat and could often lead to major incidents. I know its hard telling them not to do so because you dont want to upset them, thinking they might get offended. so best not to hand it over or take it out in the first place. \n\nAs far as today&#8217;s story is concerned, to me it sounds minor, so do not worry about it. Inshallah you&#8217;ll be alright. Don&#8217;t let this affect your confidence. Try to avoid going to that place unnecessary for the next few days or so if you can and if the gun topic ever comes into a conversation again just say you sold your weapon or gave it away to someone, and in future try to keep your weapon concealed and do participate in the gun gossip but try to control your excitement if possible and do not to admit or confess to carrying or having a gun on you. I hope this helps.[/FONT][/COLOR]', ''),

Sind is at peak nowadays since 1st Sep. But Sind cant be compared to Punjab due to various reasons, game wise.\r\n\r\nStrange phenomenon !!! That elec tape (call) is not allowed technically nor are fixed nets, and both things are commonly seen everywhere in Punjab, under the very nose of department ;) as both forms are the only methods to either catch/lure these birds on ground. This new fact - fixed nets (not being allowed) is strange again. The reason obvious - to have max leverage in negotiating with netters/shooters by department. \r\n\r\nThe best solution for game (QUAIL) preservation is : to allow shooting a generous qty of birds per gun with elec tape (call) w.e.f Aug mid onwards on any day of week & ban use of nets alltogether, either fixed or mobile types. Why the dept does not technically ban that netting on paper is again as strange to me as anything. WHO sets these absurd policies from year to year ... is indeed a mystery. In Spain or some European countries, this is called developing quail hunting sites thru electronic game calls. Use of nets severely penalized there and only shotgunning (sport shooting) is allowed for Common Quail (same quail which comes here).\r\n\r\nBut lets see, how the Punjab quail bags go this time in face of torrential showers everywhere here.

Of course if the shooter follows a slower rythmn i.e. late firing, then obviously tighter choke would have to be used.

I had some good experience with A303 Sporting (it had same mid bead and a different front white ivory bead).\r\nBaikal O/U''s are v good guns (both field and sp) but weight is tooo much 7.9 lbs (sp model). Thats the only drawback for upland. I like Sporting model particularly. But when you are carrying approximately 8 lbs shotgun all day in field walking up and down mountains in salt ranges or in Attock or Khushab, for partridge, isn''t that weight a bit too much to lug around with? I would certainly prefer around 6.5-6.75 lbs weight, max being 7 lbs.\r\n\r\nNice input you gave about a friend''s Marocchi...what observation do you have about its KICK (recoil) in field? At partridge, one fires roughly 2 boxes of cartridges in a day on average. So that should not be a problem with recoil.

Before each use, run patches and bore snake to ensure there are no obstructions inside the barrel.\n\nRemember also to give it a good cleaning as soon after use as possible.\n\nPls remember only to point the gun at something if you aim to shoot and to always treat a weapon as if it were loaded. Even when you are absolutely sure that the weapon is empty, go through the ritual of taking the mag out, locking the slide back and looking Into the chamber to ascertain if it is empty. If not, pls rack the slide to eject the round. Pls point the gun in a safe direction throughout all this.\n\nLastly, pls remember to keep your finger off the trigger until you are ready to shoot and to use good quality ear muffs and eye protection.\n\nGood luck.\n\nPS Though, some people swear by it, may I suggest that you consider cleaners other than WD 40.', ''),

For a few days only, the pakar was good, but suddenly rains started again, and pakar dropped drastically. Sind is at peak nowadays since 1st Sep. But Sind cant be compared to Punjab due to various reasons, game wise.\n\nStrange phenomenon !!! That elec tape (call) is not allowed technically nor are fixed nets, and both things are commonly seen everywhere in Punjab, under the very nose of department ;) as both forms are the only methods to either catch/lure these birds on ground. This new fact - fixed nets (not being allowed) is strange again. The reason obvious - to have max leverage in negotiating with netters/shooters by department. \n\nThe best solution for game (QUAIL) preservation is : to allow shooting a generous qty of birds per gun with elec tape (call) w.e.f Aug mid onwards on any day of week & ban use of nets alltogether, either fixed or mobile types. Why the dept does not technically ban that netting on paper is again as strange to me as anything. WHO sets these absurd policies from year to year ... is indeed a mystery. In Spain or some European countries, this is called developing quail hunting sites thru electronic game calls. Use of nets severely penalized there and only shotgunning (sport shooting) is allowed for Common Quail (same quail which comes here).\n\nBut lets see, how the Punjab quail bags go this time in face of torrential showers everywhere here. Sind shooters are indeed having a good time at least since a day or two back.[/QUOTE]\n\nThanks Brother For Your detail analysis. I agree all this.

I had some good experience with A303 Sporting (it had same mid bead and a different front white ivory bead).\nBaikal O/U''s are v good guns (both field and sp) but weight is tooo much 7.9 lbs (sp model). Thats the only drawback for upland. I like Sporting model particularly. But when you are carrying approximately 8 lbs shotgun all day in field walking up and down mountains in salt ranges or in Attock or Khushab, for partridge, isn''t that weight a bit too much to lug around with? I would certainly prefer around 6.5-6.75 lbs weight, max being 7 lbs.\n\n[B]Nice input you gave about a friend''s Marocchi...what observation do you have about its KICK (recoil) in field? At partridge, one fires roughly 2 boxes of cartridges in a day on average. So that should not be a problem with recoil. If one was to use that on occassional skeet (as hobby), that wd certainly hurt the shoulder. What r your views on partridge shooting regarding its kick/recoil?[/B][/QUOTE]\n\nbrother, weight does matter in the tough terrains, and Baikal is not helping in terms of weight but in such conditions drop downing/falling chances are increased. And baikal really does not mind if it happen. \nMarochi o/u is very very good in terms of weight. easy to quick mount and carrying all the day for upland. Since it is new in market cant say anything abt its durability. there is selective ejecting system in it i guess.\nAs for as recoil is concerned, every new purchased gun seemingly recoiling higher but with the passage of time hunters become used to it and start enjoying. \n\nI''ve seen morochi semi/auto aswl, it is finely made beautiful gun. it is in same price range i.e. 130K with badrudin pindi. excellent weight around 3 kg.', ''),

Results are as follows:\n\nMy Hatsan mod 125 sniper\nThe very 1st shot surprised us all as it read 999.6 fps on the chrony from crosman premier hollowpoint pellets (14.3 grain) which gives [B]31.7 fpe[/B] at the muzzle. Umair bhai suggested it could be dieseling which occurs if you fire a round after some days; and it made sense as the rest of the shots landed in the 945-960 fps band.\n- Average 955fps from crosman premier hollowpoint pellets (14.3 grain) which gives [B]28.97 fpe[/B] at the muzzle.\n- Average 920fps from Gamo Promagnum pellets (15.9 grain) which gives [B]29.9 fpe[/B] at the muzzle.\n\nUmair bhai''s de-tuned Diana 54\n- Average 760 fps from crosman premier hollowpoint pellets (14.3 grain) which gives [B]18.35 fpe[/B] at the muzzle.\n\nUmair bhai''s Diana 31\n- Average 710 fps from crosman premier hollowpoint pellets (14.3 grain) which gives [B]16.01 fpe[/B] at the muzzle.\n\nUmair bhai''s Diana 45\nThe first shot again was a surprise as it read 817 fps on the chrony, hence the dieseling theory proved to be true.\n- Average 680 fps from crosman premier hollowpoint pellets (14.3 grain) which gives [B]14.69 fpe[/B] at the muzzle.\n\nKhilji''s Webley & Scott (made by Hatsan)\n- Average 940 fps from crosman premier hollowpoint pellets (14.3 grain) which gives [B]28 fpe[/B] at the muzzle.\n\nKhilji''s Diana 54\n- Average 860 fps from crosman premier hollowpoint pellets (14.3 grain) which gives [B]23.5 fpe[/B] at the muzzle.\n\n\nThen we had a go at some crows which sat approx 70 yards away. Umair bhai downed one with his Diana 54. I tried putting one down at the same spot as many more crows had come after that kill, I mis-read the distance and didn''t adjust for it and ended up hitting the upper tail portion of the crow instead of the rib cage :p we saw feathers in the air but the crow flew away and didn''t seem to be hit.', ''),

Although, cosmetically It may look like the real thing but you sure understand the quality of materials used in it. My advise would be to keep saving up, or if you can, put a decent gun on lay away till you can afford it. no sense in wasting money on these ''decorative'' items.

I just do not like hard and mushy triggers. your trigger job made hell of a difference when compared to stock caracal''s trigger.\r\n\r\n2. fixed rear sight: no drift adjustment possible without drifting the front sight. with your modification of cutting a standard glock dovetail, a world of possibilities have opened up. now we can install any glock rear sight on a caracal plus the rear sight setup is now drift adjustable. what I liked the most about your modification is that it looks like a standard factory job with high finish.\r\n\r\n3. bad grip: personal preference, the rear of the grip digs into the knuckle of my hand. plus the rear of the grip (beavertail) is not deep enough to offer any significant benefit.\r\n\r\nWHAT I LIKED THE MOST:\r\n\r\nBro, I just have to have those sights installed on my handgun, my laptop, my cellphone, my wrist watch. better yet, can you install one on me? i willing to go under surgery.\r\n\r\nthese are probably the best fixed/combat sights I have ever seen. the sight picture is just too clear and easy on the eyes.\r\n\r\nhere are the pictures that I took while the cat was away:\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i998.photobucket.com/albums/af103/12gauge-pakguns/Moeen%20Bhai%20Caracal/Pic1.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i998.photobucket.com/albums/af103/12gauge-pakguns/Moeen%20Bhai%20Caracal/Pic2.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i998.photobucket.com/albums/af103/12gauge-pakguns/Moeen%20Bhai%20Caracal/Pic3.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i998.photobucket.com/albums/af103/12gauge-pakguns/Moeen%20Bhai%20Caracal/Pic4.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i998.photobucket.com/albums/af103/12gauge-pakguns/Moeen%20Bhai%20Caracal/Pic5.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i998.photobucket.com/albums/af103/12gauge-pakguns/Moeen%20Bhai%20Caracal/Pic6.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i998.photobucket.com/albums/af103/12gauge-pakguns/Moeen%20Bhai%20Caracal/Pic7.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i998.photobucket.com/albums/af103/12gauge-pakguns/Moeen%20Bhai%20Caracal/Pic8.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i998.photobucket.com/albums/af103/12gauge-pakguns/Moeen%20Bhai%20Caracal/Pic9.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i998.photobucket.com/albums/af103/12gauge-pakguns/Moeen%20Bhai%20Caracal/Pic10.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i998.photobucket.com/albums/af103/12gauge-pakguns/Moeen%20Bhai%20Caracal/Pic11.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\nRegards.', ''),

It is really a news for me.\r\n\r\nyou are right No 8 regular works better on skeet/traps than #7T and #9Sk due to its more numbers of pallets.[/QUOTE]\r\n\r\n#9 shaheen in 31g has been introduced for quail hunting, as well as skeet (as a hobby). Competitive skeet is still probably being carried out with #9 (24g) as thats Olympic Skeet standard. #9 (31-31gms) is the best quail cartrg IMO (for the smaller quail, Common Quail) & for practicing skeet to improve upland shooting too. Earlier, when I used to do competitive skeet, I tried using #9 (skeet version, 24g) for quail..that messed up the semi-autos with soot and also due to lesser pellets and lesser velocity in #9, the #8 used to outperform it. Thats why your vote in favor for it. Otherwise I have always believed #9 (field load, 31-32 gms) is the best cartrg for our quail and occassional practice at skeet range.\r\n\r\nMigratory quail (our specie) when it arrives in Aug-Sep, it has negligible fat content and when it goes back in say April, it is the size of a see-see (per say). At that time, #8 would be better, but during arrival, its such a small bird and feeble, that birdshooter is right...you can kill it with a pebble...figuratively speaking. And yes, starlings, common snipes can also be ideally taken with it (new #9) which will give give better spread, pellets, coverage for these skeet sized birds.', ''),

(459057, ' @suuch_baat, bro imported models are mostly made in aluminium, and here its not so. Here they are made in steel mostly which in any case is heavy, much heavier. Problem with steel is that the towing vehicle just has to be strong enough with a powerful 4x4 to tag it along thru mud and sand near rivers. Aluminium is ideal but not available here. As far as design issue is concerned, any imported picture from net can be copied and modified for the particular boat design, but one critical aspect is ...the height of tyres in trailer has to be equal to those in 4x4 vehicle, and the trailer horizontal to the ground when travelling. This minimizes drag and the vehicle goes effortless on roads. I have done so successfully too.\r\n\r\nI find this tyre height issue with this trailer above,,,,rest seems OK IMO. Its a big trailer and a big boat. Good for a large group or when making multiples blinds.', ''),

Everything else on the gun was a modification to an existing design.  As with All striker fired pistols, I managed to lower the trigger pull weight; however, the mushyness never went away - that will require a trigger pre/post adjustment screws on the trigger.  And as I found out yesterday, this gun is not right for the big handed people like yourself (12Gauge bhai is over 6feet tall AND MashAllah his hands are big like him) - I saw your thumb knuckle was being poked by the so called non existing beavertail.  We also yesterday found out that the ambidexterous mag release is BETTER design on the CZ999 as it doesn''t require a sharp tip to stick out of the magazine body hence it cannot snag on clothing.  The sights well what can I say but thank you.  I saw the amazement in your eyes and the facial expression you gave :thumb:.

(459235, ' [QUOTE=francolino;297263]#9 shaheen in 31g has been introduced for quail hunting, as well as skeet (as a hobby). Competitive skeet is still probably being carried out with #9 (24g) as thats Olympic Skeet standard. #9 (31-31gms) is the best quail cartrg IMO (for the smaller quail, Common Quail) & for practicing skeet to improve upland shooting too. Earlier, when I used to do competitive skeet, I tried using #9 (skeet version, 24g) for quail..that messed up the semi-autos with soot and also due to lesser pellets and lesser velocity in #9, the #8 used to outperform it. Thats why your vote in favor for it. Otherwise I have always believed #9 (field load, 31-32 gms) is the best cartrg for our quail and occassional practice at skeet range.\n\nMigratory quail (our specie) when it arrives in Aug-Sep, it has negligible fat content and when it goes back in say April, it is the size of a see-see (per say). At that time, #8 would be better, but during arrival, its such a small bird and feeble, that birdshooter is right...you can kill it with a pebble...figuratively speaking. And yes, starlings, common snipes can also be ideally taken with it (new #9) which will give give better spread, pellets, coverage for these skeet sized birds.[/QUOTE]\n\nBrother.\nyour analysis stand very logical. Early quails are smaller and weaker and surely #9 (31grm) is wise choice. Since quails are not coming in sufficient nos in our region, I dont have much experience abt that. \n\nI personally rate #8 best for early turtle doves and then later on as the season progresses they become weary and spooky. Than #6 is the best choice, Besides shorter and denser patterns and groups tend to drop the birds dead instead of lingering on and crippled ones.\n\nRecently first time I used #7Super on doves, they are really awesome. the increased velocity and more pallets really help alot. Took down few birds from unbelievable heights.  Actually since March Super and XL are on special discounted rate at Wah Industries i.e. 925/Box. Therefore got to avail the opportunity.', ''),

These are just some I have reported. This guy is someone trying to spoil forum environment repeatedly and seems he is on some deliberate agenda to create such an atmosphere... and I have been ignoring this guy repeatedly too for last many posts. Record can be searched further in database.\r\n\r\nSince last warning few days back, he resorted to indirect rude posting rather than directly addressing to me. Thats a tactic which some people use here which indeed looks obnoxious as well as cheeky.\r\n\r\nToday I had pressed report button since 2 hours. Then posted a reply here in the last post after waiting for that long, in a moderate way. I avoided harsh words and comments like he did. Actually these posts from GUNFUN have been here on thread since 11am today without any provocation to him by me or other member... I had been in a normal conversation with someone else (maybe Liano). But, the posts by him were not deleted since morning. I think if my earlier (few days back report msg) message is recalled, I stated that this guy GUNFUN should be warned strictly or better banned as his posting style is rude and unnecessary conflict oriented. It looks he does it deliberately, without any regard to forum environment. A simple netting and legislation debate was going on ...that too with some other hunters here ...and he turned it into a brawl-like situation by unnecessarily using foul language & direct accusations. The "legislation" comment here at thios post I have reported, is also addressed indirectly to me because I had been conversing with Liano or others about netting on massive scales and solution about heavy penalties and possible imprisonment on pattern of Western countries. That legislative talk was not addressed to him....nor does he iunderstand I know it clearly as he is not into hunting nor understands any ground facts...BUT just keeps on budging mischievously for fun''s sake with disregard to forum decorum or resulting uncomfortable environment. I fail to understand his deliberate behaviour. \r\n\r\nHere, I wanted to highlight such small details which normally go un-noticed, so that such guys are watched at the "right time", than waiting for a conflict oriented situation to emerge and create a bad taste among members which neither I like nor others whom I know like here.\r\n\r\nKindly see all his posts here. After that last warning to him few days back by a MOD, he has been addressing rude words indirectly here which I have ignored time and again. The record is here too. I believe he shd have been shown the door here today on his last few posts. \r\n\r\nI request that he should be banned permanently after today''s provocative and offensive posts he unnecessarily addressed. I remember that a member "HaroonNazir" was permanently banned for saying just a small sentence to a Karachi hunter Ahmed Sultan that: "Why hunt in so large a quantity...that is butchery in my opinion" (something like that he said) after seeing Ahmed''s 500-700 quails shot in Sind last September. These posts by GUNFUN today & earlier are much more abusive and rude than that.\r\n\r\nThank you.\r\n\r\nFrancolino.[/quote]\r\nPost: [url=http://www.pakguns.com/showthread.php?7377&p=297035#post297035]Waterfowls and Upland hunting 2011-2012[/url]\r\nForum: Hunting\r\nAssigned Moderators: N/A\r\n\r\nPosted by: [url=http://www.pakguns.com/member.php?5418-GunFun]GunFun[/url]\r\nOriginal Content: [quote]i really don''t understand why members waste their time discussing their own ideas of hunting legislation-have you nothing better to do in your spare time?! nobody here, even as a self-proclaimed hunter, can change these laws. i certainly don''t read these views with any interest whatsoever, as you should legally continue with your sport/hobby, instead of trying to portray yourself as the ultimate hunter who knows all!\nanyway, happy hunting brothers and respected members.[/quote]', ''),

I propose all hunters should put up their voice in their own ways with the dept heads to make quail numbers bounce back & enhance sport hunting.

Problem with steel is that the towing vehicle just has to be strong enough with a powerful 4x4 to tag it along thru mud and sand near rivers. Aluminium is ideal but not available here. As far as design issue is concerned, any imported picture from net can be copied and modified for the particular boat design, but one critical aspect is ...the height of tyres in trailer has to be equal to those in 4x4 vehicle, and the trailer horizontal to the ground when travelling. This minimizes drag and the vehicle goes effortless on roads. I have done so successfully too.\n\nI find this tyre height issue with this trailer above,,,,rest seems OK IMO.

Then posted a reply here in the last post after waiting for that long, in a moderate way. I avoided harsh words and comments like he did. Actually these posts from GUNFUN have been here on thread since 11am today without any provocation to him by me or other member... I had been in a normal conversation with someone else (maybe Liano). But, the posts by him were not deleted since morning. I think if my earlier (few days back report msg) message is recalled, I stated that this guy GUNFUN should be warned strictly or better banned as his posting style is rude and unnecessary conflict oriented. It looks he does it deliberately, without any regard to forum environment. A simple netting and legislation debate was going on ...that too with some other hunters here ...and he turned it into a brawl-like situation by unnecessarily using foul language & direct accusations. The "legislation" comment here at thios post I have reported, is also addressed indirectly to me because I had been conversing with Liano or others about netting on massive scales and solution about heavy penalties and possible imprisonment on pattern of Western countries. That legislative talk was not addressed to him....nor does he iunderstand I know it clearly as he is not into hunting nor understands any ground facts...BUT just keeps on budging mischievously for fun''s sake with disregard to forum decorum or resulting uncomfortable environment. I fail to understand his deliberate behaviour. [/FONT][/COLOR]\n[COLOR=#000000][FONT=Geneva]Here, I wanted to highlight such small details which normally go un-noticed, so that such guys are watched at the "right time", than waiting for a conflict oriented situation to emerge and create a bad taste among members which neither I like nor others whom I know like here.[/FONT][/COLOR]\n[COLOR=#000000][FONT=Geneva]Kindly see all his posts here.

[/FONT][/COLOR]\n[COLOR=#000000][FONT=Geneva]I request that he should be banned permanently after today''s provocative and offensive posts he unnecessarily addressed. I remember that a member "HaroonNazir" was permanently banned for saying just a small sentence to a Karachi hunter Ahmed Sultan that: "Why hunt in so large a quantity...that is butchery in my opinion" (something like that he said) after seeing Ahmed''s 500-700 quails shot in Sind last September.

(459537, 'New dealer in Khadda market/Deltons It''s tough for me not to notice a gun shop these days. The same was the case when I wanted to get a sports bike. So I''m going through a street in Khadda market when I spotted a policewala/guard standing alert in front of a shop. Immediately it clicked in my head that it was a gun shop and some higher post policewala has come to buy something and his guard is standing outside. So I passed the shop and looked back, the name of the shop was Point Blank; I was right. So I ordered something to eat and went back to the gun shop.\r\n\r\nThe dealers were all very nice and well-behaved people and started conversations by very polite Salaams. They main guy''s dealing was very honest too. He had Stoeger for 65 and CZ Duty for 105, unbargained. He said he had it for 65k because he has got fresh inventory and obviously then he had bought it at higher prices. When I checked the Stoeger, it really was a new piece, its printing was shiny new, ink was dark and not faded like all the rest. The piece was over all very very good, I must say. His CZ 999 was also new and its finishing was intact while its finishing does not last more than 6 months I think. Even unused ones look old.\r\n\r\nSo these were my opinions of the shop and the dealer.', ''),

The .45 dept already had 2 rowdy inhabitants living inside my closet and needed a pause too, so had been deliberating on the .40 S&W caliber since June early. \n\nHence, on return, and as a [I]natural selection of species,[/I] it therefore had to be this box below for now:\n\n[IMG]http://i1136.photobucket.com/albums/n497/wahstar1/RESIZED CZ-75B PICTURES/Pic1Small.jpg[/IMG]\n  Inside it, we''d find a black polycoat, powerful, awaiting [I]demon[/I] of "Happiness", wrapped up for some longed for [I]emancipation[/I], finally:\n\n[SIZE=5][COLOR=#ff0000][B]CZ-75B cal .40 S&W:[/B][/COLOR][/SIZE]\n\n\n[IMG]http://i1136.photobucket.com/albums/n497/wahstar1/RESIZED CZ-75B PICTURES/Pic2Small.jpg[/IMG]\n\n[B][SIZE=4]And the full box of joy:[/SIZE]\n[/B]\nThe CZ-75B .40 S&W, 2 mags, a cleaning rod, brush + manuals.\n\n  [IMG]http://i1136.photobucket.com/albums/n497/wahstar1/RESIZED CZ-75B PICTURES/Pic3Small.jpg[/IMG]\n\n[B]\nThe DVD/CD with multilingual manual/instructions:\n\n[/B]\n[IMG]http://i1136.photobucket.com/albums/n497/wahstar1/RESIZED CZ-75B PICTURES/Pic4Small.jpg[/IMG]\n\n[B]\n[SIZE=5][COLOR=#ff0000][I]The Gasoline:[/I][/COLOR][/SIZE]\n[/B]\n\n[IMG]http://i1136.photobucket.com/albums/n497/wahstar1/RESIZED CZ-75B PICTURES/Pic5Small.jpg[/IMG]\n\n[B]\n[SIZE=4]180 grains .40 S&W [I]fireballs[/I], flat tips:[/SIZE]\n\n[/B]\n[IMG]http://i1136.photobucket.com/albums/n497/wahstar1/RESIZED CZ-75B PICTURES/Pic6Small.jpg[/IMG]\n\n\n[B][SIZE=4]And finally some black power, [I]liberated[/I]:[/SIZE]\n[/B]\n\n[IMG]http://i1136.photobucket.com/albums/n497/wahstar1/RESIZED CZ-75B PICTURES/Pic8Medium.jpg[/IMG]\n\nThe CZ 75-B is one of the most photogenic monsters around - [I]the aesthetic elegance of which, looking stunningly good from any camera angle imaginable [/I]- so one just can''t stop photographing it once the session is on, and yet it still looks even better in real.\n \nNo camera can do it due justice.\n\n The [I]penthouse session [/I]below went like this, and let me just state, that all cam shots presented are 100 percent[I] genuine light control[/I], no photoshop effects added, apart from in the last pic posted, so you can trust this to be true "Happiness" [I]exposed.\n[/I]\n[B][SIZE=4]Silky black polycoat had never been this beautiful to me before:[/SIZE][/B]\n\n[IMG]http://i1136.photobucket.com/albums/n497/wahstar1/RESIZED CZ-75B PICTURES/Pic9Small.jpg[/IMG]\n\n[IMG]http://i1136.photobucket.com/albums/n497/wahstar1/RESIZED CZ-75B PICTURES/Pic10Medium.jpg[/IMG]\n\n\n[IMG]http://i1136.photobucket.com/albums/n497/wahstar1/RESIZED CZ-75B PICTURES/Pic12Medium.jpg[/IMG]\n\n[IMG]http://i1136.photobucket.com/albums/n497/wahstar1/RESIZED CZ-75B PICTURES/Pic15topSmall.jpg[/IMG]\n\n[IMG]http://i1136.photobucket.com/albums/n497/wahstar1/RESIZED CZ-75B PICTURES/Pic11Medium.jpg[/IMG]\n\n\n[COLOR=#0000ff][B][I][SIZE=5]CONTINUED BELOW, next post.[/SIZE][/I][/B][/COLOR]', ''),

Safety, as mentioned, [I]ambidextrous[/I].\n[/B][/COLOR]\nCapacity is 10+1. Enough for me.\n\nI found the recoil spring to be a bit long when decompressed, and it has to be compressed in quite a lot when  reinserting it. I wasn''t happy about a plastic guide rod, however, but that''s probably in by CZ for now, can''t say.\n\n\n[SIZE=5][B][COLOR=#ff0000]Background/Ballistics:[/COLOR][/B][/SIZE]\n\n\nI''ve always disdained copypasting the net since everything is just a few clicks away, and there''s quite some literature out there, explaining the .40 cal and it''s ballistic impact.\n\n\nThe rough and brief facts as I''ve derived on the caliber itself are - [I]and may be corrected by respectable seniors[/I] - as follows:\n\n\n[B]The .40 S/W caliber was developed in the aftermath of the Miami incident and as a special requirement by the US law enforcement agencies, with the view to have something that could resemble the performance of FBI''s reduced length, blasty 10mm auto ammo.The shortening of the 10mm''s cartridge in length reduced the powder load and cruise of the fare from 1300-1400 fps to roughly 1000 fps with a 180 grained fireball of the .40 S%W. [/B]\n\n[B]S&W and Winchester jointly developed the round and it''s a derivative of the 10mm auto, also referred to as 10mm Kurz (short).\n \nThe round''s cross sectional dia in plain milimeters measures 10.16mm and the round is therefore a medium between the .45 ACP and the 9mm, travelling almost the velocity of the 9, carrying though a 40-50% heavier projectile as standard loads, the most popular being the 180 grained, but with options like 160 and 200 grains as well. \n\nThe idea is simple: No or insignificant compromise on the velocity as compared to the 9mm, yet with an increased delivery load for higher terminal impact. How higher? Well, don''t ask me, only a surviving sucker would know better to tell the tale.\n [COLOR=#ff0000]\n[I]To me it was not the choice for any "super gun" as such, but merely an add up item to serve the versatility in collection calibers.[/I][/COLOR][/B]\n\n[B]The 180 grained .40 S&W round leaves the muzzle at roughly 1000 fps. The lighter ones, i.e 160 grained, may be almost at par with the common 9mm round''s velocity, 1200 to 1300 fps.[/B]\n\n[B]Conversely, the .40 S&W round is swifter than the .45 Auto''s 230 grains subsonic 850 fps MV, and course must have a reduced level of "felt recoil" as well.[/B]\n\n Hence, it''s a medium between the other two popular calibers and vastly in use today by the US LEA''s as assigned service calibre, and with a popularity on the rapid gain within civilian use as well.\n\nIt''s deemed a nicely adequate and effective defensive round to get the job done, but I shall not dwell upon this further, as it is respected Skeeter Sir''s and other senior respectable member''s domain and expertise.\n \nPersonally, I''ve just always been of the opinion, that provided you can control the wild forces of recoil and not compromise on the shot placements, [I]bigger is always better[/I]!\n\n Enough on the caliber for now, and I believe a CZ-75B too does not request for any big words, it''s a "[I]CZ-The-legend"[/I], and it''s supposed to behave like one. \n\n I am reserving the next 2 posts for filling in the pending range affair, as not to have this review scattered around.\n \nUpcoming news here, from the popping of the cherry affair, will be focused on following important factors about the .40 S&W 75B, since it''s a 1.st timer here - [I]probably[/I] - and with no back-up [I]logistics[/I]:\n\n\n[COLOR=#ff0000][B]1) Accuracy.[/B][/COLOR]\n\n[COLOR=#ff0000][B]2) Target reacquistion in quick successives. ( Will do a comparison with the .45 auto)[/B][/COLOR]\n\n[COLOR=#ff0000][B]3) Penetration.[/B][/COLOR]\n\n\nLots more too. I and my popular "[I]3 idiots" [/I] will be at your services very soon, so stay tuned over here.\n \nI am consequently reserving my conclusive remarks and final impressions as well, but just couldn''t hold back the preliminary introduction here, any longer.\n\n\nSo far, enjoy the cam shots only.\n\n\nAdios!\n\n[IMG]http://i1136.photobucket.com/albums/n497/wahstar1/RESIZED%20CZ-75B%20PICTURES/Pic24Medium-1.jpg[/IMG]\n\n\n[COLOR=#0000ff][SIZE=5][B]TO BE CONTINUED BELOW, next post:[/B][/SIZE][/COLOR]', ''),

Yet these bullets should only be restricted to 200 yds only for Urial and Sindh Ibex.\n\nThe 22-250 is one of the great Varmint cartridges and is very good for long range shots on small game like jackals , chinkara etc. I t can reach 4300 ft per sec with 40 gr bullets and upto 3950 ft /sec with 52 gr bullets, with the 55 gr and 60 gr bullets it can reach 3775 and 3625 ft/sec and these can be used on game the size of Urial and Sindh Ibex upto 300 yds. ( I personally would prefer nothing short of a 270 Win or a .308 Win and prefer a 7mm Mauser. My personal choice remains the 7mm Rem Magnum ) for the majestic Urial and the King of the pinnacles the Sindh Ibex, Himalayan Ibex and Markhore.\nHeavier bullets at medium velocities kill effectively without meat destruction and large superficial wounds which make the animal run and die a miserable death hiding behind bushes and rocks\nBoth Calibers are marginal for the Big Game in Pakistan.', ''),

(459652, ' [QUOTE=Skeeter60;297830]The .243 Win is now over the hill and losing popularity and ground to other high velocity 6 MM s.\nIt can be fired at Velocities of about 3875 ft per sec when light varmint 55 grain bullets are used, these are only good for jackals and may be poor chinkara but nothing bigger.\nWith 85 to 90 and even 100 and 105 grain bullets it can take bigger game out to 200 yards and NO MORE; the velocity with these heavier bullets are down to 3100 to 2900 ft which is still good and provides fairly flat trajectory comparable to a 270 Win. Yet these bullets should only be restricted to 200 yds only for Urial and Sindh Ibex.\n\nThe 22-250 is one of the great Varmint cartridges and is very good for long range shots on small game like jackals , chinkara etc. I t can reach 4300 ft per sec with 40 gr bullets and upto 3950 ft /sec with 52 gr bullets, with the 55 gr and 60 gr bullets it can reach 3775 and 3625 ft/sec and these can be used on game the size of Urial and Sindh Ibex upto 300 yds. ( I personally would prefer nothing short of a 270 Win or a .308 Win and prefer a 7mm Mauser. My personal choice remains the 7mm Rem Magnum ) for the majestic Urial and the King of the pinnacles the Sindh Ibex, Himalayan Ibex and Markhore.\nHeavier bullets at medium velocities kill effectively without meat destruction and large superficial wounds which make the animal run and die a miserable death hiding behind bushes and rocks\nBoth Calibers are marginal for the Big Game in Pakistan.[/QUOTE]\n\nVery nicely explained skeeter sir as always', ''),

And ''knowledge and education'' part....we know that policy changes and appointing right people at jobs in wildlife dept is the key to change. He is throwing hollow arguments everywhere without any knowledge that too in an arrogant tone, hitting indirectly again.\r\n\r\nEverybody knows it is the landlords (big and small) who set up netting addas at various places in their lands via their men. Only a land owner (mostly big ones) do this sort of stuff as a 12V battery, tape caller, amp, 4 speakers, poles, expensive large nets etc are involved as part of purchase and above all, permission to instal nets in peoples'' lands or local landlords mostly do it themselves. We all know also that this slogan above used by this guy GUNFUN is either deliberate or he does not know anything about ground facts at all. In both cases, he needs to control his urge to interfere unecessarily in such arguments, or he needs to show humility in asking & correct his attitude. From the very first post he has made in this section, its clear he has a certain immaturity and attitude problem which is causing such confrontations and irresposible communicatioin with members including me twice.\r\n\r\nI would therefore recommend a ban on this person, or minimum a last warning with deletion of this part from his post.

(459812, ' [QUOTE=DUST;295996]i had checked pt 92 didnt shoot it... but have heard good things about it... my friend who was in a range session with me had multiple stoppages with it... it might be because of the ammo but we did not bother to know the reason and he sold it as sson as possible... as far as pros and cons go well,\n1. ergos... its really a personal choice... i do not like the grip of pt92, a matter of fact is i do not like the ergos of fs92 as well (90-two is an exception) but your choice may vary.\n2. reliability... well caracal has proven to be really reliable, as far abbas''s test goes and as far as the international community, my friends, pakgunners and myself goes... pt-92 is also reliable as far everyone else goes excluding me as i have not tried it personally but faliures did happen infront of me which i did not invetigate so my say in this matter does not matter...\n3. value... well both guns are value for money but i think caracal will prove to be a better for money... just my say keeping in view the future potential of the gun...\n4. POU... well this is an important one... if your main objective is carrying, then i think caracal wins hands down... its light, compact than pt-92 and rugged... it seems like a business gun... has a single action trigger, no time to waste to go on double action and then single action training and this means less stress... draw and shoot and you get consistant smooth single action pull... get a good IWB holster and have a stress free daily CC... as far as pt92 goes well it is shiny, now lets face it, its SHINY...:) and its bulky and is considerablly heavy... it is good as a gun in your hd a gun for the range session but not suitable for daily carry...\nin the end it all comes down to you... i will encourage you to have experiences of your own... spend some time and some money on it... buy a gun which ever you like but please do train with it... even it you do not have time and money for the range then please spend an hour a weak practising dry firing, stnace, positioning, reloading, clearing malfunctions (only on snap caps of course), aiming, drawing from the holster and presenting your weapon in front of a mirror or in your room... but do spend some time with your guns... as that time will definitly save your life and the life of your loved ones one day... and will also make you more alert physically and mentally...\nregards...\np.s thats all of my experience in a few ending lines...:)[/QUOTE]\n\nRe serial no 4, above, I thought Caracal trigger was DAO and PT92 was DA/SA. Can you pls elaborate on the apparent SAO comment?\n\nAnd, re s. no. 2, it is true that Abbas put the Caracal F through quite a rigorous test and others have shot thousands of rounds through it without any reported issues. However, for me the test of a reputation of reliability and robustness is service/wide civilian use over a number of years. \n\nIt is still a novelty item in most markets (including the largest civilian market in the world, i.e., the US) and is still a young gun from a young manufacturer. Service adoption outside the GCC (size of forces is small and levels of professionalism not widely acclaimed) is not reported. And, trust me, it will be prominently reported on their website when it happens in any meaningful way.\n\nSo, in my opinion, and I say this with humility, it is a promising gun and I would buy it before I buy a Taurus. However, any comparisons with Glocks are premature to say the least.', ''),

Dear members,\n                            Turkish made, Hatsan air rifles, especially model 125, 125 Sniper and 135 seem to be very promising new entries in our hands.

Of these, I like B3-2 most. It is dead accurate with a scope, although least powerful, but a fun to shoot because of accuracy.   \n                            One of the Forum members "hamza_mh87" had problem with his newly purchased Hatsan 125 sniper, I also request him to give his view in detail here and what happened, Is that issue solved.

(460146, ' [QUOTE=chohan;298128]Once I was traveling from Karachi to punjab by road, stopped for some refreshment at a restaurant alongside the highway near Moro bypass, while I was sitting outside the restaurant enjoying the greenary and the environment, two men came to me and requested that they want to make a phone call from my cell and its urgent, when I asked the reason they informed that one of their relitive was dead in punjab and they are going on his demise, they want to inform the people there about their arrival so that the people there can wait for them in  Namaz e Janaza. As the place was new for me and both of them were unknown to me I was doubtful If they are telling the truth or lie, I thought what would I do If they run away with my cell phone as there was a wide open area behind the restaurant with fields and crops, I admit that I don&#8217;t have a much running stamina. when they saw the doubts on my face they offered that they can pay for a phone call. I told them I don&#8217;t need any payment and handed over my cell phone to one of the guy thinking that Allah Malik Hai lets see what happens, He made a call for couple of minutes and walk to a distance from me while the other was standing with me, I made myself alert and ready for any kind of worst circumstances. He finally ended the call and returned my cell phone to me with a bundle of thanks, both of them were thanking me so humbly that I got ashamed of  my previous doubts about them. Although I took a sigh of relief when my cell phone reached in my hand. And then I felt satisfied that I have helped someone in need, otherwise I would have a guilt in my heart if I would have not let them make a phone call.\n   \n  I left the restaurant and continued my travelling and after about 5 to 6 hours I received a call and the calling person was asking me to talk with the same guys I met at the restaurant. I told the calling person that the guys were not with me I met them at a restaurant and they were on their own way. The person who was calling told me that they are waiting for those guys as the dead body has to be buried before its dark. It proved that the guys I met at the restaurant were telling the truth and their need to make a call was genuine not fake.\n   \n  The moral of the story is that Its not all the time we use to meet the cheaters but sometime we use to meet the people who are really needy and their problems are also genuine not fake, But all of us hesitate to help them because of some of the cheaters and bad guys.

If you have pellets that get damaged you can put them in a pellet sizer and tap them through  it actually resizes the pellet. \nOr the other method is to to buy a larger pellet say if your airgun is .22 which 5.5mm and they are a loose fit you can just buy 5.52/5.54. This way you know your barrel has a better fit. You also get the small pellet like 1.77 which is 4.5mm you can use 4.52/4.54 or even 4.48mm.

No it cant be done. Sorry.\n\nU will get a stamp issued by the home department that ''allows'' you to carry your weapon all over teh ountry. however it wil still be a Sindh home department license. The MOI (Ministry of the Interior) is in itself a license issuing body that issues lienses at the federal level. therefore its weapons can be carried all over the Federation of Pakistan by default. \n\nit has currently given the authority to the Home department to stamp its (Sindh H.

(460635, 'Zain bhai in Karachi I was kind of triple minded as to where t submit this thread. It could have gone into the Legal section or the dealer section. I;s rather the mods decide where to park it. For now I am submitting it here.\r\n\r\nZain Bhai if I have omitted anything please help me out a bit by adding anything that is missing:\r\n\r\nRecently Zain bhai came to Karachi on a 2 day visit. We decided to make the most of it. \r\n\r\nOn the morning of the first day we went to the Home department where we met the In charge of the Computerised arms license section. We had an informal chat with him over a cup of tea and he helped clear a lot of misconceptions. \r\n\r\nHe told us that new computerized SHD lics are being made, however they are issued only through the instructions of the CM and the Home Sec.  I.e. only special contacts of these 2 gentlemen. The department is not processing applications on its own of people who simply apply. Whether on their own or though dealers. \r\n\r\nHe further stated that virtually all popular B.A rifles are NPB here. And as regards semi autos, only .22s are allowed. \r\n\r\nThere have been reports that 5.54 NATO has been declared NPB in semi-auto. Indeed I have learnt that a number of dealers are offering an’ upgrade’ of the usual NPB lic to include these as well. \r\n\r\nHe categorically stated that the department does not consider the 5.54 to be NPB at all even in semi-auto. The Home secretary has the power to issue a special permit that will be attached to the lic and would enable a person to purchase the weapon. However such permits are essentially permits and not licenses and they can easily be canceled as and when the incumbent HS will be transferred. \r\n\r\nI also asked him about shooting ranges on private property. He said that he had no idea since no private property owner in the city limits had come to enquire about the laws governing such ranges. \r\n\r\nLater we visited other dignitaries and then headed for Point blank which we failed to find and then we went to DAAD where he had tea with Hannan. He showed us a lot of nice stuff. \r\n\r\nTaurus 809 80k\r\n\r\nGlock 4 Gen 385k\r\n\r\nCZ 100 (used) 60k-50k (tag and final price)\r\n\r\nCaracal F 78k-72k (Tag & Final Price)\r\n\r\nColt .45 Gold plated and engraved (American army model made in 1913) 170k\r\n\r\nColt. 45 Silver placed and engraved (Amarican army model made in 1919) 160k\r\n\r\nTaurus 809c 82k\r\n\r\nTaurus 917c 78k\r\n\r\n\r\n.32 revolver 7 shot Arminius used 20k\r\n\r\n.32 revolver 6 shot Taurus used 30k\r\n\r\n.32 revolver 6 shot Rossi used 40k\r\n\r\nWalter .22 used 50k \r\n\r\nAssortment of switchblades from 7.5 to 2.5k\r\n\r\nTo my everlasting dismay he had sold a used CF for 28k only last week. (Apparently he was the 4 or 5th dealer who sold the weapon only a few days before I wanted to buy it)\r\nBut he has promised he might find me a similar piece next week. Hope springs eternal etc etc. \r\n\r\nZain Bhai bought some sort of telescopic sight from him for 10k which I hope fits his Brno and does not suffer the tragic fate of its predecessor mounts. \r\n\r\nThe next day we went to the local Police Station to do something about my purloined all Pak MOI Green Back. I managed to get it back from the lawyer who had taken it after promising to have it cancelled. Once again Courtesy Zain bhai who was kind enough to send my details to the MOI who informed us that the license was intact. Apparently it had been lying in the Lawyer’s drawer since last year!\r\n\r\nNevertheless we did file a report in the station and took a copy ourselves since the license had not been in my possession for over a year. Thanks to a few phone calls again courtesy Zain bhai, the police were extremely polite and courteous and offered us tea and cold drinks and made the report in 5 minutes flat. \r\n\r\nLater on we met a few more people and went for Tea and then he left for Larkana again.

Obviously the fish contractors'' men (fishermen ''sindhis'' as they are called there, like at Chashma barrage reserve game area), do that after striking a deal with the ''sacred cows'' deputed by Deptt there. These are some personal observations of friends including me. Every employee there is some ''sifarishi'' of some influential and thus transfers and postings of inefficient men deployed there is also an issue. As far as feeding area thing is concerned, the habitat where ducks feed at night there is vast and even with ''dib & feeding pockets'' vanished from suroundings, the pond reserve area''s large expanse of feeding waters are there year round. The only thing is to let those ducks stay disturbance free (from shotgun firing and nets) after migration waves hit waters there - so that daytime movements of these ducks are seen at regular water channels of rivers and back channels & non reserve areas where game is allowed, upstream and downstream of barrage. Note: For this same reason, it is a crime in West to fire at waterfowl when they are feeding during those post sunset or pre dawn hours.

(460774, ' @ AK47. Bro. actually it all depends. I would not call subcompacts a  girls'' weapon. many women i know want and love big guns ;)  I am  currently abroad in Holland and the women here have HUGE hands. They are  nice and beautiful here but their gigantic manly hands are a huge turn  off. Gun laws here are too strict but i am sure if they were liberal  with handguns here no woman here would ever buy a sub-compact, let alone  be able to fit one in her hands. lol\n\nAs for the need for a  sub-compact, surely you cannot blankly and completely write them off.  They are surely needed and hence they are made and sold in such large  quantities all over the world.\n\nMy particular need is for an ankle  carry gun as a backup handgun.  A G26 is nice but too overpriced in  Pakistan and not a good value for money. I have imported a Czechmate on a  one-off import permit (which i obtained almost after 4 months of  hassle) as i got it close to its true value abroad. utilizing it on a  G26 would have a been a complete waste.  Now retiring my snub nosed .357  magnum and therefore wondering if the Caracal SC is available or if it  would be available soon.

These 2 factors have destroyed that game area. \n\nFirst factor''s reasons I would like to ask myself from knowledgeable shikaris of that belt like Masroor sb, and the second factor is self-explanatory i.e. deals with ''dept'' after which it is allowed to carry on. Obviously the fish contractors'' men (fishermen ''sindhis'' as they are called there, like at Chashma barrage reserve game area), do that after striking a deal with the ''sacred cows'' deputed by Deptt there. These are some personal observations of friends including me. Every employee there is some ''sifarishi'' of some influential and thus transfers and postings of inefficient men deployed there is also an issue. As far as feeding area thing is concerned, the habitat where ducks feed at night there is vast and even with ''dib & feeding pockets'' vanished from suroundings, the pond reserve area''s large expanse of feeding waters are there year round. The only thing is to let those ducks stay disturbance free (from shotgun firing and nets) after migration waves hit waters there - so that daytime movements of these ducks are seen at regular water channels of rivers and back channels & non reserve areas where game is allowed, upstream and downstream of barrage. Note: For this same reason, it is a crime in West to fire at waterfowl when they are feeding during those post sunset or pre dawn hours. So....very rightly pointed out by everybody.....WHOLISTIC picture has to be understood.\n\nWaiting for hunters'' comments especially Masroor sb who has years of experience visiting those places there.[/QUOTE]\n\nThanks Dear. Your Observations Are Very right. I have already many time Highlights  these things here. You are quite Right about fishermen ( Sindhi)activity in Reserve areas .\nNow There are also No Feedings areas along With These Game Reserves. So Ducks have not any Choice to Feed/ Sit Freely or safely without any Disturbance. So In my Opinion This Decline of Ducks In These Ba-rages Will Be Continue.', ''),

(460879, ' A.O.A,Dear no need to go hiding, infect you have a wonderful chance to convey these rules to your circle. Ironically many of us would realize the significance of these Golden rules only after a calamity or an incident took place. I am glad that you took this entire scenario very positively and learned from seniors so do I. Would like to share: Last week my son-in-law came to visit me from Islamabad, I put a double checked shot gun (Baikal ovr- n-under) right besides my study table and the plan was to observe his handling of the firearm. He immediately checked the chamber after seeking my permission to handle and surprisingly kept his fingers away from the trigger all the time. Being curios I promptly asked “As per my knowledge you never even had an Air Gun in your life how come you know about the safety principles of Firearms. He replied “Pakguns”. So, through this forum one man (without owing a firearm) has learned those safety principles that could save one from disaster. A.H', ''),

Can you pls elaborate on the apparent SAO comment?\r\n\r\nAnd, re s. no. 2, it is true that Abbas put the Caracal F through quite a rigorous test and others have shot thousands of rounds through it without any reported issues. However, for me the test of a reputation of reliability and robustness is service/wide civilian use over a number of years. \r\n\r\nIt is still a novelty item in most markets (including the largest civilian market in the world, i.e., the US) and is still a young gun from a young manufacturer. Service adoption outside the GCC (size of forces is small and levels of professionalism not widely acclaimed) is not reported. And, trust me, it will be prominently reported on their website when it happens in any meaningful way.\r\n\r\nSo, in my opinion, and I say this with humility, it is a promising gun and I would buy it before I buy a Taurus. However, any comparisons with Glocks are premature to say the least.[/QUOTE]\r\n\r\nwell by single action i meant single action and yes it is a single action trigger... i do not know why in the manual DOA has been printed but it is definately a SAO....\r\nand as far as reliability goes well we only need a magful when it counts, and it has the ingrediants required... the rest i agree only with time comes perfection...:)\r\nbut when compared to glock, just go and shoot a glock and a caracal side by side and you will get the idea what i am trying to convey...', ''),

(461035, ' Sir\nwhat is the age of ammunition ?\nand what is the Max temperature it can handle ?[QUOTE=TRX;294158]Unless you store your ammunition underwater, moisture isn''t really a problem.  What the ammunition manufacturers warn about is heat.\n\n Most modern powders are "double base", that is, they''re a blend of both nitrocellulose and nitroglycerine.  Nitrocellulose is relatively stable, but nitroglycerine breaks down at high temperatures.  Solvents left over from the manufacturing process can also attack the nitrocellulose.\n\n Degraded ammunition will still go bang, but what speed the bullet will come out with is anyone''s guess.  Also, the products created by decomposition of the powder will leave corrosive residue behind in the barrel.\n\n Most militaries have charts telling how long ammunition may be stored at various temperatures.  When it gets old, it''s either shot up for practice or sold off for salvage.[/QUOTE]', ''),

The official permits are for 90 days only and issued by HD only so be careful from cheaters.\nyou can personally go to HD to apply for a carry permit, but since it is full of hassle and very time consuming, you can hire some arms dealer to do this for you.  Review this thread thoroughly and you will come up with at least two reputable dealers names who do this for their customers. Costs are also discussed in detail.  please review the thread thoroughly, as it has very vital information regarding the carry law.\n\nAs 144 remains imposed almost throughout the year in Karachi, you never know when you need the carry permit.  This is very much established that if 144 is imposed in an area, you cannot carry a weapon (Concealed or Open) without a carry permit. if there is no 144 imposition, you do not need the carry permit, but a valid license should always be there while you carry the weapon outside. however during 144 imposition, the carry permit only allows you to carry concealed and not open at all.  no Brandishing too.\n\nwithin your immovable property you are allowed to keep the weapon with a valid license and without a carry permit. \n\nIf your license is All Pakistan MOI even then you need the carry permit issued by HD should you need to carry it outside during 144 imposition.', ''),

My wife says Don’t fall in luv too deeply….. or else.    I hunker down (learnt that in 19 yrs married life)…but she can’t peep into my heart, can she?.            My 4yr son wants to lay hands on this new toy ….I had to bribe him with a light emitting noisy contraption….. I hate it’s sound already (the battery is proving to last longer than my nerves - unpredictable Chinese stuff). My friends… I see the envy in their eyes and gleefully let em caress it. But on the range I am the Boss and I own it.\n\nA year or so back I was comparing some 9MMs for buying off the market, including NP-22, CF-98 and Cougar Stoeger 8000. While on the range I got opportunity to fire a few mags off someone’s duty G-19 (dunno which model). I was really impressed on my first attempt and that too rapid fire at 25M. Comparatively my two bit intro feeling about these weapons was; NP-22: Good but bit wayward (later shot a lot and got used to it quite well), Stoeger: excellent/good balance and weighty (I liked the feel), CF-98: I’ve had better (LOL)….. Requires getting used to, stiff when new, awkward safety...... but excellent Bang 4 the Buck. \n\nEventually I got a duty NP-22 and kept yearning for the G-19. A year and a half’s research followed with countless hours on Pakguns, going through numerous foreign gun reviews and comparisons and finally....... I homed on this gun. Mighty real effort and running around of six months …. getting the correct paper work and the permits, visit to the land of Glocks on the other side of the world and a lot of coordination later…… Yippee……I am the proud owner of a GLOCK 19 Gen 4.[/QUOTE]\n\n\nsalam, Congrats on ur purchase. brother can u please write in detail how you imported the gun yourself ?', ''),

(461146, 'Lucky Star Arms market Survey series: Part IX I have been collecting data for the past few weeks as part of my ongoing survey series. \n\nBrothers Zaheer and Mudassir. if I have missed out anything kindly fill in the blanks. I have been overdue with this survey for almost a month now. \n\nI had been trying to find some Taurus copies that look so like the real thing they are scary. Down to the same boxes and even plastic packing, warranty cards, manuals etc. \n\nI found them last month at [b]Shahid arms and Watch Company[/b] a very small and nondescript shop on M.A Jinnah road. The owner had oodles of clones. He showed me Taurus&#8217;s both black and white for around 38k NO bargains whatsoever. He said they are a darned sight better then the Cheap CF 98s the Chinese have flooded the market with.   When I insisted that the CF is still better value for money. He showed me a first copy. Round 28k non-negotiable.  The copy was very very good. No doubt about it down to the green manual in sealed plastic packing. They had thought of everything. The only give away was the ridiculously stiff control lever. Now Cf levers tend to be stiff&#8230;.. but this was ridiculous!!!!!Who ever made it, went overboard in the &#8216;stiffness&#8217; department. Over all the place is expensive. They don&#8217;t do licenses or permits or PS entry. \n\nA week later I went to the market with Zaheer bhai.  He wanted to sell his Turk Shotguns.  We went to [b]Huffaz Corporation[/b] where we were offered pretty low prices. I asked the prices of different products and found out that most of em were at least 10 to 15% higher than some other dealers.\n\nSo we decided to try one of my old hangouts. [b]Ali Muhammad and Sons[/b].  Adnan offered to buy the Turks at the price we asked for. I have never seen a dealer do that before&#8230; I like the guy he respects his customers. \n\nHowever later on when I went there with Muddasir Bhai they offered to extend his 144 permit. Nasir said that it will be ready in 1 day. But it took them 6 days to do it. Nasir did offer to waive the charges though.  \nThe biggest problem with dealing with A M & S is that they don&#8217;t pick their phones specially Nasir. \nApparently he was not taking his employer&#8217;s calls all that much himself. Therefore, they got rid of him. \n\nFrom then onwards we went to [b]Royal Arms lucky star[/b] (Right next to the wine shop). I had been trying to trace the origin of those Taurus copies. It turned out that the brothers Habibullah and Asadullah have introduced them in the market and they were charging 32k each per clone. And 34k for the SS version.  They also had a Girsan 30k and a 909 31K. I have been looking at clones and collecting data for a comprehensive review for some time. But I have never ever seen such well made and packaged clones in my life!\n\nHowever paying in the 30s for what are essentially knock offs is just plain wrong&#8230; When U can get a slightly used CF for the same price.\nThey also had AK 47 type shotguns. Available in the market for around 20k or so. They offered the same at  34k. They had some sort of Grip on it. The gun had the legend &#8220;Gift for u&#8221; printed on the receiver. \nI guess it was the proximity to the wine shop&#8230;..\n\nThen it was on to Mr. Abdul Ghani at [b]New Pak Shaheen Armoury[/b]. I asked him for a used CF 98. And he offered me one for 37k (Just bout the last possible price for an NIB piece)\n\nIt was FAKE. And not a good one either. The weapon, the control  lever, the box ugh! Zaheer bhai saw that its hammer was twisted. .. It was a used piece all right. A FAKE used piece .. for 37K!!! He then proceeded to show me a local Stoeger Cougar. Claimed its amazing..yadda yadda yadda. I decocked it. And the decocker stuck!. He tried it. It was broken&#8230; We decided we had seen enough. We left. \n\nThen on to [b]Decent Arms[/b]. I met Sher Zaman there. He is supposedly the manufacturer of the Taurus Copies. Since I had not bought his Taurus Copies at 32k. he decided to convince me to buy his Beretta copy at 32k. Opened it and showed me the barrel. Claimed that its metallurgy was 2nd to none.  4045 steel barrel. Wire cut hammer. And what&#8217;s more his Zagana copies were used by the DHA Security force after being cleared by the Pak Army itself! He was willing to let me have the ziggy at the paltry sum of 34k. \nVery nice of him really.  But we really could not accept his &#8216;kindness&#8217; so we left. \n\nMeanwhile I and Muddasir Bhai went to [b]Ansari Arms[/b]. While he was looking for .22 rifles. I amused myself with their revolver collection. I saw an interesting looking worn out Euasta for 12k tag price.\n\nI tried it. It was broken. So I tried it again. It was still broken. But the dealer said it&#8217;s not. I decided not to argue and we left.', ''),

(461225, 'Nato tests and associated Hype. Aoa, \nDear member''s,\n1. There has been a lot of references to NATO stock number''s and their association to quality of firearm''s manufacture and/or Statements as firearm XYZ passed NATO tests and carries a NSN etc .\n\nthat is absolutely untrue and the NSN hv nothing to do with Quality of Manufacture:\n[url]http://www.nato.int/structur/ac/135/ncs_bridge/chapters/3_2.htm[/url]\n[url]http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NATO_Codification_System[/url]\n\n[quote]3.2. The NATO Stock Number\n\nCountries that participate in the NCS follow common standards and techniques to assign NSNs to items of supply in their defense inventory. The National Codification Bureau (NCB) within each country centrally assigns their national NSNs. The assignment of an NSN fixes the identity of each distinctive item of supply. All NSNs are uniform in composition, length, and structure. Each is represented by a 13- digit number, which can be divided into 3 unique parts:\n\n\nthe first four digits are the NATO Supply Classification (NSC) code, which relates the item to the group and class of similar items\n\nthe next two digits indicate the assigning NCB code (each country has its own two-digit NCB code-the United States uses "00" and "01")\n\nthe final seven digits are assigned sequentially and have no inherent significance. However, this number relates to one and only one item of supply within the codifying country.\n\nWithin NATO, the NCS currently contains 16 million active NSNs (about 7 million U.S. and about 9 million assigned by other NATO countries). The items represented range from hand grenades to guided missiles, from propeller blades to space vehicles, and from soap dishes to washing machines.[/quote]\n\n2. Nato Testing : Apparently I cant seem to find any Standard testing protocol for firearms ,NATO doesn''t test firearms.\nNato does hv a testing protocol and requirements for Ammunition.\n[url]http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NATO_EPVAT_testing[/url]\n\n3. Testing Firearms : Different countries and different agencies Test firearms on their own according to their own requirements. Period.\nIn that respect , Budget becomes and important factor, and Domestic firearms are generally favoured over imported firearms. \nAlso firearm manufacturers heed LEA advice/feedback and requirements during designing and manufacture of a firearm( or improving a current design) .\n\n[b]Moral[/b] Ignore Overly hyped Testing certifications for the most part. Most Firearms will hv some malfunction etc if taken to a Firearm training class (which entail around 2000 rounds fired over a 2-3 day course ). No wonder people teach Clearing malfunction drills and carrying a spare magazine.', ''),

And i would say hunter who are living around can best guide you about the hunting procedure or limitations. I would be also good if you can make visit to wildlife department and can request the booklet "wildilfe act" where this type information is available like what type of species you can hunt, amont of hunt, months and days for hunting etc. You asked about the pheasants so there is no habitate of Pakistani pheasants in the lahore. These are only available in the northern part of pakistan called himalayan pheasants. And for you, it is impossible to get license and hunt pheasants as those license are not allowed to non local people. Only few local people are permitted to hunt pheasents.  So it is good to hunt which is permitted there so we can support wildlife department for better conservation of these species.', ''),

I guess Hunter1 party shot quite a handful. Gr8 shooting for them. \r\n\r\nWe also took a chance despite bad weather reports. We had an invitation for Saturday and Sunday at two different areas. First day I could not go due to commitments here. And our friends (three guns) had a gr8 quail day. Shot 97 (retrieved) in morning shoot. No rain however on Sat.\r\n\r\nThinking that it would be dry on Sunday as well, we went to a second area and district in morning but were surprised to find that just an hour or two before dawn, light to moderate rains slashed the area and small pools of water were seen around pattis. However with the help of a few pointers, we managed to scan the small bushes and shrubs....shot about 40. Then immediately moved to another patti nearby where there were some nice fields too, but lesser standing water. Again the dogs (real good ones) got us another 59-60. The total was about 100 shot in a morning with four guns.\r\n\r\nSeeing the black clouds and drizzle which had already started during the last hour or more of the second beat, we then headed for the vehicles and drove back. [Pics wd be posted soon]\r\n\r\nHad it been a drier and sunny weekend, the quail potential would have been much better, and the bag would have been double that, as only 50% of the birds flew, rest kept sitting in moisture laden conditions, preferring not to fly. Currently, now that water is in fields everywhere after the heavy Sunday/Monday downpur, lets see whether any more of the quail action remains.

(461836, 'New in arms &amp; forum  want your guidace [QUOTE=Abbas;67113]Salams, a lot of the friends that come here to PakGuns are relatively new to the world of firearms and are thinking about or have recently got a new license and are looking for the right right gun to buy for their SD or HD (Self Defense, Home Defense) needs. Many new threads are opened everyday about the topic and it gets repetitive and the information becomes less useful over time. \n\nI would like to suggest a couple of guns for the first time users in various price ranges and a mini one line review of the suggested firearm. Details and discussion on any of them can be found by clicking the search button on our panel bar and typing the desired gun name i.e Glock or CF98.\n\nTo start off with I would like to say that the most important thing when keeping a gun for self defense is knowing how to use it properly. All guns are useless and counter productive if the shooter does not have a reasonable level of proficiency in the use of the firearm. Proficiency only happens by firing atleast 200 to 300 rounds in a controlled environment like a range and at a target. Once you are hitting a head size target at 10 to 25 feet you are good to go since in 90 % of the cases that is the maximum distance your gun will be used for defensive shooting.\n\nMost people new to firearms do not understand what calibers are and what difference it makes. In a nutshell calibers are difference sizes of bullets, .22 being small, 9mm being average and .45 being large. The difference it makes to [B][U]New Users[/U][/B] is that generally the larger the bullet, the higher the recoil and lower the accuracy of the second shot. I suggest selecting 9mm as a caliber for your defense needs. It''s like Goldilocks porridge not too hot, not too cold and just right ;) \n\nIn the world of firearms and defense the most important thing is reliability and all the weapons listed here have proven their worth by multiple tests. Ofcourse the more you spend the more reliable firearm you will get. \n\n\nIn 9mm there are several guns available in the market in varying price ranges. A suggested few are:\n\nIn the Rs. 30,000 price range there is the [B]CF-98[/B].\n\n[IMG]http://www.leverarms.com/Pistol%20Images/Norinco%20CF98.jpg[/IMG]\n\nIt is made in China and is a decent medium size light weight gun. It is quite accurate and probably the best you can buy around Rs. 30,000.\n\nIn the Rs. 45,000 price range, your options open up quite a bit and there is the [B]CZ 999, the Canik 55 and the Stoeger Cougar 8000. [/B]\n\n[B]CZ 999:[/B]The CZ is a great gun, extremely accurate and well made. You cannot go wrong with it. It is a high quality copy of the SIG 226 pistol which retails for around Rs. 350,000. It is made in Serbia. \n\n[IMG]http://world.guns.ru/handguns/cz999-2.jpg[/IMG]\n\n[B]Canik 55:[/B] This is my personal favorite. It''s a clone of the CZ75 B and is the most accurate sub Rs. 100,000 pistol I have ever fired. Very high quality copy. Made in Turkey. I got mine for just under Rs. 40,000.\n\n[IMG]http://i262.photobucket.com/albums/ii99/AbbasMalik/Canik552.jpg[/IMG]\n\n[B]Stoeger Cougar:[/B] Probably one of the most discussed pistols at PakGuns, this pistol is very highly regarded by all for it reliability and size. \n\n[IMG]http://i262.photobucket.com/albums/ii99/AbbasMalik/Canik555.jpg[/IMG]\n\n[B]Taurus PT 99[/B]. If you are a fan of Beretta and large shiny objects appeal to you ;) I suggest looking no further than the PT 99 by Taurus. It is one of the best pistols of the world in any price range. Very high quality piece and one of my favorites. I have shot over 4000 rounds though my pistol and it''s still brand new. Very accurate too. The only drawback is the size, it is a large frame pistol and not really comfortable to carry around. Very highly recommended. Price Around 54 K.\n\n[IMG]http://world.guns.ru/handguns/taurus_pt99.jpg[/IMG]\n\nApart from these guns, nothing in my opinion can be justified because of the insane prices. The only gun that I would recommend spending more money on is either the Glock 17 or the Glock 19. The 17 sells for around Rs. 225,000 currently and the 19 for Rs. 250,000. The difference between the two is that the 17 is larger and more accurate and the 19 is smaller and slightly less accurate than the 17. The reason you pay a much higher cost is reliability and durability. Glock is absolutely the most reliable handgun in the world and it will last multiple lifetimes.\n\n[IMG]http://world.guns.ru/handguns/glock17.jpg[/IMG]\n\n\nA closing note on magazine capacity ammunition type and durability.\n\nBoys will be boys and every manufacture that makes products aimed at men will stress "more is better" but that is not necessarily always the case. Although a 20 round magazine will get "wow''s" from your friends, more rounds in your magazine will make your weapon larger and heavier. For most situations you do not practically need anything above 13 or 15. Infact that is excessive as well, what you can''t do in the first 5 shots you aren''t going to do in the next 20. So if the handgun you are choosing has a magazine capacity of 13 or 15 you are good to go. If you feel you need more rounds, then that''s what the extra magazine is for. \n\nAmmunition type. For target shooting and practice you use normal 9mm rounds which cost around Rs. 35 (POF, CHINESE). For Self defense however you use "Hollow Points". These bullets are specifically designed for defensive purposes and will expand upon impact thus having a higher probability of knocking your target down. They cost around Rs. 65 to Rs. 250 depending upon make. I would suggest atleast firing a box of 50 rounds of hollow points though your gun to make sure they work well before loading your magazines with them.\n\nDurability. Most people will go on and on about barrel life and forging technology and yada yada. Yawn.... :rolleyes: \n\nA gun will last "FOREVER" if maintained properly. You must clean your gun within 24 hours of use or it starts to get damaged. Barrel life is nonsense and is of no concern to 99 % of the people. Ammunition is so expensive that if we take the CF 98 whose barrel under the worst conditions still lasts 3000 rounds then that means you fired about Rs. 100,000 worth of ammunition though a Rs. 30,000 gun. Not very probable, if someone has that much money to spend on ammo then I''m sure they will buy a better gun first.\n\nAnd last but not least remember that if you own a firearm you are a grownup and a responsible individual. Anger, Machoism and Irresponsible behavior have no place in the life of an firearm owner. Before you own firearms these three things should be ingrained in your psyche. \n\n\n1). EMPTY OR LOADED, NEVER EVER POINT YOUR GUN AT ANYTHING YOU ARE NOT WILLING TO DESTROY.\n\n2). ALWAYS ALWAYS KEEP YOUR FINGER OFF THE TRIGGER TILL YOU ARE ABSOLUTELY SURE OF THE TARGET.\n\n3). NEVER CARRY/USE A GUN UNLESS YOU NEED TO.\n\n\nHope this little write up helps all our new brethren to the wonderful world of Firearms ! If anyone has any question I and all PakGunners will answer them gladly. No question is too basic or foolish, we are all learners here.[/QUOTE]\n\nI need your guidance, I am about to get my arm provincal license (KARACHI)within a week and looking at purchasing a handgun 9mm pistol.

(461883, ' Hhmmm... A lot of factors will affect the choice of pellet for long distance shooting.  to name a few;  it depends on how much muzzle velocity the airgun produces! Ideally the more ME it generates the more energy the pellet carries hence greater chances of retaining energy at longer distances. If you have a medium powered airgun, a heavier pellet will drop more therefore the scope will need to be adjusted accordingly and you will NEED a scope with mil-dots to judge and accurately hit your target at variable distances; and a lighter pellet will be more prone to be affected by wind etc at distances beyond 70 yards so again you''ll need a good scope and a good hand to shoot :) \n\nTo put it simply if you have an airgun that spits out pellets in excess of 800 fps use heavier pellet (between 16-19 grain) from AirArms, JSB or H&N. For medium powered airgun (between 680-750 fps) go with medium weight pellets (13-15 grains) here you have a relatively wide choice of pellets e.g. RWS, Crosman, JSB, and H&N. This is how I would choose a pellet if I DO have many options, otherwise I''ll manage to alter my techniques according to the pellet I have in hand :p hahahaha', ''),

No rain however on Sat.\n\nThinking that it would be dry on Sunday as well, we went to a second area and district in morning but were surprised to find that just an hour or two before dawn, light to moderate rains slashed the area and small pools of water were seen around pattis. However with the help of a few pointers, we managed to scan the small bushes and shrubs....shot about 40. Then immediately moved to another patti nearby where there were some nice fields too, but lesser standing water. Again the dogs (real good ones) got us another 59-60.

The trophy size starts at 27 + inches.\nTo measure the sheep horns the method is as follows;\n1.Measure outside length of both horns along the curve and add.\n2.Measure the girth / (circumfrence) of both horns at base and add.\n3. Measure the girth / Circumfrence at first quarter of curvature of both and add.\n4. Measure circumfrence at second quarter of both  and add.\n5.Measure 3rd quarter both horns and add.\n6.Measure tip to distance of horns and add.\n7.Measure the width at the tips of horns where these are broken due to fighting etc. ( your trophies have pointed tips and not broken at the edges as yet.\nThe summ total of points will give the Boone and Crocket and Rowland Ward system of measuring sheep trophies points.\nThe animals you have shot are fair game.\nTrophies upto 34 inches have been taken in the Salt range ( Malik Shafaat ). Animals above 27 inches are few today but bigger ones are still roaming the range and are so clever it is beyond imagination; I wish you good hunting and develop your stalking skills and you will be rewarded with monster Urial sooner or later.

Although its a simple place where you can discuss whats in the shop. Now the matter has reached to integrity of my father name Peerzada Sajid Majeed and his business. People not knowing the facts are putting baseless allegations. We are in Arms & Ammunition business Since 1961 and are in import business since 1978. I don''t need to give clarifications. But you are better known that to build a good pool of guns and variety you have exchange some of your guns and usually it is done as a wise act to get the maximum variety. Everything stopped at the rates at the thread but it never went to forward as it has gone now. I have already told my client and clearing agent to stop posting threads. But the matter is, I am only getting one answer and you better know it. I ask you to either lift my permanent ban so that I can give logical answers and quit this all up. I have no concern with what one does in the market. I am limited to my business. Alhamadulillah people have firm belief on our dealing.

I have made a customized compact sized amplifier+mp3 caller (2-in-1 type) with small remote.\r\n\r\nWhen there is the time of "dor" in morning (pre)twilight time when quails are most active, the caller is switched to only female sounds (female "kirak") at a height of about 2-3 feet from ground.  Caller is kept on for few hours till shoot is finished. Same is repeated at evening time for shooting.\r\n\r\nOne Qs remains however.. whether mixed (fem+male) quail sounds are better at those twilight hours or only the female "kirak"....& why would one be better than the other?', ''),

Anyone?) as long as they are not automatic. \n\nOn this forum, some people get away with mentioning (but not "discussing") them (i.e., the so called Prohibited bore weapons)  while others immediately get pounced upon by vigilantes even if they make mere mention of a 30 round magazine for a handgun.\n\nIn short, whereas, we envy you your ability to buy all sorts of weapons for a fraction of the price we have to pay, especially for a certain Austrian brand which is particularly popular here. Can''t really say whether said Austrian owes its popularity to its easy to pronounce name or clever product placement in movies by the manufacturer (a particular Buce Willis film comes to mind). On the other hand, we don''t have to weld bits of scrap together nor practice the art of bump shooting for the day Zombies prowl the earth :-)\n\nIn short, in all probability, the only reason you have not been admonished (over your mention of Romanians and Poles)  yet, is the fact that you have enough weapons to arm a small militia :-)\n\nYou take care now.', ''),

(462829, 'Short Review: Rainbow 35 .22 MADE IN SARGODHA I got the gun for 4500rs a little less than 2 years back from Fazal Sons, Pindi after reading all the sweet talk by Dr.Hanif Malik in his thread Sargodha made airgun. In the price, I also got a stupid Tasco 4x20 (junk) which the dealer was selling for 150 each.\n\nRecoil: That''s what I love the most about it, it''s almost non-existent. No problem for any scope, you can use the plain cheapo mounts that come with the scope and mount it. I used this scope on the same mount on my Diana 350F, and after just 3 shots the setup slid off.\n\nThe gun is void of any manual safety yet the trigger is annoying enough to compensate for that.\nSling swivels are attached to the stock, but you don''t really need to sling it.\n\nThe open sights are non-adjustable to a great extent. The stock has some nice pattern and colors, but there was a crack near the trigger guard ever since I bought it. It seemed heavier than the Chinese break barrels I was previously using. The trigger was hard (some 8lbs, a guess) and barrel breaking effort was tough as well, but this smoothed just in a few shots - until I got the spring changed, it''s gotten alot stiffer now, and the trigger....don''t ask.\n\nScoping the gun makes it a whole lot accurate and it makes 1-1.5 groups at 10-15yds. I had a Busnell Banner 3-9x40 on mine, shot some doves with this setup. When the gun was new, I shot some doves and crows out to 30yds and considered that a looong range with airguns back then.\n\nThe power, when new, was 550-600fps...... it would only break lighter glass bottles with rightly placed shots ad that ability faded as the shot count went into hundreds.\nThe power is extremely inconsistent, goes down from some 12fpe to 3fpe in 1000 shots or less (my experience). After every 100 shots or so there is a significant reduction is power. Also the sound of the airgun is louder than the power. \nIt would be rendered a dove hunting gun uptill 500 shots or so, as in my case.\nAfter that, doves would be injured as close as 5-10yds and the twang was just soooo low. The pellet wouldn''t  even enter a Dalda cooking oil tin at 5 feet.\n\nThe gun got rusted, got it removed, now it''s rusted again..... it''s somehow prone to rusting.\n\nSo last year I got the spring changed, the gunsmith charged 500rs for a Chinese Diana 27 spring and labor. I didn''t shoot it much though as I didn''t have any spare scope and it was shooting haywire with open sights. So finally I took it out from hibernation a few days ago.\n\nI chrono-ed it with 14.3gn Crosman Premiers, and it averaged 5.5fpe. That''s nothing, but still the spring has a loud twang. Also what I noticed is that after getting the spring changed somehow the trigger pull has really gone wild, some 10-12lbs.... I have difficulty shooting it even with 2 or 3 fingers. I used 2 fingers, still it took some 2-3 seconds and 5x the effort of a Diana. This caused shifting in POI as the gun moved quite a bit.\n\nAnyhow, I attached a Chinese 2-6x32AO scope which I had, unused, lying around since long. Attaching took just a minute or so, zeroing, around 15minutes - as initially it wasn''t shooting great groups due to the extra hard, annoying trigger.\n\nThen finally I settled on this 1.25in group at 13-15yds using H&N wadcutters, scope at 6xmag.\nIt''s a good group for a 4500rs gun and good for dove hunting. At present, I would be able to shoot them at 15-20yds max with proper placement. But I''m looking for a spring replacement now with a minimum of 12fpe.\n\n[IMG]http://i1203.photobucket.com/albums/bb399/B77W/zgun012_zps4e4fb8b9.jpg[/IMG]\n[IMG]http://i1203.photobucket.com/albums/bb399/B77W/zgunz013_zps44711eef.jpg[/IMG]\n\nOpinion: It''s not something you should be wasting your money on, [B]Except the following:[/B]\n.It''s for a child/begginer\n.You''re just looking for a cheap practice gun.\n.You want to shoot doves in your garden and can afford having the spring replaced every 500 shots.\n\nOverall, I had no fun shooting it mainly due to the trigger and low power.', ''),

So, the gun needs to be zeroed irrespective of what pellet you''re using if you actually wanna HIT your target :) Once zeroed; mark my words the JSBs will outshoot Gamo pellets EVERYTIME, provided you''re a good shooter. \n\nGamo pellets are inconsistent and inaccurate especially over longer distances. My Crosman Premiers give FAR better results than the GAMOs at longer distances and this is JSB we''re talking about. Although in my gun the Gamos give about 30 fpe at the muzzle against 28.5 fpe by crosman premiers but I still use crosman simply because they''re better pellets. Coincidentally I compared both the pellets today at approx 50 yards and where the Gamos went haywire the Crosman pellets provided tighter groups.\n\nThe choice however rests with you :) There is good reason why these JSB pellets retail for almost double the price of Gamos.', ''),

In my view, you should consider your nature rather than experience with handguns when making a choice concerning safety features. If you are careful and disciplined by nature and will make the effort to learn safety rules and drills and follow them without exception then you are less likely to have an accidental discharge.

All Semi automatic shotguns have FREE FLOATING INERTIA  Firing Pins. When you let the bolt slam forward the firing pin moves forward due to inertia and lightly touches the primer, this causes a light mark and nothing more. It is safe and will never fire a cartridge. When the the hammer strikes it on firing, the  pin moves forward with a lot of acceleration and only then the primer is initiated to fire the cartridge. If you want to confirm;  take a fresh cartridge put it in the magazine tube and move the bolt slowly forward by hand instead of letting the bolt slam forward with the power of the recoil spring. \nYou will find there will be no mark now.', ''),

The world is moving in a big way to striker fired semi-auto pistols. Even in the U.S. they are getting over their 100 year obsession with the tempremental and low capacity 1911 .45 acp. The off the rack reliability and high capacity of the various striker fired polymer pistols(eg. Glock, S&W M&P, Caracal, Springfield Armory XD etc.) has led to U.S. police depts./FBI/DEA/Customs service etc. across the U.S. giving up on their .357 sixguns and their 1911''s.

When the the hammer strikes it on firing, the  pin moves forward with a lot of acceleration and only then the primer is initiated to fire the cartridge.

Forget about all those special US "Super rounds", offering the .45 Auto an MV of 1000-1200 fps, etc.\n\nThe standard loads offer the .45 acp an MV of 850 fps and the .40 s&W of 995 fps. There''s a bit of an edge here.\n\nThe .45 causes greater cavity than the .40. Hence, irrespective of minimal differences with respect to terminal energy, the King of lethality is no doubts the .45 acp.\n\nThe .40 offers you better control, probably, and with a slightly reduced energy transfer. When I say "slightly reduced" energy transfer, it''s because the faster cruise of the .40 vs the .45 to a considerable extent catches up with the 230 grains impact of the .45 acp, coz in the calculation formula for terminal energy, the MV is always squared and has an edge over the weight of the projectile which is 1X.\n\nHence, it''s quite a complex question and choice.\n\nThe .40 is actually the medium between the 9 and the .45. The calibre difference downwards to the 9 equals the upwards difference to the .45.\n\nHence, in brief, you could say, the .40 cal offers more lethality than the 9, packing on more power than the 9, and offers better control than the .45 Auto, with slightly reduced terminal energy.\n\nIf one is not confident/comfortable with the potency of the 9, does not have the proficiency to manage a .45, the answer is to go for a forty.\n\nDon''t know, if I managed myself out sufficiently enough here.\n\n\nRegards.', ''),

All shotgun barrels respond same way i.e. become hotter, if repeated firing is done without proper gaps. And...reasons for slower mechanism are:\r\n- Jammed or dirty recoil spring (inside stock) due to oil, moisture and dirt accumulation (recommended cleanup from gunsmiths after every 500-1000 cartrg rounds).\r\n- Lack of proper cleaning of all other routine maintenance parts (piston, bolt assembly, trigger group, magazine, mag shaft etc .. best cleaner is Gun Scrubber, BF CLP, Brunox)\r\n- Lack of proper oiling at critical parts such as rails on which bolt assembly moves etc & general wiping of all surface areas with a lightly oiled cloth. Here, a high viscosity gun oil prefereably with Teflon is recommended (best are Rem-Oil which has Teflon and Slip 2000 which is the best if available).\r\n\r\nSo.....mechanisms of all semiautos function OK if above routine is followed. There is no particular role of brand - Hatsan, Baikal or ATA.\r\nNo doubt these three are all good budget semiautos. But weight of 7.6 lbs (Baikal MP153) Vs 6.25-6.5 lbs (ATA CY series) is an issue in field.. especially when upland hunting.', ''),

In a magnum class spring rifle this recoil is even more significant. For some odd reason this recoil is comparatively more pronounced in Diana air guns. So much so that B.B pelletier (Tom Gaylord) and leapers joined hands to design a couple of scope bases SPECIFICALLY for Diana air guns so as to provide better support to scopes and to address another known Diana issue of barrel droop. Even then they still suggest an airgun rated scope to be mounted on Diana airguns despite coming up with a solid and sturdy scope base.', ''),

When you let the bolt slam forward the firing pin moves forward due to inertia and lightly touches the primer, this causes a light mark and nothing more. It is safe and will never fire a cartridge. When the the hammer strikes it on firing, the  pin moves forward with a lot of acceleration and only then the primer is initiated to fire the cartridge. If you want to confirm;  take a fresh cartridge put it in the magazine tube and move the bolt slowly forward by hand instead of letting the bolt slam forward with the power of the recoil spring. \nYou will find there will be no mark now.[/QUOTE]\n\ndoes this happen in case of baikal mp 442 also?', ''),

Should be out by end of the year. A good Glock 26 competitor. The various Caracal triggers felt good. More crisp atleast than my old Gen 1 Glock 17. The world is moving in a big way to striker fired semi-auto pistols. Even in the U.S. they are getting over their 100 year obsession with the tempremental and low capacity 1911 .45 acp. The off the rack reliability and high capacity of the various striker fired polymer pistols(eg. Glock, S&W M&P, Caracal, Springfield Armory XD etc.) has led to U.S. police depts./FBI/DEA/Customs service etc. across the U.S. giving up on their .357 sixguns and their 1911''s.

I haven''t had the opportunity to fire one but a friend of mine has one so I have seen and held it. It feels good the grip is confortabl and its not a bad idea to get one since you already own a 9mm. the 145 will fufill both the CC purpose as well as your requirement of having something with a punch.

(464058, ' Congratz on your purchase! I must say that''s a VERY GOOD price you paid for the 350 magnum :). As per your other query I am re-posting this for your convenience:\nDiana airguns are notorious for being [B]scope eaters[/B] and they have the potential to destroy even the best of scopes so be very careful in your choice of both scope and mounts for the Diana as a good combo will last you long. Go for an air gun rated scope, it''ll be best if you manage to find a [B]leapers or centerpoint scope[/B]; these are not too heavy on your pocket and work superbly on magnum rated & heavy recoiling spring guns. \n\nJust to elaborate it further, we do understand all springers have a very different recoil than that of a firearm right? In a magnum class spring rifle this recoil is even more significant. For some odd reason this recoil is comparatively more pronounced in Diana air guns. So much so that B.B pelletier (Tom Gaylord) and leapers joined hands to design a couple of scope bases SPECIFICALLY for Diana air guns so as to provide better support to scopes and to address another known Diana issue of barrel droop. Even then they still suggest an airgun rated scope to be mounted on Diana airguns despite coming up with a solid and sturdy scope base.', ''),

(464196, ' [QUOTE=MK47;252337]Just read the above incident Ahnab bro and I''m glad it all ended up without any serious consequences or you being hurt. I''ve not read other member''s comments and thoughts on this incident yet but just to make afew quick comments immediately after reading the story, Unfortunately these are the kind of threats we have to put up with now adays. Apart from spending sometime in the Royal Territorial Army and further undertaking work placements with the Met Police here in Yorkshire, I now work for the UK''s largest Security Company. As part of my job I have been going undertaking and been attending various different trainings, including the "Conflict Management" training which is probably the most important one out of all the subjects because thats where we are trained on how to tackle and deal with different hostile situations and conflicts in the most appropriate manner with the best outcome.\n From my own experience the way you handled this situation was the best possible solution. Because being a winner in such scenarios doesn’t always mean the other side being brought down or dead etc, but they say that the tough ones are always the calm ones who stay calm, immediately carries out a quick Dynamic Risk Assesment and then immediately tackle the situation without lashing out or losing control. You quickly assessed the situation or threat, then immediately responded in a way that prevented a potentially deadly attack without any one being hurt or killed and did not lose your calm. \n In that scenario legally you would have been in your rights to shoot the perpetrator if you wanted to because most Laws in every country state that if someone threatens your life with an offensive weapon and you feel your life is in danger you can respond and use necessary force required to stop or prevent the strike. Shooting him could have been justified in the court of law because he was about to pull a loaded gun at you, and that would have been enough to  justify you firing at him as self-defense but you did not do so and the way you handled it was even better. It takes a real man to keep his feet on the ground and do what you did in such scenarios. Well Done.\n\nNow lets talk abit about the other man or the potential attacker. \nOne minor possibility is that the driver driving the Merc could have been under the influence of alcohol or drugs as he failed to stop in the time required for him to break and stop at a safe distance on a traffic light. Because the use such substances slow down your reaction or response time. \nBut in my opinion there is a big possibility that this attack was pre planned. Mugging or robbing someone at the gunpoint is not the only way fraudsters, thieves, muggers, Robbers and Dacoits use to loot or rob people but many other different tactics are also used and this could have been one of them. May be he had stolen the car from somewhere, or maybe he had snatched it from someone at teh gunpoint in a different area and then planned this whole scenario to go, find a victim, bump his car into them from behind, and then try all what he tried with you to make some money.\n\nEven though in this case his plan backfired at him as in this case his chosen target or the victim (YOU) turned out to be a lot more clicked on than him which he most likely never expected but in other cases there are chances that he would have succeeded in his plan because in most circumstances most of our general public out there walk around un-armed and if it was some poor or naive working class citizen who do not want any trouble he would have just said ok brother I will pay you money etc simply because they don’t want trouble, or being involved in such cases on the legal side, and no trips to Police stations or courts, or no physical fights so often most people would just pay on the spot to avoid any further trouble and then these b*strds (excuse my language) become more and more confident and continue to do so. From what I can gather he was just a thief in a stolen Merc, also in most cases a man who genuinely owns such a car will probably not react or behave in the manner he was behaving.\n\nHe may have not made it obvious on the scene but believe me it was a nasty surprise for him. I bet you he never expected such a response, to him from your first look when you came out of your car was just a random yuppy in the suit with the money who he thought he is going to show is his TT to, pointing at him and you were going to start shaking pleading for your life begging on your knees saying please sir take the money, take the car and let me go. Lol. If anything it turned round to be the other way round.\nOne of my friends recently visited me here in UK from Peshawar and told me a story about his older brother that once his elder brother who I also know was driving his car in Peshawar and had his cell phone on the front passenger seat. All of sudden some guy on a motorcycle hit his cars back bumper from behind, he stopped the car, got out of his car started walking towards the guy on the motor cycle behind him and while he was walking another guy on another motorcycle quickly stopped near his front passengers side door, quickly grabbed the mobile phone from the front passenger seat and both guys on both motorcycles fled. \n\nAfew hints and tips to the fellow PGs, Always keep your doors locked when driving around especially at night time and if somebody bump into your vehicle from behind. DO NOT come out of your car straight away. Keep your doors locked, look around, quickly assess the situation and then decide whether it’s safe to come out or not. If not, and if necessary to flight, then do not be ashamed or hesitate to press your foot down and fly. DO NOT TRY TO BE A HERO. That’s what they say here in the British Police training. We back home, meaning in Pakistan often bring “ghairath” into everything little thing and try to employ this word “ghairath” or pride in the wrong places simply where there is no need.\n\nGod Bless us All.[/QUOTE]\nGood assesment sir....indeed we have to learn how to discern the howlers from the stalkers....thats where conflict management comes in.', ''),

(464282, 'The Curse of the Chambered Round [I][U][B]DISCLAIMER:[/B][/U] First, the following is my [B]personal opinion.[/B] It does [B]not[/B], in any way, imply that my word is the gospel; on the contrary, this is an [B]opinion[/B] and, just like with every other individual perspective, you have [B]every reasonable right to disagree with me.[/B] I am [B]not[/B] here to bash anybody''s opinion or firearm-carrying methodology, I am merely stating an opinion. Second, this discussion is [B]strictly limited[/B] to whether a gun owner should carry a gun chambered or not; in no way is this a discussion about when to shoot, or what the legal repercussions of an active shooting are, etc. Therefore, [B]please be polite[/B] and, agree or disagree, do express your thoughts on the matter.[/I]\n\nA couple of weeks ago I was on the receiving end of a very passionate lecture about the horrors and pitfalls of carrying a gun chambered. The "lecturer" was a very senior and experienced firearms enthusiast who even cited a few unfortunate examples of why a chambered gun is a liability with potentially fatal consequences. According to the gentleman, people who carry chambered are [B]"highly irresponsible, pumped up yahoos and wanna-be Rambo''s who have absolutely no regard for the consequences of their actions!"[/B] Strong words indeed! So strong, in fact, that I was completely stunned into silence by the tone and "logic" that was being used to vilify carrying a chambered firearm.\n\nInitially, I had decided to let the matter go; after all, it was just one opinion (albeit a very strong one) and I was free to disagree and ignore it. But realizing the seniority of the gentleman gave me pause in my dismissal of his point of view, and I started thinking about what he had said. Going over the entire "lecture" in my mind, I realized that the gentleman''s entire anti-chambered argument was based, ultimately, on the premise that a typical gun owner is simply not competent enough to carry a chambered gun. In other words, a typical gun owner is irresponsible and is incapable of being trusted to carry a chambered firearm (which, by the way, is how the rest of the world carries a firearm). So that got me thinking: what is it exactly about us Pakistanis that makes us utterly unable to follow a few simple gun safety rules while the rest of the world continues to do so without hesitation? Could it be that, since the gun safety rules were written in English, our understanding of the gora''s language is extremely lacking? Or perhaps we still adhere to our rebellious ways against the colonialist gora and his damnable rules? Or maybe we just simply don''t care?\n\nI racked my brain for almost a week but just couldn''t figure it out. So then I tried a different approach; I tried to examine the various points of the gentleman''s argument and see if they hold any logical merit. In that I was met with with a measure of success.\n\nThe following are the salient points of the anti-chambered debate and my side of the argument.\n\nMind you, I am writing this because of the great respect I have for the gentleman.\n\n[COLOR=#ff0000][B]\n1) A CHAMBERED GUN IS DANGEROUS[/B][/COLOR]\nSuppose one day you come home from a long day at the office. You''re tired, hungry and can''t wait to get some sleep. So you get home, rush up to your bedroom, put your chambered pistol on the night stand and jump into the shower. A few moments later, your 5-year old son strolls into your room and sees your gun. He picks it up and starts playing with it, thinking it''s a toy. Suddenly his finger slips on to the trigger, and he squeezes...\n\nSurely, for many of us, this is possibly the worst nightmare we can imagine. The question that begs to be asked is, where exactly does the blame for such a tragedy lie? The gun? The child? The chambered round? No, on all accounts. [B]The real blame lies at your feet, the irresponsible gun owner.[/B] Whether you have children or not, or even if you live completely alone, the cardinal principle of firearms is that [B]guns are dangerous objects and, as such, need to be treated with the utmost care and respect.[/B]\n\nWe''ve all heard of multiple incidents where a gun owner, while cleaning his gun, accidentally shot himself. Apparently the hapless victim did not clear his gun properly. So, in these unfortunate instances, where does the blame lie? The gun? The cleaning equipment? The chambered round, perhaps? Again, the answer is no on all accounts. [B]The actual blames lies with the irresponsible gun owner who did a sloppy job of clearing his gun.[/B]\n\nOh, and a piece of advice; by ejecting the magazine and racking the slide a couple of times does [B]NOT[/B] mean that you''ve safely cleared your gun! Instead, you also need to [B]physically[/B] ensure that the gun is clear by [B]locking back the slide, looking through the ejection port to make sure that there is no magazine in the gun and then sticking your pinky finger into the chamber to make sure that there''s no round in the chamber either.[/B] And please, for the love of God, [B]don''t point the gun at anybody or anything you''re not willing to shoot![/B]\n\n[B]Remember, nothing in this world will kill you faster than complacency.[/B]\n\n[COLOR=#ff0000][B]\n2) RACKING THE SLIDE TAKES NO TIME[/B][/COLOR]\nTell me, what''s faster & requires less of an effort; [B]racking the slide or pulling the trigger?[/B]\n\nNo matter how fast you are, no matter how quick your draw, the trigger finger will [B]ALWAYS[/B] be infinitely faster than the racking arm. I have personally come face to face with a loaded gun, and the [B]ONLY[/B] reason I''m sitting at home, happily typing away at my keyboard this very instant, is because by the time the jackass racked his slide, my chambered gun was pointing straight at his face [B](even though he drew his gun first!)[/B].\n\nSure, you can say that I have a personal bias in favor of a chambered gun. [B]Considering that I''m alive because of a chambered gun, hell yeah I''m biased![/B]\n\n[COLOR=#ff0000][B]\n3) A CHAMBERED GUN CAN GO OFF ANYTIME[/B][/COLOR]\nWhat part of [B]"Gun Safety Rule #3: Keep your finger off the trigger till your gun is pointing at the target"[/B] is so difficult to understand?\n\nIf, for some inexplicable reason, you find yourself constantly & needlessly fondling the trigger, then either get a gun with a manual safety [B](and keep the safety on at all times!)[/B] or, better still, [B]you stay as far away from guns as possible![/B]\n\nThis argument point, however, once more underscores the fact that [B]the chambered gun is considered "dangerous" simply because of an utter lack of respect for the gun safety laws!\n[/B]\nMy grandfather once told me, [B]the day you don''t respect your gun, is the day your gun will kill you.[/B]\n\n[B]\n[COLOR=#ff0000]4) A CHAMBERED GUN IS ONLY CARRIED ON A BATTLEFIELD OR IF YOU HAVE "ENEMIES"[/COLOR][/B]\nUnfortunately, we live in a society where the rule of law is nonexistent. Not a day goes by when we don''t read or hear about the lawless chaos that is prevalent in our world. If a [B]law-abiding citizen carries a weapon for the sole purpose of self-defense,[/B] then he must do so under the premise that [B]he might be required to use that weapon at any given moment, in the least amount of time.[/B]\n\nIf we accept that such are the times in which we live, then why are we so reluctant to accept the fact that carrying and deploying a chambered firearm has become a survival necessity? Soldiers carry chambered firearms in a war zone because [B]they may be required to use their firearms at a moment''s notice.[/B] Considering the poor law & order situation in which we live today, [B]how is our situation any different?[/B]\n\n[COLOR=#ff0000][B]\n5) YOU''RE AN ARM CHAIR EXPERT, YOU DON''T KNOW ANYTHING[/B][/COLOR]\nThis term, which has become so en vogue lately, not surprisingly has [B]absolutely no bearing[/B] on the "to chamber or not to chamber" debate.\n\nFor example, if I were to put forward theories on the extractor design of a Mauser Kar98, I would rightfully be labelled an [B]"arm chair expert".[/B] Why? Because I don''t have any [B]experience[/B] with a Kar98.\n\nHowever, unlike the various technicalities of a particular firearm, [B]common sense[/B] requires [B]no[/B] lifetime experience. In fact, [B]a simple mind capable of making logical deductions is all that is needed to make sound judgements. Ergo, the "arm chair expert" just might be the one talking sense.[/B] \n\n\n[COLOR=#ff0000][B]6) I''M JUST NOT COMFORTABLE CARRYING A CHAMBERED GUN[/B][/COLOR]\nThis is actually a very understandable point. When I first started carrying a gun, I used to do so with [B]a round in the chamber and the safety on;[/B] I did so because I wanted to [B]get used to carrying a firearm and stay safe as I grew in confidence.[/B] At no point did I [B]ever[/B] consider carrying [B]unchambered[/B] because it just didn''t make sense to me. [B]A round in the chamber is the natural state of an "active" gun.[/B] If you''re not comfortable carrying a chambered firearm, then I personally suggest you start carrying your firearm with the safety on; atleast that will give you a peace of mind and you will slowly gain confidence with your chambered gun.\n\n\n[COLOR=#ff0000][B]7) PEOPLE WHO CARRYING CHAMBERED ARE IRRESPONSIBLE[/B][/COLOR]\nThis statement has [B]never[/B] made sense to me; [B]how can the state of your self-defense weapon determine the level of your responsibility?[/B] That''s like saying just because I drive a Ferrari, I''m more liable to over-speed and break every single traffic rule in the book!

I have no enemies, yet my own chambered gun once saved my life from a random instance of sheer terror. Law-abiding citizens all over the world carry their defense weapons chambered; I really can''t figure out why we are so reluctant to do so! I''ve said this on numerous occasions that "a round in the pipe" is the proper way of carrying a self-defense firearm, and I hope I''ve managed to get my point across.

Now if I was in Libya or an extremely violent situation I would definitely carry a chambered weapon, no doubt about it.

They were asked to unchamber depending on the setting and activity. There was no immediate threat that could not be handled by an unchambered weapon.[/QUOTE]\n\nDear friend, here is what I don''t understand about that situation, why would you make him remove the chambered round only?\nSince you''ve already stated that [quote]There was no immediate threat that could not be handled by an unchambered weapon.[/QUOTE]That means you admit that a situation could arise needing a firearm to be deployed, but your willing to presume that a chambered round(or the lack of it) will not Effect the outcome of the scenario.\nHere is my problem with that \n1. You are suggesting that Either a chambered weapon is somehow Inherently more dangerous than an un-chambered one ( i.e weapons can discharge on their own) or you don''t trust the operator . However either way the presumption is guns can be made more safe, by un-chambering the round.\nIF you take the firearm alone, a chambered modern firearm is no more dangerous than an un-chambered one, Guns simple don''t / can''t let off rounds on their own. ( I''m presuming you understand why that is, or maybe you don''t believe that statement is true)\nThat leaves the situation that you don''t trust the operator, in that case shouldn''t you ask them to disarm. ( if I don''t trust someone''s driving, I don''t let them drive )    \n\n2.[quote]Now if I was in Libya or an extremely violent situation I would definitely carry a chambered weapon, no doubt about it. But carrying one in the tube to a social function does not make a lick of sense to me.[/quote]\nSo let me get this Straight: you admit that if you actually needed to ''use your firearm'' in an ''extremely violent'' situation  carrying Chambered is better ( would be your mode of carry ) [b]Do people become more reliable/dependable ( safe operator''s ) , or do guns become inherently more Safe in such ''violent situations''?[/b] that to me doesn''t make any sense.\nSince no-one really know''s where and when our enemies ( thieves, robber''s, kidnappers, terrorists, religious nut job''s ) may show up, souldn''t you always be carrying a firearm in a ready to use state.\n\n[B]Efficiency in general describes accomplishment of or ability to accomplish a job with a minimum expenditure of time and effort. It is often used with the specific purpose of relaying the capability of a specific application of effort to produce a specific outcome effectively with a minimum amount or quantity of waste, expense, or unnecessary effort.[/B]\n\nHere''s my opinion: People tend to believe Firearms themselves are Inherently Dangerous ( they hv a mind of their own and can shoot people on their own).\nHowever scientifically and objectively, a Chambered handgun is no more Dangerous than an UNchambered one.\nA chambered Firearm is Just a more Efficient tool at its intended purpose. \nStick to the 4 laws of firearm safety and and in most cases even if you mistakenly by-pass one, the other 3 will keep you safe (i.e you pressed the trigger but the gun was pointed in a safe direction ....no dmg done thankfully etc etc )\nCarry as you please, But learn to carry as Efficiently as you can ( if it takes you more than 5-10 sec''s to deploy you firearm , you need more practice and you need to look into or change your mode/ method of carry )\n\n@ OP  AHnab I agree with you pretty much All the way .', ''),

Second, this discussion is [B]strictly limited[/B] to whether a gun owner should carry a gun chambered or not; in no way is this a discussion about when to shoot, or what the legal repercussions of an active shooting are, etc. Therefore, [B]please be polite[/B] and, agree or disagree, do express your thoughts on the matter.[/I]\n\nA couple of weeks ago I was on the receiving end of a very passionate lecture about the horrors and pitfalls of carrying a gun chambered. The "lecturer" was a very senior and experienced firearms enthusiast who even cited a few unfortunate examples of why a chambered gun is a liability with potentially fatal consequences. According to the gentleman, people who carry chambered are [B]"highly irresponsible, pumped up yahoos and wanna-be Rambo''s who have absolutely no regard for the consequences of their actions!"[/B] Strong words indeed! So strong, in fact, that I was completely stunned into silence by the tone and "logic" that was being used to vilify carrying a chambered firearm.\n\nInitially, I had decided to let the matter go; after all, it was just one opinion (albeit a very strong one) and I was free to disagree and ignore it. But realizing the seniority of the gentleman gave me pause in my dismissal of his point of view, and I started thinking about what he had said. Going over the entire "lecture" in my mind, I realized that the gentleman''s entire anti-chambered argument was based, ultimately, on the premise that a typical gun owner is simply not competent enough to carry a chambered gun. In other words, a typical gun owner is irresponsible and is incapable of being trusted to carry a chambered firearm (which, by the way, is how the rest of the world carries a firearm). So that got me thinking: what is it exactly about us Pakistanis that makes us utterly unable to follow a few simple gun safety rules while the rest of the world continues to do so without hesitation? Could it be that, since the gun safety rules were written in English, our understanding of the gora''s language is extremely lacking? Or perhaps we still adhere to our rebellious ways against the colonialist gora and his damnable rules? Or maybe we just simply don''t care?\n\nI racked my brain for almost a week but just couldn''t figure it out. So then I tried a different approach; I tried to examine the various points of the gentleman''s argument and see if they hold any logical merit. In that I was met with with a measure of success.\n\nThe following are the salient points of the anti-chambered debate and my side of the argument.\n\nMind you, I am writing this because of the great respect I have for the gentleman.\n\n[COLOR=#ff0000][B]\n1) A CHAMBERED GUN IS DANGEROUS[/B][/COLOR]\nSuppose one day you come home from a long day at the office. You''re tired, hungry and can''t wait to get some sleep. So you get home, rush up to your bedroom, put your chambered pistol on the night stand and jump into the shower. A few moments later, your 5-year old son strolls into your room and sees your gun. He picks it up and starts playing with it, thinking it''s a toy. Suddenly his finger slips on to the trigger, and he squeezes...\n\nSurely, for many of us, this is possibly the worst nightmare we can imagine. The question that begs to be asked is, where exactly does the blame for such a tragedy lie? The gun? The child? The chambered round? No, on all accounts. [B]The real blame lies at your feet, the irresponsible gun owner.[/B] Whether you have children or not, or even if you live completely alone, the cardinal principle of firearms is that [B]guns are dangerous objects and, as such, need to be treated with the utmost care and respect.[/B]\n\nWe''ve all heard of multiple incidents where a gun owner, while cleaning his gun, accidentally shot himself. Apparently the hapless victim did not clear his gun properly. So, in these unfortunate instances, where does the blame lie? The gun? The cleaning equipment? The chambered round, perhaps? Again, the answer is no on all accounts. [B]The actual blames lies with the irresponsible gun owner who did a sloppy job of clearing his gun.[/B]\n\nOh, and a piece of advice; by ejecting the magazine and racking the slide a couple of times does [B]NOT[/B] mean that you''ve safely cleared your gun! Instead, you also need to [B]physically[/B] ensure that the gun is clear by [B]locking back the slide, looking through the ejection port to make sure that there is no magazine in the gun and then sticking your pinky finger into the chamber to make sure that there''s no round in the chamber either.[/B] And please, for the love of God, [B]don''t point the gun at anybody or anything you''re not willing to shoot![/B]\n\n[B]Remember, nothing in this world will kill you faster than complacency.[/B]\n\n[COLOR=#ff0000][B]\n2) RACKING THE SLIDE TAKES NO TIME[/B][/COLOR]\nTell me, what''s faster & requires less of an effort; [B]racking the slide or pulling the trigger?[/B]\n\nNo matter how fast you are, no matter how quick your draw, the trigger finger will [B]ALWAYS[/B] be infinitely faster than the racking arm. I have personally come face to face with a loaded gun, and the [B]ONLY[/B] reason I''m sitting at home, happily typing away at my keyboard this very instant, is because by the time the jackass racked his slide, my chambered gun was pointing straight at his face [B](even though he drew his gun first!)[/B].\n\nSure, you can say that I have a personal bias in favor of a chambered gun. [B]Considering that I''m alive because of a chambered gun, hell yeah I''m biased![/B]\n\n[COLOR=#ff0000][B]\n3) A CHAMBERED GUN CAN GO OFF ANYTIME[/B][/COLOR]\nWhat part of [B]"Gun Safety Rule #3: Keep your finger off the trigger till your gun is pointing at the target"[/B] is so difficult to understand?\n\nIf, for some inexplicable reason, you find yourself constantly & needlessly fondling the trigger, then either get a gun with a manual safety [B](and keep the safety on at all times!)[/B] or, better still, [B]you stay as far away from guns as possible![/B]\n\nThis argument point, however, once more underscores the fact that [B]the chambered gun is considered "dangerous" simply because of an utter lack of respect for the gun safety laws!\n[/B]\nMy grandfather once told me, [B]the day you don''t respect your gun, is the day your gun will kill you.[/B]\n\n[B]\n[COLOR=#ff0000]4) A CHAMBERED GUN IS ONLY CARRIED ON A BATTLEFIELD OR IF YOU HAVE "ENEMIES"[/COLOR][/B]\nUnfortunately, we live in a society where the rule of law is nonexistent. Not a day goes by when we don''t read or hear about the lawless chaos that is prevalent in our world. If a [B]law-abiding citizen carries a weapon for the sole purpose of self-defense,[/B] then he must do so under the premise that [B]he might be required to use that weapon at any given moment, in the least amount of time.[/B]\n\nIf we accept that such are the times in which we live, then why are we so reluctant to accept the fact that carrying and deploying a chambered firearm has become a survival necessity? Soldiers carry chambered firearms in a war zone because [B]they may be required to use their firearms at a moment''s notice.[/B] Considering the poor law & order situation in which we live today, [B]how is our situation any different?[/B]\n\n[COLOR=#ff0000][B]\n5) YOU''RE AN ARM CHAIR EXPERT, YOU DON''T KNOW ANYTHING[/B][/COLOR]\nThis term, which has become so en vogue lately, not surprisingly has [B]absolutely no bearing[/B] on the "to chamber or not to chamber" debate.\n\nFor example, if I were to put forward theories on the extractor design of a Mauser Kar98, I would rightfully be labelled an [B]"arm chair expert".[/B] Why? Because I don''t have any [B]experience[/B] with a Kar98.\n\nHowever, unlike the various technicalities of a particular firearm, [B]common sense[/B] requires [B]no[/B] lifetime experience. In fact, [B]a simple mind capable of making logical deductions is all that is needed to make sound judgements. Ergo, the "arm chair expert" just might be the one talking sense.[/B] \n\n\n[COLOR=#ff0000][B]6) I''M JUST NOT COMFORTABLE CARRYING A CHAMBERED GUN[/B][/COLOR]\nThis is actually a very understandable point. When I first started carrying a gun, I used to do so with [B]a round in the chamber and the safety on;[/B] I did so because I wanted to [B]get used to carrying a firearm and stay safe as I grew in confidence.[/B] At no point did I [B]ever[/B] consider carrying [B]unchambered[/B] because it just didn''t make sense to me. [B]A round in the chamber is the natural state of an "active" gun.[/B] If you''re not comfortable carrying a chambered firearm, then I personally suggest you start carrying your firearm with the safety on; atleast that will give you a peace of mind and you will slowly gain confidence with your chambered gun.\n\n\n[COLOR=#ff0000][B]7) PEOPLE WHO CARRYING CHAMBERED ARE IRRESPONSIBLE[/B][/COLOR]\nThis statement has [B]never[/B] made sense to me; [B]how can the state of your self-defense weapon determine the level of your responsibility?[/B] That''s like saying just because I drive a Ferrari, I''m more liable to over-speed and break every single traffic rule in the book! Responsibility lies with the [B]human operator[/B] and [B]NOT[/B] the inanimate object! [B]YOU[/B] are responsible for [B]all [/B]your actions! [B]YOU[/B] are accountable for the use & misuse of your firearm! If you suffer from a bout of temporary insanity or blinding rage, even an [B]unloaded[/B] gun is dangerous in your hands!\n\nThe first rule of gun ownership is to have a [B]very balanced mindset[/B] and to [B]be completely aware of the consequences of your actions.[/B][B] In no way can you make a logical defense of irresponsible actions by simply saying that a "chambered round made me do it!"[/B] If you''re going to own (let alone carry) a firearm, then [B]accept the great responsibility that comes with it![/B]\n\n\n[COLOR=#ff0000][B]CONCLUSION[/B][/COLOR]\nI own & carry a gun strictly for protecting my life and the lives of my loved ones. I carry a chambered gun whenever I leave the house and I have a chambered gun next to my bed when I go to sleep. I have no enemies, yet my own chambered gun once saved my life from a random instance of sheer terror. Law-abiding citizens all over the world carry their defense weapons chambered; I really can''t figure out why we are so reluctant to do so! I''ve said this on numerous occasions that "a round in the pipe" is the proper way of carrying a self-defense firearm, and I hope I''ve managed to get my point across. [B]Do it right, or don''t do it at all![/B][/quote]', ''),

(464474, ' Bro, I personally believe that benefits of Carrying a round in chamber have been overstated in various online forums and discussion boards.\r\n\r\nKindly allow me to explain why: (Just expressing my personal opinion)\r\n\r\n[QUOTE=Ahnab;302486]DISCLAIMER:1) A CHAMBERED GUN IS DANGEROUS[/QUOTE]\r\n\r\nThats common sense bro. ofcourse a chambered gun is dangerous. think for a second, which one is more safer, a gun with that needs to be racked first or a gun with one in the pipe? lets not commit the sin of assuming that firearm related accidents only happen to when the trigger is pressed.\r\n\r\nwhat I am trying to say is that anyone can accidentally drop a firearm. I know most modern firearms have drop safeties but you know what they say: if something can go wrong, it will.\r\n\r\n[QUOTE=Ahnab;302486]2) RACKING THE SLIDE TAKES NO TIME[/QUOTE]\r\n\r\nyou are taking this advise out of context bro. Ofcourse racking a slide takes time. it is not possible in this universe to perform an action without sometime associated with it, now matter how small.\r\n\r\nhowever in its true form "racking the slide takes no time" means that whatever you can achieve by simply turning the safety off before pointing the gun at your target, you can also achieve the same by racking the slide and pointing the gun at the target. I can write all night long discussing game theory models with you but I would rather cut to the chase, you are a smart man. here we go:\r\n\r\nmost handgun related incidents occur (A) when the victim is never aware of the situation. if you are not aware, you might as well carry a hand grenade with the pin between your teeth, it would be a futile exercise. or (B) when the victim is fully aware of the situation. in that case, you can even wrap the gun in stretch film (burlap if you prefer otherwise) and would still have time to be ready to face that threat.\r\n\r\n[QUOTE=Ahnab;302486]3) A CHAMBERED GUN CAN GO OFF ANYTIME\r\nWhat part of [B]"Gun Safety Rule #3: Keep your finger off the trigger till your gun is pointing at the target"[/B] is so difficult to understand?[/QUOTE]\r\n\r\nBro, if exercising caution is a universally practiced idea/concept then why do all potentially hazardous machinery/tools have dead man safties/switches?\r\n\r\nwhy do some cars constantly beep every few seconds (till your head explodes) if you dont wear seat belt? is this me or the manufacturer thinks that all drivers are prone to mistakes. its the human condition bro. everybody is prone to mistakes. its not all about knowing gun safety laws.\r\n\r\n[QUOTE=Ahnab;302486]7) PEOPLE WHO CARRYING CHAMBERED ARE IRRESPONSIBLE[/B][/COLOR][/QUOTE]\r\n\r\nNo! I would not say that. instead I would say (not to be taken seriously :)) that people who are carrying chambered are mostly Hollywood influenced people who mistakenly think that they are living in Wild Wild West (or mean streets if you will) and their every breath could be their last one. therefore to justify such uncertainty in their minds, they keep one of their fingers on the trigger even while taking a tactical dump (my apologies brother I simply couldn''t resist. hahahhaha)\r\n\r\n\r\n[QUOTE=Ahnab;302486]The first rule of gun ownership is to have a [B]very balanced mindset[/B][/QUOTE]\r\n\r\nkindly allow me to quote someone: "common sense ain''t so common". hence, what I am trying to say is that let not assume that every firearm owner''s brain ticks like a while timed and oiled machine. you''ll be surprised to know how many times during a day we are not in "a very balanced mindset".\r\n\r\nPeace out brother and keep your finger away from the trigger. lols!\r\n\r\nRegards.', ''),

(464521, ' [QUOTE=12GAUGE;302678]Bro, I personally believe that benefits of Carrying a round in chamber have been overstated in various online forums and discussion boards.\n\nKindly allow me to explain why: (Just expressing my personal opinion)\n\n\n\nThats common sense bro. ofcourse a chambered gun is dangerous. think for a second, which one is more safer, a gun with that needs to be racked first or a gun with one in the pipe? lets not commit the sin of assuming that firearm related accidents only happen to when the trigger is pressed.\n\nwhat I am trying to say is that anyone can accidentally drop a firearm. I know most modern firearms have drop safeties but you know what they say: if something can go wrong, it will.\n\n[/QUOTE]\n\nlet me disagree here , This mindset is the actual problem, people still believe that firearms can discharge by dropping , etc, when they hv been tested and proven to be incapable of that for a long time now ( long guns are an exception ) or Firearms with a round in the chamber are dangerous because they can ''on their own '' go off for one reason or the other. \nThe only thing that has been over stated in that regard is the saying ''if something can go wrong, it will .... in reality though it rarely ever does ( or else we would all have cleft lips and extra appendages )   \nIts Mechanically improbable for a weapon to discharge, that carries a firing pin block with out the trigger being pulled.( this is now a scientific Fact) But for some reason People, generally Older shooter''s stick to their convictions.( Sorta like the Steel vs plastic guns debate, never mind the fact that from Nasa space shuttles to modern car''s everything is now moving in the direction of the composite material ) \nIs there a remote /freak accident possibility ? Yeah , pretty much the same possibilities of the Brakes of you car completely Failing ( that would imply you should always drive your car under 20 miles an hour, in-case your brakes fail, under 20 will ensure that if you pull your foot off the gas, the car will roll to a stop), or you getting hit bit by a meteor ( carry an umbrella ? )\nNow can Some1 pls tell me how many cases of Brake failures are reported every year in modern cars? or meteor showers ? Also the same group of people believe de-cocker''s are also unsafe, I have never heard, of a Sig discharging a round due to de-cocker failing.\n\nlet me State for the benefit of all once again : for all practical reasons Modern firearms can''t discharge on their own , without some1 pressing the trigger.\nThere was this Story on the interweb''s about a bullet falling off the table and going Boom. I guess an unchambered gun with rounds in a mag is unsafe too [ extrapolating that (ill)logic] \n\n[quote]you are taking this advise out of context bro. Ofcourse racking a slide takes time. it is not possible in this universe to perform an action without sometime associated with it, now matter how small.\n\nhowever in its true form "racking the slide takes no time" means that whatever you can achieve by simply turning the safety off before pointing the gun at your target, you can also achieve the same by racking the slide and pointing the gun at the target. I can write all night long discussing game theory models with you but I would rather cut to the chase, you are a smart man. here we go:\n\nmost handgun related incidents occur (A) when the victim is never aware of the situation. if you are not aware, you might as well carry a hand grenade with the pin between your teeth, it would be a futile exercise. or (B) when the victim is fully aware of the situation. in that case, you can even wrap the gun in stretch film (burlap if you prefer otherwise) and would still have time to be ready to face that threat.[/quote]\n\nWhat Ahnab bhai meant was Its More Efficient, which you kind of Agreed with. \nI think you missed the Story Ahnab bhai quoted of him out drawing a scum that was racking his Slide.\nI think people in general need to Take force on force classes, even if it involves travelling abroad ( James Yeager''s the Fight is relatively cheap ) \nIn reality, right before any bad event, there comes a time when your brain is going like : Oh Shit .... this is really happening, this is when you realize some1 is drawing a weapon ( or in some cases you are now in a particularly nasty exchange of words or physical confrontation ) \nSituation A pretty much never happens, you always get a 30 sec or more window to react , in which you can push kick the offender and run away, Stop their draw, Draw your Chambered weapon with a 2 sec presentation window  and move off target at the same time ( this takes a lot of practice), or the ever popular...Freeze and go Numb. \n[b]However all of that aside, Ahnab''s point was simple : Which is more Efficient ? and the Answer is simple too .[/b]\nthere is a reason why Kydex holster''s are getting popular, with out retention straps or clips and buttons, they are Simple and more Efficient.\n\n[quote]Bro, if exercising caution is a universally practiced idea/concept then why do all potentially hazardous machinery/tools have dead man safties/switches?[/quote] \nIsn''t that just a bad example, for Dead man switches to work , doesn''t the machine need to running in the first place? How is that related in anyway to an Inert Firearm? ( chambered or otherwise ) \nAgain :[b] What part of "Gun Safety Rule #3: Keep your finger off the trigger till your gun is pointing at the target" is so difficult to understand?[/b]\n\n[quote]people who are carrying chambered are mostly Hollywood influenced people who mistakenly think that they are living in Wild Wild West (or mean streets if you will)[/quote]\n( I took it seriously  :P)\nSo Even with the current situation and quite recent riots/arson/kidnapping''s/mugging you think we live in a civilized world where people respect other people''s Life and property.( the overwhelming majority of people are actually good humans, but Id still be prepared )\n[b]Again going back the the Efficiency point on this one.IF your carrying a Firearm, its becuz you suspect something can go wrong, Carry it in ''as ready a state you can'' or feel comfortable with.[/b]', ''),

Second, this discussion is [B]strictly limited[/B] to whether a gun owner should carry a gun chambered or not; in no way is this a discussion about when to shoot, or what the legal repercussions of an active shooting are, etc. Therefore, [B]please be polite[/B] and, agree or disagree, do express your thoughts on the matter.[/I]\n\nA couple of weeks ago I was on the receiving end of a very passionate lecture about the horrors and pitfalls of carrying a gun chambered. The "lecturer" was a very senior and experienced firearms enthusiast who even cited a few unfortunate examples of why a chambered gun is a liability with potentially fatal consequences. According to the gentleman, people who carry chambered are [B]"highly irresponsible, pumped up yahoos and wanna-be Rambo''s who have absolutely no regard for the consequences of their actions!"[/B] Strong words indeed! So strong, in fact, that I was completely stunned into silence by the tone and "logic" that was being used to vilify carrying a chambered firearm.\n\nInitially, I had decided to let the matter go; after all, it was just one opinion (albeit a very strong one) and I was free to disagree and ignore it. But realizing the seniority of the gentleman gave me pause in my dismissal of his point of view, and I started thinking about what he had said. Going over the entire "lecture" in my mind, I realized that the gentleman''s entire anti-chambered argument was based, ultimately, on the premise that a typical gun owner is simply not competent enough to carry a chambered gun. In other words, a typical gun owner is irresponsible and is incapable of being trusted to carry a chambered firearm (which, by the way, is how the rest of the world carries a firearm). So that got me thinking: what is it exactly about us Pakistanis that makes us utterly unable to follow a few simple gun safety rules while the rest of the world continues to do so without hesitation? Could it be that, since the gun safety rules were written in English, our understanding of the gora''s language is extremely lacking? Or perhaps we still adhere to our rebellious ways against the colonialist gora and his damnable rules? Or maybe we just simply don''t care?\n\nI racked my brain for almost a week but just couldn''t figure it out. So then I tried a different approach; I tried to examine the various points of the gentleman''s argument and see if they hold any logical merit. In that I was met with with a measure of success.\n\nThe following are the salient points of the anti-chambered debate and my side of the argument.\n\nMind you, I am writing this because of the great respect I have for the gentleman.\n\n[COLOR=#ff0000][B]\n1) A CHAMBERED GUN IS DANGEROUS[/B][/COLOR]\nSuppose one day you come home from a long day at the office. You''re tired, hungry and can''t wait to get some sleep. So you get home, rush up to your bedroom, put your chambered pistol on the night stand and jump into the shower. A few moments later, your 5-year old son strolls into your room and sees your gun. He picks it up and starts playing with it, thinking it''s a toy. Suddenly his finger slips on to the trigger, and he squeezes...\n\nSurely, for many of us, this is possibly the worst nightmare we can imagine. The question that begs to be asked is, where exactly does the blame for such a tragedy lie? The gun? The child? The chambered round? No, on all accounts. [B]The real blame lies at your feet, the irresponsible gun owner.[/B] Whether you have children or not, or even if you live completely alone, the cardinal principle of firearms is that [B]guns are dangerous objects and, as such, need to be treated with the utmost care and respect.[/B]\n\nWe''ve all heard of multiple incidents where a gun owner, while cleaning his gun, accidentally shot himself. Apparently the hapless victim did not clear his gun properly. So, in these unfortunate instances, where does the blame lie? The gun? The cleaning equipment? The chambered round, perhaps? Again, the answer is no on all accounts. [B]The actual blames lies with the irresponsible gun owner who did a sloppy job of clearing his gun.[/B]\n\nOh, and a piece of advice; by ejecting the magazine and racking the slide a couple of times does [B]NOT[/B] mean that you''ve safely cleared your gun! Instead, you also need to [B]physically[/B] ensure that the gun is clear by [B]locking back the slide, looking through the ejection port to make sure that there is no magazine in the gun and then sticking your pinky finger into the chamber to make sure that there''s no round in the chamber either.[/B] And please, for the love of God, [B]don''t point the gun at anybody or anything you''re not willing to shoot![/B]\n\n[B]Remember, nothing in this world will kill you faster than complacency.[/B]\n\n[COLOR=#ff0000][B]\n2) RACKING THE SLIDE TAKES NO TIME[/B][/COLOR]\nTell me, what''s faster & requires less of an effort; [B]racking the slide or pulling the trigger?[/B]\n\nNo matter how fast you are, no matter how quick your draw, the trigger finger will [B]ALWAYS[/B] be infinitely faster than the racking arm. I have personally come face to face with a loaded gun, and the [B]ONLY[/B] reason I''m sitting at home, happily typing away at my keyboard this very instant, is because by the time the jackass racked his slide, my chambered gun was pointing straight at his face [B](even though he drew his gun first!)[/B].\n\nSure, you can say that I have a personal bias in favor of a chambered gun. [B]Considering that I''m alive because of a chambered gun, hell yeah I''m biased![/B]\n\n[COLOR=#ff0000][B]\n3) A CHAMBERED GUN CAN GO OFF ANYTIME[/B][/COLOR]\nWhat part of [B]"Gun Safety Rule #3: Keep your finger off the trigger till your gun is pointing at the target"[/B] is so difficult to understand?\n\nIf, for some inexplicable reason, you find yourself constantly & needlessly fondling the trigger, then either get a gun with a manual safety [B](and keep the safety on at all times!)[/B] or, better still, [B]you stay as far away from guns as possible![/B]\n\nThis argument point, however, once more underscores the fact that [B]the chambered gun is considered "dangerous" simply because of an utter lack of respect for the gun safety laws!\n[/B]\nMy grandfather once told me, [B]the day you don''t respect your gun, is the day your gun will kill you.[/B]\n\n[B]\n[COLOR=#ff0000]4) A CHAMBERED GUN IS ONLY CARRIED ON A BATTLEFIELD OR IF YOU HAVE "ENEMIES"[/COLOR][/B]\nUnfortunately, we live in a society where the rule of law is nonexistent. Not a day goes by when we don''t read or hear about the lawless chaos that is prevalent in our world. If a [B]law-abiding citizen carries a weapon for the sole purpose of self-defense,[/B] then he must do so under the premise that [B]he might be required to use that weapon at any given moment, in the least amount of time.[/B]\n\nIf we accept that such are the times in which we live, then why are we so reluctant to accept the fact that carrying and deploying a chambered firearm has become a survival necessity? Soldiers carry chambered firearms in a war zone because [B]they may be required to use their firearms at a moment''s notice.[/B] Considering the poor law & order situation in which we live today, [B]how is our situation any different?[/B]\n\n[COLOR=#ff0000][B]\n5) YOU''RE AN ARM CHAIR EXPERT, YOU DON''T KNOW ANYTHING[/B][/COLOR]\nThis term, which has become so en vogue lately, not surprisingly has [B]absolutely no bearing[/B] on the "to chamber or not to chamber" debate.\n\nFor example, if I were to put forward theories on the extractor design of a Mauser Kar98, I would rightfully be labelled an [B]"arm chair expert".[/B] Why? Because I don''t have any [B]experience[/B] with a Kar98.\n\nHowever, unlike the various technicalities of a particular firearm, [B]common sense[/B] requires [B]no[/B] lifetime experience. In fact, [B]a simple mind capable of making logical deductions is all that is needed to make sound judgements. Ergo, the "arm chair expert" just might be the one talking sense.[/B] \n\n\n[COLOR=#ff0000][B]6) I''M JUST NOT COMFORTABLE CARRYING A CHAMBERED GUN[/B][/COLOR]\nThis is actually a very understandable point. When I first started carrying a gun, I used to do so with [B]a round in the chamber and the safety on;[/B] I did so because I wanted to [B]get used to carrying a firearm and stay safe as I grew in confidence.[/B] At no point did I [B]ever[/B] consider carrying [B]unchambered[/B] because it just didn''t make sense to me. [B]A round in the chamber is the natural state of an "active" gun.[/B] If you''re not comfortable carrying a chambered firearm, then I personally suggest you start carrying your firearm with the safety on; atleast that will give you a peace of mind and you will slowly gain confidence with your chambered gun.\n\n\n[COLOR=#ff0000][B]7) PEOPLE WHO CARRYING CHAMBERED ARE IRRESPONSIBLE[/B][/COLOR]\nThis statement has [B]never[/B] made sense to me; [B]how can the state of your self-defense weapon determine the level of your responsibility?[/B] That''s like saying just because I drive a Ferrari, I''m more liable to over-speed and break every single traffic rule in the book! Responsibility lies with the [B]human operator[/B] and [B]NOT[/B] the inanimate object! [B]YOU[/B] are responsible for [B]all [/B]your actions! [B]YOU[/B] are accountable for the use & misuse of your firearm! If you suffer from a bout of temporary insanity or blinding rage, even an [B]unloaded[/B] gun is dangerous in your hands!\n\nThe first rule of gun ownership is to have a [B]very balanced mindset[/B] and to [B]be completely aware of the consequences of your actions.[/B][B] In no way can you make a logical defense of irresponsible actions by simply saying that a "chambered round made me do it!"[/B] If you''re going to own (let alone carry) a firearm, then [B]accept the great responsibility that comes with it![/B]\n\n\n[COLOR=#ff0000][B]CONCLUSION[/B][/COLOR]\nI own & carry a gun strictly for protecting my life and the lives of my loved ones. I carry a chambered gun whenever I leave the house and I have a chambered gun next to my bed when I go to sleep. I have no enemies, yet my own chambered gun once saved my life from a random instance of sheer terror. Law-abiding citizens all over the world carry their defense weapons chambered; I really can''t figure out why we are so reluctant to do so! I''ve said this on numerous occasions that "a round in the pipe" is the proper way of carrying a self-defense firearm, and I hope I''ve managed to get my point across. [B]Do it right, or don''t do it at all![/B][/QUOTE]\n\nIts okay to carry a chambered weapon as long as you observe all the safety rules....most modern weapons have excellent safety measures provided you act on common sense and internationally accepted safety guidelines.....its not advised with local clones and some older soviet bloc weapons though.......clear the fire arm...ensure its clear and and through out this process point the muzzel in a safe direction with a reliable back stop.....never point the gun at some thing you are not willing to destroy.....when drawing your firearm from its holster make sure that your finger stays of the trigger....follow these steps dilligently and Inshallah nothing will happen....', ''),

I have been thinking that instead of selling the PG merchandise at a cost how about we promote a sense of association instead of sense of ownership by selling them at discount?\r\n\r\nwhat I am trying to say is that instead of promoting the idea that members are buying an item/cap, we give an impression that they are becoming part of something.\r\n\r\nhow about we base price the black caps at 400/each. that is we give discount of 100 in the base price. then we add Option B shipping charges to it. now total price per cap of the back one comes at 400 plus 150 = 550.\r\n\r\nwith that, we add a premium of 100 to the base price of orange cap. now base price of the orange cap would be 600. add shipping 150 and we''ll have 750 price per cap.\r\n\r\nwhy I am doing this is because, we are using black caps to promote sense of association whereas since the orange cap (high visibility hunter orange) is very very very hard to come by and the ones that are available at hunting stores in extremely limited quantity usually cost somewhere in the vicinity of 4-5K. so any member who is exclusive looking for a hunting cap would be more than happy to pay 750 rupees for a tool/cap. similar principle we saw at work while selling PG shooting/hunting vests. we gave them higher quality at half the market price. it promoted association by way of cash savings and better quality. same can be our pitch here. we have special high visibility cloth that was specifically colored in limited quantity as per our specifications. the cloth has been thoroughly tested, it will not stretch out and lose its shape, the bill will stay in its shape even during the rigors of hunt and the color will not fade, wash after wash. the cloth is cotton poly blend specially formulated to withstand wash after wash.\r\n\r\nanyways, am I making any sense?

However either way the presumption is guns can be made more safe, by un-chambering the round.\nIF you take the firearm alone, a chambered modern firearm is no more dangerous than an un-chambered one, Guns simple don''t / can''t let off rounds on their own. ( I''m presuming you understand why that is, or maybe you don''t believe that statement is true)\nThat leaves the situation that you don''t trust the operator, in that case shouldn''t you ask them to disarm. ( if I don''t trust someone''s driving, I don''t let them drive )    \n\n2.\nSo let me get this Straight: you admit that if you actually needed to ''use your firearm'' in an ''extremely violent'' situation  carrying Chambered is better ( would be your mode of carry ) [B]Do people become more reliable/dependable ( safe operator''s ) , or do guns become inherently more Safe in such ''violent situations''?[/B] that to me doesn''t make any sense.\nSince no-one really know''s where and when our enemies ( thieves, robber''s, kidnappers, terrorists, religious nut job''s ) may show up, souldn''t you always be carrying a firearm in a ready to use state.\n\n[B]Efficiency in general describes accomplishment of or ability to accomplish a job with a minimum expenditure of time and effort. It is often used with the specific purpose of relaying the capability of a specific application of effort to produce a specific outcome effectively with a minimum amount or quantity of waste, expense, or unnecessary effort.[/B]\n\nHere''s my opinion: People tend to believe Firearms themselves are Inherently Dangerous ( they hv a mind of their own and can shoot people on their own).\nHowever scientifically and objectively, a Chambered handgun is no more Dangerous than an UNchambered one.\nA chambered Firearm is Just a more Efficient tool at its intended purpose. \nStick to the 4 laws of firearm safety and and in most cases even if you mistakenly by-pass one, the other 3 will keep you safe (i.e you pressed the trigger but the gun was pointed in a safe direction ....no dmg done thankfully etc etc )\nCarry as you please, But learn to carry as Efficiently as you can ( if it takes you more than 5-10 sec''s to deploy you firearm , you need more practice and you need to look into or change your mode/ method of carry )\n\n@ OP  AHnab I agree with you pretty much All the way .[/QUOTE]\n\nFirstly, when asking someone to unchamber a weapon I usually dont let them point it at my face and enjoy. The precaution taken when unchambering a round should be clear to all that visit this website. Whether they follow those rules or not is something I would leave upto them. Everyone that I interact with ranks and files in one category when around loved ones. When I am visiting a picnic spot by the lake in the States with no wildlife or dakaits why would anyone have a chambered weapon? I do not live in a violent surrounding or have enemies. The only enemy that day would be an accidental discharge no matter how low the probability of that happening is. My defense doctrine revolves around unchambered weapon to be chambered when danger is present. I do not think I will get in a quick draw with a BG. \n\nMaybe it is different for people who say that chambered is the way to go. My philosophy to trust metal and springs might be different than yours, dosnt mean that yours is wrong. It just means it is just another way to do things. I am not a paranoid person, but I am realistic as well. You could go through the list and answer the questions yourself as well. \n\n1) What is the probability of any chambered weapon going off?\n2) What are the leading causes of chambered weapons going off?\n3) What is the probability of "your" chambered weapon going off?\n4) What is the probability of someone elses chambered weapon going off?\n5) What is the probability of an unchambered weapon going off?\n6) How long does it take you to rack the slide?\n\nI wish I could explain better but since I am not arguing with you I just tried to explain how other people go on with their lives successfully without having to deal with a life altering mechanical failure. Everyone I meet does not present their weapons for inspection or if it has a decocker present. The easy way for me to do things would be to ask people to practice their threat reaction times accordingly when coming to a family gathering.', ''),

First day I could not go due to commitments here. And our friends (three guns) had a gr8 quail day. Shot 97 (retrieved) in morning shoot. No rain however on Sat.\r\n\r\nThinking that it would be dry on Sunday as well, we went to a second area and district in morning but were surprised to find that just an hour or two before dawn, light to moderate rains slashed the area and small pools of water were seen around pattis. However with the help of a few pointers, we managed to scan the small bushes and shrubs....shot about 40. Then immediately moved to another patti nearby where there were some nice fields too, but lesser standing water. Again the dogs (real good ones) got us another 59-60. The total was about 100 shot in a morning with four guns.\r\n\r\nSeeing the black clouds and drizzle which had already started during the last hour or more of the second beat, we then headed for the vehicles and drove back.

Ofcourse the local gunsmith can certify and stamp anything (serial No.''s, symbols etc) on the weapon anyway. In the absence of such basic quality controls, safety is compromised.

I do not live in a violent surrounding or have enemies. The only enemy that day would be an accidental discharge no matter how low the probability of that happening is. My defense doctrine revolves around unchambered weapon to be chambered when danger is present. I do not think I will get in a quick draw with a BG. \n[/QUOTE]\nSir I can whole heartedly respect that, You live in a place where you "Believe" you are Safe. You hv no enemies and your surroundings are non-violent. If in such a condition, the only "Enemy" is an AD, Why carry a Firearm in the first place. This is the same logic Anti gun lobbyists use.\nI think the problem is this illusion of Safety we live in.\nAgain I''m repeating Myself here : If I carry a firearm( meaning I am open to the possibility of bad things happening to good people ) , I would prefer to carry it in the most Efficient ( and still safe method) as I can, Chambered Modern handguns are as a matter of Fact as safe as a completely unloaded Firearm with no magazine in it. They are Functionally Inert for all purposes un-less Made to fire by intentionally pulling the trigger ( and/ or disengaging a safety before hand )  \n            \n[QUOTE=Enigmatic Desires;302738]\nAn after literally years of discussions and debates. I am at peace with my solution as regards my primary CC weapon. Took delivery today.[/QUOTE]\nED bro, so now you carry a weapon with no external safety, de-cocker, loaded chamber indicator and you still feel its safe to carry.\nI''m not sure if this weapon has a ''Transfer bar'' . is it Drop safe? Will you be carrying this by leaving the top cylinder in front of the hammer empty. How many rounds does that leave you with.  \nHow are Glocks, caracal, CZ''s more [b]Inherently[/b] unsafe than this setup .\nHowever thanks for Bringing the Revolver into this discussion, for hundreds of years people carry revolvers Loaded and ready to go with a steady trigger pull, how are auto pistols more unsafe when they are ''Mechanically'' made to hv at-least 3 safeties minimum.\nPeople who would find themselves in frequent confrontations used to cut out the front of the trigger guard to make their firearm even more Efficient. [b] Modern Locked and loaded/ chambered Firearms are simply more Efficient while Still being insanely Safe (more safe than their predecessors ). That''s what Ahnab was trying to say in essence and I concur [/b]  \nSo your recent purchase has me confused. So did you reconsider you original stance?\nAgain however pls let me restate : Modern firearms are Very Safe irrespective of the Carry conditioning. You should be more concerned about getting hit by lightening.\n\nOn a side note on mindset : People that Believe that their firearms are in a ''safe condition'' , in some cases Behave like baboons with them, pointing and playing with them more Often than those that believe they are ready to go , This is entirely my observation.\nLoaded/ unloaded, Chambered/unchamebred, External safeties/no external safety are all entirely irrelevant , The Four Rules of firearm safety will generally keep you and you surroundings safe from an AD/ND while keeping your firearm Fully functional for its intended purpose. That''s simply what I believe, and I know Of no Firearm instructor that teaches keeping Empty chambered firearms for SD and carry.\n\nLack of training, or safe methods of carry ( unchambered/unloaded)  are not mutually exclusive to Safety Rules for handling firearms, in fact imo they are irrelevant if you Follow the four rules.\nIf a 2 year old can be taught not to mess around with Electrical outlets, and a 4-5 year old can be taught not to Run with Scissors/knives/pencils while holding them pointed towards the sky. I believe a grown Adult can be Taught how to Safely handle a firearm.', ''),

The logic behind empty chamber firearms is to Prevent a ND. \nAgain the parking sensor''s don''t Fit becuz I actually cannot see my bumpers while parking, and I appreciate those things. During driving though , they cannot prevent an accident, so they don''t Fit either.\nSimilarly the Park in Auto transmission is to disengage the gears so you don''t jerk it, its the same thing as putting a manual car in any gear and turning the ignition key. That''s just how they work , similarly a gun wont work unless you pull the trigger.\nThe fire extinguisher pin is also meant to make it operational, not much different from an external safety on a firearm. \nin all honestly Sir with all due respect, I  understand what your implying, But an empty chambered weapon is not an Additional safety ( scientifically and empirically ) ,  in my opinion it is just a Disability like the Old Russian TT 30 / mak pouch holsters, a bad disabling design.      \n\nP.S I do fancy cars :) appreciate you noticing that, that single comment for some reason brought a smile to my face :)', ''),
