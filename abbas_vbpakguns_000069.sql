I''m staying in Pakistan for one month and I plan to visit some ranges while I''m there and then take my firearms back with me. The only official Pakistani form of identification I have is a NICOP which identifies me as a dual national-- I''m not sure how relevant that is to this discussion, but I''m stating it in case you know something that I don''t. I''m traveling from JFK in NYC to Allama Iqbal Airport in LHE. I''m flying Etihad Airlines which, naturally, has a layover in Abu Dhabi. I have all the American paperwork for the firearms which were purchased in the United States. I have a firearms ID in the state of NJ in the United States (which is basically like a driver''s license for guns). The State of NJ does not issue permits for shotguns or rifles, they make you go through an online federal background check; they only require permits to purchase handguns. I have contacted JFK Airport as well as the State Police in NJ and NY to confirm the proper procedure for transporting firearms from my home in NJ to the airport. Pretty simple. I have to drive DIRECTLY (no stops) to the airport from home. Once at JFK, proceed IMMEDIATELY (no stops) to the terminal to check in baggage. Also, NY Port Authority Police have made it very clear to me: I''m not allowed to have [B]possession[/B] of a handgun in nyc, so I''m leaving that at home. At this point, per Airline regulations and per regulations at JFK airport, I must check my firearms with the Airlines staff as unloaded, separate from ammunition, and locked in proper case, etc. etc. (you can refer to Etihad Airlines website as well as TSA website for more details on this part). This must be done with TSA (security at JFK airport) observing and verifying to such. I have already met with Etihad Airlines staff at their office in NYC. They handed me a form to fill out for each firearm (wherein I detail the make, model, etc of the firearm, reason for transport, a copy of my passport (photo page), a copy of my firearms license, plus more). This form must be scanned and emailed to Abu Dhabi International Airport Security Department with a copy of the email forwarded to the Airlines (as the staff member at the NYC office explained to me). I asked for the number for the Abu Dhabi Airport Security Department to which the staff member refused. I was able to get that number by an airline call center employee who unwittingly handed it to me! I called Abu Dhabi Airport Security and they were not amused by my call since it was unexpected (their number isn''t supposed to be handed out). Nonetheless, they politely answered my question on how to avoid being arrested at Abu Dhabi International Airport with fireams in my luggage. The staff member at the Security department explained that I only need to fill out the forms as was explained to me by the Etihad NYC office and that my baggage would not need to be rechecked at the Abu Dhabi airport, even if I entered Abu Dhabi during my layover (as I intend to do; I''ll be visiting the Corniche and Shaykh Abu Zeyd Mosque if you''re wondering why). My forms are filled and have been emailed. I''m on the last leg of this painstakingly researched Journey. I would like to know what my best option is to LEGALLY enter & exit Allama Iqbal International Airport with both of my firearms and to transport within Pakistan from my wife''s residence to the gun range. During the course of my research, I could only find ''hearsay'' and what amounted to unsubstantiated information that is hard to verify. Since I originally posted this on another website, I only have 1 update which is that I can''t take my handgun with me, per NYC law: I don''t have a handgun permit in NYC, only in NJ, so it''s illegal in NYC for me to have even possession of a handgun. Secondly, over the course of the last two weeks: the embassy of Pakistan in D.C. and the consulate in NY has been of very little use. Back and forth calling, being put on hold on the line for over an hour only to be transferred to another department has taken up all my free time outside of work and school. They know NOTHING! I''m going to make an attempt to make some calls overseas. I''m not sure where or whom to start calling. Perhaps the Defense Ministry? Customs? Border Protection? I''ll try to figure it out and make calls when I can. Can anyone provide me with reliable AND verifiable information on what procedure I need to follow? Contact information for the proper channels would be highly appreciated. I''ll try to state this in the most nicest way: please, please refrain from one-sentence replies or from replying without referencing some source that I can double-check. If I do find out the proper procedure on my own, I will be sure to report it back. Insha''allah, that''ll be very helpful to others in my situation. P.S> I have been recording all of my calls and conversations with the different authorities mentioned above, so if anyone else in my situation ever needs some clear evidences before they follow the same procedure, I would not mind sharing.

Hunters (people that hunt within the law) are the eyes and ears for the regulating bodies and provide valuable insights and information to them. e.g. we have a disease called Chronic Wasting Disease spreading among deer species in some areas, we submit the heads from our hunts for testing and management of disease. I recently received an email to take part in a survey if I had hunted in specific areas, that was to learn more about a species of wolf in that area. Man has been hunting since his existence, farming and crops came later on. Human stupidity and greed has no bounds, if a species was hunted (read poached) to extinction that was wrong and unethical and immoral. As a paradigm if a guy commits a crime with a gun, is banning guns from the country your solution, if not then you have double standards and unfortunately that makes you a hypocrite. Also there is no requirement for psychological evaluation of would be gun owners in Canada generally (there might be in a special case, but I am unaware of even that), so you made that up as well. And I am sure that since you have a low opinion of our psychiatrists, they probably are contemplating suicide out of shame as I type this message. My sincere advice to you dear ED is, get the idea of being always right out of your head and proving that everyone else is wrong, life is not about conflict, it is about co existing.\n  [QUOTE=Enigmatic Desires;426761]You.. are happy... that an entire.. species has been hunted to extinction!! and would willingly consign others to the same fate..

House was in the middle of a forest with a fair bit of land. Lizards were common living space invaders but had 1 rattle snake and 1 black cobra grace us. Rattle snake was spotted by our cat Tom, who ran out of that room like he''d been scared s''less, which gave us the indication something was in the room next to my room. I, 14 or 15 then, walked in the room to find the rattling sound .... ''mommmmm .... snaaaaaake ....'' close door, and ran to call Juma Waan (our hard core Indonesian gardener). This guy was fearless ... arrived with a long stick he had for catching snakes and in 5 minutes the rattle was bagged. Second time was the cobra coiled up outside parents room, mid-afternoon. Mom was snoozing and when she woke she called the maid to remove the ''rassi'' from the front of the room. Baffled maid walked to the corridor only to scream ''sapppp baaji'' ... again the gardener to rescue. Both times living snakes were handed over to pest control govt agency - they killed the rattle snake but took the cobra away live, don''t know why ...\n\nOne thing Juma Waan told us was to avoid killing the snake inside the house as where one kills the snake the others are likely to visit. On the single lane road to the house from the main road, every other week a snake of some kind would fall victim to the car tyres. After the rattle snake incident and watching the agency people smash it''s head, we started driving slow to avoid wrecklessly killing these creatures. \n\nWould recommend you get a garbage picking stick, modify the length and picker face, or order a snake catcher stick.[/QUOTE]\n\n@ VERVE, very interesting story.

I have agricultural land and I want to convert it into a business.\n\nBro first thing to keep in mind is that 1stranger is correct about bank interest. It''s haram. No matter how big is the profit, it''s like eating poo.\n\nI wouldn''t advise you to invest in property because that gives you profit after a long time. At least 2-3 years. And I understand you need to invest in a business which gives you monthly income at least. It also looks like you don''t have any business experience and like me, none of your family or close friends are in business.\n\nFriend, I will advise you to invest in cattle farming. I think you have around 10 million money with you. With this, you can set up an excellent cattle farm with all the modern technologies. The milk gives you daily return, you can use the animal''s dung in a bio-gas plant for free gas and electricity, and the animals breed and increase for free, which is an added bonus. But it will take a lot of careful planning and an experienced management to run the cattle farm. You can''t do it alone from the start.\n\nNext is my friend that you go and visit China and see if you can become an importer/exporter. It is incredibly simple and easy. Only you need to select the right products for export and import. For this, you will need to first travel to china and make a broad survey of their market and prices. Then see what things are in demand here. With God''s grace and careful planning, you can make more than 100% profit per year. But for the first two three times, you will need to visit china with someone who is already an exporter/importer. Try your friends and family contacts. You will hopefully find a contact. I am myself planning my first visit in June.\n\nAnd of course you can make a carwash pump with a fuel station too. I won''t advise a fuel station in the start as it takes some 5 million nvestment only for the pump machinery. The price of land will be other than that. Carwash you can easily set up with upto 700k, including all the machinery expenses and land price. I have set one up myself in just around 150k, but the land was my friend''s so it''s price isn''t included. It gives a good little money every week for an lol and small personal expenses. I think 4-5 carwash stations in suitable locations can easily give you more than 1k for your daily expenses. Don''t try a carwash as your main business though.\n\n in the end it all comes to experience. Don''t invest in ANYTHING unless you get an understanding of how that business works. However, if you have any relative or friend already in a business which is going successful, if you can trust them, put your investment with them and be their business partner. It''s the safest way (if they are really honest and doing good business, that is).', 1, 0, '119.63.143.29', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

A .177 pellet travels at a greater velocity than the heavier .22 when fired from guns of identical power, but this does not mean that .177 is more powerful. For example;\n\n.177 pellet weighing 8.4 grains, fired at 802 fps (244mps) = 12 foot pounds of kinetic energy.\n.22 pellet weighing 16 grains, fired at 581 fps (177mps) = 12 foot pounds of kinetic energy.\n\nThe lighter .177 pellet has a flatter trajectory which means that when aiming less hold over is required than with a .22 over normal airgun ranges. The benefit of this is that targets are easier to hit with a .177 even if there are slight inaccuracies in range estimation; this is why .177 is the calibre of choice in Field Target and paper target disciplines.\n\nIn countries with laws limiting airgun power, .177 is gaining popularity for hunting, as their flatter trajectory is seen as an advantage over .22. Where .22 scores over .177, is in their retention of down-range energy.\n\nAt the UK power level of 12ft/lbs the difference is fairly small, but as the power increases, the trajectory of both calibres flattens out so reducing the advantage that .177 would have over .22 at lower velocity. However, when a pellet approaches the speed of sound (which is about 1100 feet per second), it can become unstable, resulting in poor accuracy. This problem is almost exclusively confined to .177. The .22 really comes into its own as the velocity increases, when it&#8217;s heavier weight means that the pellets retain greatly superior down range-energy, and do not suffer from the loss of accuracy that can affect high velocity .177 pellets.\n\nDo not confuse velocity with power, they are not the same. Velocity is simply a measure of speed; power as measured in foot pounds or joules, is a measure of kinetic or striking energy, which takes into account the weight of the pellet as well as its speed.', 1, 1, '39.32.53.13', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

Where and when did I say that I wanted them to be hunted to extinction? If you ever care to read, please try reading statistics about how much hunters benefit an ecological system and also the regulating bodies and also how ecological systems work. Hunters (people that hunt within the law) are the eyes and ears for the regulating bodies and provide valuable insights and information to them. e.g. we have a disease called Chronic Wasting Disease spreading among deer species in some areas, we submit the heads from our hunts for testing and management of disease. I recently received an email to take part in a survey if I had hunted in specific areas, that was to learn more about a species of wolf in that area. Man has been hunting since his existence, farming and crops came later on. Human stupidity and greed has no bounds, if a species was hunted (read poached) to extinction that was wrong and unethical and immoral. As a paradigm if a guy commits a crime with a gun, is banning guns from the country your solution, if not then you have double standards and unfortunately that makes you a hypocrite. Also there is no requirement for psychological evaluation of would be gun owners in Canada generally (there might be in a special case, but I am unaware of even that), so you made that up as well. And I am sure that since you have a low opinion of our psychiatrists, they probably are contemplating suicide out of shame as I type this message. My sincere advice to you dear ED is, get the idea of being always right out of your head and proving that everyone else is wrong, life is not about conflict, it is about co existing.[/QUOTE]\n\nYou specifically stated that u r happy that Dodos are hunted to extinction.

Performance wise they both are the same, i cleaned my two air rifles with it and it works perfect and a very handy tool for all kind of rifles, air rifles, shot guns and hand guns. The only difference between this and Otis is that this one is universal means for all type of guns and in Otis i had to buy separately for hand guns, also there is a price difference of about $15 -$20 between this and Otis. This one is slightly expensive but worth it and they both are military grade cleaning kits and are very handy and reliable Because before this i bought another kit from UK which was the cleaning rods one but was a complete piece of rubbish especially its rods were very cheap and they got bent when i use them 2nd time while i was cleaning my Brno. 22 thats why i wanted to go for a pull through kit but which should be reliable and I''m glad this one din''t let me down and it cleaned my air rifles like crisp...so I''m quite happy with it.\r\n[QUOTE=musk;428688]Congratulations for nice purchase[/QUOTE]\r\nThanx Musk Bro :)\r\n\r\n[QUOTE=hmd;428696][QUOTE=Ahtsham Raja;428591]Real Avid''s universal pull through cleaning kit with a nice case...\r\nCongrats bro on your purchase .[/QUOTE]\r\nThanx hmd Brother :)', 1, 1, '92.40.248.134', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

The Chinese AG and the Diana are from my high school days. You will be surprised to learn that both of these guns have never been opened. I just make sure they are used gently and never dropped to hurt accuracy / finish. The finish on the West German Diana is just incredible. The bluing on the barrel and receiver still looks like it came out of box and stock is made of very fine wood. My 11 year old son now shoots it and these guns are truly pieces that you can pass on to generations. \n\nI just make sure that every time I use these guns, I wipe them with a good gun oil leaving no finger prints behind which also result in rusting since skin has natural oils that can the mar finish of metallic surfaces over long use. The Chinese gun also gets an occasional wipe of WD-40 followed by oiling. A drop on the moving parts like the barrel hinge / cocking arm keeps the sweaking away. Only recently, I cleaned the inside of the barrels using alcohol swabs and fishing line as suggested by a dear PG bro. Screws are tightened after every 3~4 shooting sessions. That''s just it. If you want to learn more, just google or visit youtube and you will find loads of info that can help to make these guns more accurate and durable. I am yet to find a synthetic oil from Lahore which can be used to lube the main springs so just add a drop or two of regular gun oil on the spring but this is very rare as too much of it can cause dieseling which can damage a powerful magnum springer. Never pour oil in the barrel or the air port / chamber as this can damage the piston seals. That''s just about it.\n\nAs for performance, I have never chronied these guns but I have a good guess that power has remained fairly consistent throughout the years. I am not a sharp shooter and just love to plink with my guns. Can hit small tins at 25 yards and that''s good enough for me :) \n\nAm using the Hatsan these days and going thru the learning curve of taming this beast.

Performance wise they both are the same, i cleaned my two air rifles with it and it works perfect and a very handy tool for all kind of rifles, air rifles, shot guns and hand guns. The only difference between this and Otis is that this one is universal means for all type of guns and in Otis i had to buy separately for hand guns, also there is a price difference of about $15 -$20 between this and Otis. This one is slightly expensive but worth it and they both are military grade cleaning kits and are very handy and reliable Because before this i bought another kit from UK which was the cleaning rods one but was a complete piece of rubbish especially its rods were very cheap and they got bent when i use them 2nd time while i was cleaning my Brno. 22 thats why i wanted to go for a pull through kit but which should be reliable and I''m glad this one din''t let me down and it cleaned my air rifles like crisp...so I''m quite happy with it.[/QUOTE]\n\n\nBrother thanks for a detailed reply...\nHowever few questions need your reply... :)\n\n1.

What do you think of that and why you preffered pull through over Rod in Avid''s kitts?\n\n3.  Real Avid''s kit used (aluminium,brass)/metal material in kits or plastic? And if plastic is it solid and long lasting..?\n\n4. Generally, what yours opinion about pull through and rod cleaning systems?  Pros and cons...!\n\n5. The kit you got is that universal? Because its not mention on the description of the kit you got.

Yes Bro it is 100% air safe, i''ll copy here the description of the seller provided as well which states that also.\n2. Bro i haven''t tried Real Avid''s Rods one but i can imagine it would be very good like this and my preference is always with a rods cleaning kit the reason I''ve chosen this pull through kit was ike i said before that because the one i bought last time was completely rubbish especially its rods were useless and simply trashwhich was this one\n [ATTACH=CONFIG]29285[/ATTACH] \nthat''s why this time i wanted to go for a nice pull through kit secondly a friend of mine recommended me this one.\n3. Bro Real Avid uses Brass and Aluminium both types for its connectors and brushes, also they have some kits with the plastic connectors aswell but i don''t think going for a kit with the plastic connectors is a good option.\n4. My preference is still the rods kit because with the rods especially for the big bore rifles cleaning of lead in the barrel can be done very easily because they can be moved both forward and backward very easily and rapidly with the cleaning brushes on but although pull through kits can be used both ways aswell but because they are pull through and not stiff like rods so they can not be moved in the barrel very fast like rods one can so i still prefer the kit with the rods even though i have bought a very good pull through kit.\n5. This is a universal kit ma brother and its even mentioned on the packing aswell, You might have missed the 1st pic\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]29286[/ATTACH]\nAnd here is some detailed description from the web page...\n"[I]Premium gun cleaning kits in a Go-Anywhere Case and 100% air safe.

You should always match your airgun''s dimensions with that of the scope so as to avoid these commonly made mistakes. 1 very common thing ppl tend to overlook the most is the size of objective lens and height of the mount in relation to length of the receiver. For a biiger objective lens you need a higher mount. For your use a 4-16x40 or a 3-9x40 scope would do better. I personally have this scope and its quite big, and its NOT one of my favorite scope. \n\nSecondly, most of these under 150$ scopes do not come optically centered and its not really a big deal once you know how to optically center your scopes.\n\nThirdly, you need to be very careful with the windage & elevation knobs esp when the clicks start to feel mushy, STOP tight there. This means that the adjustments are almost fully done and have no room for more clicks. If the windage and elevation adjustments run out, simply reverse and re-fit your mounts and the problem generally goes away.

It seems like the toolings were obtained under license of some sort by POF.\nAs for the barrel. This is not a Darra made weapon. The barrel would meet and exceed army and international standards.

I picked up both of them in my hand and did not feel any difference in the weight, weight orientation, metalwork etc. I told him I''m new to guns and what would be his advice for me. He said ''bhai ji hamaray liay to jo bhi sale ho, munafa hi hai. ap nay mashwara manga hai to mera mashwara hai ap hamari factory ka mall bay fiker ho ker lay jao. aik sal ki warranty hai. kabhi koi masla karay to hum zimadar. a ker raddi main phenk jana or apnay pesay lay jana. agay bhai ji apki apni marzi hai''\r\n\r\nHe also made a long speech about how the imported guns required a lot of care, oiling and performed flawlessly only with certain type of ammo while (according to him) the one they made was a hardy breed and performed flawlessly with all ammo types and in the dusty conditions of our neighborhood. He restated the one year warranty thing again too.\r\n\r\nAs you might have guessed, I know nothing about guns (I shot 7 cartridges at sitting doves with number 8 cartridge, the other day and even a feather didn''t fall :( ).\r\n\r\nI can spend upto 60k for a quality handgun, but frankly, I''m not a person to care for a sleek handgun like my girl. I could disassemble and oil it once every decade, and that''s all about it.

Foreign guns of good maker are not ''softer''....rather are better in quality than local ones...\n\n2. Normally, majority of the foreign guns are very reliable and ammo friendly for all quality ammo...! However if you use sub standard or low quality ammo, then any gun of the world may cause problems...!\n\n3. Well, like all valubale items guns also need care but not daily or weekly... after 1st out of box cleaning,  one should clean the gun after every session/usage. . And then remains no need for cleaning till next session or usage. However, if gun is not used regulary, then seniors advise lubricating the gun every month or so.. even if its not used...!\nBut even if one delays cleaning and lubricating gun for some time, there will not be any immediate serious damage to the gun, but over the period it may tend to catch rust, or start miss fire/failure to feed etc...!\n\n4. Well metal can be damaged by rust or water, and its a univeral phenomenon. Guns can also suffer that problem, but there are good rust prevention liquids and cleaners/oils easily available in market, whih can minimize the problem. Also if you are so worried about rust etc... then go for a polymer hangun....there are some very good quality polyner handguns. Polymers are basically a tyoe of plastic, which mean no chance of rust.... on frame etc... but barrel and some other parts still needed to be taken care of and cleaned and oiled periodically. ..!\n\nIts my understanding, seniors may guide you well.', 1, 1, '182.185.216.223', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

No revolvers. All semi autos. (Though he said some of the locals could operate at full auto too, which was a new awakening for me). Didn''t ask if the locals were clones of overseas models or not. By their shape, I would think they were copies of some gun of the same shape (grooves in the body at several places, western design and sleek shapes, very much resembling the handguns you would expect to see in hollywood movies).\r\n\r\nThe guy claimed they were the originals.

Thankfully they published it...\n\n"Although the aims of CTAC are indeed commendable, I disagree with  them because hardly any crime is committed with registered, licensed  weapons. In fact, the criminal element which commits these crimes  possess weapons which are neither licensed nor registered. Placing a gun  ban will simply disarm law-abiding citizens and not the criminals; if  one is naive enough to think that such a ban will also disarm the  criminals, please keep in mind that drugs like heroine are also banned  and yet are easily accessible to the criminals. A criminal, by  definition, is somebody with zero respect for the law; what makes you  think that the same criminal will suddenly start obeying a law banning  guns?\n\nOn the other hand, our police is too politicized and/or incompetent  to be able to fully protect our citizens. Even if we lived in a society  when the police was free of corruption and undue political influence, it  is impossible for cops to simultaneously protect each & every  citizen at all times of the day. So, where does that leave law-abiding  citizens like you & I? Who will look out for me and my family’s  safety? Ultimately, that responsibility lies on my shoulders. By banning  guns, you are not only emboldening the criminals to prey upon helpless  law-abiding citizens with even greater ferocity, but are also stripping  away my ability to protect myself and my family in the face of a dire  threat.\n\n A gun ban will NOT disarm the criminals, and will instead turn  law-abiding citizens into even easier targets. Why don’t we, instead of  trying to ban guns in a short-sighted attempt to reduce crime, start  focusing on the REAL reasons why crime exists in the first place,  reasons like poverty, lack of educational and professional  opportunities, massive inflation, and an overall increasing difficulty  of ordinary citizens to live in prosperity?"[/QUOTE]\nGood write up bro .

As the groves are worn out it will gradually decrease in accuracy. I.e If she is giving U a 1 inch group of a 5 shot string at 25 yards. She may well give U a 2 inch group of a 5 shot string at 25 yards. But that''s about it. Looong before the barrel goes other small parts such as springs and pins may need replacement.  \n\nWhich is why "barrel life" is never a factor when I go and buy a gun. For me the things that matter are sights, which tend to lose their zero over time. slides not locking back magazines becoming lose. firing pins getting worn out, recoil springs losing their flexibility. Mags rattling.. extractors breaking. frames cracking. These are all problems I have seen.  Never seen a barrel crack after its life was over though.  Barrels do crack.

Isn''t it simple..?\n\nAlso, in my humble view (which you may differ from), barrel is the most important part of a gun, and if that is worn out/damaged, then the gun becomes useless... No matter what is the condition of other parts, like springs, firing pin etc.\n\nSo, I think barrel life should be given preference in considering a gun (if one is buying for longer period of time), because others parts like springs, firing pins etc can be arranged locally but [COLOR="#FF0000"]a barrel is almost impossible to replace[/COLOR] if damaged or worn out!

So basically, regardless of the law, now matter how badly it is interpreted, their directive under section 144 has to be taken in the right spirit (minus the entire letter) and consider it as a legal ban on carrying licensed weapons. It defies logic. In the days of the Raj, we were all treated as criminals and anti state, barring the few ghaddars and chamchas. That is why their laws and interpretations were as such. But even after independence, you are treated the same. In spite of the law and order situation, you are banned from carrying your licensed weapons. If you had freedom to defend yourself, criminals would not dare approach you with intent of crime. In my opinion, just a government directive allowing people to carry their licensed weapons for self defence will result in significant drop in crime rate. But then, it is just my opinion.

He must have been like really really happy since instead of his usual I-have-sold-noting-all-week he actually told us that business has been brisk. \nHe showed us a Turkish shotgun, very light with front optic sight and back rifle sights and a â&#8364;&#732;3â&#8364;&#8482; inch chamber. 7+1 asking 44k and was willing to give it away for 41k.

Pakistani gunsmiths do put TT on their Tok clones though. \n\nThe Zastava company makes a tok clone called M57 not M57TT.

Again, the finishing on the weapon available here is not as good as the weapons pics that I have seen online. \n\nWhen I told Daniyal what I think He yelped that he has gotten them from Tahir & brothers one of the biggest whole sellers around.

Isn''t it simple..?\n\nAlso, in my humble view (which you may differ from), barrel is the most important part of a gun, and if that is worn out/damaged, then the gun becomes useless... No matter what is the condition of other parts, like springs, firing pin etc.\n\nSo, I think barrel life should be given preference in considering a gun (if one is buying for longer period of time), because others parts like springs, firing pins etc can be arranged locally but [COLOR="#FF0000"]a barrel is almost impossible to replace[/COLOR] if damaged or worn out! (except with clone barrels).\n\nRegards brother[/QUOTE]\n\n\nNo sir, I am just a learner. Thats all. Lots of info but not enough shooting experience.  10,000x 36= 360,000 \n\nMost people simply wont shoot 3.6lac worth of ammo in a single weapon. Similarly, I seriously doubt any one will put 1.8 million rupees worth of ammo though his gun. (50kx36)\n\nAgain if I have that kind of money I would buy umm lots and lots of PB  goodies. \n\nThe only weapon I know that had gone though thousands and thousands of rounds was the range gun at the ASCC Gun club. It was rented at Rs 500 per session. \n\nIt was a CZ 999 Scorpion. While the barrel life ensured that it was accurate. It had long sense lost its mechanical reliability and had to be manually charged for every round. \n\nU see 1st stranger, the barrel life is a very clever gimmick used by gun companies to sell their wares. They know that almost no1 will go though the barrel life so they argue about that one thing as a criterion for durability. Not a word in promotional literature about firing pins, springs and such like. \n\nThe Chinese simply give a few extra springs and stuff that they know will break in the long run as part of the package.

Review and Zeroing Report', 1395204740, 'I always wished to have a bolt action hunting rifle chambered in  308/7.62x51 being a round of my choice as this round possess better  ballistics qualities. But the prices of bolt action rifles chambered  in  7.62x51/308 are  insanely high in this part of world.  Some friends  came up with the suggestion of re-barreling a rifle in to 308. The idea  seemed workable  but since a 308 round generates an enormous chamber  pressure thus it was a genuine matter of concern to select a rifle and  design to withstand the gigantic pressure of 308 round . Finally , with  the help and advice of a very knowledgeable friend , located overseas ,  having a practical experience of gunsmithing , the design of mauser 98  and caliber of 7x57 was chosen. \n\nI had 2 rifles in 7x57 , a parker hale and a BRNO ZKK600, I  always love  BRNOs and  selected the BRNO for rebarreling, though my friend opined  that the bolt of a Parker Hale is nearer to the original mauser 98 bolt  design. The integrated dovetail to mount scope was another plus in  BRNO  so I proceeded with it. My friend also gave a nod and told me that the  action of ZKK 600 was the standard action that BRNO used in many  calibers including 30-06.\n\n[COLOR=#000080][B]THE BARREL[/B][/COLOR]\n\nThe barrel of 308/7.62x51 was hardest thing  to come by. Another friend  told me availability of machine gun barrels, coming from Afghanistan  (presumably supplied by NATO to Afghan Government Army who sale them  subsequently) in the area bordering with Afghanistan. The area was  extremely volatile and unstable, yet my craze for the gun drove me  there. I remained there for several days and heard something horrible  every day. Once a friend came to see me and on his return , his car was snatched just minutes after he left the place i was staying. Those circumstances were horrifying  but finally I got the job done and the task of re-barreling  was accomplished.

The mobile coverage is the recent blessing of modern times but they are charged on batteries and money is charged on mobile charging. the village I went to zero the gun is situated at a buffer zone between civilization and stone age style of life  as the dirt tracks end here and rough mountain tracks lead to rest of human dwellings situated  deep down in the mountains . The distance is measured in nights on camel back. I had visited the caves those contain very old pictures made by their pre-historic residents. These caves of Stone Age human dwellings are located at the distance of two nights on camel back.  \nThe modern life articles ( which are no more modern for all of any more) are a scare commodity here . Such scarcity so intense that there was not a proper table to be used as a rest. but I am  used  to it now and have adapted to use our cradle to grave companion, “the Cot” as a rest. This cot is very multi-dimensional tool. It is used as Chair,   as a sofa, as a resting chair, as a table , as a dining table  ,as a bed , as a hospital sick bed and yes, as a rest to zero a gun too.

Not only this but  the event is talked about for days , weeks and months. If something extra-ordinary happens, it survives through  the generation as an anecdote  and every narrator adds the spices of his choice .  so one has to be very careful in doing anything in any such like event if he does not want to be funny character of local folk lore :o . \nI was well aware of the tradition and did not get bothered when a mob of all aged\nvillagers gathered around me when I started the process of zeroing my gun.\n\n[IMG]http://i1270.photobucket.com/albums/jj613/zainulabdeen/z5.jpg[/IMG]\n[IMG]http://i1270.photobucket.com/albums/jj613/zainulabdeen/z6.jpg[/IMG]\n\nIt is obvious that when I cannot get a table and chair to be used as a rest so there is no question of availability of paper targets and stands to hold them.

It turned in to dust. second stone was put and was hit it as well. Then I put 5 stones and loaded 5 bullets in a row and started to hit one by one. 4were hit out of 5and missed only one. There were some stones which puffed away like s smoke or powder but there were some stone stubborn enough just to bounce away having a scar of P.O.I only.\n\n Here is one.  \n[IMG]http://i1270.photobucket.com/albums/jj613/zainulabdeen/z41.jpg[/IMG]\n\nThe stone puffed away by bullet impacts.

So I took the rifle , loaded a 7.62x51 round in it , put the gun on the roof of my vehicle and aimed . At the very same moment, the bird I was aiming at, started to feed. It was moving randomly and was very hard to shoot . I kept waiting in that posture for nearly 6 to 8 minutes and finally the bird started to move in straight line of my fire . I aimed at his “dead centre chest “and fired. I saw , in scope the bird blowing up with the power of bullet and turned to its side.

These birds were sitting quietly. I again aimed at one and fired. This time the bullet just zipped through it. Perhaps the difference between the result of two shots is caused by movement and stationary states of birds .These two shots made me to feel intoxicated for several days .   \nWhile at the village I saw a sig Saur    bolt action 308 rifle which one of the resident of village had one in a long range shooting competition few days ago.

But the Detroit engineer now believes he has created a device that would have saved him and may save thousands of others.\r\n\r\nHe calls it "Identilock," and while it still needs final adjustments to the prototype and further investment, Kiyani expects to launch his smart gun technology in U.S. stores within a year, retailing for around $300.\r\n\r\nThe device attaches to the trigger of a handgun, which can then only be unlocked by biometric authentication, preventing any unauthorized user from firing the weapon. Drawing on breakthroughs in mobile technology, the trigger is released by similar fingerprint sensors to those used in Apple''s iPhone 5S. Those sensors are approved by the FBI, and widely found in security scanners.\r\n\r\n"The key is reliability," says Kiyani. "The sensor has proved itself in different sectors over the past few years and the market is aware of its capability."\r\n\r\nThe gun is enabled in under a second from first contact, and engineers are chipping away to further reduce the time. Eventually, it is hoped the lock will be integrated and the release will be instant.\r\n\r\n"The main point of firearms ownership is home defense, and home defense means quick access," says Kiyani. "But the other side of that is accidents."\r\nhe inventor believes his experience indicates an urgent and avoidable crisis and the statistics support him. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, in 2010, 62 children aged one to 14 were killed in firearm accidents in the United States, and 785 from 1999 to 2010 -- far higher death tolls than school shootings over the same period.\r\n\r\nKiyani is not interested in politics and keeps his vision simple. "I''m a gun victim, a gun owner, and I have children. I came up with something that fits my needs.\r\n\r\n"I was working as a safety engineer for airbag calibration, and it didn''t make sense that there was something so simple that had such an impact on safety, but not for guns. In essence, this is a product of that question."\r\n\r\nSurge of innovation\r\n\r\nEven if all goes to plan, Kiyani''s will not be the first smart gun system to hit the U.S. market. In February, German firm Armatix launched its iP1 pistol that uses a radio frequency identification (RFID) chip activated by the owner''s watch, and the competition is growing.\r\n\r\nDirectives from the White House to promote development of safety technology in the wake of school shootings have led to a surge of innovation. There is now an increased appetite and funding for a field that had stalled since the earlier designs in the 1970s. The boldest statement is an open challenge from The Smart Tech Foundation. It was created by Silicon Valley angel investor Ron Conway and serial entrepreneur Jim Pitkow in response to the Sandy Hook shootings and is making $1 million in prizes available for development of the best ideas.\r\nThe Foundation claims to have received over 200 entrants after the first month of the submission period, everything from concept stage to working prototype. Designs include electronic ammunition, remote controls and RFID chips buried in the owner''s skin.\r\n\r\nResearchers at the New Jersey Institute of Technology (NJIT) have been developing biometric designs since 1999. The leader of that program, Donald Sebastian, has seen many false dawns but is more confident than ever.\r\n\r\n"The difference now to a decade ago is that there are more types of technology and they are all much better. Biometric technology failed one time out of four then, now we aim for one in 10,000 failure rates", says Sebastian. "The reliability of the safety needs to exceed that of the underlying firing mechanism, so there is never a discussion that the gun wouldn''t work because of the technology."\r\n\r\n''Production ready''\r\n\r\nSebastian''s view is borne out by 2013 research into gun safety technology from the National Institute of Justice (NIJ). The report tested reliability in a range of RFID and biometric designs against existing firearms, and gave several ratings of "Advanced Prototype or Production-Ready." "It is only recently that viable product designs have reached a commercializable or production-ready level of maturity," the report stated.\r\n\r\nNJIT remains at the vanguard, working with "Dynamic Grip Recognition," perhaps the most ambitious system in development. The design uses a battery of sensors to build a "movie" of the user, learning the size and weight of their grip, and even their tics and manner with the gun to be sure of authorizing the correct user.\r\n\r\nwant to read the rest then click on this link [url]http://edition.cnn.com/2014/03/26/tech/innovation/smart-guns-know-whos-firing/index.html?hpt=hp_c5[/url]', 1, 0, '39.34.137.185', 0, 1, 5, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

Biometric authentication and finger prints recognition devices installed on a handgun? Well I don''t know if this is the best measure to avoid accidents or worse. I am not willing to jump into some debate here, just giving my 2-bit opinion.\n\nNormal safety precautions is the way to go for gun owners. You can always keep guns away from kids "that''s why we have locked drawers and cabinets" and certain available gun locks. You can also have a word with the family on "why they cannot access these firearms". \n\nA safety device installed is not going to help you avoid accidents, if you are one of those gentlemen who some how mange to shoot themselves or somebody else while cleaning the firearm or something. This is not going to help.\n\nOne million is nothing, even a billion dollar idea will not prevent a massacre if the "person involved" is willing to do it at the cost of his/her life. I fail to see any connection or approach that may help in this regard. \n\nYou cannot control the flow of guns (legal/illegal) neither in USA nor in Pakistan. There will always be criminals who would die to kill others and Innocent gun handlers who will shoot themselves or others unwillingly. No body can make certain and actual hold on above two situations.\n\nWhat you actually need is responsible and sensible gun owner who understands and believes "Normal Safety Precautions" while handling a firearms. Now that gun owner is what society needs because he/she will not only be able to protect their family but others too. He/she will also teach their kids about "handling firearms the right way". \n\nCould such safety measures work? Yes why not, but would this make a significant change? Hell No. This sounds pathetic already "Smart Guns", No guns are smart, only "People" are who operate them in responsible manners.

(432529, 12903, 432512, 'Sand', 15746, '', 1396340077, 'Yes Matapapa bro, you are right.\n\nRefilling of the casings might not be a very dangerous process, but you must remember that you need fine grained gunpowder for your refilling with the proper percentages of CSK (carbon, sulphur, potassium nitrate) as the ones used by the manufacturer of the bullets. And as I stated earlier, you cannot legally buy gunpowder from the market.\n\nFor preparing fine quality gunpowder at home, you would require impurity-free sulphur and saltpeter/pot nit. Carbon you can collect easily with burning wood into charcoal. But this isn''t all. You will also need to crush them (all three ingredients) very finely into powder. Ask me, I have done. And I tell you that and it is NOT easy. Not that it is dangerous (if you grind them all separately and slowly, there is no risk), but it takes a LONG time and a LOT OF POWER for grinding potassium nitrate (aka saltpeter) into powder form. Then you have to mix them thoroughly. Now this IS a dangerous process. If you mix them roughly while they are all dry, you risk a very bad explosion (or the mixture would just combust and burn away, wasting all your effort). You better dampen them all before mixing (the factories also dampen them before mixing together). After thoroughly mixing them together (for which you would require electric shakers), you would have to compress it. And I don''t mean compress it with your hand or with a brick. You would REALLY need to compress it using hydraulic presses. After that, you would get a sort of paste (called gunpowder cake). Dry it up and break it into fine pieces. And in case you have to prepare guncotton, you better be ready for some graduated/labelled beakers, concentrated nitric acid and some other stuff. Warning: nitric acid isn''t only dangerous when it touches your skin, its fumes/vapours are also deadly and corrode the lung tissues much faster than cigarettes/smoke. I won''t go into details of preparing guncotton here.\n\nNow comes the filling part. Now I am no expert (not even a regular user) of guns or ammo, but I think you will have quite a few things to fix up, here too. First, a spent bullet casing would have a firing pin mark on its base (where the firing pin hits the bullet). This part will be slightly pushed inside, depending on the strength of the firing pin spring. This means that (at least theoretically) a refilled bullet will require a stronger hit from the firing pin than a new bullet. I am not sure about this as I have never done it, but experts can tell you if it''s true.\n\nThe next part is the bullet head. Where do you expect to find the bullet head? You can''t actually shoot your rifle, then travel 2 miles and search for the bullet head. Plus, even if you find it, it will be deformed and not fit for use. You will need a *new* bullet head each time unless you have a metalwork workshop at home to modify it.\n\nThen how are you going to seal the bullet? Factory bullets are sealed properly to prevent the contents from leaking or rolling about inside. How are you going to seal a gunpowder filled case at home? You cannot expect to do it with a hammer and a prayer.\n\nAnd in the end, if you read the info on the internet, you will learn that the refilled bullets have different and unexpected rage and their accuracy is a big question mark.\n\nAll in all, you will not only require a supply of proper propellent, but also the necessary tools for the process. I agree that in the west (specially America) shooters do that commonly. That''s because you can get almost anything freely and openly in America. And then again, the people refill their bullet casings do it with all the proper tools for the process. You cannot expect to find all that stuff around here, bro.', 1, 0, '119.63.143.28', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

But that would mean my previous example of simply scaling up the bullet would be correct as the ratio of the gunpowder/mass is the same for the different sizes and they travel the same distance.\n\nSo my answer is , the one that i passed over before without thinking about it....just that more gunpowder is added. \nwhat do you guys think of ^', 1, 0, '182.189.57.220', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

Difference of opinion brings lot of realities with hard facts to those who discuss and to those who listen/watch; and in the process enlightens both. So if you withhold your opinion, that is what you need to do; and if I stand by my contrary opinion - this is what I need to do. \n\nIf my driver is not DUMB which I know he is not; If I need to carry weapon ALL the times where I live (security is real issue); for SD and I have to travel carrying my weapon; I cannot leave that back home; I need to respect to avoid taking my weapon into an office where it is not allowed - what choice do I have (I request you not to suggest me otherwise) and I will get hold of bio-metric device and use it - this my choice and I am happy with it and I feel this tool is a great tool!!! (may be if I use it it it is otherwise). Now if some one disagrees - I have NO problem :) Lets all of us share our views :)\n\nGod Bless you!\n\nRegards', 1, 0, '182.181.221.71', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

But I have had many adventures with gunpowder and explosives in general, so I can advise you on this.\n\nBro, the first rule of working with gunpowder (or guncotton, if they employ that for bullets, as its iv is much greater than gunpowder) is to actually NOT work with them unless it''s necessary and there is no choice, or you don''t have enough brains. In my case it was the second.\n\nSecond rule about filling spent casings is to never (as in NEVER) use anything except for factory prepared, graded explosives with proper indication of sulphur, carbon and saltpeter percentages (or in the case of guncotton, the percentage of nitro cellulose in the product). Never (as in NEVER EVER) try using improvised explosives.\n\nSadly you won''t get factory prepared, graded explosives/propellents in pakistan (unless someone in your friends is a taliban. but in that case you would have no need for refilling spent casings as you''d have boxes full of ammo in your home).\n\nFor preparing fine grained, uniformly burning gunpowder in your home, you will need:\nproper lab equipment.\na professional chemist.\na fast vehicle (if a hospital is nearby, all the better).\nloads of first aid and life saving meds.\na bigger load of your mom''s prayers.\n\nBut if you (like me and my friend yasir aka ''choochi'' for his skinny build) decide to be a senseless fool and go on about it with market-purchased chemicals and your grandma''s mortar, first make sure that:\n\nyou don''t care about losing your eye(s), limb(s) or your life.\nyou don''t have little kids.\nyou have written your will (there are a couple lawyers on board who can help you with that)\nyou don''t love your life, your parents, your wife/girl, your neighbor''s wife/daughter, your boss''s wife/daughter, your best friend''s younger sister, your kids, dog, horse, guns or country. if you love any of these, don''t do it.\nif you actually don''t love your life, your parents, your wife/girl, your neighbor''s wife/daughter, your boss''s wife/daughter, your best friend''s younger sister, your kids, dog, horse, guns and your country, then there are major chances that you are suicidal. in that case, search google for "painless suicide methods". dying in an explosive''s untimely explosion accident is neither easy nor beautiful.[/quote]', 1, 0, '182.185.157.176', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

If you start asking around it will only result in confusing you more and more and more.\n\nGuns (and particularly handguns) have a strange and very personal appeal about them, what might be awesome for one person might be trash for another. If i was to answer your query, I''d suggest you go for other options for half the price or completely different looking guns like the Steyr or S&W etc. \n\nI reiterate that since you have your heart set on it, then get it and use it safely; learn the proper handling, practice and care for it and you''ll never need another replacement for years to come.\n\nAs for the price, yes it is very normal for a gun worth 500-1000 dollars to be sold here for 3-4 times the price.\n\nExactly how much this particular gun SHOULD cost in our market, quite a few people will be able to help you out with that :)\n\ngood luck!', 1, 1, '116.0.62.161', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

Cool down, everyone.\nI also second Sand, that you cannot make a bomb with gunpowder.\nif you could make a bomb with gunpowder, we wouldent be using it in guns, as it would blow it all apart. It is classified as a "low explosive" as it deflagates or burns at subsonic speed, so a controlled ejection/displacement of the bullet can go on. if it was high then long barrels wouldent make sense as the gunpowder will go boom and stop pushing the bullet even when it is not out of the barrel.\n\nHe is talking about nothing more then a few stories of his life. \n\n@1stranger\nwhat he said is not non Islamic in any way at all. infact, i would go as far to call it Islamic as he is warning us all not to play with is so that our repos, ourselves and our families (which may be hurt directly/indirectly from gunpowder play) will not be harmed.Actually humor is one of the best ways to get humans to memorize something,ask any psychologist.If you read that piece that Sand wrote seriously, or you read it humorously the warning written in it is perfectly clear.    I understand this sounds .....offensive but i would advise you to go and read over the entire thread a few times, conduct a brief analysis of what he is saying, and come back and reply. Your opinion on what he said will probably do a 180 at that point.The reaction of armornear is what you should be experiencing.\n\n@Nisar\nYouve got the right idea. Sand, whatever your experiences may be, try to avoid sharing specific explosive info. \n\n@K203\nThis isent vulgar at all. Just a story of sands early days. if you dont like it dont read it.Its not like (i dident get the chance to read his story b/f it was removed) he is sharing specific info on how to make things go boom.\nthe simple black powder recipie is so old and weak its practically useless as a area of effect weapon. You could make something 10x powerful with a propane canister.\n\n Both ED and Leon are correct, everyone needs to take a step back and relax.\n\nAbout the stories..im always interested to hear them.\nif you could email me the story...as you promised Surg.Ray\nhere is my address. ( [EMAIL="ch2shahid@gmail.com"]ch2shahid@gmail.com[/EMAIL]) Be sure to leave out the formulas and stuff, but any mistakes in handling the material...emphasize them please. Even if i will be using Acetone peroxide as my homemade mortar propellant, i would like to...live to tell the tale.\n\n\nNow, back to reloading. the machinery one can improvise, lead bullets one can cast, but gunpowder is hard. would the pakgunners here agree that the effort is not worth the reward in pakistan?\n\nif this place turns into a house for argument, i will go and ask the mods to lock it. as long as no specific bomb making info is shared, all is well.', 1, 0, '39.34.128.55', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

No licence etc is a real added advantage as you''ve already stated.\n\nAs you said you are physically fit so a good pump will not be an issue in refilling. My Walther has 300+ bar cylinder so that can take a few goes (in order to not overheat the pump) to fill from 100bar to 300bar and the BSA Ultra MS takes one go to top up to 200bar. Walther gives around 80 shots from 300bar to 100bar, and BSA about 40 shots to next refill. That''s plenty to get me by at least. I don''t consider myself to be fit, per se, anymore but this is ok for me and not a back and deal breaker.\n\nI do however strongly recommend getting a factory spec regulated pcp or one that has been prepared/modified by an experienced pcp gunsmith. Hatsen seems good but fiddling with aftermarket regulators, disassembling a brand new rifle etc is why I didn''t opt for it. You may want to take it all apart and DIY and if you like that then well and good getting an unregulated pcp.

Yes, the heat actually diminishes here, in November. \n The start of summer indicates the commencement of construction season. The long yet hot days suit the builders as they get extra sun light to get their construction finished early. The working hours are terminated and a break of couple of hours is allowed to labor in peak hot hours in extremely hot months of May , June , July and August as it is simply beyond the human ability to work in such scorching heat. The reduced working hours also contribute to economic miseries of this region.\nThe construction season needs construction material and like most of things that is too, prepared manually, by using primitive methods. In our region, mostly the bricks are used as primary or basic unit in construction perhaps due to climatic reasons .The use of bricks could be traced back to the pre-historic metropolis of Moen Jo Daro , the capital of ancient Indus Civilization .

But he was just useless in this particular scenario. If you see the pictures which I have posted in the intial part of this thread it is very clear that stick was useless because snake was sitting in between and close to one partition of study/computer cupboard ( at the level where you place books / laptop etc. ). Making the free & desired swing of stick out of question.\n\nLater on we showed the scene to our gatekeeper and what he said was that I just did the right thing at right time because if I happened to give that snake a little bit of time it must have disppeared in big house making it almost impossible to trace it giving me sleepless nights.\n\nI am not making it up but I never panicked not only here but in many hard situations of life, instead my brain started working very fast to get the shotguns and finish him before he escapes. \n\nThe reason I had to use 4 shells, I am not trained well with shotguns though a member of LRC but shotguns are not allowed here. Very occasionally I do go to my friends farmhouse who is also an Oncologist and my colleague but you know TIME is becoming short and short I wish from time to time that this 24 hour day for others become a 40 hour luxury time for me and in extra 16 hours I just enjoy the life in my own way shooting, hunting, camping etc. & etc. Life has becaome so much mechanical nowadays.\n\nRegards', 1, 0, '182.189.230.27', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

And yes it would have very easily hidden in the packed rooms (store rooms tend to be their favourite abodes) and it would not only give sleepless nights but also some tragedy could occur too. Plus, even if the scoundrel was someday killed, your peace of mind would still not return (what if this killed snake was another one and the one that hid still lives? what if it was a female and has already laid eggs somewhere in the house? such thoughts are not only very haunting, they also have the potential to turn out true)\n\nPrevious year a snake crawled in the bedroom of my brother. It was fortunate for us all that the guard dog saw it and began acting abnormally. It took us 6 men''s effort to practically empty the room (putting the furniture out of the room, removing the bedbsheets, turning over the carpet and whatnot else) to finally locate it. And when we did, it was right under the feet of my bare feet bro. Thank God it was located and killed in time.\n\nSo yes, you made THE RIGHT choice eliminating it quickly. I was just thinking maybe you should have used a handgun for it. Using shotgun indoors is very dangerous as the pellets can rebound and hit you (= not good) and you also have a much much greater chance of inflicting property damage (which you so did :p).\n\nAnd then too, one #8cartridge should have put the tale to it''s end.

In his quest, I am sure he discussed several options with other members of the forum including myself and thus one fine morning we set off on a mission to look for handguns, particularly an SP-01. I wouldn&#8217;t bore you with the details of what happened during this venture, however on our way back he mentioned that he had had some discussions with Mr. Noor-ud-Din of DSA regarding carrying out some test on their new handgun, 9x19 Trushot. I pointed out to Dr. sb that we should check out this handgun and in my books, if it clears 300 rounds test, it&#8217;s good to go as a budget handgun for HD. The ammo suggested by me was Chinese (Red Box) for the reason that its inexpensive; trustworthy dealers have more probability of having the original Chinese and not the local reloads; they generate more residue and would be an excellent litmus test for any resultant FTF/FTE. The decision was made that Gilani sb would request the concerned at DSA to provide one of their handguns for our test and if cleared, Dr sb would go for it. Now I need to point it out here that we were not exactly planning to do a review of Trushot as such rather the intention was (and for me it still is) that we should check if Trushot can land as a budget gun for Dr Gilani with primary purpose of HD.\n \n[B][U]PG Member&#8217;s in Action:[/U][/B]\nThe day was not far, when Dr Gilani called me and stated that 300+ rounds have been procured and now the ball was in my court to reserve the range. I was utterly unsuccessful in this ONLY task assigned to me and could not do the same. Then came to our rescue Mr. Noor-ud-Din of DSA after Gilani sb presented him the possibility of carrying out this test at DSA&#8217;s facility and hurrah we were back in the game. \nColt1911, Ameer, Ka_Khan and Aquarius sir were informed at the eleventh hour, yes it was literally 11:00 pm, and to our dismay only brother Colt1911 could make it and the rest had to excuse themselves due to their other commitments; well next time, InshAllah. Interestingly, Nazim Sahib and Fraz had already scheduled their plan to come to Peshawar on the very day when we were testing Trushot. I informed them to come to DSA facility for testing the Trushot as it will be an excellent opportunity for them to Ganga-ay-ho-to-nahaty-hi-chalo. lol\n\nSome pictures at the range:\n[URL="http://s1341.photobucket.com/user/Jibz77/media/IMG-20140406-WA0003_zps0b0d2ba5.jpg.html"][IMG]http://i1341.photobucket.com/albums/o744/Jibz77/IMG-20140406-WA0003_zps0b0d2ba5.jpg[/IMG][/URL]\n \n[URL="http://s1341.photobucket.com/user/Jibz77/media/IMG-20140406-WA0004_zpsfb2c8ff5.jpg.html"][IMG]http://i1341.photobucket.com/albums/o744/Jibz77/IMG-20140406-WA0004_zpsfb2c8ff5.jpg[/IMG][/URL]\n\n[URL="http://s1341.photobucket.com/user/Jibz77/media/DSC_0700_zps0ee60ca6.jpg.html"][IMG]http://i1341.photobucket.com/albums/o744/Jibz77/DSC_0700_zps0ee60ca6.jpg[/IMG][/URL]\n\n[URL="http://s1341.photobucket.com/user/Jibz77/media/IMG_0427_zps1a505af7.jpg.html"][IMG]http://i1341.photobucket.com/albums/o744/Jibz77/IMG_0427_zps1a505af7.jpg[/IMG][/URL]\n\n[URL="http://s1341.photobucket.com/user/Jibz77/media/IMG_0426_zpsedc678da.jpg.html"][IMG]http://i1341.photobucket.com/albums/o744/Jibz77/IMG_0426_zpsedc678da.jpg[/IMG][/URL]\n\n\n[B][U]Basic FTE and FTF Test:[/U][/B]\nAt 10:15am we were at DSA and almost a dozen of their support staff was already present at their testing range to extend all possible support to us, for which we are thoroughly grateful to them. Nazim Sb and Fraz joined us somewhere around 10:30am. \nI was the first one to go and in a jiffy 3 mags of 15 rounds each had been fired without a single hiccup; No FTF/FTE. We checked the temperature of the barrel with the laser fitted temperature gauge and it was 83F/ 28C. Within next minute or so I had fired another 3 mags making a total of 90 rounds and checked the temperature yet again using the same device; it was still at 83F/ 28C. \nAfter the first 90 rounds we had a small tea break and soon after that it was Dr sb&#8217;s turn to had his way with the Trushot (I hope this didn&#8217;t come out the way I didn&#8217;t intend it to.. hahhaha). Dr Gilani also shot 3 mags 15 rounds each. Temperature of the barrel was checked and it had soared up to 93F/ 33C. I need to mention it for the record that while firing the 3rd clip, the handgun didn&#8217;t fire its last (15[SUP]th[/SUP]) round. I guess that was because the magazine was not properly tapped while insertion and thus the round didn&#8217;t chamber. The clip was not properly seated in its place and the round didn&#8217;t feed in the chamber with the forward movement of the slide. After a solid tap on the magazine, the slide was racked by Dr sb and the game was on. The temperature of the barrel was checked and was found to be 105F/ 40C. The next two magazines went flawless and interestingly in the 6[SUP]th[/SUP] clip, the 13[SUP]th[/SUP] round didn&#8217;t feed for the same reasons mentioned above. (For every magazine fed firearm, it is a must that the clip is properly seated in its place and thus requires a firm tap for insertion). Each time Dr Gilani gave the magazine a firm tap, the round chambered without any issue. At this stage we had fired 180 rounds. Despite the fact that some of our readers must be thinking that the above mentioned case was of FT-Feed; we are of the opinion that it was a simple case of improper magazine insertion which happens to most of the firearms if the clip is not firmly tapped. Here, we want to emphasize on the fact that the issues faced with the chambering were isolated events faced by only one shooter at the range, and as the rest of the gang didn&#8217;t come across this problem, the issue has nothing to do with the handgun itself.\nFraz, Colt1911 and Nazim Sb were next in line and each one of them fired a total of 2 magazines of 15 rounds each. They all went flawless without any FTF and FTE. We had fired a total of 270 rounds in almost 1.5 hour or so (including tea break and our usual chit chat during several breaks). We were constantly checking the temperatures of the barrel and it was noticed that when we were nearing our 300 rounds mark, it had went up to 121F/49C with 131F/ 55C as its last noted temperature. Dr. Gilani sir fired another 2 mags, reaching the 300 round&#8217;s mark and the gun was still going good. \n\nThe 300 rounds videos are as under:\n\n[B]Fraz: Firing two magazines of 15 rounds each\n[/B][video]http://s1341.photobucket.com/user/Jibz77/media/Trushot 9x19/Fraz-Trushot-300RoundShots-2Mags_zps7aeed21d.mp4.html[/video]\n\n[B]Nazim Sahib: Firing two magazines of 15 rounds each\n[/B][video]http://s1341.photobucket.com/user/Jibz77/media/Trushot 9x19/NazimSb-Trushot-300RoundShots-2Mags_zps186bf653.mp4.html[/video]\n\n[B]Dr Gilani: Firing two magazines of 15 rounds each[/B]\n [video]http://s1341.photobucket.com/user/Jibz77/media/Trushot 9x19/DrGilani-Trushot-300RoundShots-2Mags_zpsc64efeb5.mp4.html[/video]\n\n[B][U]Accuracy Test:[/U][/B]\nIt was decided by the gang that we will test the accuracy of Trushot from 15 meters and then 25 meters but due to shortage of time, we could only test it at 15 meters. Anyways, the primary purpose of the handgun was intended as HD by Dr sb so 15 Meters was a sufficient enough distance for our test. Now, if you ask us for our honest opinion, it produced somewhat satisfactory results, considering all factors. i.e. The target was an A4 size page, we were shooting the handgun for the first time; using Chinese ammo which are not consistent wrt propellant gramage for accuracy testing; the front and rear sights were not fixed and were made of polymer type material and had probably not been zeroed by DSA the way other international manufacturers do; I guess the grouping was pretty good. \n\nThe following video links would give you gentlemen some idea:\n[B]Colt1911: Testing the accuracy of Trushot\n[/B][video]http://s1341.photobucket.com/user/Jibz77/media/Trushot 9x19/Colt1911-Trushot-AccuracyTest_zps95b0b2c7.mp4.html[/video][B]\n\nFraz: Testing the accuracy of Trushot\n[/B][video]http://s1341.photobucket.com/user/Jibz77/media/Trushot 9x19/Fraz-Trushot-AccuracyTest_zps046fb279.mp4.html[/video]\n\n[B]Dr Gilani: Testing the accuracy of Trushot\n[/B][video]http://s1341.photobucket.com/user/Jibz77/media/Trushot 9x19/DrGilani-Trushot-AccuracyTest_zps525c3d56.mp4.html[/video]\n\n[B]Nazim Sb: Testing the accuracy of Trushot\n[/B][video]http://s1341.photobucket.com/user/Jibz77/media/Trushot 9x19/NazimSb-Trushot-AccuracyTest_zps2566b9a5.mp4.html[/video]\n\n[B]Jibz: Testing the accuracy of Trushot\n[/B][video]http://s1341.photobucket.com/user/Jibz77/media/Trushot 9x19/Jibz-Trushot-AccuracyTest_zps26c60fb7.mp4.html[/video]\n \nYou can see that most of the groups generally landed on the 7oclock position. This may mean that a general shooter has a higher probability of landing his shots on a 7oclock position with the current sights of the Trushot.\n \n[B][U]Water Dunking Test[/U][/B]\nDespite lack of our comprehension, why a water dunking test is required for a handgun which Dr sb is considering for HD, Nazim sb was adamant that it is imperative that this test should be carried out. Falling prey to the fear of Nazim Sb&#8217;s gangster looks, each one of us humbly submitted ourselves to the test!!! Oops sorry, it was the handgun actually which underwent the test. \n\nThe result is well described in the following video. \n[video]http://s1341.photobucket.com/user/Jibz77/media/Trushot 9x19/WaterDunkingTest_zps33cc5782.mp4.html[/video]\n\n[B]Part-I:[/B] A 15 round magazine was loaded and with a chambered muzzle, Nazim sb went ahead and dipped the handgun in a water drum for a reasonable duration. He then straight away fired 15 rounds without any issue of FTE or FTF.\n[B]Part-II:[/B] Nazim sb loaded another magazine; chambered a round and re-did the dunking process. Now he had fired only 7 rounds when the pistol stopped making any more bangy sounds. lol\n[B]\nComments on Water Dunking Test[/B]\nYes. The firing pin broke from it&#8217;s rear-end where the hammer strikes. Now here started another debate among ourselves in which we were trying to comprehend the reasons behind breakage of the firing pin. Some of the members were of the opinion that it was the result of rapid temperature changes which resulted in accelerating the stress reversals; and after firing 15 rounds of the first clip for Water Dunking Test, the firing pin broke on the 7[SUP]th[/SUP] round of the second clip. Now my thoughts on the subject are that there is a very insignificant temperature change in the firing pin even if one fires 100 rounds constantly. With [B]insignificant[/B], I mean the type of change which would not subject itself to becoming brittle with temperature change. For becoming brittle, the difference in temperatures (highest and lowest) needs to be quite high. For example, a sudden decline in temperature from 80C to 20C would most probably result in any metal becoming brittle and consequently breaking after being hit with a hammer. However the significantly high temperatures of a hot barrel or slide cannot transmit to the firing pin at the same levels and thus the rise or drop in temperature of a firing pin does not make sense. \nReference to my discussions with Dr. Gilani, he was in agreement with my point of view to the extent that firing pin had exhausted/fatigued due to 400+ rounds but he was also of the opinion that dipping in water and overall changes in whole pistol temperature which was carrying/holding/encasing the firing pin went under accelerated wearing/fatigue/stress. He thinks that if the pistol was not dipped in water then the firing pin would have not at least failed during the 15+7 rounds of the Water Dunking Test and would have fired even more than 550+ rounds. We would highly appreciate the feedback and comments from other members of the forum. If I have to state a reason for the breakage of the firing pin, it is because it was time for it to break. Yes you heard me right; I think the life of the firing pin was 400 rounds and it did so when it reached its threshold. The Water Dunking Test has nothing to do with firing pin breaking. \n \n[B][U]What Worked Well:[/U][/B]\n1.    The gun has controlled recoil and can be easily governed by anyone who has occasional pistol shooting experience. \n2.    No FTF/FTE during the 300+ rounds which we fired. (To be exact we shot 357 rounds with it and we were told that DSA had already tested the same handgun with 48 rounds, making a grand total of 405 rounds).\n3.    It has a comfortable grip which suited all of the shooters present at the range. \n \n \n[B][U]What Didn&#8217;t Work Well:[/U][/B]\n1.    Trushot has a very long trigger rest and if a shooter is trying triple tap or more, it takes like ages for the trigger to reset. (We are sure this issue can be easily addressed by DSA).\n2.    As I was the first one in the gang to give it a go, I felt a very minute creep in the trigger during the second stage but after firing 300+ rounds, it completely vanished and at least I didn&#8217;t feel it at all during the accuracy test. \n3.    The front and rear sights need to be made out of metal as the ones on Trushot is polymer. \n4.    There is almost no space on the sides of the front sight tip once it is aligned with the rear sights. For shooters like me, who utilize this space to align the intended target, it is a big downer. \n5.    [I]In case if the shooter is Dr Gilani sir,[/I] it is a [U]must[/U] that the clip is firmly tapped for its proper seating. DSA is seriously considering entering these instructions in their user Manual of Trushot with special reference to Dr sb; joking. lol \n6.    There was also a particular incident where the slide went forward and chambered a round when Nazim Sb firmly tapped the magazine in its place. Here it important to specify that this didn&#8217;t happen every time, however, to explain the problem to the technical staff of DSA, Nazim sb tapped the clip several times and 4 or 5 times the slide didn&#8217;t go forward without even pressing the slide release. It is something which is not safe and shouldn&#8217;t be happening. DSA needs to look in to this shortcoming which could be due to a week spring of the slide catcher.', 1, 0, '182.181.208.164', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

Every successful product follows an evolutionary path and we promise that ours will too! \n\nHowever, your continued support and trust in us is of paramount importance. We take our customer satisfaction and product quality extremely seriously. Having mentioned this we would like to request PG members and theirs friends to bare in mind that the DSA Trushot is after all being marketed as a budget 9mm that will perform under the normal use environment. So please be fair in your judgements even if they are critical in nature. \n\nWe are also working on color options, accessory options, grips and personalization options like engraving etc. these options will add to the customization of the Trushot as per your needs for an added cost.\n\nwe will produce videos of the standard drop test and other tests over time.\n\nThe DSA warranty also stands by the DSA TRUSHOT with 18months of after sales service and part replacement in case of a manufacturing defect. Abusive usage is not covered under warranty however there is a lifetime part availability guarantee from DSA. Unfortunately the laws within Pakistan governing firearms do not allow for them to be transported freely, which makes it impossible for our dealers to handle warranties for our customers. Customers are responsible for delivering products under warranty directly to DSA. We cannot change this unless there is a change in government policy for the transport of firearms within Pakistan. \n\nWe see this as the biggest advantage for owning a DSA firearm apart from its obvious price and performance benefit.\n\nGentlemen, once again thank you for your good efforts, we will remain in touch with you and other enthusiastic PG members. please do visit us at www,Facebook.com/daudsonspk and share your stories with your friends and families. \n\n\nSincerely,\n\nDSA', 1, 1, '182.181.146.16', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

I would like to point it out that during the tests we were informed that DSA is considering to produce two grades of this handgun. According to them, there will be a first grade Trushot and a not-so-first rather a second grade Trushot. In my opinion, this strategy can be disastrous for this new handgun to establish its footing in our market. How?? Well if the dealers are selling the second grade handguns by providing misinformation to its customers and saying that its first grade, a higher probability of any misfortune with respect to FTE/FTF or God forbid a kaboom will surely tarnish the image of this handgun for sure. We, as responsible gun enthusiasts, there and then suggested to DSA that no such two-grade production should be adopted for the above stated reason. \n\n[QUOTE=DAUDSONSARMOURY;433376]Dear Mr. jibz, Dr. Gilani sb, Mr. Nazim, mr.

Snakes can be identified by doing  some quick online research for photos, or calling your state extension  office. The main focus of this research should be to [B]obtain a basic understanding of the snake''s habits[/B] and *[B]determine whether it is venomous or not[/B]. If snakes are getting inside somehow, inspection should [B]also include a survey of the foundation[/B]  for gaps, cracks, unscreened crawlspace vents, too-wide clearance under  doors or improper sealing around plumbing and utility lines. \n\n[B][I]*Is it Poisonous?[/I] -  Non-poisonous snakes have round eye pupils, while poisonous snakes have  elliptical pupils with an additional pit or opening close to the  nostril.\n[/B][B]\n2) Habitat Modification. [/B]If  you are seeing snakes around your home or property on a regular basis,  it is because conditions are favorable. Any of the following  environmental modifications will aid in snake control by discouraging  them from making their home near yours.\n\n \n[LIST]\n[*]Eliminate tall stands of vegetation. \n[*]Remove piles of lumber, rocks, or other debris that may harbor smaller pests that snakes like to eat. \n[*]Cover up or fill entrances to rodent burrows that may attract snakes. \n[*]Control of rats, mice, and other rodents will result in greater snake control. \n[*]Snake proof fences constructed around a home or garden will keep  most snakes out. If made of fine mesh 24 to 46 inches high and buried  several inches in the ground. \n[/LIST]\n [B]\n3) Exclusion. [/B]When snakes are found inside the  home, there is usually a point of entry that has been overlooked. Snakes  are able to constrict themselves to pass through very small openings.  Search the foundation specifically for any gaps or crevices larger than ¼  inch and up to three feet in grade. Vents in crawlspaces should be  guarded by screens with at mesh no larger than ¼ inch.\n \n[B]4) Live-Trapping. [/B]Snakes that are loose in a  home are often hard to find. One thing that might help to ‘lure'' the  snake in is to place piles of damp towels covered with a dry towel at  different places along walls. The pile should be at least big enough  that a snake could crawl under it and hide itself. This is helpful  because of snakes'' preference for moisture. The piles can then be  checked several times a day. \n\n[B]5) Emergerncy Maneuvers. Sometimes the snake will be on a floor surface. If  so, the best thing to do is to place an object over it like a heavy  blanket. The snake should immediately calm down and will feel secure if  it can not see what is going on outside the blanket. Placing heavy  objects around the edge will prevent the snake from slipping out from  underneath it and going elsewhere. This will buy you some time to get  help.\n\n\n[/B]Or.....\n\nWe can just shoot anything that moves inside the house which could include shooting your toes off over what is probably a non poisonous snake.', 1, 0, '203.81.234.19', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

We have full faith in the DSA TRUSHOT and as promised, improvements will become visible on a continual basis. Every successful product follows an evolutionary path and we promise that ours will too! \n\nHowever, your continued support and trust in us is of paramount importance. We take our customer satisfaction and product quality extremely seriously. Having mentioned this we would like to request PG members and theirs friends to bare in mind that the DSA Trushot is after all being marketed as a budget 9mm that will perform under the normal use environment. So please be fair in your judgements even if they are critical in nature. \n\nWe are also working on color options, accessory options, grips and personalization options like engraving etc. these options will add to the customization of the Trushot as per your needs for an added cost.\n\nwe will produce videos of the standard drop test and other tests over time.\n\nThe DSA warranty also stands by the DSA TRUSHOT with 18months of after sales service and part replacement in case of a manufacturing defect. Abusive usage is not covered under warranty however there is a lifetime part availability guarantee from DSA. Unfortunately the laws within Pakistan governing firearms do not allow for them to be transported freely, which makes it impossible for our dealers to handle warranties for our customers. Customers are responsible for delivering products under warranty directly to DSA. We cannot change this unless there is a change in government policy for the transport of firearms within Pakistan. \n\nWe see this as the biggest advantage for owning a DSA firearm apart from its obvious price and performance benefit.\n\nGentlemen, once again thank you for your good efforts, we will remain in touch with you and other enthusiastic PG members. please do visit us at www,Facebook.com/daudsonspk and share your stories with your friends and families. \n\n\nSincerely,\n\nDSA[/QUOTE]\n\nThanks alot for the warm welcome at the DSA facility, most of the members on PG are very supportive for quality local guns and we understand that Daudsons has established a reputation after delivering durable weapons to the consumers. keep up the good work :) and keep the prices down, if u keep prices reasonably down (while maintaining quality) as compared to the imported guns u will find a lot of buyers.....

It would really help to know whether others can perform at par with our Trushot and if the expectations are reasonable or beyond what other weapons are capable of. \n\nAnother point which is very important and should be taken into consideration is that guns which qualify NATO standards for military applications require an extreme temperature shock test and then gun should fire after the exposure. Regardless of the temperature, the gun should fire, however, there is no mention of how many rounds should be fired. The gun might fire once or twice or 10 rounds and then something might break, but the test is passed and the weapon is qualified.

''1st and 2nd grades'' mean two different models and not inferior or superior grades of quality in the same model. We would like to further clarify the following:\n\n\n1. Having two grades does not mean that the 2nd grade will be something below existing standard/grade/model of the Trushot. \n\n2. Any additional grades to the existing gun will surpass/exceed the material spec. and manufacturing quality of the existing Trushot which already performs very well. You may think of terms like ''match grade'' etc. which are improvements to standard/base models and will have a higher price tag and will be sold as a separate model. Of course prices TBA later when such grades become available for the Trushot. \n\n3. We are not interested in increasing the existing price of the Trushot by much, so any improvements in this standard/base model Trushot will reflect of this policy. \n\n4. Another clarification on the term ''grade'' is that when this was discussed with PG members the intention was that different models(grades) of the Trushot would be introduced such that Grade A might have better accessories, grips, finishes, engravings etc. along with perhaps a possibility of a higher spec. barrel, quicker trigger and better finishes overall. \n\n\nWe hope this clarifies any doubts regarding the term ''Grade'' and it''s relevance to our products.\n\nThank you,\n\nsincerely\n\nDSA\n\n[QUOTE=Dr_Gilani;433478]I agree as well to have one GRADE - however options can be created for various feature to choose from, if needed.\n\nRegards[/QUOTE]', 1, 1, '182.185.54.174', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

(Though I were not there :p) This shows their confidence in their product and eagerness to establish it as an affordable solid pistol...!\n\nHowever, I think that there is need for improvement in True Shot (Just based this assumtion on the review of it here and on a video available on their FB page)... its not a criticism... respected DSA should not mind this... \nI think many of us want DSA and thier products to flourish including True Shot... and compete with international weapons...! And I seriously think that its achievable goal... but True Shot at the moment does appear lacking.. (pardon me if I am overstating)... as 300 or so rounds are nothing. A gun should atleast have a life of few thousand rounds... atleast...IMO... after all, buyer would be spending around 25 tlor 30 K or so for this gun... but then its DSA first step in the arena of 9mm so, I think with a continuous development and tests, true shot will become a solid, reliable and durable handgun. In Sha Allah.\n\nSo, no worries DSA, if you take a little time and make True Shot a solid and reliable gun...!\n\nI hope DSA won''t mind this...  Its just a humble opinion from a humble enthusiast... who wish and pray that you may become a renowned arms company of Pakistan in International gun market. Aameen.\n\nP.S. DSA, your customer support, and giving customers'' satisfaction a premier importance is appreciable. .. but does this only mean that we come their and enjoy your hospitality in shape of Charsi''s Karrahi or Kababs..? :)\nComon why are you not active and a little bit customer friendly over the internet brothers???

Sharing, reviewing here are ALL our personal LIMITED assessments (may be technically right or wrong) PG members assess that on their own.\n\n3. DSA did not asked to test, I wanted to go ahead to test and my other dearest members (JIBZ, COLT1911, FRAZ and NAZIM sahib) were kind enough to spend time with us, have great time and @JIBZ to be further kind to write review which I agreed to.\n\n4. 300 rounds (Rs 16k) for me might be a very big deal BUT not for DSA. Bro Colt1911 mentioned 100 rounds yes DSA did provided that BUT that is just small part. The arrangements for us to sit, tea, food, other arrangements which included presence of 10 or more DSA staff running around us to help us.  I do not know how many man hours of DSA invested in making sure that 5 PG members are very WELL taken care of on that day. I am sure diversion so many staff on that day would have costed them a huge delays in their regular production.  Trust me they are very busy people and doing many big projects. Spending so much time with us is great gesture from them.\n\nABOVE ALL the honor, respect that we got from DSA was like if we were VVIPs - [B]the respect and love that we had on that day from DSA cannot be PURCHASED!!!![/B] [I][U][B]It is priceless[/B][/U][/I].\n\n\n:) now lets please focus on technical details of TRUSHOT\n\nGod bless us all!\n\nRegards[/QUOTE]', 1, 1, '182.185.54.174', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

This is a NOBEL quality and rare. Please reconsider what you have said, this was a collaborative effort and Dr. Gilani''s testing of the Trushot and his extended invitation to other PG members was purely to turn this into a educative and meaningful event. Foremost consideration, and we welcome Dr. Sb to please comment if we are wrong, is that Dr. Gilani sb was most interested in testing the Trushot and the 300 rounds for his own satisfaction and curiosity. We believe it is a great act of kindness that he has shown towards fellow PG members allowing them to also be equally involved in his personal ambitions. \n\nWe as a company are and were always fully confident that the DSA Trushot will perform the 300+ round test easily. We have tested these ourselves before we went into full production about 1.5 years ago with two prototypes. One was tested with 270+ rounds and then stopped. The other went through 300+ rounds and was cleared good for production. Both these weapons were also put through several rounds on a bench and fired remotely before being handled by our technicians. We have never put forth a firearm to our prospective customer before having full confidence in its reliability and quality. Mishaps do happen. Whether with us or some big Brand company, that is inevitable, however the aim is always to minimize the risk and maximize safety. \n\nFor a member of the public or media it is very easy to make a statement or pass a comment, but the fact is that legal and ethical firearm manufacturers like ourselves put their blood and sweat into making their products safe and reliable. I should say the same applies to manufacturers of anything that people would depend on, like cars or planes or medicines etc. etc. So these comments cannot be taken lightly and we would request other members to show respect and sensitivity with regards to it. After all, we place our forefathers name on our products and it''s reputation is our own reputation which we have earned from years of hard work. \n\n[B]We value your feedback but doubts about our professionalism and ethics is taking it a bit too far.

It seems that the recoil & muzzle flip is a bit on the higher side.\n2. The empty brass was thrown unconsistently even at times the brass was thrown backwards over Gilani Bro''s head.\nAnyhow if DSA can workout on its trushot regarding its grips & sights as mentioned by Jibz bro, we will be having a very nice handgun in a very good price range.[/QUOTE]\nSir. Your presence was dearly missed by all and we are sure that if you had been there, along with Dr Gilani sir, your technical know-how would have been immensely supportive to us and definitely for DSA as well.  \nAs far as the muzzle flip is concerned, I found it quite manageable for quick recovery and a second shot. I cant say the same for the rest of the members present there. DSA can work on the spring tension and the muzzle flip can be controlled till great extent. \n \n[QUOTE=Fraz;433793]btw id like to add one thing here, the grips are slightly broad (thick) for a medium handed person to hold comfortably ...[/QUOTE]\nVery right, Fraz. \n\n[QUOTE=AK47;433818]Salams gunners!\nBeen away since a month nearly and found this thread on homecoming.\nKudus to Jibz and Dr. Gilani Sahib for giving a brilliant, all-covering 1.st hand insight into a since long expected launch of the Trushot. \nAs I had stated initially, a 300 rds test would suffice for a local handgun to unveil any flaws. The firing pin issue now compels a 500 rds test minimum, whenever issue corrected by Daudsons.\nWe hope Daudsons will comply efficiently with the shortcomings mentioned and we should have the patience to let them work on it.\nI trust they''ll deliver. Their customer back up is laudable, as reported here in this thread by our prominent members.\nI observed too that the recoil is somewhat on the higher side, probably due to the thicker grip circumference.\nMay I mention, SIG P226 grip circumference is ideal for almost any hand size and it suits my smaller hands even. I think grips could be flattened out a bit on this one.\nBest Luck to DS and all aspirants.\nRegards.[/QUOTE]\nMany Thanks AK47 sir. Your well wishes are truly motivating. I am not sure if Dr Sb will put his handgun to the same test; not because he doesnt trust this handgun but for the reason that he has his eyes set on few other acquisitions as well... Oops, Dr Gilani sir, I hope I haven''t said too much. lol. \nWe need another enthusiast or a group to carry out the 500 rounds test with a Trushot. What say you all!!!! :)  \n\n[QUOTE=Denovo87;433833]First of all my apologies for not being able to record my hazree ontime. \nWhat a meaningful thread posted after soooo long; each word n line of it shouting out loud the effort n dedication behind this test. Distance between Sialkot and Peshawar saved brothers Dr_Gilani & Jibz from the kisses my lips are holding for them ;)\nI am not interested in pros n cons of Trushot for the time being, its just the way our brothers tested a potential HD handgun and shared it with the community is all that matters. \nThanks and lots of love Dr_Gilani & Jibs bros your thread is a true benchmark for an HD/SD handgun testing & most importantly a true example of how a meaningful thread is made.

From my limited knowledge what the US authorities require is an import authorisation to import a particular firearm(s) from the government of the country that the firearm is being exported to. \n\nOnce this import permit has been shown the person or business that is importing the firearm needs to send a hand written posted or typed signed scanned and emailed purchase order, that mentions the firearm commodities that are required. \n\nAfter this is done, a form called the "DSP-83" form is filled and signed by the person who is importing and all these documents are sent to the US government, it roughly takes 2 to 8 weeks to obtain an import license in the US for the firearm to be exported. \n\n All this is done through an FFL dealer in the united states, normally they will fill out the forms themselves and will require all permits and purchase orders to be in english. All the person needs to do is sign the forms and send them back to the US dealer. \n\n This is the main procedure TO MY LIMITED KNOWLEDGE that is a legal and fool proof way to import a firearm from the US.

They can hardly ever decide. The decision making process starts from middle rank upwards. The lower ranked military personnel (all over the world, not just here in Pakistan) are taught and trained how to react.\n\nUnder any circumstances, you can easily predict their reaction, because all the reactions are inculcated in their training.\n\nBabaz7, yes they might treat some ethnic groups more harshly, but that is due to long term experience in the past. You aren''t a terrorist and you would always have dealt with the paramilitary with respect and common sense, but you know how some of the Baloch seniors dealt with the government and the military officials. I won''t post any names or start a political debate, I am just saying that sometimes the seniors do something and the common members of the society have to take the backlash. It''s not fair, but it happens.\n\nIn my experience, if you treat the military people politely and sensibly, they deal you likewise. Sometimes they even make little exceptions for you if you show that you aren''t some hot-headed son/nephew/brother/father of an MPA, beauraucrate, factory owner etc. Myself being a member of a feudal family, I have dealt with the local punjab police and the patrolling police several times. I didn''t even have the driving license or ownership papers for my vehicle and still they only confirmed my identity and let me go. It didn''t happen once or twice, but at least half a dozen times.

So I have now firmly decided that I will no longer be buying any products that have export bans imposed by another country to Pakistan. Weapon manufacturers included in this are Glock, H&K, SIG, Walther etc. These companies will simply refuse to even send spare parts, under warranty/officially, if something breaks. They are absolutely no authorised distributors in PK for these and if any distributor tells you otherwise he is BSing out of where the sun don''t shine.\n\nCZ, Sarsilmaz, Norinco, Taurus, Zigana, Canik55 etc are all good ...... any other export banned weapons from other countries, in my humble opinion, I would be ashamed to buy and fire one from now on. Ultimately the money we spend, a big chunk of the price we pay goes to these countries, so why should we buy their products when they don''t want to sell to us with a non-existent aftermarket service.\n\nThe above is no criticism to those who love these export banned weapons and love buy them. This is just my personal opinion. I have a Walther P22Q and I will be getting rid of it as soon as I get a less problem infested local clone made.[/QUOTE]\n\n+1\nExactly same thinking as that of mine. In my opinion if you have many millions in your account still it is never wise to purchase a 500$ Glock for 3000$ same go for the other guns who have got big names. But what difference it makes whether you shot a Sig, Glock or cheap but standard options like CZ , Taurus etc. avaiable over here with very little extra money to pay. After all you are firing a 9mm !!!\n\nI am sure many of you have seen youtube videos of Hickok45 & according to him a very costly and expensive gun either makes no difference at all or even if it makes it is not even in millimeters and maters only to a few names who are ranked very high in international competitions. Almost same is stated by Massad Ayuoob.\n\nEven in USA CZ 75B SS costs more than Glock 17/19. Google it and glocks are said by many as cheap plastic pistols and same are my personal views ( No offence of any sort intended just sharing my personal thoughts )\n\nInstead of paying 3 lacs for a 9mm why not someone get a decent battery of weapons and licenses or get a decent semi auto .223 ( once their prices no longer remain insane in near future or atleast I hope so )\n\nRegards', 1, 0, '182.189.18.227', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

Wish all of us had your strength.\nNow who said that the permits can''t be sold... the current going rate for permits is $50000/rs and yes that so called businessman (oops meant government servant... oops meant to say OverLord) will be present at time of clearing.  How else are all these Glocks arriving here lately?  I was personally at the airport to purchase such Glocks a few months back.  How else did most of the Sigs arrive here?\nAs for the DSP83 stuff - there is nothing in there to suggest a time limit or the right(s) of the importer.  Meaning I have seen the 8 weeks turn to a year - EASY and then get refused!  And you have to submit the entire amount for the order in advance.\nI remember I placed an order from Brownells for a bunch of 1911 accessories (no barrels, slides, or frames).  The total I paid was 1100usd and I waited for 9 months.  After approval I placed the SAME order again with Brownells and within three months it came back refused.  Why you ask?\nBecause your permit''s approvals are at the discretion of human beings... maybe the permit approving officer''s wife didn''t kiss him to work that day... maybe on the way he decided to hate us... or more B.S..  We don''t have any rights when applying for DSP83 - either it comes back as  a yes or most of the time its a NO.   Also most US sites have a bad image about us and hence refuse to sell to us where as they will sell internationally like Gelatini International...  I can''t remember the name of the website but they had clearly written something to the fact that '' We don''t send to specific (countries listed) or to those who consider us as enemies'' and it included our great nation''s name in the list as well![/QUOTE]\n\nMoeen bhai if i manage an import permit will u be able to guide me on how to import the weapon ?\n\nRegards', 1, 1, '39.47.237.165', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

Yes Toyota and Honda are in breach of their contracts as they should''ve been manufacturing by now instead of just assembling the cars. Nonetheless, the employees are our Pakistani brothers.\n\nAs for technology transfer, I agree there should be no borders but that is not going to happen. I worked in IBM and Cisco and I know for definite that IBM''s high-end servers and some of high-end Cisco products have export bans to Pakistan and many other countries that EU and USA do not approve of.\n\nAs for those who can afford, well each to their own and I have nothing against that. I''ll buy a Merc over a BMW in PK because I know I can get service and parts for Merc, even though I prefer to drive BMW because even cheaper 330ci BMW (or 530/535 for that matter) has a much better road grip and handling that of S Class Merc (I''ve owned both 530 and CL500 in past). But if I was to buy a BMW, and something goes wrong, money aside I''ll have a real headache trying to source parts and find a not so much of cowboy mechanic to fit it. So, here in PK, I''d rather buy a Honda for a daily car (I hate Corolla anyways - it is abs run of the mill junk, very high center of gravity, stuffy cabin space and nasty to drive, 2014 model is no different than current - just a facelift).\n\nAnyways, coming back to weapons .... the rudeness by Walther staff (when they found out I was from Pakistan) is something not to be let go so I gave them tough time/language in return. And I will be reporting Walther Germany to the German Customs for selling weapons to their distributor who is exporting to Pakistan - responsibility sits with Walther where their weapons are sold by their distributor. Walther also refused to state the name of the distributor they sold my serial number pistol to. Some of you may hate me for it, but if that''s the attitude of the company of their product users then I have no issues screwing them over. I have a very minor issue with the 3.4" barrel where extractor has chipped it slightly, so I''ve fix the extractor edge. This issue was spotted very early so and fix means that pistol will continue to function without any further damage/chipping to the chamber wall. But then I thought ''what the heck, let me get the barrel replaced by Walther anyways since this shouldn''t have happened'' ... by the way, this will happen and is happening to every new P22Q (even a friend''s who just bought his a few months ago) you will buy in the market, it is a design fault by Walther!! So buy P22Q at your own risk if you don''t intend to do any smithing on the extractor as it will kill the chamber without the extractor modification. And added to that are all the little modifications one needs to do to smoothen/polish sharp trigger bar edges that chip the slide, and extractor modification to stop the shells landing at the face.\n\nThis is what they said in the first email when I sent the picture to them ''I have shown your pictures to our technical department and was told that they will check to find out why your barrel is damaged. For sure you need a new extractor and barrel. It is possible to issue a letter saying that we are prepared to exchange the barrel free of charge under warranty but that we can not do this due to the German export law and the lack of the needed German export permit."\n\nLast Walther email after I threatened to post all their emails (quite a few exchanged) on international gun forums - note specifically in bold:\n"This pistol was sold overseas and not to a German dealer. No the letter will not be amended in the requested way as this is prohibited to do. Again we can not send the barrel to you and also we can not arrange any business between you and somebody in a foreign country. [B]It''s your part or the part of your dealer to be creative but never inform us about what you have done as than we have to stop this deal[/B]. I hope this time you understand our bad situation. Be sure we understand your situation and we want to help you but we have to stay within the law and this law also prohibit to tell you whom to contact to get your parts.

Only licence holder will be ''entertained'', strictly no agents/dealers/relatives etc (this is why many of us can''t get weapon change done).\n2. SO will see your genuine MOI Card and may have a question(s) and once satisfied, he will ask you to write a hand letter requesting the change of weapon for him to sign.\n3. Hand over the signed letter to his staff in the room across the hall along with the copy of your MOI Card and CNIC (take copies before reaching the office as only photocopiers are outside the main entrance and even those are a hit or a miss with machines working).\n4. In about an hour or less (depending on staff workload), staff will issue you the SO signed letter stating your licence number and old weapon number. Letter states your file number on top. It also states that you can sell your existing weapon to a registered weapon dealer and buy a new one of the same calibre, and to produce both the sale and purchase receipts to Ministry for further processing. CHECK, CHECK AGAIN, and CHECK YET AGAIN that all details on that letter are correct (licence number, weapon number, name, address, date etc) and that the file number on the letter matches the number written on your actual card file (filing system in that office is ''interesting'' to say the least).\n5. Sell your weapon, get a sale receipt, and buy a new weapon, get a purchase receipt. Make photocopies for your records.\n6. Produce both original receipts to the same office, along with the first letter issued.\n7. Ministry will issue a new letter, signed by the SO, to you the same day (within an hour or 2 max), to give to Nadra that will entail new weapon details etc. Check everything on that letter.\n8. Take the letter to Nadra along with MOI Card, pay the relevant fees and handover old licence, and retain the coupon. You will be informed of date to pick up the licence with new weapon number on it.\n\nGet there by 10am! Office is closed from 1pm to 2pm.

Maintained Lead:\r\n\r\nthis is rather difficult to master but is highly rewarding in skeet. you point the target with your eyes only, let your mind estimate the speed and flight path of the target. then you start your barrel ahead of the bird/clay with forward allowance and shoot.\r\n\r\nadvantage: way faster then previous method and the shooting becomes an instinctive affair as it is no more a deliberate exercise.\r\n\r\ndisadvantage: really steep learning curve. very difficult to master this technique and mostly when you miss, you have no idea what happened and how to correct it unless you have a buddy standing right behind your shoulder and tracking your gun''s movement.\r\n\r\nRegards.', 1, 1, '39.47.147.250', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

I was looking for a good scope such as Hawke/Leopold etc. but unfortunately none of the brands were available in rawalpindi/Islamabad so ended up buying cheap Crossman CenterPoint 4-16x40 AO mil-dot rectile.  I took good two to three weeks to get the scope mounted properly and zero the gun at 50 yards, reason for taking so long? I zeroed the scope optically and brought it to about half an inch to zero without changing windage/elevation settings.\n\nInitially the spread was not very consistent and was not really happy with the gun. However a very good friend of mine guided me to clean the grease from the barrel. Using fishing line I made a pull-through and cleaned the barrel with clean cotton cloth. Barrel cleaning really helped reduce the spread of the group the gun was making i.e. improved its consistency.\n\nI was using H&N FTT 14.xxGrn, H&N Baracude at 21.xxGrn and RWS Superdome at 14.xxGrn but on my last visit to Outdoor Adventures in Lahore I managed to buy JSB Exact Heavy 18.33 Grain pellets.   Diana P1000 just like any other PCP shines with JSB''s at 18 Grain. The spread at 50 yards suddenly became close to 1/2 inch, basically all the pellets would just make the initial hole bigger. By the way I am using Leopold RX600 range finder to set the target at exact yardage. \n\nHave been testing the gun at 40, 50, 60, 70, 80 and 90 yards and slowly fine tuning the windage. Today, me and my friends started off at 50yards and then decided to test the gun at 100 yards. Please note it was an open area with wind. First thought 100Yards is a long long long long....long distance for an Airgun. I mean it is really long! Any ways we set the target up at exact 100yards using the range finder. Used a bean-bag on the car roof as a support and fired a few shots. The drop was huge as expected more than 5mils at 16x zoom (I measured it later on and it was 14.5inch POI to be exact though chairgun software was predicting 12.5inch at rated 950FPS of P1000). This makes me wonder two things \n\n1- With 18 grain pellets the FPS of Diana P1000 should be dropping to something close to 900?\n2- Second how do people hit the target at close to 180 yards????  \n\nAny ways one of the group was really really tight! the remaining groups opened up a bit but I believe that was mostly because of the wind and I was keeping my crossair at the target. I also made all my friends sign on the target which I will most likely frame and put on one of the walls of my hobby room.\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]30110[/ATTACH][ATTACH=CONFIG]30109[/ATTACH]\n\nHere are pictures of group at 100Yards Group 1 was good but then wind picked up quite a lot but I kept firing at the target without any windage.\n\nHere is the facebook video link \n[URL="https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?v=498087676960051"]https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?v=498087676960051&l=1230412254518034409[/URL]', 1, 0, '101.50.80.237', 0, 1, 2, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

The thing is that none of his major artery/ organ was damaged by the bullets. The thing is that if we puncture flesh, there will be very little blood and it will be just oozing a little and not bleeding. Puncture an artery and things will be changed. So this could be the reason of little blood on the seats. \n\n* I read somewhere that according to the FBI stats, 75+% of gun shot victims survive (in US i.e. where mostly the ER is really prompt and quick). We have different situation here. Mostly the victims die here because of loss of blood since they can''t reach to hospital quickly. Moreover, the so called ambulances we have here (other than Aman''s) are not really ambulances, they r just carriers. Hence casualty rate is high here of the gun shot victims. HM was lucky that his driver was quick to take him to AKU. My guess is on Sat eve, it is possible to reach AKU in 10-15 mins from the mentioned location. \n* Regarding Malala, well u can compare here face before and after the incident. \n\nMy point is that I believe the above actually happened.

The original idea came about ten years back to Swiss armourer Vivian Mueller, who at the time experienced cutting and welding together multiple parts of the famous Sig P210: the result was a long slide, double barrel 9mm, highly decorated collector piece, which indeed shot very well. Our idea took the challenge further: to commemorate the legendary Colt 1911-A1 in the Centenary by making a true industrial market-ready double barrel .45 caliber pistol. We achieved success in the brief span of 6 months, after intense and round-the-clock 3D designing, stereolithographic modeling and parts machining. The gun can be handled by any shooter able to shoot with a .45 Acp and it is not only very pleasing, but very accurate and great fun. The AF2011-A1 holds amazing and surprising target performance for the shooter: in fact, it will group all the 8 double .45 caliber rounds (16 bullets) held in the duplex, single columns magazines, in a target of the size of an orange at 15 yards and of a water melon at 25. The stopping power of the AF2011-A1 is tremendous: 2 bullets for a total of 460 Grains weight impacting at 1 to 2 inches apart (depending on the distance of the target) will knock down a bull, while the whole 18 bullets, for a payload exceeding 4000 Grains, can be delivered to the target in about 3 seconds. The AF2011-A1 obviously features a number of very special parts, such as the single slide, the single frame, the single spur double hammer, the single grip safety, the single body double mainspring housing and the single double cavity magazine floor plate, the long and double magazine latch, the special barrel bushings and the hold open lever and side lever safety with long shafts: but the most interesting feature of the new pistol which we strived to keep during the development of the project, is the interchangeability of most internal parts, which come as standard 1911 replacement parts. These include the firing pins, the firing pins plates, the sears groups, the triple springs, the inner parts of the mainspring housings, the recoil springs and recoil springs rods, the magazine bodies and inner parts, the sights (including after market adjustable sights) the grips and grips screws and bushings.[/QUOTE]\n\nGreat guns for great hands...', 1, 0, '182.183.208.90', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

Meet SO Arms, Room 435, 4th Floor, S Block, Interior Ministry, Constitutional Avenue, Islamabad. Only licence holder will be ''entertained'', strictly no agents/dealers/relatives etc (this is why many of us can''t get weapon change done).\r\n2. SO will see your genuine MOI Card and may have a question(s) and once satisfied, he will ask you to write a hand letter requesting the change of weapon for him to sign.\r\n3. Hand over the signed letter to his staff in the room across the hall along with the copy of your MOI Card and CNIC (take copies before reaching the office as only photocopiers are outside the main entrance and even those are a hit or a miss with machines working).\r\n4. In about an hour or less (depending on staff workload), staff will issue you the SO signed letter stating your licence number and old weapon number. Letter states your file number on top. It also states that you can sell your existing weapon to a registered weapon dealer and buy a new one of the same calibre, and to produce both the sale and purchase receipts to Ministry for further processing. CHECK, CHECK AGAIN, and CHECK YET AGAIN that all details on that letter are correct (licence number, weapon number, name, address, date etc) and that the file number on the letter matches the number written on your actual card file (filing system in that office is ''interesting'' to say the least).\r\n5. Sell your weapon, get a sale receipt, and buy a new weapon, get a purchase receipt. Make photocopies for your records.\r\n6. Produce both original receipts to the same office, along with the first letter issued.\r\n7. Ministry will issue a new letter, signed by the SO, to you the same day (within an hour or 2 max), to give to Nadra that will entail new weapon details etc. Check everything on that letter.\r\n8. Take the letter to Nadra along with MOI Card, pay the relevant fees and handover old licence, and retain the coupon. You will be informed of date to pick up the licence with new weapon number on it.\r\n\r\nGet there by 10am! Office is closed from 1pm to 2pm. Earlier you get there, the quicker you will meet the SO and get the printed sale/purchase authorisation letter. Staff were very nice. Be polite and they will treat you well. SO does get called in for meetings so patience is a virtue. He is a good guy in my honest opinion, polished, polite, and soft spoken so you shouldn''t have any issues getting the authorisation.[/QUOTE]\r\n\r\nBore change are not', 1, 0, '182.181.162.244', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

Don''t have receipt but it shouldn''t be valued more that $25.00 so will see how it goes. Thanks again for a very helpful reply.[/QUOTE]\n\nOk so this is how things went through. Updating after reaching US.\n\nI called airline and they ran message thru all transit airports and reply came, no problems, disassemble it and put it in checked baggage. That is what I did.\n\nAs I entered karachi airport, I told first scanner that I have an old airgun in pieces in my suitcase. Response was normal and they wanted to look at it. Sp I opened the suitcase and 5 ASF inspectors all of different ranks looked at it, then I showed them my FFL 01, and they were fine.\n\nGot to airline counter and checkin staff who was nice but all kids, got excited since they never saw an airgun or gun per say in pieces. So there was another show n tell. They were fine too I signed disclaimers and luggage checked in in good atmosphere. I was told to shrink wrapped this suitcase. They entered in their computer that I am traveling with a weapon. Great!\n\nNow finally when I went to hand over luggage to last scanner and told the security guy that he will see an airgun in pieces which he did. Here a new saga started, he called another Mr. ASF who asked me to open baggage again. Removed shrink wrap and open the baggage again. By now people were gathering around and it was looking like crazy. \n\nHe looked at it and you can tell he has no f'' ing clue what he is looking at. He touched the air gun spring and said &#1576;&#1681;&#1740; &#1582;&#1591;&#1585;&#1606;&#1575;&#1705; &#1670;&#1740;&#1586; &#1729;&#1746; &#1575;&#1740;&#1585; &#1580;&#1729;&#1575;&#1586; &#1662;&#1585; &#1606;&#1729;&#1740; &#1580;&#1575; &#1587;&#1705;&#1578;&#1740; .\n\nI explained this is not a real bullet using gun it is just an air gun which is now in more than 25 pieces and in a suitcase which will be somewhere in the luggage hold.  Nope, decision was made. So I started to look for those who already allowed and airline who already checked my bags. But no one will look in my eyes and talk.\n\nI asked for a chief and someone who never looked like a chief (not enough phols on shoulder) showed up and told me they have received a new set of rules most recently which treat even disassembled airguns dangerous. Talk about making things up right on the spot. Obviously he did not have access to that order when I asked to look at it.\n\nThis seemed like same game PIA crew plays at after midnight flights when bosses are away. They tell you that CAA just added another tax of Rs 5000 per ticket and passengers have no choice but pay. We don''t fly PIA anymore.\n\nAnyways with a fear of missing flight and no common sense holder available at the airport, we called the person back who came to drop us and send the disassembled airgun back home.\n\nMy father gave this gun to me I wanted to pass this on to my son and grandson but I will not be able to do that for now. Thanks to untrained, illiterate officials with authority. Not giving up, and going to involve Pakistan''s high commission and ministry of foreign affairs if needed. Any clues will be highly appreciated.\n\nSo pakguners, here is a lesson learned, the hard way. I am a big game hunter and travelled with my guns and ammo all around the world, never had an issue. But my own countrymen treated me this way, I will never forget that.\n\nI am sure later that ASF guy sat in his canteen with his fellows and bragged about how he forced a Pakistani passenger to send a disassembled airgun home which was OK by airline staff, airplane captain, mid east air line base and of course landing airport in the USA. &#1576;&#1729;&#1578; &#1657;&#1608;&#1585; &#1729;&#1746; &#1605;&#1740;&#1585;&#1740; &#1575;&#1608;&#1585; &#1580;&#1608; &#1576;&#1726;&#1740; &#1605;&#1585;&#1590;&#1740;  &#1570;&#1746; &#1705;&#1585; &#1587;&#1705;&#1578;&#1575; &#1729;&#1608;&#1722; &#1748;\n\nOne last thing, airline staff apart from being nice but still empty headed and irresponsible also did not remove comment from computer that I am traveling with a weapon knowing that it has been removed from baggage. They witnessed whole thing going down.\n\nI was separated at mideast hub and questioned, made to wait to confirm that comment is not valid anymore. From country''s top leadership to very bottom, no one is using brain. Not sure why.\n\nThanks for reading and keep shooting.

Here is the kill (although it was very much alive and struggling to free itself) and the "bullet".\n\nSo ... the fellow had been buzzing around in my room for 3 days. As you can tell already, it was extremely threatening, not only annoying, as I stay in my room almost all day, trying to finish my writing work on the laptop. Anyhow, on the 3rd day I got fed up of this constant stinger literally hanging over my head and decided that enough was enough!\n\nMy trusty 4-feet blowpipe was handy. I counted the darts. I had 4 of them. Now, for a small target such as this (it was around 1.5 inches), you need to have more than 4 darts, but of course there was no time to relax and prepare extra darts first. I picked up the blowpipe (a 50 cal, 4 feet steel pipe, that is, with an improvised mouthpiece) and loaded the first dart. The scoundrel was buzzing at the ceiling then, nearly 20 feet from me.\n\nFirst dart goes swooshing past it, just missing it by 5 mm or so.\nSecond dart sweeps its wings and flies past, piercing in the cement of the ceiling. No harm done.\nThird dart just skims over it''s head and sticks it''s way into the ceiling. The scoundrel now gets alarmed. There is little time left!\nFourth dart. My hands were slightly shaking due to excitement. As you, fellow members already know, if it knew I was the cause of all this shooting, it could charge at me and plant a couple of stings in me which would have had extremely bad consequences for me. Anyhow I load the fourth dart ... put the mouthpiece to my lips ... I blow in hard ... and hit! I see the dart taking the target with it as it hits the ceiling, bounces off and falls on my computer table. Proudly and prudently, I go and pick up the dart, with the needle stuck halfway in it. It being an arthropod, I knew it had suffered no vital damage. If the needle was pulled out of it, it would immediately charge at me and sting me. I carefully take a couple of it''s snaps to share with you fellows here, and give the dart (with the scoundrel still pinned in) to a child to "neutralize it".\n\nSo, that''s the story of my glorious hunt, friends.

If that wasn''t enough motivation, K-203 presented the rosy prospective of winning a copper-skinned South American tribal princess with my humble skills. There is no excuse left for not posting the images anymore!\n\nHere we go ...! Notice that all pics were taken with m Qmob Z3, so don''t expect crystal clarity of a full fledge digi cam. I have severely zoomed out the images (upto 24% of original size) so they are acceptably clear and there is very little pixelation. But still ...\n\n[IMG]http://marked.hostei.com/images/intro.jpg[/IMG]\n\n1 => The pipe\n2 => The mouthpiece. This is the end where you are supposed to blow in. It is usually kept wider to allow for easy blowing and generating more pressure.\n3 => The damned evo USB. This idiot little thing acted up last night, or I would have posted the pics already.\n4 => If you are wondering, it''s my nokia phone. If you can judge the model number, it''s yours to have (NOT!)\n\nOK. Moving on. Now that you have seen the pipe, I think I should show you the mouthpiece in some detail. I used a plastic cold drink bottle cap (1 and 1.5 lits) for my mouthpiece. Basically you simply cut a clear, clean hole in the center of the cap. The hole should be the size that the pipe fits in with some friction and doesn''t easily slide. When you are done with it, you simply wind some adhesive tape at the end of the cap as an added safety against its sliding away.\n\n[img]http://marked.hostei.com/images/mouthpiece_closeup.jpg[/img]\n\nWhen holding the blowpipe, you wrap your strong hand (your trigger finger''s hand, that is) around the mouthpiece so that your lips don''t touch the mouthpiece and are connected only with your own hand. This comes convenient as one blowpipe might be used by multiple people and you never know how many spiders, wasps and God-knows-what creatures crawl over and sleep cozily in your (or you could say your blowpipe''s) mouthpiece.\n\nWith your other hand, it depends on where you hold the pipe. The practical blowgunners of South America hold the pipe right near the mouthpiece but I just can''t shoot accurately like that. I hold it farther from the mouthpiece. Nearly at the center of the pipe.\n\n[img]http://marked.hostei.com/images/holding_mouthpiece.jpg[/img]\n\nFor making the dart, you cut out a 1.5x2.5 inches of a plastic film. Then you roll it into a cone like this one. After you are done rolling it, you drop two drops of elfi or any other superglue to seal it in it''s shape. One drop goes at the tight end and the other drop goes between two outer layers of the open/wide end. After you are done, you place the cone in your blowpipe. If it is too wide, you mark the point where it gets too wide for the pipe, and cut it with a scissors. You keep doing it until the cone fits snugly in the pipe. It shouldn''t be too tight and neither should fall off when you point the pipe to the floor.\n\n[img]http://marked.hostei.com/images/dart_cone.jpg[/img]\n\nAfter the cone is made, it depends on you which type of dart you want to turn it to. You have 3 options:\n1- needle dart (posted here) is the easiest to make and has maximum accuracy and range. However it is very light and despite it''s unbelievable penetration, does little against larger targets (snakes, squirrels, doves etc). This should be your choice as a beginner and if you want to shoot for fun. These ones never disappoint you. Just take a needle (the one which is nearly 2.5 inches) and insert it tip-first into the cone. When the tip emerges from the tight end, pull it through all the way so that only the base of the needle is left inside the cone. Then seal it there with the handy superglue.\n\n2- broadhead dart. These are quite some headache to make unless you have a couple of hardware machines for flattening and sharpening. These are heavier than the needle darts and end up in a shape of spear head. These do very very nasty damage (even to a HUGE target such as a human or a deer) although can''t bring them down, obviously. These have lesser range (almost 2/3 of needle) and slightly lesser accuracy. You use them for taking down mice, snakes, crows, doves, squirrels etc. I will post some pics of them when I make them again.\n\n3- stun darts. These don''t have anything sharp and basically end up in a small steel ball. Put simply, these are used as slow-speed bullets. The steel ball is at the tight end of the cone and it is this which hits the target. Some people say these have unbelievable accuracy, but I have never made any of them, to know for sure. I am a fan of the needle tips.\n\n[img]http://marked.hostei.com/images/dart_complete.jpg[/img]\n\nAnd now that you are already watching some photos, why not show you something more warm and beautiful than darts and blowpipes?

Even if you try, you can''t make any mistake. (What mistake can you make in buying a 0.5" pipe of your desired length, anyway?)\n\n* Preparing a good suitable mouthpiece is a major headache. With 3 years of blowing, it still gives me headaches. There is little chance that the hole you punch/cut in the plastic cap would be in the CENTER of the damn thing. Mostly the hole gets on one side and it looks very funny, not to mention extremely hard to aim with.\n\n* Making dart cones comes with practice. Your first few will be very bad, but after you have wasted some 2 pots of superglue and 1 hour of effort, you will find the method which suits you. There isn''t one hard and fast rule about the size, the material and the weight of the cone. With practice, you will form your own method. There is no exception about the shape, though.\n\n* Even a badly formed needle dart amazes the beginners with its range and speed. While you won''t be able to shoot accurately with a bad dart, you would easily be able to blow it to distances of 60-70 feet. A properly formed needle dart, blown at 45° upwards (max projectile range angle) can be shot upto distances of 150 feet with a 4 ft pipe. With a 6 ft pipe (the standard for hunting), you can shoot it upto 200 ft if you learn how to quickly blow in with pressure.\n\n* The penetration power of the needle darts is shocking. At 40 feet, if you blow a dart at a tree, it would be impossible to pull it out with bare hands. I use a pliers (plass) to pull out darts from trees and other wooden objects. If you shoot at a biological object at 30 feet, with a 4 ft pipe, expect a penetration of half inch. If you shoot the same target at the same range with a 6 ft pipe, the penetration of a needle dart would be 1 inch.\n\n* When pulling out darts, always hold them from the needle, not the cone. If you hold it from the cone, the cone will tear apart and the needle will stay in the target.\n\n* I once shot an extremely annoying kid with a needle dart, in the leg, from 20 ft. I used only 1/4 of my lungs force and ... well ... he didn''t pester me for the next 6 months. The wound was hardly visible, but he limped for 2 weeks. You know what''s the moral of the story? It''s this: darts can never kill a person, but they definitely make his life extremely painful. NEVER shoot at ANY living thing which you don''t want to kill.\n\n* Shooting birds with darts is far far more fun than shooting with an airgun. With an airgun it is just looking through the scope and pressing a lever/trigger. With the blowpipe, you know it''s YOU who is shooting, not some mechanical device. It is nearly the same feeling as that of shooting with a slingshot (ghulail). Only the darts take more time and energy to prepare and you can''t afford to waste them.\n\n* Every properly formed dart takes around 6 minutes to make (after practice) and doesn''t cost more than 3 rs under any conditions. With one superglue bottle (15 rs), you can make about 30 darts. One thick needle (khandooi) costs around 1.5 rs where I live, but city guys should be able to get them at 1 rs.\n\n* Darts can be used over and again. The needle never fails to perform. When a dart gets useless, it only means that you need to pull out the needle and use it with a new cone. So the life of a dart is actually the life of it''s cone. My darts usually serve me 30-40 shots, but I pull them through to 60, although with a malfunctioning cone and lesser accuracy :D\n\n* Supreme tea sachets make for the best material for darts. After it comes the Surf Excel packets. Although the wrapping plastic film on cold drink bottles looks more smooth and lightweight, it is too limp for making a good, stable dart. They won''t serve accurately for more than 7-8 shots.\n\n* Blowgunning is a very addictive hobby. But it is very tiresome too. Making dart cones is the worst part of all. You can''t buy them from the market and you can''t expect anyone else to make the cones of your choice. In the long run, you will have to do it yourself. And it is extremely boring and monotonous task. Not to mention that you have to be careful from the start to the end. One failed cone = 6 minutes wasted + lots of annoyance.', 1, 1, '119.154.103.67', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

Airguns arrive by air in booked luggage to Pakistan regularly and get ''cleared'' through customs ... $1000+ assembled, I must add, airguns are given Go Pass with $10-$15 chaiy panni ...\n\nAs for the law quoted to you ... it was utter nonsense, lie and non-existent ... I know people who regularly fly between cities within Pakistan and take their pistols and bullets along. It is perfectly legal to do so as long as one has All Pakistan licence. \n\nI was stopped by checkpoint police last year near Texla, with Mrs in the car. They asked if I had a weapon so I said Yes. They asked to see it and took out the gun case when pointed where it was. That officer took the pistol out and started pulling the trigger immediately, multiple times!! .... it was chambered but the thanks Almighty the trigger safety was on (as I always keep it on even if not chambered). I nearly had a heart attack and had to push his gun holding hand down and take the gun off him saying that this is chambered and do you want to kill us by this trigger testing you are doing!!? This is the competency level!\n\nNext time, ask the customs guy, who is putting up resistance, to speak with him privately (they love private conversations!! Really, they do!). Do not kick up any fuss or ask for laws, chiefs etc. In private corner/room, say this is 25 years old gun for blowing up balloons and worth $15 and I''m taking it back for my kids. Please help me. He''ll fluff about, and then take out $5 and shake hands ... done!

Thanks for taking the time to give us a detailed tutorial.. May you have dozens of youngsters from your tribal princess.[/QUOTE]\n\nThe range of your shot actually depends more on your PIPE LENGTH, than your dart, although both play their part. With every one foot of length added to the length of your pipe, you may add an extra 16-22 ft range for your pin darts and 13-17 ft for your broadhead ones. I have no idea about the stun darts range as I have never made any.\n\nNotice that this is the EFFECTIVE range of the shots which I am posting, not the length of distance added to the dart''s trajectory. This said, let me explain the few things which have their impact on a dart''s range and which effect they have:\n\n1- The power of your lungs. This is obviously the biggest factor. The harder you can blow, the faster and longer your shot goes.\n\n2- The weight of the dart. This is the next most important factor. Although you cannot shoot an empty cone accurately for more than 10 feet (it will go like a bullet for the first 10 feet and then suddenly turn randomly in the air and immediately drop to nearly zero speed). There is a minimum weight which a dart must have, to travel smoothly. I think it is around 700 mg or so, but I have never weighed them with a fine scale to know for sure. The more weight you add to this optimal value, the more powerful will your shot become (more shock generated to the target) but they will have lesser range and accuracy.\n\n3- The length of your pipe. For myself I think a 6 feet pipe gives optimal range versus lung force. This means, that for any pipe lesser than 6 feet, you cannot use all of your lung shot for blowing as the dart would already be out of the pipe before you finish blowing. For any length more than 6 feet, your lungs would already be empty before the dart gets out of the pipe. For europeans, americans and asians with tall, strong stature, this optimal pipe length is around 8 feet.\n\n4- The length of the dart. Yes, this also has its part in determining the range. Generally, the longer a dart is, the longer it''s range is, until you reach the optimal length, after which the range actually starts decreasing. The optimal dart length (from cone''s wide end to broadhead''s/needle''s sharp end) for a 4 feet pipe, for me, is between 5 and 6 inches. For a 6 feet pipe, I guess it would be between 6 and 7.5 feet.\n\n5- The shape of the dart and the quality of it''s material. The more solid is a dart''s cone (i.e. does not bend inside due to air drag), the longer and more predictable/accurate is the flight of the dart. The shape of the dart also has a large impact on the range and accuracy. Sometimes the cones of my darts are not in line with the needles. That is, there is slight angle between the cone and the needle. Those darts, besides having a spiraling flight, also have a much lesser range. For optimal range, your darts must be STRAIGHT.\n\nHaving said all this, here is what is my darts range. Notice that I have a 4 feet pipe.\n\nMy pin darts are usually between 5 and 6 inches of length and are generally straight. I can easily shoot my darts to distances of 120 feet. The EFFECTIVE RANGE of these darts (for which the penetration is at least 0.3 inch in flesh) is around 60 feet. This doesn''t look like damaging enough to bring down a crow, but trust me, I once hit a crow with nearly 0.2 inch (based on lung power used) penetration and it took 3 somersaults in the air before finally balancing itself. Sadly, it managed to escape, albeit with a very erratic flight. The dart was still stuck in it''s chest. For incapacitating a mouse or a snake (around 3 feet in length), you would need some 4-5 well places darts (around the head region). It won''t kill them, but they won''t be able to escape, either. However, at a distance of 30 feet or so, one good hit is enough to severely damage them and assuring their death, even if they manage to drag themselves out of reach.\n\nMy broadheads are around 3.5 to 4 inches in length. These have an effective range (0.3 inch penetration or more) of 40-45 feet. You can easily incapacitate a snake or a mouse with one hit of these. It won''t kill them, but it would definitely render them unable to escape. Same for a crow or a dove in this range. I use bicycle spokes (the ''wheel-wires'' for bicycle wheels) for making my broadheads. Although they come in free, these are too heavy and demand much effort in blowing. I am desperately looking for some wire or cord which is slightly lesser in thickness. I hope with them I would be able to increase the effective range and accuracy to nearly the same range as the pin tipped ones.\n\nI have no idea about the stun darts. While they would be great fun to break people''s light-bulbs (oh yeah baby!) and killing mice and other pests at a short range, I can''t think of any other useful exploitation for them. Never made them. My rough idea (based on their would-be weight) would be that their effective range (enough for incapacitating a mouse) would be around 30 feet.\n\nAnd yes, blowing is crazily fun thing to do. Just stay prepared for hours and hours of making dart cones. Once you start shooting a pipe, you would forget the airguns (for fun shooting, that is. if you kill birds as a need, not as a sport, you would have to stick to your airgun/shotgun).', 1, 1, '182.189.180.19', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

The extra space is very helpful in operation with tactical gloves specially used in Combat operations. \n\nFraz Sb, Thank you for the decocker method, Dr. Gilani sb had mentioned decockers to us before and we have considered it but that may come as an option in future models. \n\nThank you to Dr. Sb''s for wonderful photos from last week.\n\nSincerely,\n\nDSA', 1, 1, '99.237.113.163', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

From what I''ve gathered, Diana P1000 looks like a much better choice, although at twice the price of the BT65, but worth it. PCP''s are all about accuracy, power and low sound report. You get all three in the Diana.   You can put the money you spend on the pump in the Diana. I can tell you the way around the pump. Just get a steel cylinder rated to 300 bar with a DIN connector and the Diana fill adapter will fit right on. You can then have it filled at a SCUBA diving facility if you''re in Karachi or call me if you''re in Rawalpindi / Islamabad. This setup is nice, easy and very convenient.  A used steel cylinder goes for around Rs. 5000 and carbon fibre for about twice as much. You may get them cheaper if you look around.   I''m surprised this information has never been given here before, even though I''ve seen a couple of posts asking for this kind of info. I asked once but there was not much help, so I looked around and found all the info and all the equipment I would ever need, even a compressor. It''s enough to run a PCP club.

It was purchased from Hira Arms Lahore and has been shipped to Karachi. Posting first snaps of the beauty. A full detailed review of the Airgun will be shared soon.[/COLOR]\n\n[B]Background:[/B]\n[COLOR=#323D4F]My passion for Airguns is little over a year old. My first Airgun was a Chinese Airgun and a clone of Diana Magnum. I was initially quoted 9k for it but later due to shortage of stock, I had to buy it from a different shop for 11k. I never got to measure the force of it on a Chrony but it was very power with decent accuracy even though the trigger was a little hard but not too much of a bother. The sights were fiber optic but the plastic used was of fairly low quality. I shot on it almost every day for two months and then the breach seal got damaged. THe FPS of the Airgun dropped drastically and I had absolutely no idea about technicalities of an Airgun so I thought something had gone wrong with the spring. I panicked and sold it back and bought a Kral Instead (asking price was Kral was 14k and in exchange I had to pay 9k over). If I would have just replaced the seal the problem would have been solved.[/COLOR]\n\n[COLOR=#323D4F]Anyhow, the Kral was much lighter and the trigger was very nice. It was very crisp as compared to the Chinese. The gun was accurate as well. After shooting around 1000 pellets with it I checked it on Chrony and It was giving 560-570 fps. A decent Airgun for random plinking at 10-15 yards but now I was looking for something a bit more powerful. Also in-between my Kral developed some problems. The gun refused to load. Felt as if the Sear kept slipping, anyhow got it fixed from a gun smith and the problem never happened again. The breach seal got damaged as well so replaced it with a Teflon made custom seal.[/COLOR]\n\n[COLOR=#323D4F]I got rid of my Kral, sold it to a dear friend and got myself a Gamo Shadow (which I purchased from txshooter). The Gamo felt very nice had I fixed a 3x9-44E scope on it. The setup turned out to be pretty good for the price and I loved everything about the Shadow except its trigger. I shot around 2000 pellets with the Airgun and even after breaking in I just hated the trigger. The Gamo was giving 670-690 FPS and just to give a rough idea of its penetration power, I had shot at a green coconut from about 30 plus yards and the Pellet crossed the coconut and the one behind it. I shot several pellets and all of them went through.[/COLOR]\n\n[COLOR=#323D4F]Anyhow a very dear friend of mine was very interested in buying my Shadow so I sold it to him. From over a month I had been looking out and researching for my next Airgun and after doing much research (and the amount of budget I could have spared) I got myself a Hatsan Mod 99 for 21.5k including delivery charges from Hira Arms at a very special price (courtesy of a dear friend) else the normal asking rate is 24k. [/COLOR]\n\n[COLOR=#323D4F]Now that I have the airgun in my hand, lets see what Hatsan Mod 99 has to offer. \n\n[/COLOR][/FONT][URL="http://postimg.org/image/rvxbqmfth/"][IMG]http://s26.postimg.org/rvxbqmfth/IMG_20140430_091036.jpg[/IMG][/URL]\n[FONT=arial][COLOR=#323D4F]\n[/COLOR][/FONT][URL="http://postimg.org/image/5zasq92mt/"][IMG]http://s26.postimg.org/5zasq92mt/IMG_20140430_091113.jpg[/IMG][/URL]\n[FONT=arial][COLOR=#323D4F]\n[/COLOR][/FONT][URL="http://postimg.org/image/s9ynq7zx1/"][IMG]http://s26.postimg.org/s9ynq7zx1/IMG_20140430_091509.jpg[/IMG][/URL][FONT=arial][COLOR=#323D4F]\n[/COLOR][/FONT]', 1, 1, '125.209.88.46', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

I didn''t get the chance to meet with the managing head of the design team but i was pretty much satisfied and well received by Mr Murad (and what a fine gentleman he is, which overall reflects the courteous, polite and respectful attitude of the top brass including the owner of the industry  and their attitude towards the satisfaction of their customer). i''m planning to visit them as soon as i find free time.

Barrel Release System which helps in easy breaking of the Barrel and also acts as a safety feature\n2. Micro adjustable Truglo rear sights (good quality sights)\n3. Combo Scope Mount Rail\n4. Automatic / Manual Safery\n5. Gold plated quattro trigger\n\n\n\n\n[b]01-05-14\nLabor Day[/b]\n\n\nI had it all planned in my mind last night, how I was going to review the Hatsan Mod 99.  today at 7:00 am in the morning I went to my rooftop and did so. The Sun was unforgiving.\n\n\nI had set up the target at 15 meters, cocked the Airgun, loaded a pellet, aimed and aligned for a good sight picture, pulled the trigger to realize that I had not disengaged the Automatic Safety.I pushed the knob in and tried again. Guess what, I still couldn''t press the trigger. I thought perhaps I did not disengage the safety properly so I pulled it back and pushed it back again. I tried and I tried but the gun wouldn''t shoot. I pointed the gun in the air and pulled the trigger and TWWWANGGG it shot... \n\n\nI did not jump to any conclusions and very patiently I loaded another pellet only to find the same incident repeating again. My 2nd, 3rd - 15th and 16th pellets all were fired in the air and I found the trigger to be extremely hard.\n\n\nI failed to understand the situation, I thought maybe the safety is not disengaging properly so I pulled and pushed the safety knob / switch several times but it had absolutely no effect.\n\n\nI figured that it was not the safety, something was up with the trigger. I would load the gun and pull the trigger, it would act as if the safety was active. I released the trigger and tried again a few times. In 3-4 attempts the trigger worked and the gun shot. Of course with this kind of a setup it was humanly impossible for me to even imagine about making a group. \n\n\nAfter shooting approx. 30 pellets, I realized that the trigger was slowly getting better. The gun would fire 3 shots normally, then the trigger would get stuck for the next 4 shots, then 1 shot normal, stuck for 2 shots. This kind of cycle kept repeating and I kept shooting.\n\n\nI am not going to jump to any conclusions at this stage and give mod 99 benifit of doubt. Perhaps and most probably the gun needs time to break in.\n\n\nBelow is a picture of the best 10 shots I did today from 15 meters while sitting on chair and elbow resting on my knee with open sights.\n\n\n[url=http://postimg.org/image/f5oyj5zf9/][img]http://s26.postimg.org/f5oyj5zf9/IMG_20140501_100419.jpg[/img][/url]\n\n\nThe trigger got stuck in the first 3 shots but did not create problems in the remaining 7 shots. The different is clearly evident. \n\n\nAnother fellow member also got mod99 couple of months back and faced a similar kind of issue. He took the stock off to find out that the sear had been over greased which was creating the problem. He cleaned the sear and the problem was resolved.\n\n\nAnyhow I tried some more shots in the evening and I think the problem is slowly going away but it''s still there. I am going to wait for a couple of days but if the problem doesn''t go away, then i`ll open and check the Trigger and I am pretty sure it''s going to be the same over greasing issue.\n\n\nBelow are pictures of the setup I have on my roof top,\n\n\n[url=http://postimg.org/image/3sblzg3o5/][img]http://s26.postimg.org/3sblzg3o5/IMG_20140501_083104.jpg[/img][/url]\n\n\n[url=http://postimg.org/image/9uj8pxs45/][img]http://s26.postimg.org/9uj8pxs45/IMG_20140501_083136.jpg[/img][/url]\n\n\n[url=http://postimg.org/image/6l4tjh40l/][img]http://s26.postimg.org/6l4tjh40l/IMG_20140501_083148.jpg[/img][/url]\n\n\nLater in the day I took some more pictures of the mod99\n\n\n[url=http://postimg.org/image/fcbudqnbp/][img]http://s26.postimg.org/fcbudqnbp/SAM_2257.jpg[/img][/url]\n\n\n[url=http://postimg.org/image/yvgfn3m39/][img]http://s26.postimg.org/yvgfn3m39/SAM_2261.jpg[/img][/url]\n\n\n[url=http://postimg.org/image/5zb99mjkl/][img]http://s26.postimg.org/5zb99mjkl/SAM_2262.jpg[/img][/url]\n\n\n[url=http://postimg.org/image/bc03nr7h1/][img]http://s26.postimg.org/bc03nr7h1/SAM_2264.jpg[/img][/url]\n\n\n[url=http://postimg.org/image/u36mbnrf9/][img]http://s26.postimg.org/u36mbnrf9/SAM_2269.jpg[/img][/url]\n\n\n[url=http://postimg.org/image/brfyuiis5/][img]http://s26.postimg.org/brfyuiis5/SAM_2275.jpg[/img][/url]\n\n\n[url=http://postimg.org/image/q9d62ia39/][img]http://s26.postimg.org/q9d62ia39/SAM_2277.jpg[/img][/url]\n\n\nThe Quattro Trigger Closeup\n\n\n[url=http://postimg.org/image/tlbgvt1ud/][img]http://s26.postimg.org/tlbgvt1ud/SAM_2280.jpg[/img][/url]\n\n\nMy conclusion so far (and I feel this review is going to go a long way)\n- This Airgun is fairly accurate and is capable of making some very nice groups\n- There is alot of side by side movement in the trigger but when it works fine, it is a very soft trigger \n- This Airgun is heavy and weights 3.8 kg, Don''t buy this Airgun if you cannot handle weight (Most Diannas weigh around 3.5kgs)\n- The heavy weight is balanced of with very nice recoil management\n- The finishing of the stock is simply amazing as you guys must have made out from the pictures\n- The barrel is a very thick one and almost looks like a rifle barrel\n- The gun has been made very well and looks very tough yet no machine marks and with very smooth finishing\n- I have not measured but I suppose this gun is currently shooting at 720-750 fps. Anyhow I will be checking it on Chrony very soon.\n\n\nWell, that''s all for now, all new developments will be posted and I`ll keep you guys updated.', 1, 1, '182.178.7.124', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

For a 300 bar rated PCP the 1st fill will be at 300 bar and every fill thereon will drop in pressure both in the cylinder and the PCP.\n\nMy carbn fiber filling setup has cost me approx 20k because when dealing with such high pressure I want to be a 100% sure about the quality and life of my equipment. Any mishap will spell disaster so I honestly will NOT opt to buy a low cost cylinder. Also getting it tested is another area where I would not take any chances. \n\nOnce that whole setup is obtained i know of places in Karachi where you''ll get cylinders filled up for Rs 1000.

My Office was open but I didn''t go since I wasn''t feeling well today as well. However my restlessness kept increasing and my patience kept going down. I took out the Mod99 from it''s case and made up my mind to open up the gun for a DIY project.\n\n\nI started opening the gun, took the screws out, separated the barrel and trigger mechanism from the Stock. I had made up my mind to figure out (if not fix the trigger) that what exactly is the problem in the gun and why was the trigger behaving the way it was.\n\n\n[URL="http://postimg.org/image/93406tnrp/"][IMG]http://s26.postimg.org/93406tnrp/IMG_20140502_110651.jpg[/IMG][/URL]\n\n\nThe stock of this gun has been extremely well done on the inside.

I cleaned the entire trigger mechanism with WD40 to remove any rust if present or excess grease (even though there was none visible and all parts were shinny). In the process in noticed something. I figured out the reason why the trigger would not release the sear.\n\n\n[URL="http://postimg.org/image/cb8hjva1h/"][IMG]http://s26.postimg.org/cb8hjva1h/IMG_20140502_110715.jpg[/IMG][/URL]\n\n\n[URL="http://postimg.org/image/5tpl0czo5/"][IMG]http://s26.postimg.org/5tpl0czo5/IMG_20140502_110752_1.jpg[/IMG][/URL]\n\n\nObserve the picture below, within the circle you can clearly see the safety engaged and a metal part is preventing the trigger from travelling.\n\n\n[URL="http://postimg.org/image/yog86oaz9/"][IMG]http://s26.postimg.org/yog86oaz9/IMG_20140502_112907.jpg[/IMG][/URL]\n\n\nUpon disengaging, this metal part is suppose to be removed from under the trigger, enabling it to travel and release the sear. What was happening was the even upon disengaging the safety, the metal part was not moving away properly and the trigger was getting stuck in the part. Pulling and releasing the trigger 2-3 times would eventually put this metal part in its place and the trigger would work.\n\n[url=http://postimg.org/image/6hyfjaydx/][img]http://s26.postimg.org/6hyfjaydx/IMG_20140502_112922.jpg[/img][/url]\n\nI filed this metal part a little bit, oiled the safety mechanism with some gun oil and engaged / disengaged the safety approx 30 times.

It''s really nice, very soft and I really like the quattro trigger. I shot some pellets through the gun and out of 15 times, only once the trigger got stuck. I am very sure that with a bit more shooting, this problem will go away completely .

Thanks buddy, and you are doing the right thing by waiting for 500 pellets before scoping it. as far maintaining your airgun is concerned, it''s slightly more complicated. You may clean the barrel with a pull through after every 500 shots approx. 5 Pull through should do the job, the first 3 damp with WD40 and remaining completely dry. Make sure the barrel is totally dry before shooting any pellets. Avoid any oiling around the breach seal as it can distroy it. Also make sure no Oil goes in the Gas Chamber as it may damage the seal inside as well. You may wipe the visible metal parts with oil to protect them from rust but make sure its just enough, any dripping or flowing oil might leak into the cylinder and damage the seals.

Higher usable number of shots because you can fill the gun to higher pressure (300b e.g.) and still get the same velocity as you''d get at 120b.

To get consistent FPS the trick is to start and stop the shot string where this curve is most flat i.e. "the sweet spot".  The issue is that this sweet spot is rather small as far as cylinder pressure variance is concerned (Also in terms of number of shots that can be taken). To expand the sweet spot gun manufacturers usually try to minimise the pressure variation in the cylinders by increasing the total volume of cylinder and keeping the pressure variance to mimum (between 200 and 100b, compared to regulated guns that can take 300 to 100b) . But still the number of shots taken at the sweet spot are only a few if you are looking at consistency of target shooting.  The more consistent you want your gun to be the smaller the sweet spot you will have. \n\nOf course the other approach is to regulate the pressure to the release valve through entire regulated cylinder pressure range. On the flip side you add one additional component in your gun in the form of regulator this means one more thing that can go bad! \n\nLastly all of the high end PCP guns manufactures have introduced regulators for their Guns either as a standard or as an add-on. FX is selling regulator as add-on ,  Daystate is using electronically controlled air pressure regulator. CaliberGun Cricket is using regulator, Diana has a regulator as well. \n[COLOR=#767676][FONT=sans-serif]\n[/FONT][/COLOR]', 1, 0, '101.50.81.50', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

Only a limited quantity is imported irregularly which is bought and consumed by the PCP gun users immediately as JSB does not have a Pakistani distributor as of right now.  I would also like to add that JSBs are excellent pellets for break barrel rifles especially their 16 and below grain range.

Originally i was looking for a K2 in 45 ACP back when cancer_doc bought his. But due to unavailability of that particular firearm i had to shift towards this baby. I present to you my Taurus 669! 6-inch barrel, the classic 6 round capacity in 357 magnum! This model was a target model by taurus back when it was competing with Smith&Wesson etc. And maybe that''s the reason every time i type taurus 669 reviews on the web, i find people regretting trading this firearm and others telling people never to get rid of it. Not even a single bad review whatsoever! (Kisi ko millay to bata day taakeh main apni gun ko behtar tareeqay say jaan sakoo) I couldn''t take a trip to the range unfortunately, but here''s a link in which the user comments on its accuracy [url]http://castboolits.gunloads.com/showthread.php?136103-My-new-to-me-Taurus-669-357-Magnum-6-inch[/url] . For me however, its a treat to fire! Totally manageable recoil (because i''m too much into arm wrestling) and the bang and power is just WOW!!! I use Armscor ammunition and according to the info on their website and midwayusa they have a velocity of 1894 fps and a muzzle energy of 984 ft.lbs! comparing this with a 44. mag sellier and bellot round with a muzzle energy just above 700 ft.lbs this baby is affordable AND ultra powerful!  And the funniest part is, i got it sealed packed from Majeed Sons for 75000!!!

To get consistent FPS the trick is to start and stop the shot string where this curve is most flat i.e. "the sweet spot".  The issue is that this sweet spot is rather small as far as cylinder pressure variance is concerned (Also in terms of number of shots that can be taken). To expand the sweet spot gun manufacturers usually try to minimise the pressure variation in the cylinders by increasing the total volume of cylinder and keeping the pressure variance to mimum (between 200 and 100b, compared to regulated guns that can take 300 to 100b) . But still the number of shots taken at the sweet spot are only a few if you are looking at consistency of target shooting.  The more consistent you want your gun to be the smaller the sweet spot you will have. \n\nOf course the other approach is to regulate the pressure to the release valve through entire regulated cylinder pressure range. On the flip side you add one additional component in your gun in the form of regulator this means one more thing that can go bad! \n\nLastly all of the high end PCP guns manufactures have introduced regulators for their Guns either as a standard or as an add-on. FX is selling regulator as add-on ,  Daystate is using electronically controlled air pressure regulator. CaliberGun Cricket is using regulator, Diana has a regulator as well. \n[COLOR=#767676][FONT=sans-serif]\n[/FONT][/COLOR][/QUOTE]\n\nsalaam brother.\nyour basic understanding is probably the same as mine-but, i just happen to have personal experience of pcp''s with and without a regulator and the results too ;)\nfirstly, just to give you an example of a high power pcp with NO regulator:\nTheoben Rapid pcp, .22 cal, 18 gr jsb pellets, 200 bar fill... here were some of the fps readings starting from the very first shot...\n1012, 1012, 1013, 1016, 1016, 1015, 1017, 1014, 1014, 1015, 1015, 1015 ...\nas you can see from the very first shot the shots were very consistent and these results are as good as as any regulator wold give.\nwhen using a regulator and you know the regulator pressure and max filling pressure of that regulator-then, you are able to simply know between what bar readings you can expect to get consistent readings.\nwhen NO regulator is being used and there are varying factors in different pcp''s, you should fill to 5 bar more each time you re-fill, and the shot fps consistency should remain the same, but you will reach a point where the first few shots will NOT be consistent-once this has been reached then one knows the max and most effecient fill pressure of that pcp... then it''s a matter of shooting a string of shots until the fps drops and then you have your lower bar pressure curve point... in the case of this rapid was from 220 bar down to 160 bar. this gave 42 shots, which works out to be about 1.5 bar per shot-even though there''s just 60 bar of consistent shots, in my eyes, that''s pretty damn good and AS good as any regulated gun and is an amazing sweet spot for such a high power pcp.\nthe daystate airwolf is totally electronically controlled and is a different type of working system which is slightly out of context-i don''t like any electronics in a pcp and for pakistan this is the worst type of pcp to have as you WILL have problems with these type of pcp''s and these can NOT be fixed in pakistan so is a bit silly to have such a pcp in pakistan at least.\ndaystate air ranger, for example, is available upto 60 fpe in .22 cal and you''ll find these high power versions are NOT regulated and the same is true in other brands too-at high power, a regulator also actually restricts the amount of air so max power can simply NOT be achieved WITH a regulator.\ni also have 2 fx royales-one is regulated and the other is not regulated. they are both JUST AS consistent and same no of consistent shots, but the NON regulated version gives slightly more power.\nagain, the need for a regulator all depends on the overal workings of that particular pcp.', 1, 0, '82.28.5.76', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

Sights are good, but the manual says that it has rear adjustable sight with tritium inserts. It''s not adjustable nor it glows in the dark. I charged the damn thing for hours and it didn''t lit-up. Good accessories, love the holster. Magloader is useless. It''s a pretty big and heavy gun then Caracal F. Harder to CC. Mag capacity is good. But couldn''t get the 18th round to go in the mag. The concept of the DA/SA trigger in the striker fired gun is good. But this gun is just not that refined. The trigger pull in both DA and SA is very very heavy. I can''t break the trigger in DA at all. It was that heavy. SA not so much, but i couldn''t fire 10 rounds in a go. My poor trigger finger just gave up. I had to take a break between shots. Maybe it''ll get better after the break-in period. The gun shot pretty accurately. But the trigger was so hard that occasionally my hand started to shake when i squeezed the trigger. Fired hectic 100 rounds through this gun. Don''t have the energy to fire more anytime soon. There were only 2 FTFeeds. 1 in the first mag and 2nd in the second mag. After that no problems. The other issue that i faced with this gun was that it wasn''t throwing the empties very far from me. Couple of shells dropped on my shooting hand and some hit me in my face and cap couple of time. I don''t know what caused that. Haven''t cleaned it yet and will see how much can this gun shoot without getting cleaned. \nHere are some pics:)\n [URL=http://s1113.photobucket.com/user/bilal_qureshi1/media/20140504_151953_HDR_zps630993ef.jpg.html][IMG]http://i1113.photobucket.com/albums/k512/bilal_qureshi1/20140504_151953_HDR_zps630993ef.jpg[/IMG][/URL]\n[URL=http://s1113.photobucket.com/user/bilal_qureshi1/media/20140504_152116_HDR_zpsd5a1c594.jpg.html][IMG]http://i1113.photobucket.com/albums/k512/bilal_qureshi1/20140504_152116_HDR_zpsd5a1c594.jpg[/IMG][/URL]\n[URL=http://s1113.photobucket.com/user/bilal_qureshi1/media/20140504_152250_HDR_zpsc9c95d82.jpg.html][IMG]http://i1113.photobucket.com/albums/k512/bilal_qureshi1/20140504_152250_HDR_zpsc9c95d82.jpg[/IMG][/URL]\n[URL=http://s1113.photobucket.com/user/bilal_qureshi1/media/20140504_152213_HDR_zps18947bd3.jpg.html][IMG]http://i1113.photobucket.com/albums/k512/bilal_qureshi1/20140504_152213_HDR_zps18947bd3.jpg[/IMG][/URL]\n[URL=http://s1113.photobucket.com/user/bilal_qureshi1/media/20140504_152333_HDR_zpsc4a4a9d8.jpg.html][IMG]http://i1113.photobucket.com/albums/k512/bilal_qureshi1/20140504_152333_HDR_zpsc4a4a9d8.jpg[/IMG][/URL]\n[URL=http://s1113.photobucket.com/user/bilal_qureshi1/media/20140504_152404_HDR_zps97059922.jpg.html][IMG]http://i1113.photobucket.com/albums/k512/bilal_qureshi1/20140504_152404_HDR_zps97059922.jpg[/IMG][/URL]\n[URL=http://s1113.photobucket.com/user/bilal_qureshi1/media/20140504_152502_HDR_zps89deb3dd.jpg.html][IMG]http://i1113.photobucket.com/albums/k512/bilal_qureshi1/20140504_152502_HDR_zps89deb3dd.jpg[/IMG][/URL]', 1, 1, '119.154.47.69', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

To get consistent FPS the trick is to start and stop the shot string where this curve is most flat i.e. "the sweet spot".  The issue is that this sweet spot is rather small as far as cylinder pressure variance is concerned (Also in terms of number of shots that can be taken). To expand the sweet spot gun manufacturers usually try to minimise the pressure variation in the cylinders by increasing the total volume of cylinder and keeping the pressure variance to mimum (between 200 and 100b, compared to regulated guns that can take 300 to 100b) . But still the number of shots taken at the sweet spot are only a few if you are looking at consistency of target shooting.  The more consistent you want your gun to be the smaller the sweet spot you will have. \n\nOf course the other approach is to regulate the pressure to the release valve through entire regulated cylinder pressure range. On the flip side you add one additional component in your gun in the form of regulator this means one more thing that can go bad! \n\nLastly all of the high end PCP guns manufactures have introduced regulators for their Guns either as a standard or as an add-on. FX is selling regulator as add-on ,  Daystate is using electronically controlled air pressure regulator. CaliberGun Cricket is using regulator, Diana has a regulator as well. \n[COLOR=#767676][FONT=sans-serif]\n[/FONT][/COLOR][/QUOTE]\n\nRcpak Bro.\nYou are right any AIRGUN with out regulator will have a sweat spot.\nthe regged guns will give more shots and are more consistent shot to shot.\nsome people just thing they are clever that''s all but are not and only been playing with PCP airguns less than two years.\nSH.', 1, 0, '92.236.129.1', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

(437604, 13000, 0, 'Moeen', 704, 'CANIK Piranha VS CZ SP01 Tactical', 1399228868, 'Salam All,\nThe other day I was bored and roaming around the forum to see whats new in members lives and I came upon a thread of a fellow member Verve.  Now, Verve has lately gone through or what I believe still may be going through is a little bit of a mid-life-gun-crises.  He keeps on jumping from gun to gun when he should be going for what he has tried and tested and liked.  So I am on this thread where the Canik Shark is being mentioned and somewhere along the posts I read up quality quirks with the Caniks.  Uh, is that right?  Could I be wrong?  I mean granted I am the Sig guy lately rather than the Glock guy going through my own version of identity crises of gun ownership; but, Canik?  Noooway.  I have used this gun, shown this gun, have had amateurs fire this gun with success at the gun club where they have managed to knock down all plates in the first round (a feat that not even my Mastershop can claim!) - and I can''t get that damn thing to JAM!  I refused to clean PG One''s Canik when I had it with me... everyone who picked it up complaint about their hands getting black and their clothes getting dirty - I cleaned it after I think it was 1700 rounds or something like that as everything in front of the trigger guard to the muzzle was covered in black sut (carbon).  Verve has also fired the Canik, and in the first round DID manage a better total of knock down of plates over the CZ SP or the CZ Shadow.  Hmmm, maybe you didn''t have enough coffee or smokes that day Verve when you were firing the CZ?  I know I won''t attempt the accuracy test because some might say I did a biased shoot.  Verve, please do let me know regarding accuracy... or should I say bro ''don''t worry with practice you will get better with the CZ equallying what you can already do with the Piranha''.  Bro, I am being sarcastic please don''t mind.  Either way, I had Verve visit me at the Gun Club today.  He sat with me and spent a few hours whilst we tore apart both guns and started comparisons.\nSo let the games begin... Well, no, you know what?  I will just tell you what you already know and the rest is me blah blah blah....  Seeing is believing and we can also get the rest from Verve.   Both guns are made out of a ISO manufacturing facility, matter of fact the Canik factory seems to have more certifications posted on their site than the CZ factory.  Both of the items are manufactured from die casting (aluminum) to precision Investment casting (wax casting).  Both are using proper metallurgy with xrays and to check for cracks and gas bubbles and the like.\nNow, this is where things do take a turn for the worst for the CZ quality wise.  The outer finish on the Canik - although dirty has had over 1000 rounds through it already yet still looks new - furthermore, I wish I had PG One''s Canik here as thats had well well over 6000 rounds fired through it and one can never tell.  The finish is also a medium shine finish.  The CZ''s more dull, un-used, still looked like it had fired over 1000 rounds through it.  The internal of the frame was not finished rather left sand blasted on the CZ.\nThe barrel tolerances on the CZ will be looser after a few 100 fires because the Zinc coating started to wear off Verve''s new gun barrel already where as in the Canik the barrel is hard chromed and barely showed use.  \nThe factory wire spring meant to hold the slide release in place kept coming out of frame slightly on the CZ.  Bro, glad you tinkered and fixed it.\nThe serrations on the hammer seem better precision cut than the loose cut serrations on the CZ.  The lesser spaced serrations also require more detail to manufacture.\nLook at the precision work on the sear block as well.  The CZ one looks like someone worked on it.  The trigger spring on the Canik sat completely inside its slot whilst the CZ one was bent to the center.  The two springs working the disconnector/trigger bar were not fully reseating to their resting place on the CZ... Bro, good thing you got that cleared.\nThe guide rod was well hmmm the comment I would like to make but can''t on the CZ.... very wavy (up down up down...) where as the guide rod on the Canik was a no nonsense steel.\nThe slide rails on the CZ - see photos.\nThe barrel in the slide movement felt granular in the CZ due to the now fast wearing Zinc coating - where as the one on the Canik was like butter even though this gun was dirty.\nThe magazine bodies... see the precision of the mag body curves on the Canik verses CZ''s I won''t be commenting on it. \nYou know what I am just going to post the photos I want you guys to decide.  I believe Canik here as the upper hand over the CZ anyday... Everyday.  Its lighter, very easy to take apart, very precision built - oh yeah it has no night sights... Damn I am never buying a Canik now - right.\nTake a good look forum members the real great news.  CZ stuff fits right in the Canik, no alterations.  Look at the pictures carefully you may see working hybrids.\n\n[IMG]http://i1109.photobucket.com/albums/h427/pyramids99/1-11.jpg[/IMG]\n The top barrel is CZ and the bottom is Canik.\n[IMG]http://i1109.photobucket.com/albums/h427/pyramids99/2-2.jpg[/IMG]\n The top slide is CZ and the bottom slide is Canik.\n[IMG]http://i1109.photobucket.com/albums/h427/pyramids99/3-5.jpg[/IMG]\n The top frame is Canik with CZ custom unaltered fitting grips and bottom is CZ frame.\n[IMG]http://i1109.photobucket.com/albums/h427/pyramids99/4-1.jpg[/IMG]\n Top frame is Canik and the bottom is CZ.\n[IMG]http://i1109.photobucket.com/albums/h427/pyramids99/5-3.jpg[/IMG]\nTop frame is Canik and the bottom frame is CZ.\n[IMG]http://i1109.photobucket.com/albums/h427/pyramids99/6-2.jpg[/IMG]\n Frame on the left is Canik and the frame on the right is CZ.\n[IMG]http://i1109.photobucket.com/albums/h427/pyramids99/7-3.jpg[/IMG]\n Frame on the left is Canik and the frame on the right is CZ.\n[IMG]http://i1109.photobucket.com/albums/h427/pyramids99/8-1.jpg[/IMG]\n Frame on the left is Canik and the frame on the right is CZ.\n[IMG]http://i1109.photobucket.com/albums/h427/pyramids99/9-2.jpg[/IMG]\nFrame on the left is Canik and the frame on the right is CZ.\n[IMG]http://i1109.photobucket.com/albums/h427/pyramids99/10-2.jpg[/IMG]\n Frame on the left is Canik and the frame on the right is CZ.\n[IMG]http://i1109.photobucket.com/albums/h427/pyramids99/11.jpg[/IMG]\n Top guide rod is Canik and the bottom is CZ.\n[IMG]http://i1109.photobucket.com/albums/h427/pyramids99/13-2.jpg[/IMG]\nTop slide is Canik and the bottom slide is CZ.\n[IMG]http://i1109.photobucket.com/albums/h427/pyramids99/14-1.jpg[/IMG]\n Oops!

Could be that the price is a bit to high for everybody to afford. My experience is that people are buying good quality airguns and then use cheaper pellets and are not happy with the airgun.\nin UK I have seen people only buy one brand of pellets which they have proved to be good in their airguns they will buy a huge stock of pellets.\nAnother thing I have seen in Pakistan people using different pellets they just mix them..\nI have seen on and tested myself if you shoot two pellets of one brand and zero your scope they will hit the same place within a 1". And just change the brand they will hit the same diameter but 6/8" left or right of the first two pellets.\nOne must get some sample packs of say 20 pellets of each brand and you must clean your barrel too before going on the next test. \nPellets are too soft and can be damaged during loading.

Sights are good, but the manual says that it has rear adjustable sight with tritium inserts. It''s not adjustable nor it glows in the dark. I charged the damn thing for hours and it didn''t lit-up. Good accessories, love the holster. Magloader is useless. It''s a pretty big and heavy gun then Caracal F. Harder to CC. Mag capacity is good. But couldn''t get the 18th round to go in the mag. The concept of the DA/SA trigger in the striker fired gun is good. But this gun is just not that refined. The trigger pull in both DA and SA is very very heavy. I can''t break the trigger in DA at all. It was that heavy. SA not so much, but i couldn''t fire 10 rounds in a go. My poor trigger finger just gave up. I had to take a break between shots. Maybe it''ll get better after the break-in period. The gun shot pretty accurately. But the trigger was so hard that occasionally my hand started to shake when i squeezed the trigger. Fired hectic 100 rounds through this gun. Don''t have the energy to fire more anytime soon. There were only 2 FTFeeds. 1 in the first mag and 2nd in the second mag. After that no problems. The other issue that i faced with this gun was that it wasn''t throwing the empties very far from me. Couple of shells dropped on my shooting hand and some hit me in my face and cap couple of time. I don''t know what caused that. Haven''t cleaned it yet and will see how much can this gun shoot without getting cleaned. \n[/QUOTE]\nNow after reading this unbiased review by T_H bro, lets hope Verve bro''s tension would be released a bit.', 1, 0, '182.181.208.110', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

However people don''t do this, and I don''t know if they think they need more expensive gear or are just lazy, but here are some easy tips to take your still pictures to the next level no matter what camera you are using.\n\n1. DON''T USE THE FLASH\nThe direct flash on the camera destroys more pictures than anything else, and unless you are photographing the license plate of a hit and run driver speeding in to the distance or something like that there is no reason to ever use it. Any kind of light can be used, it''s easiest to take good pictures in good natural lighting but since you can easily adjust the white balance, tone and color later it''s not super important as long as there''s no glare or shadows on your object.\n\n2. Use a Tripod\nEven a cheap $10 mini one will do. When you are taking pictures without the flash you will probably need a longer exposure time, and if you are holding the camera in your hands the photo will be blurry and out of focus.\n\n3. Use the Timer\nLike the tripod, this will remove the variable of movement, even on a decent tripod your finger on the camera will affect the photo. Just set it to the timer as you would with a family photo.\n\n\n\n4. Use a Small Aperture\nThis will increase the depth of field, meaning more of the photo will be in focus at once, which is nice for taking pictures of guns or really anything at indirect angles. This also increases the exposure time so obviously the tripod and timer are not optional.\n\n5. Use a Low ISO\nThis adjusts your cameras sensitivity to light, and has similar effects as using the small aperture, increased depth of field and higher detail. I nearly always use an ISO of 100 on non moving objects. Again, tripod and timer are necessary.\n\n6. Black or White Backgrounds\nThis is always nice especially for guns as it gives you such a clean look. For a black background go get a yard of synthetic black velvet, costs less than $10 at a craft store. Hang it on the wall behind what you are taking a picture of (the further the better as it will be easier to control the light). Try and illuminate the object but not the background. You can use a desk lamp or even a piece of cardboard on the light in the room to block it from hitting the velvet. The background should be pitch black in the photo. White backgrounds are the opposite, get a large sheet of white paper, place it behind the object making sure there are no folds or creases, and put all the light you can on the background rather than the object. You may need to adjust the exposure to make it completely white.\n\n7. Play With Light\nFor both the black and white background photos and most photos really you rarely will get the light perfect the first time. Just try a lot of different things until you like what you see, over time you will get a sense of what light works for photos.\n\n\n8. Don''t Put a Knife or 12ga Shell in Your Trigger Guard\nGo to any forum and you will see a ton of photos like this. Spend 10 seconds thinking about a way to prop up the gun at your desired angle without it being visible in the photo. I''ve had some precarious setups but it''s worth it not to have that kind of distraction in the photo.\n\n9. Edit your Photos\nAt the very least you should resize them so people don''t have to spend 30 seconds loading them, but almost every picture can benefit from a bit of tweaking. Photoshop and Lightroom are great but you don''t need them, there''s an amazing free program called Paint.net that will allow you to do adjust the hue, saturation, etc. At the very least use the auto corrects and resize the photo.\n\n10. Take More Photos\nThe more you take the better you will get. Once you take some nice ones you will be more motivated to take more as well. Try as many different ideas as you can too, the best thing about digital is you can take an endless amount and delete them in seconds if you don''t like them. You really have no reason not to take more, so go for it.[/QUOTE]\n\n\n:) happy to see your post sir very informative very knowledgeable for me thanks for sharing these kind of stuff .', 1, 1, '182.185.152.217', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

With all the hype and information available to me via this thread on the Hatsan 125 Sniper, i just had to go ahead and get one. So i just ordered myself one. Had a decent talk with Nafees at Hira Arms Lahore. I have to admit im impressed by the way he treated and guided me on the whole process. I was a bit fidgety and uneasy (to say the very least) with the transaction being made on phone and having had no look or feel of the rifle, but Nafees was very understanding. If this is how these gentlemen treat their customers then im a happy one. My only letdown: i got the rifle without a scope for 31K, and in no way could i get a scope with it, id have paid upto 35k for the whole package but according to him those scopes now cost 6-7k and the rifle comes without them. I could seriously have done with that scope... :ohwell: Oh well, i hope i do get a clean and working rifle atleast.\nThanx a bunch for the extensive review on this rifle Nabeel, it is highly appreciated.

The autocorrect suggests: Meta Potato), as some of the members like Rishi and Hammad really nailed it already, I just like to add this:I understand that you are in search of a consolidated article covering everything in one place.Remember. A weapon and a ride are both Sunnah. Your weapon is a tool to kill, protect, enjoy and feel proud of. It is to be respected, feared and looked after. Read between the lines.There are some mistakes which a newbie makes and then there are are some which even an avid shooter would make. Just remember a simple rule: Everything that is taught to you (like you said earlier that most of the things are shooting techniques) become mistakes more or less when you violate them.Practical weapon handling can be learnt with a good instructor at the range. Rest practice makes perfect.[/QUOTE]\n\n@Haidithanks for the rules. ill keep them in mind. ive already learned those basics with airgunning, but i should remember and enforce them even more with a real one.\n\n@hamadAs i said i dont have the gun with me right now, havent even bought it but i am considering a cz-75 or a DA 9mm TRUshot.\n\n@glock 17 i agree with what you have said, and understand it completely.its just...i want to go into this knowing everything and anything i can.before going in, i want to be a....armchair general of sorts (the guy who knows everything about a certain topic, but has no practical experience whatsoever.) thats how i do things. learn everything i can by scouring the internet, then get my feet wet.the basics of trigger discipline etc i have learned with airguns, but things specific to handguns is what i want to know.Things like the weaver stance, best way to hold a gun, how to clear it, alternatives to slapping the magazine and racking the slide to clear problems, advanced disassembly and maintenance.Call me a coward or paranoid, but i like to know it all before making a decision.About my location, i live in the south side of lahore, the sui gas/state like DHA phase V area. not many ranges around here, and those in the central city are ridiculously expensive. (30k admission? i can buy a DA trushot or a good chinese .30 cal pistol with that much.)\n\naddendum/edit= if it helps, i have studied the manuals for common pistols here cz 75 taurus 24/7 and beretta 92fs\n \nIll be honest with you. I''m a kid (rather unfortunately). will turn 18 next year. always wanted to practice marksmanship. and have saved up about 30,000-40,000 for a firearm. i''m inclined to get a cheap-ish pistol as both the place where is live is not exactly safe (string of burgalries last year) and i''m leaving for a foreign university in 2 more years. so dont want to spend too much on a thing that i cant take along, and i dont want to invest too much in it either (hence reluctant to pay 30k admission)I hope you understand my predicament\n\nso i understand the bottom line from you is to be safe and respect the weapon, and get the help of others when i can.', 1, 0, '182.189.0.206', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

I had already made sure nobody was at risk, and everything was safe. ( i also had a large pile of bricks about....8m high to serve as a backstop)\nso i fire away, and had gotten some looks from people behind me, but they peacefully went on their way after a glance.\nabout the point were i had fired off a good 30 rounds (was re-zeroing gun) this...person comes up to me and asks me what i am doing.\ni tell him that i am target shooting/nashanabazi\nhe then tells me i cannot do this here and he is the property owner of the entire society (it happened to be fermanite society on the south side of lahore. anyone who had been there would tell you how undeveloped it is. only the main roads have houses.\n\nThen he proceeds to barrage me with questions from where i was, my fathers name etc etc (he could tell i am a minor). i declined to answer everything except my first name, and the general location of where i lived. He asked further, but i told him that was all he will get. Then he starts talking about what i am doing, how it is bad,and so on in a slightly raised voice. I tell him what i am doing is completely legal, as air rifles dont need licences. nor am i threatening anyone at all. He once again says i cannot do so on this as it is private, but stops the second i tell him that each and every road of pakistan is considered public property, and to stop me is both unlawful and in court he would be thrown out,so i told him go ahead and try,we will see who is right in civil court. ( i was getting kinda nervous as the amount of people had increased from one to about 6, so i bluffed my hand )\n\nso then, seeing as trying to intimidate me wasn''t getting anywhere, he tried to ask my credentials again, and i declined. After another 17 minuites of talking he asked that i should have gotten permission before i did this, and i replied i had ( security guards stopped me coming in the society yesterday and after explaining my condition and my intentions they let me on the condition that i only practice where there are few people.) he said those security guards had been fired, and i should have went and asked there. At that point one of the men approached the driver side door ( before they were all talking to me through passenger windows) At that point i realized this may just escalate out of my control, and started the engine, shifted into first and kept the engine idle. \n\nHe then talked to me about what other "wrongdoings" i had done. There was a flat, plain field in the back side of the society and i had used it for random drifting and car control practice. the field was not marked, not well kept, and by all means it looked like nothing more then a empty useless large plot (enough to make a shopping center in.)\nhe then started to complain that i had ruined it and kids played cricket there. i said it looked like a empty field, it had no paving, no evenly and well kept grass growing, it was just a empty plot full of dust.( i admitted to playing around there freely)\nto that he was quiet and asked me the come with him to the admin office. i was/am both a minor and didn''t have any id on me.i declined, and told him that any further questions will be considered harassment. \n\nafter that, he left but had stationed 2 armed guards to keep a eye on me, and i left soon afterwards.\n\nThinking afterwards i could have just ended the encounter sooner, and with less conflict.\nI am soon to get a real gun, and the ranges are too far away and so i want to practice in empty plots, far away from other people. so i ask you, did i behave correctly? if i was shooting a real gun instead, (with a proper backstop) would this have gone the same way? How should i behave if i am in a empty area shooting and am approached by others/authorites?\n\nThanks in advance\n\n@mods= i know i have just posted two threads yesterday, but i would like to inform you i am not spamming. this is the last thread i will be posting in a while.', 1, 0, '182.189.0.206', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

I had already made sure nobody was at risk, and everything was safe.

He asked further, but i told him that was all he will get. Then he starts talking about what i am doing, how it is bad,and so on in a slightly raised voice. I tell him what i am doing is completely legal, as air rifles dont need licences. nor am i threatening anyone at all. He once again says i cannot do so on this as it is private, but stops the second i tell him that each and every road of pakistan is considered public property, and to stop me is both unlawful and in court he would be thrown out,so i told him go ahead and try,we will see who is right in civil court. ( i was getting kinda nervous as the amount of people had increased from one to about 6, so i bluffed my hand )\n\nso then, seeing as trying to intimidate me wasn''t getting anywhere, he tried to ask my credentials again, and i declined. After another 17 minuites of talking he asked that i should have gotten permission before i did this, and i replied i had ( security guards stopped me coming in the society yesterday and after explaining my condition and my intentions they let me on the condition that i only practice where there are few people.) he said those security guards had been fired, and i should have went and asked there. At that point one of the men approached the driver side door ( before they were all talking to me through passenger windows) At that point i realized this may just escalate out of my control, and started the engine, shifted into first and kept the engine idle. \n\nHe then talked to me about what other "wrongdoings" i had done. There was a flat, plain field in the back side of the society and i had used it for random drifting and car control practice. the field was not marked, not well kept, and by all means it looked like nothing more then a empty useless large plot (enough to make a shopping center in.)\nhe then started to complain that i had ruined it and kids played cricket there. i said it looked like a empty field, it had no paving, no evenly and well kept grass growing, it was just a empty plot full of dust.( i admitted to playing around there freely)\nto that he was quiet and asked me the come with him to the admin office. i was/am both a minor and didn''t have any id on me.i declined, and told him that any further questions will be considered harassment. \n\nafter that, he left but had stationed 2 armed guards to keep a eye on me, and i left soon afterwards.\n\nThinking afterwards i could have just ended the encounter sooner, and with less conflict.\nI am soon to get a real gun, and the ranges are too far away and so i want to practice in empty plots, far away from other people. so i ask you, did i behave correctly? if i was shooting a real gun instead, (with a proper backstop) would this have gone the same way?

The Punjab government has already signed an agreement with Nadra  for the issuance of the cards and computerisation of the record of all  three stages -- [B]weapon manufacturing, selling and repairing.[/B]\n\n[B]The  system is likely to be in place in the next two to three months in the  big cities of Lahore, Rawalpindi, Bahawalpur, Faisalabad and Gujranwala.  The remaining Punjab districts would be covered in a further two  months&#8217; time.[/B]\n\nThe officials frankly admit to Dawn the government  does not have any idea of the extent of illegal weapons in the province  but they say their number could defy highest of projections. The most  disturbing fact, they say, is the presence of countless illegal weapons  licences, manually prepared by the corrupt among staff in the district  governments. The number again is high, showing organised gunrunning. \nThe issuance of illegal licences is a mega fraud committed right under the nose of the DCOs, says a senior government official.\nAs  per the home department record, the number of arms licences in the  province should safely be 1.7 million. If all of them had been renewed  this year at the rate of Rs1,000 per licence, the government should have  collected Rs1.700 billion. But it received just Rs600 million meaning  thereby that only 600,000 licences were renewed. &#8220;The rest of the  licences were made illegally and were therefore not renewed,&#8221; a senior  official inferred.\nAs for the procedure, applications are received  on printed forms which are easily available. Police verification is  attached mentioning particulars of the applicants.\nThe method  adopted by the corrupt is simple: Duplicate books are secretly kept in  which the unauthorised licences are entered. These books are later  destroyed. Corrupt officials can then make licences using fake DCO  stamps. For example, Lahore&#8217;s one-month quota is 250 licences but many  more are issued.\nOnly Lahore district government gets the books  printed from the Security Printing Corporation. In the rest of the  districts these are just another stationery item. An estimated 10  million licences have been issued in Lahore since 1947. The number on  record, officials say, is far less.\nThere are 562 arms dealers in  Punjab though new licences for this business were banned in 1987.  Monitoring them is a big problem as their record is manual which is kept  in ordinary registers. These books can be tampered with or destroyed,  and there is no organised system of ensuring their accuracy.\nFlaws  in the legal method of obtaining bullets for licenced weapons, too,  benefit unscrupulous dealers and the weapon holders. For example, if a  man is allowed 25 bullets in a month, he can buy bullets of the same  number from as much dealers as he likes. And the multiple buying is  seldom traced.\nThere are 12 registered arms manufacturers in  Punjab and there is no system of their products&#8217; forensic audit, making  it impossible to find out the origin of weapons or bullets used in a  crime.\nRepairing arms was once an attached function of the  registered dealers but over the years it has become a separate domain.  There are 700 arms repairers and there is no monitoring of their work  and the suspicion is that their clientele mainly consists of those who  use illegal weapons.\nMore dangerous is the practice of converting  non-prohibitive weapons to the prohibited class. The experts can make a  12-bore cartridge pump-action rifle into a more lethal magazine-loaded  weapon that can fire volleys of bullets.\nOfficials in the home  department say the computerisation and the smart cards would control  such practices to a great extent. Initially, manual licences issued over  the past around five years would be turned into smart cards to be made  by Nadra from the DCOs offices. All particulars of the licence holders  and biometrics of their guns would be verified online through Nadra  record. \nThose whose particulars could not be verified would lose  their licences. All old manually created licences would stand cancelled.  Previously, desirous citizens would routinely buy weapons after getting  manual licences. Now, they would be eligible to get the smart cards  only after buying guns and mentioning their details. \nAll the four  stages of computerisation -- manufacturing, selling, licences for  weapons and repairing -- would be integrated online. Even the biometrics  of each and every bullet which is like fingerprints and the details of  each weapon would be fed online. And the database would be available  with the home department, DCO offices and the law-enforcement agencies. \nOfficials  of LEAs would therefore be able to have verified authenticity of a  licence in no time by merely sending an SMS at a specified number.\n[B]&#8220;Earlier  attempt to computerise record of weapons licences introduced by the  Punjab IT Board in 2009-10 failed. But this Nadra-based system needs to  succeed if anyone is serious in controlling at least official  gunrunning,&#8221; a senior home department official said.[/B]', 1, 0, '115.186.104.251', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

Yes a “fresh dated manual license” with not one but two weapons on it. Also a practice that is not done. \r\nI also pointed out that it is a 99.99% fake license. \r\nAnd the dealer who makes it is the most unscrupulous dealer in the market. Since ALL licenses are banned these days. \r\nThe license had a provision for pistol and a shotgun.  He asked me if conversion can be done on the shotgun part. I said yes after talking to a number of dealers.\r\nWhat the learned doc did not inform me was that he had a shotgun on “THIS” license. And he wanted a conversion from shotgun to rifle while retaining the shotgun.  In effect 3 weapons on a license that has permission for two!  \r\nThis was an anomaly so obvious that none of the dealers we showed the license to even mentioned it. Since we all assumed that the shotgun section is empty. Since it is pure common sense that one cannot have 3 weapons on a license that has permission for only 2!!! \r\nThere are 4 remedies. \r\n1 Get a fresh rifle license from the same dealer who got him this one. .
