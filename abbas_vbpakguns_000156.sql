Some of them were Webley & Scott 700 series (50''s and 60''s vintage). I knew they were good guns but I just couldn''t justify spending a large amount of money on a middle class ancient English side-by-side. \nIt so happened that I bought my first Webley & Scott 700 few months ago and used it this past hunting season to hunt partridge. The purpose of this thread is to share my experience upland hunting with this gun. \n\nFirst and foremost, they are very popular and sought after guns in Pakistan for the right reason. These guns, like most English quality shotguns, are reasonably light weight. English guns are generally well-made and high quality machines. Among which, Webley & Scott 700 can be considered a mid-range  (ideal for upland hunting) shotgun. They are very well balanced and very forgiving even to the novoice shooters in terms of aiming a bird in flight. \n\nPrice could be debateable. It all depends on who and where and when. Also condition and originality will make all the difference in price. Generally speaking, I have seen anything from Rs.175,000 to Rs. 425,000 and heard about one that sold for RS.550,000 because it was virtually new in box. Most of the ones i''ve seen (serial number 13xxxx to 14xxxx) are manfactured in 1960''s. Its very rare to find one that is extra extra clean but it is possible to find one that hasn''t even left the box it came in. \n\nMine is a 28" barrel length, box lock ejector, straight english stock. The serial number reveals that it was manufactured in 1968. I love the balance and time it takes for this gun to align the object. I enjoyed some great flying shots that I wouldn''t have possibly scored with my Spanish 30" shotgun. \n\nIf you have one of these, hold on to it and if you get a chance to own one you won''t be disappointed. \n\nHere are some pictures of my gun (I am not sure if the pictures loaded correctly or small like icons but I can post links of more pictures in a later post). Thanks for reading and looking at my thread. I hope it was useful to somebody in some way or another:\n\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]18624[/ATTACH]\n\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]18625[/ATTACH][/QUOTE]', ''),

It resembles the 577/500 Magnum Nitro Express, but has a shorter case and is not inter-changeable. It was used in single and double rifles and many under-lever rifles based on the Martini action chambered for it. At one time, it was loaded in Germany as the 12.7mm British No. 2.\n\nThe 500 No. 2 Express was popular in India for shooting thin-skinned game, including tiger. It was not used to any extent in Africa as it is not powerful enough for general use there. Ammunition is difficult to find, although old rifles of this caliber are occasionally found. It would be adequate for almost any North American big game at short range. Bullet diameter is nearly the same as the old 50-caliber. Sharps cartridges and Lyman moulds in various weights will work for cast bullets. Keep smokeless loads on the light side as these old rifles don''t take kindly to high pressures.

(505799, '224 R-C Maxi The 224 R-C Maxi was developed by Don Rissi and Jack Chechowitz both of Reno, Navada in 1987. Most of the work was done while the two were students in attending the NRA summer gun-smithing classes at Lassen College in the Susanville, California. The cartridge is based on the 357 Remington Maximum necked-down to 22-caliber. This provides a rimmed case with practically the same capacity as the 222 Remington, adn loading data for the 222 can be used with similar results, but should be reduced by 10 percent when starting to work up loads. The cartridge is also similar to the 5.6x47Rmm, but is shorter. The purpose of the cartridge was to provide a rimmed version of the 222 Remington for use in single shot rifles and pistols such as the small Martini or the Thompson/Center. The originators used 222 Remington dies to form the case along with an RCBS shell-holder with .002-inch ground off to achieve proper shoulder placement.\n\nThe 224 R-C Maxi, like the 222, is an accurate cartridge suitable for target or varmint shooting. It can cover the same use range as the 222 Remington where a rimmed cartridge is desirable. Brass 357 Remington Maximum cases are easily available through the larger sporting goods or gun stores, and cases are simple to form without a lot of expensive dies or other equipment. There are other versions of this cartridge and, off course, the standard 357 Magnum has been necked-down to 22-caliber. The 22 Remington Jet is also based on the 357 Magnum case. These cartridges are all more or less in the same class, but those made up from the 357 Maximum are the most powerful because of greater volumetric capacity. The 45-grain bullet loaded over 24 grains of H-335 powder generates a muzzle velocity of 3410 fps and muzzle energy at 1155 fpe.', ''),

(505989, '500 Nitro Express (3&quot;) This 500 Nitro Express was derived from what was originally a black-powder cartridge. The smokeless version was introduced in the 1890s and the black-powder original about 1880. A 3-inch and a 3 1/4-inch case were used, the only real difference between them being the lower pressure developed by the long shell. Ballistics are the same and both are used in single and double rifles.\n\nThe black-powder 500 was not as popular in Africa as in India, but smokeless version was considered a real killer on practically anything. John A. Hunter, who did game control work for the Kenya Game Department for 26 years or more, considered it his favorite. His book, HUNTER, is recommended reading for those who enjoy good firsthand experience as a guide to African shooting. The 500 Nitro Express resembles the 50-140 Sharps and empty cases can be used to make ammunition for the old Sharps rifles. For North American game, the 500 is needlessly powerful. With a 570-grain bullet leaving the muzzle at 2150 fps and having an energy of 5850 fpe.', ''),

(506008, ' [QUOTE=raohadi;343969]@rmishaq\nwhat is main feature which is better in combat pistols compared to sports pistol?.....i think accuracy is also needed in combat pistol, isnt it?[/QUOTE]\n\nWell my understanding would be that the inherent purpose of combat weaponry would be reliability and not pin-point accuracy. By that understanding,  combat pistols would be designed to operate in harsher environments and slightly loosely fit so that they do not fail despite dust and stuff. Additionally, there ought to be a lot more "standardization" to facilitate field usage and interchangable parts for lower cost.\nCompetition guns would be more tightly machined for more precision in performance and accuracy. Definitely better trigger since a combat weapon design also needs to minimize accidental discharges which is less of a concern in competitions. Plus there is lots of room for further customization. \nI guess a slightly appropriate analogy would be a BMW stock 2 liter engine and a 2 liter F1 engine. The former is not as much fun to drive but is a lot more durable and reliable than an F1 engine which needs major maintenance or even an overhaul after a couple of races otherwise it''s performance may suffer. :D\nThis is just my take on things. I''m sure pg experts have a much better understanding and canexplain this better.', ''),

It also known as the 7mmx223.\n\nThe 7mm TCU has a reputation for exceptional accuracy and makes a good varmint cartridge in the T/C Contender pistol, particularly with the 14-inch barrel, which provides an extra couple of hundred fps over the 10-inch barrel. It is on the marginal side for deer or other large animals. The originators recommend that only commercial 223 Remington brass should be used for forming cases. Don''t use military brass. Cases are easy to make and can be formed in one operation once the dies are properly adjusted. Proper case length is 1.740 inches. With a 150-grain bullet loaded over 25 grains of BL-C2 powder it produces 1910 fps muzzle velocity with 1218 fpe of muzzle energy.', '');

(506055, '32 Extra Short This cartridge was made for the Remington magazine pistol and the Chicago Firearms Co.''s "Protector" palm pistol. The Remington pistol was manufactured from 1871 until 1888 and the odd palm pistol originated sometime in the ''80s. This would appear to fix the date of introduction of the 32 Extra Short at 1871, even though some authorities indicate a later date. The cartridge was listed in Remington catalogs up to 1920. It was also known as the 32 Protector.\n\nThe 32 was a popular caliber for both handguns and rifles for many years. The 32 Extra Short was probably designed to increase the magazine capacity of the Remington-Rider magazine pistol. Since it only held five of these very short rounds, it is obvious it would have held only about three of the standard 32 Short rimfires. A longer pistol would have been unhandy, a reduced magazine capacity not competitive with the five- to seven-shot revolvers of the day. The sales department has to consider all these angles. the Remington magazine pistol had a tubular magazine below the barrel and a "lever" that protruded slightly above the hammer. Lever and hammer were drawn back together which cocked the gun and extracted the empty shell. Release of the lever chambered a new round as it returned to the forward position. It was of omly limited popularity. Original load was 5 to 5 1/2 grains of black-powder and a 54- to 60-grain bullet.', ''),

(506066, '500 Nitro For Blackpowder Express This was originally a black-powder cartridge introduced around 1880, and there are now three versions. There was not a great deal of difference in the ballistics between these and the 3-inch case, but the short case was loaded with a 340-grain or 380-grain bullet and 136 grains of black-powder. whereas the long case would hold 142 grains and a heavier bullet. The 500 Nitro Express is loaded with smokeless powder, of course.\n\nThe black-powder 500 was popular in India as a good general-purpose firearm, but was not highly regarded in Africa. However, the later smokeless version was well liked in Africa. This cartridge is similar to the 50-140 Sharps. It would certainly be adequate for any North American big game. Late loadings used smokeless powder, but delivered the same ballistics as the original black-powder load. There is a variety of 50-caliber Lyman bullet moulds available for making cast bullets. This particular cartridge was loaded with 400 grain bullet having a muzzle velocity of 1900 fps and energy levels at 3530 fpe at muzzle.', ''),

(506402, 'FN 5.7x28mm The FN 5.7×28mm is a small-caliber, high-velocity cartridge designed and manufactured by FN Herstal in Belgium. It is a bottlenecked centerfire cartridge that is somewhat similar to the .22 Hornet or .22 K-Hornet. The 5.7×28mm was developed in conjunction with the FN P90 personal defense weapon (PDW) and FN Five-seven pistol, in response to NATO requests for a replacement for the 9×19mm Parabellum cartridge.\nIn 2002 and 2003, NATO conducted a series of tests with the intention of standardizing a PDW cartridge as a replacement for the 9×19mm Parabellum cartridge. The tests compared the relative merits of the 5.7×28mm cartridge and the 4.6×30mm cartridge, which was created by Heckler & Koch as a competitor to the 5.7×28mm. The NATO group subsequently recommended the 5.7×28mm cartridge, citing superior performance in testing, but the German delegation objected and the standardization process was indefinitely halted.\nBy 2006, FN''s 5.7×28mm firearms&#8212;the P90 personal defense weapon and Five-seven pistol&#8212;were in service with military and police forces in over 40 nations throughout the world. In the United States, 5.7×28mm firearms are currently used by numerous law enforcement agencies, including the U.S. Secret Service.\nIn addition to being used in the FN P90 and FN Five-seven firearms, the 5.7×28mm cartridge has subsequently been used in a number of other weapons, such as the AR-57 and FN PS90 carbines. Excel Arms has developed four firearms chambered in 5.7×28mm, and MasterPiece Arms offers three different 5.7×28mm firearms. The 5.7×28mm cartridge itself is produced in a number of varieties, two of which&#8212;the SS195LF and SS197SR&#8212;are currently offered by FN to civilian shooters for use in 5.7×28mm firearms.\n\nThe 5.7×28mm cartridge was designed in response to NATO requests for a replacement for the 9×19mm Parabellum cartridge. According to the NATO requirement, the new cartridge was to have greater range, accuracy, and terminal performance than the 9×19mm cartridge.Additionally, it was to be capable of penetrating body armor. FN Herstal responded to the NATO requirement by developing the 5.7×28mm cartridge and two associated weapons: the FN P90 personal defense weapon (PDW) and FN Five-seven pistol.\nThe original 5.7×28mm cartridge, called the SS90, was introduced in 1990. It used a 1.5 g (23 grain) plastic-core projectile, which it propelled at a muzzle velocity of roughly 850 m/s (2,800 ft/s) when fired from the P90. A United States patent application for the projectile design used in the SS90 was filed by FN''s Jean-Paul Denis and Marc Neuforge in 1989. U.S. Patent 5,012,743 ("High-Performance Projectile") was received in 1991.\n\nThe 5.7×28mm SS90 cartridge was discontinued, and replaced in 1993 with the 5.7×28mm SS190. The SS190 uses a 2.7-mm (0.11 in) shorter projectile with a weight of 2.0 g (31 grains), which it fires from the P90 at a muzzle velocity of roughly 715 m/s (2,350 ft/s). The shorter length of the SS190 projectile allowed it to be more conveniently used in the 5.7×28mm FN Five-seven pistol, which was also being developed at that time.\nIn 1993, FN introduced a modified version of the P90 with a magazine adapted to use the SS190 cartridge. Several specialized 5.7×28mm varieties were also developed alongside the SS190, such as the L191 tracer round and the subsonic SB193 bullet for sound-suppressed use. The 5.7×28mm FN Five-seven pistol then went into production in 1998.\n\n[B]NATO evaluation[/B]\nIn 2002 and 2003, NATO conducted a series of tests with the intention of standardizing a PDW cartridge as a replacement for the 9×19mm Parabellum cartridge. The tests compared the relative merits of the 5.7×28mm cartridge and the HK 4.6×30mm cartridge, which was created by German small arms manufacturer Heckler & Koch as a competitor to the 5.7×28mm. The results of the NATO tests were analyzed by a group formed of experts from Canada, France, the United Kingdom, and the United States, and the group''s conclusion was that the 5.7×28mm was "undoubtedly" the more efficient cartridge.\nAmong other points, the NATO group cited superior effectiveness (27 percent greater) for the 5.7×28mm against unprotected targets and equal effectiveness against protected targets. It also cited less sensitivity to extreme temperatures for the 5.7×28mm, and cited a greater potential risk of barrel erosion with the 4.6×30mm. In addition, the group pointed out that 5.7×28mm is close to the 5.56×45mm NATO by its design and manufacture process, allowing it to be manufactured on existing production lines. The group also pointed out that 5.7×28mm firearms are more mature than 4.6×30mm firearms, and that the 5.7×28mm FN Five-seven pistol was already in production at that time, while the 4.6×30mm Heckler & Koch UCP pistol was only an early concept.\nHowever, the German delegation and others rejected the NATO recommendation that 5.7×28mm be standardized, halting the standardization process indefinitely. As a result, both the 4.6×30mm and 5.7×28mm cartridges (and the associated weapons) have been independently adopted by various NATO countries, according to preference; both the P90 and Five-seven are currently in service with military and police forces in over 40 nations throughout the world.\n\n[B]Present[/B]\nIn 2004, the SS192 hollow-point cartridge was introduced to civilian shooters alongside the new IOM variant of the Five-seven pistol. After being met with controversy, the SS192 variety was discontinued in the same year, and in 2005 the SS196SR variety was introduced using a 2.6 g (40 grain) Hornady V-Max projectile. The SS196 was also shortly discontinued in favor of the newer SS195LF and SS197SR varieties, which are currently offered to civilian shooters for use in 5.7×28mm firearms, followed by the SS198LF variety, which is currently produced but is restricted by FN to military and law enforcement customers.\nFN''s 5.7×28mm ammunition types were briefly manufactured by Olin-Winchester, but today they are only made by FN Herstal in Belgium and (since 2006) Fiocchi in the United States. In 2009, the National Rifle Association added 5.7×28mm firearms to its NRA Tactical Police Competition standards, allowing law enforcement agencies to compete in this event using 5.7×28mm firearms. Starting in 2012, Federal began producing a new 5.7×28mm round for civilian shooters, designated the AE5728A.\n\n[B]Design details[/B]\nThe 5.7×28mm cartridge was designed by FN Herstal specifically for use in the FN P90 personal defense weapon and FN Five-seven pistol.[10] Subsequently, it has been used in a number of other weapons, such as the FN PS90 carbine and the AR-57, an upper receiver for M16/AR-15 rifles. The ST Kinetics CPW can be configured for the 5.7×28mm cartridge by changing the barrel and magazine groups.[28] Excel Arms has developed four firearms chambered in 5.7×28mm, and MasterPiece Arms offers three different 5.7×28mm firearms.\nThe 5.7×28mm cartridge weighs 6.0 g (93 grains)&#8212;roughly half as much as a typical 9×19mm Parabellum cartridge&#8212;making extra ammunition less burdensome, or allowing more ammunition to be carried for the same weight. Since the 5.7×28mm cartridge also has a relatively small diameter, an unusually high number of cartridges can be contained in a magazine. The cartridge has a loud report and produces considerable muzzle flash (when fired from a pistol), but it has roughly 30 percent less recoil than the 9×19mm cartridge, improving controllability. Due to its high velocity, the 5.7×28mm also exhibits an exceptionally flat trajectory.\nOne of the design intents of the SS190 variety of this cartridge was that it have the ability to penetrate Kevlar protective vests&#8212;such as the NATO CRISAT vest&#8212;that will stop conventional pistol bullets. Fired from the P90, the SS190 is capable of penetrating the CRISAT vest at a range of 200 m (219 yd), or a Level IIIA Kevlar vest at the same range. However, sporting variants of the 5.7×28mm are classified by the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) as not armor-piercing.\n\nAccording to FN, the 5.7×28mm cartridge has an effective range of 200 m (219 yd) and a maximum range of 1,800 m (1,969 yd) when fired from the P90,  and an effective range of 50 m (55 yd) and a maximum range of 1,510 m (1,651 yd) when fired from the Five-seven. In testing, the SS190 and similar 5.7×28mm projectiles consistently turn base over point ("tumble") as they pass through ballistic gelatin and other media, using the 21.6-mm (.85 in) projectile length to create a larger wound cavity. However, some are skeptical of the bullet''s terminal performance, and it is a subject of debate among civilian shooters in the United States.\nThe 5.7×28mm projectile potentially poses less risk of collateral damage than conventional pistol bullets, because the projectile design limits overpenetration, as well as risk of ricochet.[36][38][39] The lightweight projectile also poses less risk of collateral damage in the event of a miss, because it loses much of its kinetic energy after traveling only 400 m (437 yd), whereas a conventional pistol bullet such as the 9×19mm retains significant energy beyond 800 m (875 yd). This range exceeds the engagement distances expected for the 5.7×28mm cartridge''s intended applications, so the cartridge''s limited energy at long range is not conversely considered to be disadvantageous.\nSince the 5.7×28mm SS190 projectile does not rely on fragmentation or the expansion of a hollow-point bullet, the cartridge (and 5.7×28mm firearms) are considered suitable for military use under the Hague Convention of 1899, which prohibits the use of expanding bullets in warfare.\nFN''s 5.7×28mm cartridge cases are covered with a special polymer coating for easier extraction with the PS90 carbine due to the high chamber pressures and lack of case tapering. In addition, this coating ensures proper feeding and function in the magazines.\n\n[B]SS90 prototype[/B]\nThe SS90 was an early prototype round used only in the earliest examples of the P90. It used a lightweight 1.5-g (23 grain) full metal jacket bullet with a polymer core, which it propelled at a muzzle velocity of roughly 850 m/s (2,800 ft/s). The SS90 was abandoned in 1994 in favor of the heavier and 2.7-mm (0.11 in) shorter SS190 projectile.\n[B]\nSS190 duty[/B]\nThe SS190 FMJ, a refinement of the SS90, was introduced in 1993. It offered superior performance over the prototype projectile as well as slightly reduced length. The latter change allowed it to be used more conveniently in the Five-seven pistol also being developed at that time. Fired from the P90, the SS190 propels a 2.0-g (31 grain) bullet at a muzzle velocity of roughly 715 m/s (2,350 ft/s). It has a steel penetrator and an aluminum core. The SS190 has been manufactured with a plain, black, or black-on-white tip color.[15][41][42] It is classified by the ATF as armor-piercing (AP) ammunition, and its sale is currently restricted by FN to military and law enforcement customers.\nIn testing done by Houston Police Department SWAT, the SS190 fired from the P90 into bare ballistic gelatin exhibited penetration depths ranging from 28 to 34 cm (11 to 13.5 in). In testing in 1999 by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP), the SS190 fired from the P90 at a distance of 25 m (27 yd) exhibited an average penetration depth of 25 cm (9.85 in) in ballistic gelatin after passing through a Level II kevlar vest.\n[B]\nL191 tracer[/B]\nThe L191 (also formerly called the SS191)   is a tracer cartridge designed for easier bullet spotting in dim light. Combustible chemicals packed in the rear of the L191 projectile create a light trail visible up to 200 m (219 yd). The L191 has been manufactured with a red or red-on-black tip. The performance and trajectory of the L191 is identical to the SS190.  For this reason, it is also classified by the ATF as armor-piercing ammunition, and its sale is currently restricted by FN to military and law enforcement customers.\n\n[B]SS192 hollow-point[/B]\nThe SS192 was discontinued in late 2004. It used a 1.8 g (28 grain) hollow point bullet with a copper jacket and an aluminum core. The projectile had a length of 21.6 mm (.85 in).  It had an unmarked hollow nose with a depth of 7.6 mm (0.3 in) and a 0.8-mm (0.03 in) opening. The SS192 was classified by the ATF as not armor-piercing, and in testing by FNH USA it did not penetrate a Level IIIA vest when fired from the Five-seven.\n\n[B]SB193 subsonic[/B]\nThe SB193 (also formerly called the SS193) is a subsonic cartridge featuring a 3.6-g (55 grain) Sierra Game King FMJBT (Full Metal Jacket Boat Tail) projectile. The SB193''s low muzzle velocity eliminates the distinctive "crack" created by supersonic rounds, and when used in conjunction with a sound suppressor, the muzzle report is also reduced. Due to the greatly decreased muzzle velocity, the SB193 benefits from a slightly reduced recoil force of 1.3 kgm/s.[44] The SB193 can be identified by its white tip color. Its sale is currently restricted by FN to military and law enforcement customers.\n\n[B]T194 training[/B]\nThe T194 training round was discontinued in 2002. It could be considered an early version of the SS192 or SS195. It used the same 1.8-g (28 grain) copper-jacketed aluminum core bullet, propelled at the same muzzle velocity.  It had a green painted tip.\n\n[B]SS195LF (lead free)[/B]\nThe SS195LF is a commercially available cartridge that features a lead-free primer and produces ballistics similar to the SS192 round, which it replaced in late 2004.  It uses the same 1.8-g (28 grain) copper-jacketed aluminum core bullet as the SS192, and it can be identified by the unmarked, hollow void at the tip and the silver-colored primer. The SS195 is classified by the ATF as not armor-piercing, and it is currently manufactured by FN Herstal in Belgium.\n\n[B]SS196SR (sporting round)[/B]\nThe SS196SR was introduced in 2005 and it is now discontinued in favor of the SS197SR cartridge.  It featured a lead core 2.6-g (40 grain) Hornady V-Max bullet which it propelled at a muzzle velocity of roughly 500 m/s (1,650 ft/s) when fired from the Five-seven.  The polycarbonate tip used in the V-Max bullet acts as a wedge, enhancing expansion of the bullet. The SS196 was classified by the ATF as not armor-piercing, and in testing by FNH USA it did not penetrate a Level II vest when fired from the Five-seven.  The SS196 can be identified by its red polymer tip.\n[B]\nSS197SR (sporting round)[/B]\nThe SS197SR is currently offered to civilian shooters in addition to the SS195LF.  It uses the same lead core 2.6-g (40 grain) Hornady V-Max projectile as the SS196SR,  but it is loaded for a muzzle velocity roughly 30-m/s (100 ft/s) higher. The projectile has a blue-colored polymer tip instead of the red color used in the SS196 projectile tip.  The SS197 has been manufactured by Fiocchi under contract for FN Herstal since 2006 and it is distributed in the United States by Federal Cartridge Company.\n\n[B]SS198LF (lead free)[/B]\nThe SS198LF uses the same lead-free projectile and primer as the SS195LF,  but propels it at roughly 30-m/s (100 ft/s) higher muzzle velocity. It has a green painted tip, and its sale is currently restricted by FN to military and law enforcement customers. \n[B]\nAmerican Eagle (AE5728A) TMJ[/B]\nSince 2012, Federal Cartridge Company produces a 5.7×28mm round under their American Eagle brand.  Designated the AE5728A, this cartridge uses a 40-grain Total Metal Jacket (TMJ) projectile, that is atypical in that it does not use a copper plated bullet; sectioned pictures show a very thick full copper jacket. The AE5728A casings are of FN manufacture, and the muzzle velocity is slightly lower than that of the SS197SR.[citation needed]\n[B]\nNon-FN ammunition[/B]\nElite Ammunition manufactures a wide variety of reloaded 5.7×28mm ammunition offerings.  Belgian ammunition manufacturer VBR-Belgium has also developed specialized 5.7×28mm projectiles designed for armor penetration and controlled fragmentation.\nHandloading is possible with 5.7×28mm ammunition, and 5.7-mm (.224 in) bullets are widely available due to use in .223 Remington and 5.56×45mm NATO cartridges. Handloaders have noted that the 5.7×28mm cartridge is very sensitive to small changes in powder charge or overall length (OAL) with a bullet inserted. Bullets weighing 2.6 g (40 grains) or less are recommended for optimal use in 5.7×28mm applications, but the 1:231 mm (1:9.1 in) rifling twist rate (distance the bullet must travel to complete one full revolution) used in the firearms'' barrels will stabilize bullets weighing up to 4.5 g (70 grains)\n\n[B]Controversy[/B]\nThe FN Five-seven pistol and FN 5.7×28mm ammunition were originally restricted by FN to military and law enforcement customers, but in 2004 the new Five-seven IOM variant was introduced, and offered to civilian shooters for use with SS192 ammunition. FNH USA has marketed the Five-seven to civilian shooters as a pistol suitable for personal protection, target shooting, and similar uses, but the Five-seven''s introduction to civilian shooters was strongly opposed by U.S. gun control organizations such as the Brady Campaign; by the end of 2004, sales of the Five-seven pistol had increased dramatically.\nIn early 2005, the pistol was subject to intense controversy in the United States after the Brady Campaign stated that commercially available SS192 ammunition penetrated a Level IIA Kevlar vest in testing. The National Rifle Association (NRA) shortly countered the Brady Campaign''s claim by pointing out that the gun control group may not have adhered to standard testing procedures, and that FN only offers armor-piercing varieties of the 5.7×28mm cartridge to military and law enforcement customers.[15][52] Varieties offered to civilians are classified by the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) as not armor-piercing, and it was stated that the SS192 and SS196 cartridge variations were unable to penetrate various types of Kevlar vests in tests conducted by FNH USA.\nThe Five-seveN has been loved and hated in the years since its introduction. It is one of the most controversial handguns of our time, and was so even before the Fort Hood atrocity.\n&#8212;Massad Ayoob, On Target magazine\nMichael D. Barnes, then-president of the Brady Campaign, responded to the NRA''s statements on the Five-seven by challenging NRA Executive Vice President Wayne LaPierre to be shot with the pistol while wearing a Kevlar vest. The NRA again attacked the Brady Campaign''s statements, saying that "Barnes demonstrated his group''s complete and utter disregard for gun safety and its flaming zeal to further restrict the rights of law-abiding gun owners." In the same year, two pieces of legislation were introduced in the United States Congress, specifically targeting the Five-seven pistol and 5.7×28mm ammunition for a federal ban: the H.R. 1136: PLEA Act was introduced in the House of Representatives by Rep. Eliot Engel (D-NY), and the S. 527: PLEA Act was introduced in the Senate by Sen. Frank Lautenberg (D-NJ); neither bill proceeded to a vote by the House or Senate.\nIn March 2007, legislation was again introduced in the United States Congress by Rep. Engel, under the new designation H.R. 1784: PLEA Act. Once again, the bill failed to proceed to a vote. In the following years, the Five-seven was subject to further controversy due to reports of the pistol''s use by drug cartels in the Mexican Drug War. In the United States, the Five-seven has never been used to kill a police officer, but various news sources such as The Boston Globe and La Jornada reported incidents in which the pistol was used to shoot and kill police officers or civilians in Mexico. According to the ATF, the Five-seven is one of the weapons favored by drug cartels in the Mexican Drug War, and smuggled Five-seven pistols can sell for up to $5,000 in Mexico. From Mexico, the pistols have been smuggled into other South American countries; in a July 2010 drive-by shooting in Envigado, Colombia, two cartel gunmen armed with Five-seven pistols opened fire on a group of bystanders outside a nightclub, leaving 9 people dead and 10 wounded.\nIn November 2009, the Five-seven again became subject to intense controversy in the United States, following the Fort Hood shooting at Fort Hood military base, in Texas. A U.S. Army psychiatrist, Major Nidal Malik Hasan, reportedly opened fire on fellow soldiers with a Five-seven pistol, killing 13 and wounding 29 in the worst shooting ever to take place on an American military base. Shortly after the shooting, FNH USA responded with a fact sheet dismissing allegations about the nature of the pistol, pointing out that it is only offered to civilians with sporting ammunition. Later in the month, a number of gun control organizations such as the Brady Campaign wrote a collaborative letter to U.S. President Barack Obama, citing the weapon''s reported use by the Fort Hood shooter and Mexican drug cartels, and calling on him to ban importation of the Five-seven pistol and 5.7×28mm ammunition. In July 2010, legislation was introduced in the United States Congress by Rep. Engel, for a third time, under the new designation H.R. 6030: PLEA Act. Like its previous incarnations, the H.R. 6030 bill failed to proceed to a vote by either the House of Representatives or Senate.', ''),
(506403, '32 Short The 32 Short rimfire originated under a Smith & Wesson patent of 1860, and early cartridge boxes were so marked. It was first used in Smith & Wesson New Model #1 1/2, and #2 revolvers. It was later adapted to Colt revovlers and handguns with names such as Allen, Blue Jacket, Enterprise, Favorite, Whitney, X. L. and many, many others. It was also used in a variety of rifles including Remington Stevens and Winchester. It was loaded and listed in catalogs up to 1972-1973.\n\nRifles and pistols using 32 Short rimfire were fairly popular up to the early 1900s. Stevens single shot rifles were available in this caliber as late as 1936. There must be tens of thousands of guns around for this cartridge. It actually was a good small game caliber out to about 50 yards as it would kill cleanly with hits in the forward body area and not spoil a bit of meat. Accuracy is not outstanding, but quite adequate for field use. However, the ammunition costs enough more than the 22 Long Rifle to be a consideration in choosing a rimfire gun. The 32 rimfire is obsolete. Original lad has as 80-grain bullet and 9 grains of black-powder.', ''),

Asking 45k. he had obligingly attached a laser as well.  Now 45k for a PT 92 is a very good deal indeed. Too good in fact. So I asked him the inevitable “is it local” question. \r\n\r\nHe replied to the effect that the parts are original Brazilian. I was a bit taken aback. How exactly did he get parts here? “Oh, from Afghanistan.”\r\nPersonaly I never knew the Brazilians exported Taurus parts to Afghanistan for reasons best known to them.\r\n\r\nMe: Err this looks remarkably like the products sold at the nearby Royal arms co factory outlet\r\nHim: Oh  no those cheap guns are manufactured in Pakistan… Proberly Peshawar\r\nMe: And this gun?\r\nHim: The parts are made in Afghanistan Sir.\r\n\r\nMe:Umm Ok enough of that now show me some shotguns\r\n\r\nHe showed me a Vepr 12 clone hybrid with a ak 47 type down wards folding skeleton stock and plastic drum magazine equipped with a laser. Nice.  I mean really nice lookin weapon. Asking 45k \r\n\r\nHim: The weapon too was assembled with parts made in Afghanistan.” Actualy( He told me in a confidential whisper)  it was an Afghan tank. \r\nMe: It was a what?? :O\r\nHim::A tank. U know a lot em were scrapped and U know sir. tank metal is very very solid so “They” made shotguns out of em.\r\n\r\nI remember reading on the backs of rickshaws. “main bara ho kay pajero Banoun gaa” (When I grow up I wil become a Pajero SUV) But a tank that grew up to become a "shotgun”….. If tanks have souls the poor thing must be in purgatory!\r\n\r\nMe: (Under my breath) it must have been a really naughty tank indeed.. \r\nHim: eh? What?\r\n\r\nMe: I mean it came back as a shotgun.. Must have done some really mean things in its previous life as a tank to deserve being re-incarnated as a shotgun.\r\n\r\nBut I coud see it was lost on him… \r\n\r\nThen I saw an Akdal M 1919. At least it looked like an Akdal M 1919. Very realistic looking weapon. But for the fact that someone had forgotten to put in a peep hole in the rear sight!! \r\n\r\nI loved the magazines though. 7 round capacity At around 3.5K a piece if they fit the original m1919 and work well they should be a real bargain. Looked pretty well made too. \r\nMe: how much is it for\r\nHim: (The by now ubiquitous) 45k \r\nMe: Turkish? \r\nHim: Oh no. Turks don’t know the ABCs of making guns. This is made\r\nMe: with afghan tank parts.. yes yes I know. But where. I mean is it made in Afghanistan or Peshawar or Darra? \r\nHim: Its made at the border.. The afghans send over the parts and there are factories at the border that turn em into guns.. \r\n\r\nI took a deep breath and tried to force the image of afghans ruthlessly assaulting and plundering  poor, helpless tanks and after dismembering em.. making bundles of their parts and surreptitiously throwing em over the border where those parts were caught and turned to guns right across the border…\r\n\r\nMe:So this akdal and Vepr clone. Can they fire slugs. \r\nHim: Oh u can fire a thousand of em if u want. The guns can handle it. .. \r\nMe:  A local offering that can actually handle slugs???\r\nHim: Oh we guarantee it… \r\n\r\nI guess it could. After all it was a Tank masquerading as a shotgun.\r\n\r\nOK whats that? I asked looking at a big M4 type of assault weapon. \r\nHim: That’s an M4 in .30 calibre complete with red dot and laser aiming module asking 85k without accessories. And 2 25 round mags included.\r\nDamn that thing looked good!\r\n\r\nZain bhai took a look\r\nZain bhai: its on a PB license right?\r\nHim: No not at all its NPB since it’s a pistol.\r\nZain bhai:That thing? A Pistol?? does that mean that the barrel is in fact a shotgun like appendage without threading.\r\nHim: oh no sir its threaded through out just like a real M 4\r\nZain bhai: And it’s a pistol?\r\nHim: yes of course the MOI has given instructions that ALL pistol calibers are in fact pistols irrespective of barrel size.\r\n\r\nNow that thing was waay bigger than the MP 5 which in our humble opinion is definitely PB irrespective of whether its semi or full auto. Due to the length of its barrel.  Now this thing was much much bigger then an MP 5.. Yet it was NPB..  And made right across the border from parts scavenged from those unfortunate tanks. \r\nAnd 85k at that.. Tank or no tank this is the most expensive (un branded).30 I have ever seen here in Karachi..\r\nZain Bhai: Are u sure its legel?\r\nHim: If it were not legal sir how would we be selling it? \r\nCant really argue with the man’s logic now can U?\r\n\r\nBy this time Zain bhai had enough.. He got up and decided to wait outside. As for me. .. the best was yet to come..\r\nI said that I wanted something cheaper. So he showed me something cheaper.  \r\nA “Zafar” berretta 92 clone.  Now Zafar Alam has a reputation for making some of the best copies of the berretta here in Pakistan. In fact he was amongst the pioneers of berretta copy makers here.\r\nHim: No not Zafar alam. But Zafar. \r\nMe: But isn’t Zafar Alam a gunsmith? (I had no idea that Zafar alam was something like a rock group that split apart with both Zafar and Alam making their own brands….)\r\nHim: No No this is another Zafar that makes guns as good as Zafar Alam\r\n\r\nHe was in effect trying to sell me a copy of a copy and made by someone who had even copied the actual copier’s name!! 30k  final price\r\nAn ‘original’ copy (even though the term’s an oxymoron) made by Zafar Alam goes for around 25k or so.  I tried out his copy\\s copy and the decocker jammed on me at the first attempt.  Now that’s a problem that I have never encountered in a betty clone. After the TT the local gunsmiths have perfected this design. And such faults may be common in their Zegana copies but never their berretas. \r\nBesides that, the firing pin looked pretty badly made. Kind of like an over sized darning needle that had been broken off in the middle. \r\nI asked him for an SS finish. Now this one was waay nicer.. A real firing pin and very light. Much much lighter than any other betty clone I have seen in the market. On top of that.  The control lever was smoother and silkier then Ashweriya rai’s ebony tresses ..  A worthy copy’s copy. Final 32k \r\nHowever I have seen the same quality (if not better) with NFAC and GHA products. (Both betty copy makers of some repute)\r\nI asked for something stil cheaper and he showed me a Himalya arms co’s local 9mm wanna be zegana clone.  18k..  I have seen the same weapon at HM Traders a few yards down the road. Asking 13k Negotiable. \r\n\r\nBy this time Zain bhai had started calling me outside.. So I decided to call it a day. But not before I took the price of Chinese red box ammo. He was retailing at Rs. 35 a pop.. Irrespective of weather u bought 1 box or a crate.  He was also willing to make a 144 permit for 6 months for Rs. 4k[/QUOTE]\r\n\r\nOne word...TRANSFORMERS :-D lol Tank Converted into Shortyyyy', ''),

(506476, '500 Rimless Jeffery [FONT=&quot]Adapted by Jeffery for his bolt-action magazine rifles based on the Mauser action. This 500 was a proprietary cartridge developed by Schuler in Germany for bolt-action rifles. It has rebated, or undercut, rim of smaller diameter than the base to fit the standard-diameter Mauser bolt. In Germany, the same cartridge was loaded as the 12.7x70mm Schuler and also chambered in Mauser-type rifles.[/FONT]\n  [FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n  [FONT=&quot]The 500 Jeffery is very similar to the 505 Gibbs, but it has shorter case and is loaded to higher velocity and energy. It was designed to provide the man who preffered the repeating rifle, or who couln''t afford a double, with the same killing power as some of the popular rimmed cartridges. The 500 Jeffery is the most powerful cartridge used in any of the British magazine rifles. Until the introduction of the 460 Weatherby, it was the most powerful magazine rifle cartridge in the world. However, the Weatherby develops 8245 fpe of muzzle energy as opposed to 6800 fpe for the Jeffery with 535-grain bullet leaving the muzzle at 2400 fps. The 500 Jeffery is considered quite adequate for any large or dangerous African game under any condition. It is quite accurate, and a good shot who can handle the recoil can get 100-yard groups of 2 inches or less. Needless to say, this is another caliber greatly overpowered for North American game. Most shooters claim the apparent recoil of 500 Jeffery magazine rifles is less than that of similar-calibered double rifles.[/FONT][FONT=&quot][/FONT]', ''),

(506565, ' @Faisji Good answer.\n\nI have [B]no [/B]reason to believe this incident is cooked but I think the response by brothers is not correct and they have been misguided by seniors. I repeatedly have been saying all along that make comments/offer suggestions that are [B]RESULT [/B]oriented. Testing, court cases etc etc solve nothing instead only spoil it for the brothers involved, the company and the gun community at large. It also leaves a bad taste in everyone mouth and quite frankly I personally have been disappointed at how our community approached this whole incident. This was not the educated way to handle this situation. I believe that if a problem is being solved amicablely and with friendship why resort to other more ugly means. \n\nApart from the initial miscommunication between both parties I think the company did a good job of branching out to the gun owner and community as a whole. I must appreciate that Caracal offered to do the following which were all rejected.\n\na). Replace the gun without inspecting it immediately free of cost and offering the brother involved in the incident an all expense paid trip to the factory to advise them in person.\n\nb). Send over the gun to the factory for analysis and they would get any 9mm replacement Caracal of their choice.\n\nc). Get an immediate CASH refund plus Rs. 30,000 in medical expenses. \n\nWhat is wrong with this picture ?  Regardless of anyone''s educational/financial level these were all really good offers.\n\nAnyway, personally I felt quite embarrassed by this whole incident as I went out of my way to help and the manufacturer readily agreed to whatever I was requesting out of friendship/respect and regard for our gun community. What I did not know was that our expectations were not that the gun would be replaced but that our understanding of firearm malfunctions is that when a firearm breaks it''s magically transported into the heavens by fairies on unicorns and as soon as they disappear into the clouds, cases of Gold and Silver float down for all to be merry with.', ''),

It seems that we unknowingly and unwillingly became part of some defamation campaign. It seems that there is some kind of conspiracy against Caracal in Pakistan. Yesterday, I reported that I heard another incident of slide failure. I have shared the details with AK47 Bro. Though I could not get the details but the story line is the same just with change of location of incident. The slide was broken from same place and operator got the same injury and so on.\n\n\nAnother interesting fact, I have been visiting Baksh Elahi on almost every alternate Saturday. I categorically asked them about the incident but they informed that nobody came to them with any such complaint.\n\nWhy such reports are not coming from USA where people normally fire +P round? I think they fire more ammo on average than us.\n\nWhatever it is but I don''t see any effort by Caracal Pakistan to control the damage. On the other hand, we are left on our own to draw the conclusion. Isn''t it ironic?[/QUOTE]\n\n\nWhy Khan Brothers are not cooperating now? They wanted to get heard and we made them heard. If you remember, they said, they never received any reply from Caracal. While, Caracal Pakistan provided proof that they replied.\n\nWell, This is trully a million dollars question - why the khan brothers after mobilizing are hiding behind the curtains. If we do the complete analysis of their first email which they sent to Cracal and posted by them it shows their motive. It is quiet clear now that they were not concerned about the community, they were trying to collect some goodies - what a shame. I have been reading posts here and then finally was compelled to reply. I have gone through every reply here for two days. I now understand why the caracal people were crying here and asking the logical questions. It is really hard to undersstand why khan brothers waited 3 months to report the incident - why in their email to caracal they didn''t write their contact details. If God Forbid - tht was me - I wouldn''t hide like women, I would be giving out my numbers loudly and I will be standing at the door of the dealer who sold me this weapon first thing in the morning. And here we find that they never contacted Baksh Elahi. Oh oh oh - another one, caracal pakistan in their email claimed that Khan Brothers has sent the purchase receipt from Chaudhry arms which till today Khan brothers never contradicted. I would like khan brothers to day to answer here - did you send the receipt from Chaudhry arms to caracal or not ? or they are making this up tooooo... Plz answer khan brothers.[/quote]', ''),

(506661, ' [B]@Faisji..........[/B].+100\n\n[B]@Chief...........+100![/B]\n\nChief has been very sincere in trying to resolve this affair amicably and with a very positive approach towards both parties. I was looking forward to maturity of the 1.st resolve agreed upon initially. It''s sad that our dear Khan bros did not stretch out the cooperative hand. I hope they do so on better retrospection, since their call was heard and responded to favorably by Caracal with Chief''s involvement.\n\nNow, about the mistrust existing. Let me just know what withholding the handgun from mutually assisted investigations would yield or deny the owners? Another handgun? It''s promised already. Medical coverage? it''s promised already. Other compensations within reasonable limits? I trust Caracal wouldn''t mind taking this into consideration too. Now, what''s the issue then? Oh, yeah, Caracal could back off with a statement that it wasn''t a Caracal handgun involved at all, but a clone of some sort, right? Well, this is a morbid presumption, honestly. We can present the handgun and take a written statement from them that it was an original Caracal involved/handed over, coz verifying the originality of the handgun is a minutes job, not requiring any labs at all. Then, what''s left, tell me? What''s the fear about? Losing the evidence to drag them to courts? Machinery can fail anytime, and since when did any manufacturer claim that their product wouldn''t/couldn''t fail technically, or since when did we ever before hear about written guarantees from manufacturers that their production guns would be 100% "[I] kaboom proof[/I] "?  At the max there''s a product warranty dispensed in favor of the user and that one is already present here. So? What now? \n\nFrankly speaking, the withholding of the handgun and consequent delay of final findings is putting other Caracal owners around the globe into uncertainty about their handguns. May I also state that only 50 % of the evidence here is the handgun. The remaining 50% consist of the ammunition involved. I hope sincerely for the best outcome of the physical findings here, that these latter 50% can be established as[I] constant[/I] as well!!  \n\n I am humbly of the opinion that the two parties should join hands willingly and conclude this matter in the best interest of all. As for now, the ball seems to be in the courtyard of our respected KKhan brothers. Let''s put it back to the courtyard of Caracal.\n\n I also appreciate Chief''s effort - in goodwill gesture- Caracal should cooperatively replace Pakistani C owners with new ones, as to also address the preceding issue with the drop safety. We''ve suffered the uncertainty from that one too.\n\nLet''s see some progress.\n\n\nRegards.', ''),

(506674, ' [QUOTE=Topak;343805]Thanks TRX, you are welcome. Will you share your modifications or creation ?[/QUOTE]\n\n Certainly.  I jumped into building guns as a hobby.  I already had a modest machine shop with a vertical mill, a lathe, and other basic tools.  I have started a dozen-odd projects and work on them as time and interest allow.  If I didn''t have so many different builds started I would get finished faster, but there''s no reason to get in a hurry.\n\n Most of the builds I''ve completed or am working on are semiautomatic rifles.  However, for basic gunsmithing, I have a pair of Canadian-made bolt action rifles that I assembled from pieces.  The Long Branch SMLE was a receiver and barrel I bought from a guy who was going to use it to make a lamp stand (!?).  I have installed a 20" barrel chambered in .45-70 and acquired all the pieces needed to assemble a working rifle, except for the magazine, which I still have to make.    The other rifle is a 1905 Ross straight-pull, also obtained as a barreled receiver.  I am in the process of rebarreling it to a 6.5mm cartridge, basically a .303 British necked down to 6.5.  I still have to make some attachments to my lathe to cut the barrel threads; the Ross uses a very strange left-hand thread on the barrel.  I have a blue laminated target stock that I have to inlet to accept the Ross action.  \n\n I have a much more ambitious project - I''m making an accurate copy of an AMT Auto Mag, a rather rare .44 caliber automatic pistol made in the 1970s.  I managed to get a partial set of blueprints from the original designer, and examples of the parts I didn''t get the prints for.  The Auto Mag was designed to be made by investment casting, so some of the machining is very complex.  So far, I''m still working on tooling upgrades... I thought I was a pretty good machinist, but the Auto Mag is showing me I''m not as good as I thought I was.  I expect to finish it in a couple more years.\n\n In the meantime, I have a scratchbuilt rifle project.  It''s a single shot bullpup called a Maadi-Griffin, from some plans that were available a few years ago.  It''s a very simple design, set up to fire the big .50 BMG cartridge.  I acquired a rifled 12 gauge barrel, and I''m building it in "12 Gauge From Hell" instead.  Technically it''s a .720 caliber rifle, but due to the way the law works here, legally it''s a 12 gauge shotgun.  No, it doesn''t make any sense to me either; we''re dealing with politics, not engineering.\n\n I have a bunch of sketches of other things I want to build, but right now I''m putting all my time into the Auto Mag, except for finishing up the rifles when I''m tired of working on the pistol.  The other unfinished projects are mostly boxed up and put aside at the moment.\n\n I have more enthusiasm than skill, but I''m having a lot of fun!', ''),

[/B]\n The move comes after the apex court’s orders on the implementation of  the Karachi violence case – on October 6, 2011, it had made a number of  recommendations to the provincial government so that bloodshed could be  curbed. They included cleansing the city of weapons and making  amendments to the Arms Act, 1965. The apex court has fixed another  hearing on the matter for February 25.\n Moving the bill, law minister Ayaz Soomro said, “We have made this  legislation on the Supreme Court’s directives, given the extortion  incidents, terrorism and deteriorating law and order in Karachi.” In  their speeches, most MPAs reiterated the need to deweaponise not only  Karachi, but the rest of the province as well.\n [B]The new policy [/B]\n Under the new law, the age limit for acquiring a firearms licence has  been increased from 18 to 25 years. Another significant change is that  possessing a weapon without a licence will now be treated as a  non-bailable offence, contrary to the previous Arms Act 1965, under  which it was a bailable offense.\n [IMG]http://pullquotesandexcerpts.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/wasim-aftab.jpg?w=625[/IMG]\n While talking to [I]The Express Tribune[/I], law secretary Ghulam  Nabi Shah said, “Under the new policy, the licence will only be issued  to people who either have permanent residence certificates of the  province or can prove that they belong to Sindh by other means. We will  verify whether the applicant is a permanent resident or not.” He added  that law enforcers arrest many people who possess illegal weapons but  release them soon after. “But now, they [police] will be legally bound  to refer the accused to a magistrate.”\n Arms licences will not be issued to those people who have been  convicted of any offence or possess more than one CNIC or passport. The  punishment for possessing illegal weapons has been increased to 14  years, in addition to a hefty fine. Nobody is allowed to carry weapons  outside their homes without having the licence on them. Any licence  holder who provides others with their weapons to commit unlawful acts  can be imprisoned for 10 years.\n [B]Hot and cold[/B]\n Muttahida Qaumi Movement’s Wasim Aftab has lauded the move, adding  that his party has been advocating tighter checks in the process of  issuing licences. “We welcome this decision and hope the government will  implement it properly,” he told [I]The Express Tribune[/I].\n But not everybody is happy. Bashir Jan, the general secretary of  Awami National Party’s Sindh chapter, said the government should clarify  the “permanent” residents clause. “We came from Khyber Pakhtunkhawa,  but have been living in Karachi before Pakistan was created. We want to  know whether we meet this particular criteria or not,” he said. “Our  party has already endorsed the idea of deweaponising Karachi. But it  must be applied to everyone.”\n [I]Published in The Express Tribune, February [/I][I]22[SUP]nd[/SUP], 2013.[/I]', ''),

(507027, 'You can''t go wrong with a .308win A cartridge I h''ve always been soft on is the .308 Winchester.I slew my first and best sambar buck with a .308.I slew more than a dozen NEELGUYS'' in River ghagra,fortabbas area in 1992-1995 with .308.The second most accurate rifle I h''ve ever owned was a .308.The first sporting-weight big-game rifle from which I managed\nto extract a genuine sub-one-inch group average was reamed to .308. I used it extensively on wild boars.Lots of memories.\nOlin managed to attach its Winchester name to the 7.62*51 NATO cartridge---for which Armed forces chambered the ill-fated but excellent M-14 IN 1952.Good move.since that day it has felled a mountain of big game,set a covey of world records in all types of centerfire rifle competitions (including bench rest),gained following among the paramilitary sect second only to the .223 Remington,sold many a sporting rifle of every action type,been accepted by police for special assignments and spawned a family tree that includes such popular loads as .243,which is really a necked-down .308.Not bad for an unassuming little cartridge that''s impeccably mannered in every way.\n       Original military specs for the 30-06 mentioned a 152-grain ball at a nominal 2''700 fps.The .308 was hailed as equaling those numbers,despite being one-half inch shorter.it did so by using a new spherical propellant,plus being loaded to a bit high pressures than was the ''ought six.\n         There has been a multitude of factory of factory loads for the .308,in bullets weights running from 55 grains upto 200.In the middle are the 110,125,130,147,150,165,168 and 180s.Even the 30-06 can''t boast such an array of choices,\n          The 150-grain version is listed at 2''820fps;the 165 is shown as reaching 2''700;the 180-grain soft point are said to achieve 2''620 fps.Good solid ballistics,not only for urial size animal,but heavier game as well.\n           Since the .308''s competition record is well known, there is little point in dwelling on accuracy.The cartridge itself is superbly accurate one;obviously in a properly-bedded rifle.In my experience,even some semiautos will print five-shot groups of 1 1/2 inches for an average.Most turn bolts will stay under 1 1/4 inches or less;heavy barreled models often group inside three-quarter of an inch.\n           This cartridge handles the bulk of big game hunting up to 300 yards or so.Although one of the pimary reasons I chose the .308 is identitical to that for the .223--- inexpensive and readily available ammunition---the short .30 can stand on its own merits.\n           Being of modest length,the .308 will work through short bolt actions quite nicely.IT offers scant room for legitimate complaints.Out to the 300 yards mark,it shows within an inch or two of the drop attainable from the very flattest-shooting cartridges in its class,such as .270 winchester or 30-06.while it yields a few paltry foot-pounds of energy to such as the .284 Winchester and 30-06, it still carries plenty of of steam to kill cleanly any game for which the foregoing pair is suited.what does that include?deer,hog deer,sambar buck,urial,markhor,ibex,wild boar,neel gaiy,sheep,etc.The .308''s all that''s necessray for a quick dispatch.Bullet weights up through 200 grains can be handled at suffiocient velocities to enable sure hitting at all reasonable ranges.\n       The .308''s not the powerhouse of its class,but the jack-of-all trades.\n       Considering all the above,plus the relatively benign recoil levels,the availability of inexpensive 7.62*51 surplus ammo in our country,you will probably agree that you can''t go wrong with a .308 WINCHESTER.', ''),

Two motorcyclists came up and threatened him with a pistol. The guy racked the slide and told him to hand over his mobile and any cash. Of course he handed it over and they left.\n\nWhen he came home he was upset and told me "I could have fought them, perhaps the gun was fake". I asked him how did the gun sound when the slide was racked and he replied "similar to our pistol". I then told him he did the right thing, a mobile phone is just not worth losing one''s life over.\n\nIf I were armed and were sure that the BG only wanted some money or a phone, I would hand it over. If I thought they were intending to shoot / kidnap me or my family, I would perhaps open fire. If I opened fire I would not shoot to wound, I would shoot to stop the threat.\n\nDue to the complicated legal and police dealings after such an incident, I would be very choosy when deciding to shoot.\n\nAsif, I think you did the right thing.

It was not a trivial task for me, although not that bad either considering what goes on in police stations.\n\nFirst time I went there, I was told to go to a particular room. The relevant person was not in the seat and I had to wait outside. One of the sipahi''s was dealing with a young fellow supposedly caught near a khokha where illicit drugs were being sold. The sipahi was slapping, pulling the hair and making this guy do sit ups (not a pleasant sight at all). Any way I had to go back home as I was told to try another time.\n\nIn short, I made 3-4 visits to find the relevant person.

But the one in the market only had serial number on side of upper receiver. \nWanted to check with friends would have bought to please confirm that there in local market 1919 comes with out chokes and serial number is only on one place. Also i would be grateful if someone can share recent purchase price and name of dealer in Karachi.', ''),
(629076, ' Hmmm, no one replied for four years...\n\nOK, I will give it a go, and others can chime in to correct me if they think I am wrong.\n\nThe maritime spring cups replace the standard spring cups on the striker assembly. They have channels to allow water to go through when the striker moves forward to strike the primer of the bullet. If water is not allowed to go through without resistance, the striker will move slower and could result in a light strike on the primer, and there could be a misfire.\n\nSo, with the maritime spring cups you have a better chance of shooting reliably under water. One thing to be careful about, water is much denser than air of course, so the sound of the shot is very loud (denser medium, less attenuation of sound amplitude at the same distance). Do NOT submerge your head while shooting underwater, unless you have hearing protection. You could damage your hearing with just a couple of shots.\n\nDue to the water being denser than air, the bullet will not go very far. I don''t know the exact range, but I have seen people do videos on youtube and the bullet did not even travel the full length of the swimming pool where they were doing this experiment.\n\nApologies for resurrecting an old thread, but being a new member I really really wanted to post and discuss something :D', ''),

This option will allow a guard to use weapon to protect the company''s business. The advantage is that you can change guard.\n\nThe other option is that the guard have his oown licenses weapon. If you are going to give him weapon, it will be legally his weapon and you cannot take it back.\n\nYou cannot give your weapon (license in your name) to your gaurd to protect your business.

All our products are thoroughly tested before leaving the factory. Those tests include firing with overpressure ammunition as per international regulations.  \nBy performing those tests on each and every pistol we make sure that there is no material failure. In your particular case we have to look into the causes of the incident which could include issues with the ammunition.\n\nTherefore we would like to get back the pistol as well as ammunition from the batch you have used during firing for technical investigations.\nWe will strongly work with you together to find the cause and, after getting the results, decide with you on the way forward.\nUntil those results available, we would like to ask you for your valuable cooperation by passing to us the items and information we need and also we would like to ask you for your patience.\n\nPlease use the following address for further communication on this case [EMAIL="customerservice@caracal.ae"]customerservice@caracal.ae[/EMAIL]\n \nAs mentioned before, we take customer safety very serious.

His nickel-plated Colt revolver, engraved with his name on the backstrap, was modified for the fast-draw sport with an especially contoured hammer and a light trigger pull.

It was listed in late catalogs but is no longer produced in the U.S.\n\nThe 32 Long has a heavier bullet and delivers slightly more energy than the 32 Short, but velocity is about the same.

It was a good short-range small game number because, like other cartridges in the same class, it killed cleanly without mangling or ruining edible meat. However, it is not effective beyond about 50 yards because of the relatively high trajectory which makes close bullet placement difficult at long range.

(507359, '505 Rimless Magnum (Gibbs) Introduced as a proprietary cartridge by Gibbs for use in Mauser-type bolt-action magazine rifles. After 1913, rifles in 505 Gibbs were imported by American dealers and used to a limited extent there. A few custom-built rifles for the 505 were also turned out by American gun-makers. Most of these big-bore nitro cartridges were developed around 1910 and this one was still available until quite recently.\n\nWhen the first of the 505 rifles showed up in the U.S., there were all kind of stories floating around about the horrendous recoil. Several individuals were alleged to have suffered broken shoulders or collar bones as the result of firing them. This nonsense made really "big men" out of those who fired these guns and survived, but hardly contributed to the popularity of the cartridge. The English must have more sturdy frames then Americans because none of them appear to have fractured anything. The 505 is a little less powerful than the 500 Jaffery, but has an edge over the 458 Winchester. It is considered adequate for anything in Africa and has a good reputation against elephant, buffalo and lion. For North American game it is needlessly large and powerful with a 525-grain bullet leaving the muzzle at 2300 fps and a massive muzzle energy of 6190 fpe.', ''),

(507365, ' [h=2]308 Winchester[/h] 				   						 						 				 					 						[INDENT] 							Introduced by Winchester as a new sporting cartridge in 1952, the  308 is nothing more than the U.S. T-56 or the NATO 7.62x51mm military  round. This was a very smart move, to tack the Winchester name on what  was sure to become a popular sporting number. Unfortunately, American  manufacturers don''t always exhibit this much imagination. Practically  all American and European high-powered sporting rifles are chambered for  the 308 since it will work through the medium- or standard-length  action. The Model 70 bolt-action and 88 lever-action Winchester were the  first American sporting rifles chambered. It was adopted as the  official U.S. military rifle cartridge in 1954, although weapons for it  were not ready until 1957. It is used in the M14. However, it has been  replaced by the 5.56mm NATO as the official U.S. military cartridge.\n\nIn power, the 308 Winchester is superior to the 300 Savage and almost  equal to the 30-06. It delivers about 100 fps less muzzle velocity than  the larger 30-06 with any given bullet weight. The factories used a  special ball-type powder in loading the 308, and it was difficult for  the hand-loader to equal factory ballistics with the powders then  available. However, Winchester-Western Ball powders are now available in  canister lots; shotshell and pistol powders have been on the market for  some time. Most authorities consider the 308 suitable for most North  American big game, although it''s on the light side for moose or big  brown bear. 						\n[/INDENT]', ''),

(507416, ' [QUOTE=Abbas;344664]@Faisji Good answer.\r\n\r\nI have [B]no [/B]reason to believe this incident is cooked but I think the response by brothers is not correct and they have been misguided by seniors. I repeatedly have been saying all along that make comments/offer suggestions that are [B]RESULT [/B]oriented. Testing, court cases etc etc solve nothing instead only spoil it for the brothers involved, the company and the gun community at large. It also leaves a bad taste in everyone mouth and quite frankly I personally have been disappointed at how our community approached this whole incident. This was not the educated way to handle this situation. I believe that if a problem is being solved amicablely and with friendship why resort to other more ugly means. \r\n\r\nApart from the initial miscommunication between both parties I think the company did a good job of branching out to the gun owner and community as a whole. I must appreciate that Caracal offered to do the following which were all rejected.\r\n\r\na). Replace the gun without inspecting it immediately free of cost and offering the brother involved in the incident an all expense paid trip to the factory to advise them in person.\r\n\r\nb). Send over the gun to the factory for analysis and they would get any 9mm replacement Caracal of their choice.\r\n\r\nc). Get an immediate CASH refund plus Rs. 30,000 in medical expenses. \r\n\r\nWhat is wrong with this picture ?  Regardless of anyone''s educational/financial level these were all really good offers.\r\n\r\nAnyway, personally I felt quite embarrassed by this whole incident as I went out of my way to help and the manufacturer readily agreed to whatever I was requesting out of friendship/respect and regard for our gun community. What I did not know was that our expectations were not that the gun would be replaced but that our understanding of firearm malfunctions is that when a firearm breaks it''s magically transported into the heavens by fairies on unicorns and as soon as they disappear into the clouds, cases of Gold and Silver float down for all to be merry with.[/QUOTE]\r\n\r\nThese are very reasonable terms.

(507440, '32 Long Rifle [FONT=&quot]This cartridge has an inside-lubricated bullet and a slightly longer case than the regular 32 Long rimfire. It appears on cartridge lists from about 1900 on into the early 1920s. Both Remington and Winchester loaded it. Some say it was a smokeless powder improvement over the 32 Long, but the 1918-1919 Remington catalog shows it as available in black-powder loading only. It has been obsolete for many years and is something of a collector''s item.[/FONT]\n\n  [FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n  [FONT=&quot]The case length of the 32 Long Rifle is between that of the 32 Long and Extra Long rimfire; other dimensions are practically identical. No doubt it could be fired i n any rifle  chambered for the Extra Long, and probably most rifles or revolvers made to handle the Long. The old outside-lubricated bullet was a messy thing to carry in the pocket or loose in any container. They soiled the hands, picked up lint and dirt, greased up and stained the pocket, etc. Inside-lubricated bullets are much cleaner to handle under any conditions and that is the main efforts were made to produce such a version of many of the older outside-lubricated types. However, this required a smaller diameter bullet which usually gave unacceptable accuracy in the original barrel. That may have been why the 32 Long Rifle had such a short life. No one seems to have made a gun specially for it, or at least the author found no reference to such. Original load was an 81-82-grain bullet and 13 grains of black-powder.[/FONT][FONT=&quot][/FONT]', ''),

(507443, '577 Nitro Express (3&quot; &amp; 2 3/4&quot;) The 577 was originally a popular black-powder caliber introduced about 1880. The original cartridge had a 2 3/4-inch case, later lengthened to 3 inches. The current smokeless powder 3-inch version was introduced shortly before the turn of the century. The short case was loaded with smokeless powder for a time, but has been obsolete for a number of years. This is a straight, rimmed case used only in single shot and double rifles. \n\nThe 577 enjoyed a great reputation as an elephant killer and was more or less a standard caliber found in any battery of African rifles. It was popular with professional ivory hunters for close cover work. Many claimed it was superior to the 600 Nitro because it gave better penetration. Rifles for the 577 could be made a few pounds lighter than was feasible with 600-caliber guns, which also contributed to its popularity. Cartridges of this size were usually for emergency use under difficult conditions. Most hunters used lighter rifles of smaller caliber for ordinary shooting, but had the 577 as a backup. Rifles for the 577 weighed from 14 to 16 pounds or more, and that''s a lot of weight if you have to carry it very far on the ready. Gun bearers usually carried the heavy guns until needed, but because the British were lazy. An exhausted man just can''t handle a gun of such heft and weight in a pinch. This 577 Nitro had a 750-grain bullet with muzzle velocity of 2050 fps and muzzle energy levels at 7010 fpe.', ''),

(507447, '300 vjr The 300 VJR was developed by Vern Juenke, a Reno, Nevada gunsmith, in January of 1985 and is his latest wildcat based on necking-up the 5.6x50Rmm Magnum case. The cases are made by fire-forming after they are necked-up, using a light charge of 2400 powder and a case full of cornmeal. The final configuration has a very sharp shoulder and a body with less taper and is about 1/8-inch longer than the parent. The cartridge is chambered in custom-made barrels for the Thompson/Center Contender pistol. John Septian of Reno has been winning regional silhouette matches with this combination. The 300 VJR uses standard .308-inch-diameter bullets.\n\nThe 300 VJR is one of the better 30-caliber silhouette cartridges because it has less muzzle blast and recoil than some of the others, while delivering ample energy to knock down the metallic targets. It is also a good field cartridge, delivering ballistics in the 30-30 class. Although it has a smaller case, it delivers performance equal to, or superior to, the 30-30 or 30 Herret when fired from the short barrels used in silhouette pistols.', ''),

(507468, '600 Nitro Express The 600 is the largest and most powerful English elephant cartridges. It was introduced by Jeffery in 1903, shortly after the turn of the century. It is of original design and is not based on any earlier black-powder cartridge. It was usedd in double riflesand has been obsolete for a number of years, but was still listed in the 1962 Eley-Kynoch ammunition catalog.\n\nAt one time, the 600 was the most powerful commercial rifle cartridge in the world. However, that title is now held by the 460 Weatherby Magnum and its 8245 fpe of muzzle energy. (Off course, 700 Nitro Express proprietary cartridge with its 8900 fpe overshadows both of these). The 600 designed to deliver the maximum possible stopping power against elephant under the most difficult and dangerous conditions. Even professional ivory hunters considered it over-powered for anything but emergency use. It is said that a head shot on an elephant that missed the brain would still knock him down and out for a considerable length of time. John Taylor says up to 30 minutes. Rifles for the 600 usually weighed 16 pounds or more. There were actually two loadings for the cartridge- one at 1950 fps and another at 1850. he lighter load was used in Jeffery-made doubles. It is necessary to use the load the rifle is regulated for or the two barrels won''t shoot to the same point of impact. This caliber uses 900-grain bullet and produces a massive muzzle energy of 7600 fpe.', ''),

(507690, ' [QUOTE=Trajan;318498]I think Skeeter sb''s point is also to strongly implore all firearm users to immediately stop shooting if they hear abnormal sounds after pulling the trigger. This is true for all firearms, be they be handguns/rifles/shotguns or otherwise.[/QUOTE]\r\n\r\n This is absolutely true.  Sometimes there''s a problem with the ammunition.  Sometimes there''s a problem with the shooter.\r\n\r\n Military and some police train to "clear the jam and continue."  Many shooting schools do the same.  However, the hidden assumption there is that someone is shooting at you, and getting the next shot off is more important than a low-probability safety problem.  Competition shooters who have to fire a minimum number of rounds in a given time will clear and continue.\r\n\r\n Unless someone is shooting at you, if your gun does something strange, STOP.  Unload, clear the chamber, and LOOK DOWN THE BARREL.  Do you see rifling all the way down?  You''re OK.  Do you see anything that ISN''T rifling?  Then you have a problem.\r\n\r\n Obviously, a bullet might be stuck in the barrel.  But it''s not all that unusual for a jacketed bullet to come apart and leave its jacket stuck in the barrel while the core goes downrange.  This will usually "ring" the barrel (put a circular dent on the inside) on the next shot.  It also causes a severe pressure spike when the next bullet goes down the now-constricted barrel.  Split barrels, broken locking lugs, etc. can happen.\r\n\r\n Often, the wrong ammunition can be a problem.  For example, a 20 gauge shell will drop into a 12 gauge chamber, but it won''t fall through the barrel.  If you accidentally load a 20 gauge shell into a 12-gauge, you might figure you had a dud.  Rack the slide, try again.  BOOM.  The barrel was obstructed by a whole 20ga shell ahead of the fired 12ga shell.  You might think it would be hard to mistake a 20ga shell for a 12ga shell, but it has happened to many people. \r\n\r\n After the .40 S&W came out, a similar problem began happening with pistols.  Many .45 magazines will retain a .40 round, and the pistol will chamber it just fine.  Shooter has a misfire, clears the gun as he was trained, pulls the trigger again, BOOM. \r\n\r\n Just because you cycled the action doesn''t mean the "dud" cartridge came out.\r\n\r\n Just because a case or shell was ejected, doesn''t mean the barrel is clear. \r\n\r\n\r\n And just for the record, if you find an obstruction in the barrel, "shoot it out" is not the correct answer.\r\n\r\n\r\n If you''re not in a situation where "clear and continue" is important, take the time to stop and look.  Trying to shoot through an obstructed barrel is an unkind thing to do to a firearm...', ''),

Especially the length of pull; the index finger reach on the trigger, the beaver tail - is kinda perfect. Please correct me if I am wrong, the Shadow has a trigger job done at factory (or removing the FPB has make the trigger short & smooth).\n\n\nSo besides money another thing that is holding me from loosing bread is:\n\n\nIs regular SP-01 better than Shadow -?\nIs Tactical better than Shadow - ?\nWhich of the three should I get - My purpose (besides infatuation) is SD / HD / not conceal carry / not competitions.\n\n\nThere are numerous threads here as well as on various other forums. However I am very clear that I do not intend to conceal carry it (practically no body can effectively conceal carry a full size gun); i do not move with a round in the chamber, so I am ok with the safety (with or without FPB). I am OK with the weight.\n\n\nThe CZ website says that they made it after feedback from cops & soldiers, so why after the detailed input the guns is only good for Range / Competitions & not for active duty.

(507755, 'Side by side with hammer lock well, this was in my possession from years. i dont know much about this gun, but my chacha and grandfather for sometime used it. while i was a kid i didnt much cared that we had this gun. "ayyeee old piece of junk" was my stance, however, later when this gun was in no shape and not in working condition. I realized that it had number of trophies, blue bulls, hog deers and God knows how many birds under its glory and used by teachers. I decided to fix it. I in hurry to fix and restore i actually forgot to take pictures of before. because i never thought at that time of posting it here. However i shall try to explain with words what had happened to it. the barrel was badly scratched, it was partially orange from rust, i couldnt open the gun, had to give it a diesel bath to open with hammer. :P the hammer locks were not striking the firing pin. the wood stock had dents and its finish well, I dont even know how to describe it. and Finally the whole gun was shaking, like it wasnt stable. \r\n\r\nSo what did i do... \r\n\r\n1. gave complete bath of diesel, and fully disassembled the guns \r\n2. learned the process of bluing, Both cold and hot. (from youtube and pakguns)\r\n3. Learned the process of fixing and finishing wood stock.  (sanding, degrease, ironing for dents an polish).\r\n4. Consulted my dad''s Unit gunsmith (who off course is not specialist in shotguns) but still it really helped and maintained my confidence for fixing working parts of the gun. \r\n\r\nNow the gun is in full working condition, i shot personally 25 rounds 4 no. and no misfire or any trouble, it worked perfect and had a good old recoil. The gun is Belgium made from a custom armory who''s name is also engraved. (but because of bluing the markings are lil blury) this was my first proper restoration project, i loved every bit of it. I am not done as yet. I have arranged a wood carver from chinyot and prolly he would make me a new stock with full cravings. furthermore i am thinking of getting the hammers gold plated from gold smith ( with gold water). \r\n\r\nPlease advise on further improvements. and if above mentioned shouldn''t be done. \r\n\r\nP.s my inspiration for this project was 12guage sir who had done several restoration projects. and i would be honored if he share some views on this thread aswell.', ''),

In fact if u search the forum, some time ago I suggested a member who wanted to buy a 92fs to buy a pt92/99 instead. :) In fact I''m totally against the fact that a 600-650 dollar gun (Beretta) is sold at a ridiculous price of 250k. Any person who wants the 92 platform SHOULD go for the taurus....period. In Pakistan, "value for money" is much much higher with the Taurus.\n\nThe reason why I asked jawad bro to clarify his statement was that I thought maybe he has had some bad experiences with the Beretta.\n\nBy the way, the difference between a 92fs and pt92 is of fit and finish (besides the difference in safety lever position). Generally the 92fs is a lot smoother right out of the box than a pt92, which should smoothen out after an initial break-in period. That being said, the 92fs is an AWESOME weapon, and a must have for any enthusiast, its really sad that they are so damn expensive here. :)\n\nSorry for off topic guys :D, @op i''d suggest u to go for the Canik55, but if its a Taurus u want, then pt92/99 is the way to go. :)\n\nRegards.', ''),

(508218, '32 Extra Long Exact date of introduction of this cartridge is a little obscure. It is definitely listed in various catalogs by 1876 and probably originated between that date and 1870. Ballard, Remington, Stevens and Wesson single shot rifles chambered it and probably others. It does not appear in post WWI catalogs. Many old gun catalogs indicated an extra charge for rifles chambered to shoot any of the extra long rim or center-fire cartridges. some authorities place the date of introduction as 1866 and that may be correct.\n\nOriginal load for the 32 Extra Long rimfire was a 90-grain outside-lubricated bullet and 18 to 20 grains of black-powder. The bullet is the same as that used in the ordinary 32 Long, but there were some variation, depending on who manufactured the ammunition. The 32 Extra Long was not a very accurate cartridge and never established itself as much of a match round. For hunting it extends the effective range of the rimfire 32 out to perhaps 65-75 yards, but dosen''t possess appreciably greater killing power than the 32 Long.', ''),

(508226, '5.6x33 Rook. 5.6x33R Rook These two cartridges are identical except one is rimless, the other rimmed. They date back to around 1900 or earlier and were originally loaded with black-powder. Both have been obsolete since 1936. Like the British, the Germans had a series of rook (a form of crow), or parlor cartridges, for short-range target practice or small game shooting. These were listed in catalogs as for Tesching Gewehre, i.e., small game or rook rifles. although popular in Europe, they were not used to any extent elsewhere.\n\nWhen Winchester introduced the 22 WCF in 1885, it not only replaced most other 22 center-fires in the U.S., but also in Europe. The 5.6x33 is of similar performance and was probably made obsolete by the 22 WCF. Both are strictly small game or target cartridges. The Winchester round is still loaded in Europe, where it is known as 5.6x35R Vierling. The 5.x33 was also listed as the 5.7x33. These are said to be for single shot rifles, but must have also been used to some extent in repeating rifles. If not, then why the rimless version? The rimless 5.6x33 bears some resemblance to certain modern wildcat 22 rounds based on necking-down the 30 U.S. carbine. The 5.6x33 factory loads with 65-grain bullet produces muzzle velocity of 1500 fps and muzzle energy of 327 fpe.', ''),

(508283, '30 Herrett [FONT=&quot]The 30 Herrett was developed as a handgun hunting cartridge by Steve Herrett and Bob Milek. It was intended for use in the Thompson/Center single shot pistol, and the first barrels were apparently made up during 1972, although Thompson/Center did not offer did not offer it as a standard chambering until 1973. The cartridge is based on the shortened and reformed 30-30 case, which is reduced to 1.6 inches as compared to the original length of 2.04 inches. The case is longer and has greater powder capacity than the 30 Carbine, and when fired in the 10-inch barrel of the Thompson/Center pistol, delivers a rather impressive performance. Muzzle velocities of over 2000 fps are possible with the 125- or 130-grain bullet with muzzle energy of 1160 fpe.[/FONT]\n\n  [FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n  [FONT=&quot]Conceived as a superior handgun hunting cartridge, the 30 Herrett has been used successfully on everything from varmints to deer and even elk and moose. However, as loaded and used in the Thompson/Center pistol, it develops less velocity and energy than the standard 30/30 rifle and must be considered on the marginal side as a big game cartridge in the hands of the average hunter. Much of its success has been due in no small part to the skill of the people who have used it. On the other hand, it certainly offers greater power than the 357 Magnum revolver and some consider this adequate for big game in the hands of a skilled hunter and good shot. Certainly it, too, has had its share of success over the years, but again, as with all big game hunting with a handgun, it boils down to the question of who is doing the hunting. What an Elmer Keith or someone in that class can do and what the average person can do are two different things. In any event, the 30 Herrett is an outstanding long-range handgun varmint cartridge, particularly with the 110-, 125- or 130-grain bullet. It has also been used with some success for silhouette shooting, although most shooters prefer the 357 Herrett for this sport. The 30 Herrett is a good example of a wildcat cartridge designed for a specific purpose not really covered by anything in the commercial line, and one that fulfills its design purpose extremely well.

They went o stay the night there as they have a couple of rooms where they let the guests stay in. He took lots of extra stuff with him I.e. food ingredients like spices, Ghee etc and said gave it to people who are always present at that place. Probably the "Mureeds" (The devotees who live there) or the people in charge/ looking after the place whatever. They also took a goat with them, slaughtered it and had a Bar-b-Que him and his friends had a "mehfil of gup shup" with Tikka''s and bar b que etc... and had a good time until they called it a night and went inside the room to sleep. He said I think around 10/11 pm someone knocked on the door so one of them from inside opened the door and to their surprise there was a big group of masked armed men, some entered inside the room while their others stood outside to watch over, they demanded their cash and valuables and while demanding they started firing rounds in their feet to scare them off with Bolt Action Rifles 7/8MM Look alikes but what he described looked more like those British-Indian Style 11 Rounds bolt rifles with detachable magazines. They handed them all the money, the main guy I am on about they took Rs, 7000 from him and other valuables and even took the food they had cooked saying you guys must have already been eating too much we will take this as our share. After every little while they would fire a round in the room to cause further terror and he said as they were old style constructed rooms built with stones they could hear bullets circulating across or around the room hitting from one wall to another and then another creating a "ta ta ta" noise after every round was fired. He said I told them that look guys you have got what you wanted (Money Valuables etc) so no need to keep firing the rounds as it will injure somebody. They walked away and soon after one of them stopped outside pointed the Rifle towards the room, where 1 door was open and one was shut, he fired the final shots on the door that was shut the rounds went straight through the door and unfortunately sat behind the door on the bed was the main subject in the story I.e. my dad''s friend, the bullet or bullets went straight through his both legs, through the bones, exiting the other side.\nHe started bleeding heavily without a surprise of course, it was late night, no medical facilities around, his friends put him in the vehicle took him to the nearest main hospital which took at least 2 hours, by the time he got there he had almost died due to heavy bleeding but thanks to Allah he survived and made a full recovery. The police collected all the well known criminals in the village for the so called I D Parade but nothing happened, as usual.\n\nHe said may be it all happened because one his friends who went with them told one of the locals during "gup shup" or while having a chat with the locals there that "hum mein se ye eik dost England se aaya hay" meaning one of our friends with here with us has come for holidays from the UK.', ''),

(508311, ' First off, great forum and "well done" to the moderator staff!\n\nIt is certainly unfortunate, this recall business and now an injury related to a Caracal pistol. I have two Caracal pistols myself, a C and an F which will soon be replaced with a brand new one. I''m standing by to learn more about the situation with the C as Caracal provides more updates this coming week, according to the latest announcement anyway. I sure hope this is an isolated incident. \n\nAs I read this thread and others elsewhere, it seems to me that Caracal has reacted and followed through on what they''ve promised so far. It also appears that in both instances the actions of Caracal have been pro-active in terms of initiating a recall based primarily on a concern for the safety of its users. I can respect this voluntary action and think it is a brilliant move. To me, Caracal obviously cares more than most other manufactures. I am not aware of any other manufacturer who has offered a 100% refund or exchange for a new pistol. To me, this is a new standard in service for the firearms industry and other companies should take note. \n\nI will wait it out... I enjoy my Caracal in every aspect, so if I can be part of making it better by being a customer of a brand who listens to its customers (hence the upgrades present in the new Caracal F .40 S&W) then I''m on board. \n\nI''m glad to see in this thread that the operator was lucky to not be more seriously injured, that communication was finally worked out between Caracal and parties, that pro-active action was taken by Caracal in the best interest for public safety and that an official announcement was made. Now we wait, yet again :(  But, I know that in the end my Caracal pistol will be even better than it is now as Caracal continues to evolve beyond the first generation of product. \n\nLuckily, we have other guns to shoot here while the Caracals get, uhmm&#8230; "upgraded."', ''),

(508418, '38 Short When the Civil War ended in 1865, a number of rimfire cartridges had been developed and used successfully in battle. Most of these were large caliber rifle cartridges. After the war there was a demand for smaller caliber metallic cartridges for revolvers and sporting rifles. Both the 38 Short and Long rimfire date back to this period, possibly the early 1860s. they are listed in the 1869 Folsom Bros. & Co. gun catalog. The Remington Model 1866 revolving rifle was available in 38 rimfire. In 1871 the Remington New Model revolver was advertised as available with an extra 38 rimfire cylinder. The 38 Short rimfire was listed in the 1876 J. Brown & Sons catalog as for Ballard, Remington and Wesson rifles and Allen, Colt, enterprise, Whitney, X.L. and other pistols. This is now an obsolete cartridge, but it was manufactured to about 1940.\n\nThe 38 Short rimfire is in the same class as the center-fire 38 Short Colt. Original loading was a 130-grain bullet and 18 grains of black-powder. Like most older rimfires, the bullet is outside-lubricated. Bullet diameter is .375-inch, the same as the ball fired in 36-caliber cap and ball revolvers. The 38 Short may have originated as a cartridge for breech-loading conversions of these old revolvers. Many catalogs listed the 38 Short as for pistols and revolvers, whereas the 38 Long is shown as a rifle type. The Rollin White patent covering the bored-through cylinder, held by Smith & Wesson, did not expire until 1869, and this undoubtedly had an effect on the use of the rimfire 38 Short for revolvers.', ''),

F22 raptor has so many issues, a pilot commited suicide as he couldnt cope up with the cough that most of its pilots are getting due to faulty oxygen system, even its ground engineers are facing health hazards that th us govt. denies. see the link. I m not defending caracal, I m not defending my buy, I m not assailing anybody also. its just that may Allah keep all of us safe, but the company acknowledging its malfunction and moving for it is a good move.

ARM-PIT!!![/FONT][/COLOR]\n[COLOR=#333333][FONT=lucida grande] [/FONT][/COLOR]\n[COLOR=#333333][FONT=lucida grande]and this was his right arm, the one with the gun still pointing at me... all i could do at that point was to open my door and hurl myself out onto the ground lest i got shot (yes, i do love myself a lot!)[/FONT][/COLOR]\n[COLOR=#333333][FONT=lucida grande] [/FONT][/COLOR]\n[COLOR=#333333][FONT=lucida grande]i heard a crash as the bike went down, not a single growl or even a peep out of the dog so far, except for the howls and shrieks of that man...[/FONT][/COLOR]\n[COLOR=#333333][FONT=lucida grande] [/FONT][/COLOR]\n[COLOR=#333333][FONT=lucida grande]i went round back of the car, and saw Fantum chewing at the man''s arm-pit and shaking him like a ragdoll... he was no longer yelling, but rather a gasping, wheezing and gurgling kind of sound, half from exhaustion & loss of blood and half from pure shock, i suppose... i wouldn''t be too happy and dandy at having a big black creature emerge out of the darkness and go for me with his bare teeth![/FONT][/COLOR]\n[COLOR=#333333][FONT=lucida grande] [/FONT][/COLOR]\n[COLOR=#333333][FONT=lucida grande]Anyway, the guy had apparently dropped the gun on my seat as his arm was paralyzed by the pressure on his veins i suppose.[/FONT][/COLOR]\n[COLOR=#333333][FONT=lucida grande] [/FONT][/COLOR]\n[COLOR=#333333][FONT=lucida grande]a few Rickshaw drivers gathered, while i tried to pull him off...

It is a polymer-framed striker-fired pistol and comes with an extra backstrap and practically 2 kydex holsters. However, unlike other striker-fired guns (like the Glock or Caracal), the TP-9 also has a decocker; so basically, once you''ve chambered a round (and cocked the striker) and then hit the decocker, your first becomes a DA shot (all subsequent shots are SA). In other words, the TP-9 is a striker-fired gun that works like a traditional DA/SA hammer pistol.\n\nI personally really like this DA/SA setup. I''m a fan of hammer pistols specifically because the first shot (being DA) is an excellent safety against an ND and can, therefore, be carried quite easily without any worries.\n\nHowever, I agree with [B]doc pistol[/B] bro, if this is your first gun then I suggest you get a traditional hammer pistol with an external safety.

(508642, 'Karachi arms market survey : beyond lucky star series: With lots of help from messers Zainulabideen, Ashes & Agha 007 who trudged along with me from shop to shop.\r\n\r\n[B]Ilahi Bux and Co.( Teen Talwaar) ED Zainulabideen:[/B]\r\n\r\n[I]The outlet[/I]\r\n\r\nThe shop has been completely over hauled and remade. The door is closed and locked from inside. In fact the whole look was quite intimidating to me. But Zainulabideen brave and strong man that he is.. Did the manly thing and manfully walked to the shop while I scurried along behind him. \r\n\r\n[I]The (New) Manager:[/I]\r\n\r\nHe is a nice old man.. As in really nice.. He was in a bank all his life but had an epiphany and realized his calling in life was selling guns.  He is very very eager to please.  Gave us his card and asked us to come back as and when we liked… And bring our friends along as well… \r\n\r\n[I]The product line (Hoppes):[/I]\r\n\r\nThey have more hoppes stuff in one place then I have ever seen in any outlet I have ever visited. And most of it is pretty reasonably priced.  A solvent was around Rs. 550 and he the gentleman threw in a rifle brush for free!\r\n\r\n[I]Shotguns:[/I]\r\n\r\nHe had a lot of em. I saw one of my favourites..  the Hatsun MP A (TS) there. I have been looking and lookin for it for ages and ages (and ages) \r\nSo far I have only seen the fixed stock version. I had given up hope of ever feasting my eyes on the tactical stock version. \r\nThis is the weapon \r\n[url]http://hatsan.com.tr/new_escort_mpa_ts.asp[/url]\r\n\r\nThe door buster attachment is available at Guns and Assassories.\r\n\r\nThe Pump action version was also available\r\n\r\n[url]http://hatsan.com.tr/new_escort_mps-ts.asp[/url]\r\n\r\nThe asking price of the MPA semi auto was 50k and the pump was 40k \r\nSince the fixed stock version is around 48 to 50k or so in the market. I think this was a very reasonable tag price.  \r\nHowever the weapon was named “jaguar”. I have no idea why. Since its an MPA TS all right. I asked him as to the anomaly. So he said that its an Amarican company producing in Turkey. \r\nI don’t think he was been deliberately obtuse. Rather, he was confusing it with the Winchester shotgun line.  Winchester has shifted production to Turkey.  So I guess he thought that it applied to all Turk shotguns.  However I have never heard of a Hatsun bearing the moniker “Jaguar”.\r\n\r\n[I]Pistols:[/I]\r\n\r\nWell… he had the by now ubiquitous CF 98 and the comparatively rarer CZ 83 in .32 calibre. It was NIB asking price 55k.And that’s it. That’s their total handgun line.  I was last here in 2008. At that time they had a CZ 83 .32 caibre NIB. And that’s it. Now that they have a CF 98 as well to keep that lonely CZ 83 company. \r\nHowever the uncle there told me that like shotguns they will be receiving their shipment of handguns next week.  I also saw a clay disk thrower as well. \r\n\r\n[I]Documentation:[/I]\r\n\r\nNopes not their ball game. Licenses, entries. permits or anything of the sort…  manager Uncle wont know how to go about it I guess. \r\nAs we were leaving uncle came to the door to see us off and told us that whatever prices we get for ammo both 9mm and shotgun in Saddar lucky star area he will decrease the price by Rs. 3 per round. \r\n\r\nNext week I think I will do another round here.  They have really really nice show room. And have spent a lot of money on it. Does not make sense to leave it (mostly) empty.', ''),

However there are tests conducted prior to any breeding to minimize any future health issues, unfortunately in Pakistan facilities are not upto the mark to carry these out and anyone and everyone breeds 2 good-looking dogs to make a quick buck regardless of the future of the breed and it''s progeny.\n\nAs for Rotties being social and a delight, only in the hands of an equally dominant and experienced owner/handler could that be held true. In the hands of a newbie, it could be as devastating, if not worse, as a newbie buying and carrying around a chambered Caracal! ;)\n\nHaving said that, I personally know Aman of Sieger Stern and can vouch for his dedication, knowledge and concern for the Rottweiler and the good quality of his litters.', ''),

I am a government officer in Grade 18 and working in ISB. \r\n\r\nFor all readers information, I like to add that Arms License Section adress has been changed in MOI. It has been shifted to S block now and room number 434. I met the Section Officer, Arms License section and he asked me to apply via my department and I have done so. I sent following documents via official mail from my department to MOI:\r\n\r\n1: Copy of NIC\r\n2: Pictures\r\n3: Profession certificate\r\n4: MOI Application form\r\n\r\nNow, with my application submitted, I have some queries for the members to guide me further from here.\r\n1: I have heard that the Officer of Grade 17 and above are exempted from Police verification. Is this fact true or false.\r\n2:  I am employed in ISB and living on rental apartment here in Islamabad. So I have given the actual address of my home town where my family resides. Will this create a conflict for MOI that I have presented address of outside Islamabad (South Punjab) but working in Islamabad.\r\n3: How long will it take for MOI to issue the approval certificate\r\n4: To which address MOI will send the approval certificate. To my home address or to my department.[/quote]\r\nPost: [url=http://www.pakguns.com/showthread.php?9790&p=300219#post300219]DIY MOI licence[/url]\r\nForum: Licenses (MOI & Provincal) & Legal Issues\r\nAssigned Moderators: N/A\r\n\r\nPosted by: [url=http://www.pakguns.com/member.php?7380-mythical]mythical[/url]\r\nOriginal Content: [quote]i was looking for some dealer who could provide the licence in time and with less burden on my pocket. \nby reading the forum i know that Most of members give advise to get the moi by dealer to avoid any hardships  involved in the process.\nIn order to judge the entire process and for authenticity of my own licence , i decided to do all the work my self . \n\nIt was a rough road ahead :frusty:  of me since most of us havent tried it with CAL. \n\n(Steps might differ in each case.

(508775, '9mm Action Express This is a 1988 innovation by Evan Whildin, Vice President of Action arms, Ltd. The 9mm Action Express (9mm AE) is the 41 Action Express case necked-down to 9md rim and retains the 41 AE rebated rim which is the same diameter as the standard 9mm Luger. The advantage of this in the 9mm AE is that the cartridge  offers a larger case that can be used in firearms originally designed for the 9mm Luger without the necessity of changing the bolt or breech face. This will allow a number of 41 AE semi-auto pistols and carbines to be changed to the 9mm version by the installation of kits available for specific weapons. \n\nThe 9mm AE has already been tested in the Uzi semi-auto pistol and specially-altered 1911 Colt models. It is a sort of super 9mm and as such is more powerful than the 38 Colt Super Auto. It has an advantage over the 9mm Winchester Magnum since it is shorter and most 9mm pistols can be adapted to it. Tests in a 10-inch pressure barrel gave muzzle velocities with a 95-grain bullet of 1884 fps at 31,760 CUP and 1903 fps with a 100-grain bullet at 34,880 CUP. these pressures are a bit on the hot side for many semi-auto pistols. On the other hand, these are top loads and can be reduced and still maintain impressive velocities. A 124-grain bullet was measured at 1592 fps and 28,550 CUP, a load which could be digested by most 9mm autos. The 9mm AE is a potentially good self-defense and field cartridge. Of course, converted auto pistols are not likely to have 10-inch barrels, 5 inches being more normal. However, safe loads of around 1500 fps with the 124-grain bullet have been tested in converted Colt 1911 autos with 5-inch barrels. This beats out the 38 Colt Super Automatic and its 130-grain bullet at 1275 fps.', ''),

It was used in Allen, Ballard, Remington, Stevens and Wesson rifles of later date and in Enterprise, Favorite, Forehand & Wadsworth and Colt revolvers. It was both a rifle and pistol caliber of fair popularity up to the turn of the century. It was replaced by similar center-fire rounds. American companies quit loading it some time in the late 1920scor early ''30s.\n\nThe rimfire 38 Long is in the same general class as the center-fire 38 Long Colt. Original load was a 150-grain outside-lubricated bullet and 18 grains of black-powder. However, loads varied with different manufacturers from 140-grain-cto 150-graincbullet and up to 21 grains of powder with the light bullet.

To my home address or to my department.\n\n5: Most important is that where I should peruse in MOI that whether my application has been received there or not.

It is reasonably accurate for short range. Rotating barallel ensures compensation for the recoil. The grip is thick which is a negative for cc, but in price it is an excellent technological option. Beretta Storm is based on the similar platform.\n\nI kept this gun for the last three years and now will be replacing it with Glock 17 gen 3 soon.

(509185, '5.6x50mm Magnum Most authorities agree that the 5.6x50mm Magnum was developed by DWM in co-operation with Friedrick W. Heym, a noted German gun-maker, and was introduced in 1968 or 1969. It is an offshoot of the 5.6x47R, which is basically a rimmed version of the 222 Remington Magnum, dating back to about 1967. However, the 5.6x50mm case is .118-inch longer than the 222 Remington Magnum and has slightly greater powder capacity, resulting in a higher muzzle velocity. The rimmed version was intended for use in single shot, combination guns and drillings, the rimless cartridge for bolt-action rifles. Neither cartridge is very well known or used to any extent in the U.S.\n\nIn Germany, the 5.6x50mm is used for deer hunting and is loaded with a bullet designed for that purpose. In the U.S. it would be primarily a varmint cartridge. Where more power than the 222 or 223 Remington is desired, most Americans would opt for the 22-250 Remington or the 220 Swift because both rifles and ammunition are available there on an over-the-counter basis. Loading data for the 5.6x50mm are available from RCBS and Forster/Bonanza. A 50-grain bullet of 5.6x50mm over 28 grains of N202 powder produce 3435 fps of muzzle velocity and 1305 fpe of muzzle energy.', ''),

The Volkskrant newspaper wrote: "the choice of the SIG Sauer earlier this year evoked surprise with representatives of both the arms industry and police unions. During police tests there was a strong preference for a pistol made by Heckler & Koch."[20][21][22] According to the court verdict of 28 March 2011 there were no manipulations involved during the public tender process and the order was finalized.[23][24] On 8 November 2011 the Dutch Minister of Security and Justice formally declared SIG-Sauer in default and immediately dissolved the order following the fourth negative production sample test of PPNL pistols firing Dutch police issue RUAG ACTION 4 NP ammunition by a reputable independent German testing institute (Beschussamt Ulm). Minister Ivo Opstelten found that SIG-Sauer could not deliver the requisite quality in a mass production setting and had some harsh comments on SIG-Sauer: "On the basis of the results of these tests I no longer find it responsible to continue with this pistol. There is no longer enough confidence in the quality of the pistol, nor in the capacity of the manufacturer to improve the quality or safeguard it. All this brings a risk to the safety of police officers on the street." The Minister delegated a (legal) review to examine the possibility of coming to an agreement with one of the other suppliers that has had their pistol operationally tested in the procurement procedure.\r\n\r\n[url]http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SIG_P250_DCc[/url]', ''),

(509257, '20 Gauge Shotgun Cartridge Well I was going through some old stuff of my father so I found this huge quantity of 20 gauge cartridges.\n\nI wonder why were these lying around since so many years because my father never had a 20 gauge shotgun okay maybe he used to have one when I was too small to know about arms and ammo as he was very fond of weapons as well...\n\nAnyway I am posting the pics below for the PG members, maybe the seniors can help out and tell more about this ammo and its difference from 12 gauge cartridges which we all use.\n\nBTW there were [B]6 [/B][B]differennt types of 20 gauge cartridges that I discovered. [/B]These cartridges are pretty old probably more than 15 years at least I think...\n\nThis one is Sellier Bellot and the cap has stamping saying, "SBP and Made in Czechoslovakia". Wonder why it says SBP and why not S&B the way its written on the 9mm ammo.\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]18878[/ATTACH]\n\nEley and it says Made in England.\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]18879[/ATTACH]\n\nThis one just says Hi-Power written on it and the cap says, "Federal Hi-Power 20 GA".\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]18880[/ATTACH]\n\nSo this one is pretty unusual to me because on the cartridge its written [B]Hubertus. [/B]Also says BEST SMOKELESS POWDER AND CHILLED SHOT (I wonder what does this mean lol). The cap says Made in Germany but the case from where the pellets exit say Sellier and Bellot written on it and also has number 5 and number 7 written on it (have to types of these). So really needed information about this because I always thought that S&B was made in Czech but this says Germany. The information maybe available on the internet but I prefer to use this forum as a source of knowledge :)\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]18881[/ATTACH]\n\nThis one was approx 25-30% shorter in size then the rest of the 20 GA cartridges. The primer says Eley-Kynoch and the cartridge has written on it, "FOR INDIA and Made in England, smokeless cartridges". But the end of case says Manton & Co Calcutta. So once again this is a mysterious cartridge because of its size and its targeted market, BTW it has the Indian map made on it as well... \n[ATTACH=CONFIG]18882[/ATTACH]\n\nThis is a group photo of all 6 types lol...The one on the right side bottom has nothing written on except the primer which says Eley-Kynoch as well.\nThe reason why I posted these pics was that I haven''t seen any 20 GA shotgun in the market so far.

Before i start, i would like to say thanks to everyone who prayed for me. thanks a lot. May Allah Bless All Of You.\n\n\nMy life have been changed since the accident. I thought about a lot of things during that time and yes i made few changes in my life. changes which many of you may not agree with me, but that''s ok cause the changes that i made effects me not any one here in the forums. I also thought and discussed with few of my seniors who are into guns quite a lot and they told me the same thing what i was feeling, that was just a pure accident nothing else. That could happened to any one any time. If i had more experience with guns it might not happened or may be it was meant to happen. In any case when some thing is about to go wrong, some times you can''t stop because it''s not in your control. It''s like driving a car, you never know when you have an accident. we all can try to be safe but what is about to happen will happen and happens for a reason. This accident reminded me of the day when i bought my first new car, i was driving so slow and carefully and you know what happened while i was driving back from the show room, standing on a red light when someone came and hit me from behind. after that i was so heart broken that my brand new car got hit. From that day on i never cared about the car that much and it''s been 5 years now not a single scratch happened since then. i guess when you care about something so much, when your too careful about something that when bad thing is waiting to hit you.\n\nSince last week i start doing the pistol shooting, but this time alone. My fear for guns and the big sound of fire is gone. i shoot every day now and fire almost 200 to 300 bullets a day, sometimes even more. i feel like i''m getting my anger out through the bullets. i now keep my pistol safety off, and bullet in the chamber. i have learned few things about my pistol from a good friend of mine, like how the safety works and how i open the dam thing. it''s like u don''t know how to get up un till you fall. Now i always check my pistol before and after the use but i had unscrew the dam safety thing and took it off for good. \n\nMany of you will not agree to what i have written above but after a careful thought and realising a lot of things like \n\n" who''s fault it was these few people were travelling to work, kids going to school when the bombers attack?" who''s fault it was, when a person dies with a heart attack when he never smoked or drink and alcohol" \n\nI''m not trying to justify what i''m doing, but i thought very carefully about these things and made me realise, sometimes taking risk is better than not taking risk at all. please guys don''t take this in a wrong way. i''m great-full for all of your advice and help.

As shallow as I am (being North American) I fall for the looks, but the Pakistani side kicks in after and if it becomes my mate if it is both "naik in soorut and seerut", right now the H&K USP is bothering me in my sleep, I love how it fits in my hands and fires, but for a 9mm, I probably will wait a bit and keep looking............[QUOTE=MK47;345011]HRMMM Now thats a very difficult question to answer despite as simple as it may seems. Because there are so many beautiful babes in 9mm due to which choosing one as your partner could be a very difficult decision to make. Particularly in the US and Noth America it is probably the most common hand gun calibre. My personal carry babe on my last trip to Pak was a Stoeger Couger. Chose that for various reasons I.e due to its reliability and most important due to its ambidexterous de-coker/safety Lock mechanism allowed me a chambered carry with abit more peace of mind. But since you guys (in the America and Canada) have afew more advantages over us here for example a wide market and a wide range of selection for much cheaper prices, and you know which typical example am I going to use now........ The Glock OffCourse... You guys can take that babe home for 400-600 Dollars. I''d suggest something like a Glock 19 but then again it''d be rather better for you to visit some of your local dealers, do abitta window shopping, hold and feel then decide what you like.[/QUOTE]', ''),

I don''t know what this is all about but from what I get, it''s that someone applied for a license and the application is approved and there is also some kind of 90 days deadline for something or this would be treated cancelled.\nAnyway, What I want to ask is that there is no contact information of the person mentioned in this letter (Only name, Father name, CNIC #). So I think this is something important and I want to get this to the owner. But I don''t understand how to go about it. I searched newspaper for lost and found Ads but didn''t find one related to this. How should I go about it? Should I return this letter to the ministry? There is no address or contact number. Only CNIC #s of the arms dealer and the person who bought this weapon. Also there is weapon no. and other stuff. There is also a tracking No. of the file/application, but I didn''t find any online database for this where I can get the information about the person and reach him. Guide me.

(509349, '38 Extra Long The 38 Extra Long appeared about 1870 and was chambered in Ballard, Howard, Remington, Robinson and F. Wesson single shot rifles. It was not a standard Ballard caliber, but special order item. It was strictly a rifle caliber, being too long for revolvers. Because of rather mediocre accuracy plus development of similar center-fire cartridges, the 38 Extra Long rimfire did not have a particularly long life. It was not carried in the 1918-1919 Remington catalog.\n\nThe 38 Extra Long is in a class well below the center-fire 38-40 black-powder loading. Original load was a 150-grain outside-lubricated bullet and 30-31 grains of black-powder. However, some companies loaded lighter bullets down to 140 grains and slightly more powder. It was not a bad small to medium game cartridge out to about 80 yards or so. It was introduced at a time when the center-fire was emerging as the dominant type and did not build up much of a following. The center-fire 38 Extra Long was developed by Ballard in 1855-56 and was preferred because of the re-loadable feature.', ''),

(509357, '38-45 Hard Head The 38-45 Hard head is nothing more than the 45-38 Auto in different dress. The 45-38 Auto is based on the 45 ACP case necked-down to 38-caliber. The 38-45 Hard Head is the same thing, but instead of using the standard 45 ACP case with it''s 19,000 CUP pressure limit, this one uses the 45 Winchester Magnum or the 451 Detonics case both of which are rated at 38,000 CUP. It allows the use of hotter loads without the danger of case failure.\nThe idea originated with Dean Grennell, of GUN WORLD magazine fame, who has been working on improving the performance of the 1911 Colt auto pistol for some years. The 38-45 Hard Head was fully reported in the November, 1987, issue of GUN WORLD magazine. Velocities in excess of 1500 fps were achieved with a 124-grain bullet from the 5-inch barrel of a modified 1911 type auto pistol.\n\nAttempts to upgrade the ballistics of cartridges fired in the 1911 Model Colt auto are fraught with frustration because of two limiting factors- the weakness of the partially unsupported case and the strength of the action. If you push the cartridge case too far, it will fail, and if you put too much strain on the action, severe damage can result. The answer is a stronger case and stiffer recoil springs, something that Dean Grennell has used successfully on a number of occasions and has done so again here to upgrade the 38-45 Auto and develop a sort of super, 38 Super auto. The 38-45 Hard Head was also tested in a T/C Contender with a 10-inch barrel and developed velocities of over 1700 fps with the 124-grain bullet. Bullets used in the testing were .355-.356-inch diameter (9mm).', ''),

(509384, '5.6x57mm RWS The 5.6x57mm was introduced by RWS about 1964 as a cartridge for bolt-action rifles for hunting deer and chamois. West Germany had a law that requires a minimum remaining energy level at 200 meters in order for a cartridge to be legal for taking these animals, and the 5.6x57mm was designed with this in mind. It is also loaded with a properly-designed bullet for these larger animals.\n\nThe 5.6x57mm is in about the same class as the 2220 Swift and as loaded in Europe would probably do very well for American deer or antelope; however, it would be classed as a varmint cartridge there. It is good cartridge, but the difficulty of finding ammunition, plus the existence of similar American cartridges, would rule out any great popularity in that country. The twist used in rifles of this caliber is 1 in 10 inches as opposed to the standard 1 in 12 to 1 in 14 inches used by U.S. gun-makers. the cartridge also has an unusually thick and heavy neck which allows the use of 22 rimfire adapter units, but presents some problems to the hand-loader. With a 55-grain bullet over 44 grains of N204 powder it produces a muzzle velocity of 3785 fps and muzzle energy at 1745 fpe levels.', ''),

(509463, ' 20-Guage\n\nWhereas the popularity of the 16-guage is declining, the 20-guage is increasing remarkably. This is due mostly to the 20-guage 3-inch magnum load and the many light, fast 20s now available with 3-inch chambers. The Savage 22 rimfire/20-guage combination gun in their Model 24 handles the 3-inch shell and has had some influence in advancing the poppularity of the 20. This heavy load has the same 1 1/4 ounces od shot as the 16 and takes the 20 out of the light class. In actual field use the 20-guage is now capable of doing almost anything the 16 can do, which makes the difference mostly one of personal preference. However, when it comes to the older 20-guage guns or any without the 3-inch chamber, then the 16 has an edge. There is another area where the 16-guage retains an advantage over the 20, and that is in the use of rifled slugs. The 16-guage slug is adequate for deer and most other big game under ideal conditions, and in the hands of an experienced hunter. On the other hand, the 20-guage slug is just barely in the short-range deer class, regardless of who uses it or the situation. Many experienced hunters believe the 20-guage slug should not be permitted on any big game. Shell lengths for the 20-guage are 2 1/2, 2 7/8 and 3 inches. The top black-powder loading was 2 3/4 drams of powder and 7/8-ounce of shot. It has come a long way since then. American companies load only 2 3/4-inch and 3-inch shells. Steel shot loads are available in both lengths.\n\nNOTE:- THIS IS THE INFO WHAT I HAD ON HAND FOR 20-GUAGE, HOPE MY TWO CENTS WILL BE ACCEPTED.\n\nRegards.\nAllah Bless. Luv Ya All.', ''),

(509546, '38-45 Auto,  45-38 auto Pistol,  45-38 Clerke Designed by Bo Clerke of the Armory Gun-shop, Burbank, California, and first announced publicly in the October, 1963 issue of GUNS & AMMO magazine in an article by Howard French. The 45-38 auto is based on the 45 ACP case necked-down to accept standard .57-inch bullets. Super 38 ACP barrels are reamed to the new caliber and used in the 45 Colt Auto without any other change.\n\n\nOne of the inherent faults of most semi-auto pistols is there inability to digest cast or swaged lead bullets. Much time and effort has been devoted to correcting this, an the individual hand-loader can effect considerable improvement. The necked design of the 45-38 eliminates any and all feed an chambering problems with light or standard loads. With a straight case, such things as bullet shape, seating depth, hardness of the alloy, etc., are highly critical. With the necked case they can be ignored. The idea behind the 45-38 was to produce a satisfactory target round that would function with any type bullet and any load sufficient to operate the mechanism. However, it should also be an excellent field cartridge because it will allow the use of hunting-type bullets. There is a definite need for an improved auto pistol hunting cartridge. Case configuration is the same as the 38-45 Hard Head but loading data is not inter-changeable. With a 130-grain bullet over 7.5 grains of Unique powder, it produces a muzzle velocity of 1275 fps and muzzle energy of 475 fpe.', ''),

This test is offered in the hopes of putting these false images into a more proper perspective.\r\n \r\n Please circle your answers to each below:\r\n \r\n 1. What is the real meaning of that pink T-shirt with a revolver on it that says: "The ultimate in feminine protection" ?\r\n 1. Obviously a plot by seditious gun fanatics from the NRA.\r\n 2. I''m amazed the pigs have no law banning women''s T-Shirts.\r\n 3. A 9mm for "light days" and a .44 Magnum for "heavy days".\r\n \r\n2. For rape and assault prevention, a whistle is:\r\n 1. All you''ll ever need.\r\n 2. Like I''d use yet another phallic symbol.\r\n 3. The signal to open Fire.\r\n \r\n3. The movie "Thelma & Louise" was:\r\n 1. An insidious plot to stamp out femininity and glorify\r\n violence.\r\n 2. A male ploy to encourage further suppression of women.\r\n 3. A training film.\r\n \r\n4. What was technically wrong with the scene in "Thelma & Louise" where the two women disarmed a Texas State Police Officer.\r\n 1. Tacky, tasteless, and altogether gauche I mean pointing guns;\r\n let alone taking his icky, disgusting gun for their own use.\r\n 2. Only thing I saw wrong was that it took two sisters to disarm\r\n only one man; not realistic at all.\r\n 3. The dummies left a perfectly good shotgun clamped to the\r\n dashboard of the cruiser.\r\n \r\n5. A mouse runs across the kitchen floor. The proper response it to:\r\n 1. Climb onto a high stool and scream for a man to help you.\r\n 2. Is it a male mouse or a female mouse ?\r\n 3. Link up the belt feed to the M-60.\r\n\r\n 6. You are discussing the local crime stats with your neighbor,\r\n Ralph, who suggests you buy a .25 caliber pistol for defense. You reply:\r\n 1. Never! A woman who buys a gun has humiliatingly surrendered to the evil ethos of mindless brute force!\r\n 2. Yeah, like I''m supposed to stand there and let old fat gut Ralph leer and drool like he usually does. Men are such pigs !\r\n 3. Only to plant in the dead hand of the next little weasel stupid enough to give me whimpy advice like that!\r\n\r\n 7. What is your reaction to the concept of a bra holster ? \r\n 1. Obscene ! The icon of death with the symbol of nurturing.\r\n 2. What''s a bra ?\r\n 3. As long as it doesn''t get in the way of my shoulder sling.\r\n\r\n 8. Define "male."\r\n 1. The first syllable of "malevolence," which in turn is only one letter short of "male violence."\r\n 2. An animal with a one track mind. A brute who feels the need to try to control, suppress, double-talk all women everywhere.\r\n 3. A quaint anachronism, once useful for protection of females, but rendered obsolete by contemporary firepower.\r\n\r\n 9. Where, in the scheme of things defensive, do such spray products as Mace and CapStun belong?\r\n 1. Nowhere! If you just show your attacker compassion and understanding, you won''t need nasty things like that.\r\n 2. Yet more products of questionable effect manufactured by the male dominated industrial complex to make women feel somewhat secure.\r\n 3. In the medicine cabinet; real women use mace instead of Feminique.\r\n \r\n10. You are cornered in your home by a knife-wielding intruder. He ignores your command to halt, and charges you with the knife upraised. How many shots should you fire?\r\n 1. None. It would be better to die or submit than sacrifice moral victory by using deadly force. How unseemly and gauche.\r\n 2. As many as I had, assuming the male dominated firearms industry would sell me a gun; or let alone ammunition in the first place.\r\n 3. A minimum of fifty shots.

(509671, ' +1 Enigmatic desires\nResearch shows Bear spray (pepper spray in bigger cans) is the most effective method of defence against wild animals, especially bears. Also studies show the trend of Police officers'' injuries during arrest process to decline after the introduction of pepper spray. Here the cops cary a baton, pepper spray, taser and a gun. If the person being sprayed has Asthma they can die from it too. Also one has to be very careful of wind direction when spraying, because like any other weapon it can backfire! I have seen cops turn their face away when they spray someone. A can of pepper spray might not be effective in deterring a mob! A firearm might work better in a situation like that, but again most of the time just showing the firearm is enough to dissipate the situation. Having more than one options is a very good idea. Tasers are illegal for civilians in Canada. Carrying pepper spray in urban areas requires a permit as well, in the bush one can carry bear spray without any issues.', ''),

(509687, ' It seems like we won''t have to wait too long before another picture is posted on this thread! DJ one does not learn to walk by running first!! Accidents happen!!???? Seems like you are living in lala land!! WAKE UP BEFORE YOU HURT SOMEONE!!! You have no clue about how to safely handle a firearm, and you took the safety out!! This is real life not a movie!!! Here is a safety procedure for you and GOD HELP YOU!\n[B]1. Treat all guns as if they are loaded. [/B]\nAlways assume that a gun is loaded even if you think it is unloaded. Every time a gun is handled for any reason, check to see that it is unloaded FIRST. If you are unable to check a gun to see if it is unloaded, leave it alone and seek help from someone more knowledgeable about guns.\n \n[B]2. Keep the gun pointed in the safest possible direction.[/B]>\n Always be aware of where a gun is pointing. A "safe direction" is one where an accidental discharge of the gun will not cause injury or damage. Only point a gun at an object you intend to shoot. Never point a gun toward yourself or another person.\n \n[B]3. Keep your finger off the trigger until you are ready to shoot.[/B]\nAlways keep your finger off the trigger and outside the trigger guard until you are ready to shoot. Even though it may be comfortable to rest your finger on the trigger, it also is unsafe. If you are moving around with your finger on the trigger and stumble or fall, you could inadvertently pull the trigger. Sudden loud noises or movements can result in an accidental discharge because there is a natural tendency to tighten the muscles when startled. The trigger is for firing and the handle is for handling.\n \n[B]4. Know your target, its surroundings and beyond.  [/B]\nCheck that the areas in front of and behind your target are safe before shooting. Be aware that if the bullet misses or completely passes through the target, it could strike a person or object. Identify the target and make sure it is what you intend to shoot. If you are in doubt, DON''T SHOOT! Never fire at a target that is only a movement, color, sound or unidentifiable shape. Be aware of all the people around you before you shoot.\n \n[B]5. Know how to properly operate your gun.  [/B]\n It is important to become thoroughly familiar with your gun. You should know its mechanical characteristics including how to properly load, unload and clear a malfunction from your gun. Obviously, not all guns are mechanically the same. Never assume that what applies to one make or model is exactly applicable to another. You should direct questions regarding the operation of your gun to your firearms dealer, or contact the manufacturer directly.\n \n[B]6. Store your gun safely and securely to prevent unauthorized use. Guns and ammunition should be stored separately.[/B]\n When the gun is not in your hands, you must still think of safety. Use a California-approved firearms safety device on the gun, such as a trigger lock or cable lock, so it cannot be fired. Store it unloaded in a locked container, such as a California-approved lock box or a gun safe. Store your gun in a different location than the ammunition. For maximum safety you should use both a locking device and a storage container.', ''),
(509688, ' [QUOTE=bilal978;347270]Assalam u Alaikum!\n\nI know nothing about arms and licensing. I have just join this forum because I found a letter 2 days ago lying on a road. It is from Ministry of Interior. The subject is "Weapon procurement authorization (Demand Note) for issuance of PB/NPB Computerized Arms Licence". There is also a form attached "Gift of Weapon". I don''t know what this is all about but from what I get, it''s that someone applied for a license and the application is approved and there is also some kind of 90 days deadline for something or this would be treated cancelled.\nAnyway, What I want to ask is that there is no contact information of the person mentioned in this letter (Only name, Father name, CNIC #). So I think this is something important and I want to get this to the owner. But I don''t understand how to go about it. I searched newspaper for lost and found Ads but didn''t find one related to this. How should I go about it? Should I return this letter to the ministry? There is no address or contact number. Only CNIC #s of the arms dealer and the person who bought this weapon. Also there is weapon no. and other stuff. There is also a tracking No. of the file/application, but I didn''t find any online database for this where I can get the information about the person and reach him. Guide me. Thanks[/QUOTE]\n\nBro! Kindly go to any NADRA Kiosk which are established for CNIC verification. They will charge like Rs. 50/-. They will give a page which will have details of CNIC. That''s how you can get address of the person. And then send the form / DN through courier to that address. That''s how you can help that guy.', ''),

(509777, ' LOLZ! Yes it''s true, [B]rmishaq[/B] took a big risk when he bought the TP-9 when the gun was new, untested and completely unknown.

The fact that Canik55 took the extra step for their customers shows their commitment to their customers.

I tell you brothers that i  own this pair of vikings since 2010 and atleast have fired 7k rounds with steel version while alteast 4500 to 5k rounds from poly version, so, for the sake of arguments, i have a better experince than all of you gentlemen.\nthe major demerit of viking (that has surfaced on this debate ( in your kind opinions) is the absence of a decocker, well , i have been dealing with the guns owned by my family members having decockers such as NP22 and CZ999 and have  dared not to decock the wepon except pointing it towards safe direction and i believe every sane gun enthsist would do the same coz we have been trained not to rely on the safties. Well i manually decock my both of vikings in same manner, so  what and where is the difference?. besides, by pointing both of my guns in safe directions, i deliberetly let my thumb slip to let the hammer strike the firing  pin but the bullet didnt went off ( no body should try this as results may varrie . if any body is doing this, he would be doing it on his own responsibility, i shall not be at cost , responsible for the cosequences) it was obviously due to firing pin safety or half cock arrangement as the baikal calls it. i saw a very good thread on it here as well which i cant find now . this is no less than a decocker.', ''),

(509888, '357/44 Bain &amp; Davis The 357/44 Bain & Davis was intended for use in special, re-built 44 Magnum revolvers, the cartridge had a rather short life and then fell into disuse. However, in more recent times it has re-surfaced as a chambering for Thompson/Center Contender single sot pistols, and in this mode, it really comes into its own. The cartridge was developed by gunsmith Keith Davis and first announced in an article by Dan Cotterman appearing in the January 1964 issue of GUN WORLD magazine. The original purpose for the design was to bring the velocity of the 38-caliber revolver up to the then-advertised 1410 fps with the 158-grain bullet. Actual velocity is, of course, some 299 to 300 fps below that figure. Ammunition catalogs no longer list the 158-grain 357 Magnum at anything like 1410 fps. In any event, the 357/44 B&D did achieve its design goal by developing velocities in the revolver over 1400 fps. The case is based on the 44 Magnum  necked-down without any other change. \n\nThe 357/44 B&D is another wildcat that started off as one thing (a super 38 revolver cartridge) and ended up as something else (a silhouette and hunting round for single shot pistols). What is interesting about this cartridge is that although smaller than the 357 Herrett. It produces equal or slightly superior ballistics. It is a potent and effective cartridge for either metallic silhouette or game shooting with 110 up to 158 grains. As a field cartridge, it will cover the spectrum from small game and varmints up to deer, although it''s a bit marginal for the latter. cases are very easy to make, requiring only a full-length sizing and seating die. In a 10-inch barrel of T/C Center Contender a 110-grain bullet loaded over 24 grains 0f "296" powder produces a muzzle velocity of 2120 fps and muzzle energy at 1100 fpe level. On th other hand, a 158-grain bullet loaded over 24 grains of "296" powder produces 2045 fps of muzzle velocity and 1465 fpe of muzzle energy.', ''),

(509897, ' [QUOTE=dodo23;347776]It seems like we won''t have to wait too long before another picture is posted on this thread! DJ one does not learn to walk by running first!! Accidents happen!!???? Seems like you are living in lala land!! WAKE UP BEFORE YOU HURT SOMEONE!!! You have no clue about how to safely handle a firearm, and you took the safety out!! This is real life not a movie!!! Here is a safety procedure for you and GOD HELP YOU!\n[B]1. Treat all guns as if they are loaded. [/B]\nAlways assume that a gun is loaded even if you think it is unloaded. Every time a gun is handled for any reason, check to see that it is unloaded FIRST. If you are unable to check a gun to see if it is unloaded, leave it alone and seek help from someone more knowledgeable about guns.\n \n[B]2. Keep the gun pointed in the safest possible direction.[/B]>\n Always be aware of where a gun is pointing. A "safe direction" is one where an accidental discharge of the gun will not cause injury or damage. Only point a gun at an object you intend to shoot. Never point a gun toward yourself or another person.\n \n[B]3. Keep your finger off the trigger until you are ready to shoot.[/B]\nAlways keep your finger off the trigger and outside the trigger guard until you are ready to shoot. Even though it may be comfortable to rest your finger on the trigger, it also is unsafe. If you are moving around with your finger on the trigger and stumble or fall, you could inadvertently pull the trigger. Sudden loud noises or movements can result in an accidental discharge because there is a natural tendency to tighten the muscles when startled. The trigger is for firing and the handle is for handling.\n \n[B]4. Know your target, its surroundings and beyond.  [/B]\nCheck that the areas in front of and behind your target are safe before shooting. Be aware that if the bullet misses or completely passes through the target, it could strike a person or object. Identify the target and make sure it is what you intend to shoot. If you are in doubt, DON''T SHOOT! Never fire at a target that is only a movement, color, sound or unidentifiable shape. Be aware of all the people around you before you shoot.\n \n[B]5. Know how to properly operate your gun.  [/B]\n It is important to become thoroughly familiar with your gun. You should know its mechanical characteristics including how to properly load, unload and clear a malfunction from your gun. Obviously, not all guns are mechanically the same. Never assume that what applies to one make or model is exactly applicable to another. You should direct questions regarding the operation of your gun to your firearms dealer, or contact the manufacturer directly.\n \n[B]6. Store your gun safely and securely to prevent unauthorized use. Guns and ammunition should be stored separately.[/B]\n When the gun is not in your hands, you must still think of safety. Use a California-approved firearms safety device on the gun, such as a trigger lock or cable lock, so it cannot be fired. Store it unloaded in a locked container, such as a California-approved lock box or a gun safe. Store your gun in a different location than the ammunition. For maximum safety you should use both a locking device and a storage container.[/QUOTE]\n+1\n@ darkjustice\naccidents do happen but that doesnot mean to stop doing the right thing and shift to the more dangerous things, infact you have to look for improvement, look for your own mistakes and correct them....consider dodo23 thread...its good...anywayz everyone has his/her own way of handling things.....good luck with whatever you decide.', ''),

(509903, '41 Short (Derringer) This is an old and once very popular rimfire, mostly because of the light, handy arm that chamber it. The 41 Short was introduced in 1863 or ''64. It was originally called the 41-100 rimfire. The National derringer was patented by Daniel Moore in 1861 and ''63. It was made by National from its introduction to 1870 when the company was purchased by Colt. From about 1872 to 1890 this rotating barrel, single shot derringer was manufactured by Colt. They also adapted the 41 Short to the Thuer-patented or third model derringer and the House pistol or "Cloverleaf" cylinder model of 1871. Derringers made by Allen, enterprise,Williamson, X.L. and others were also of 41 Short caliber. The Remington over/under or double derringer manufactured from 1866 to 1935 was perhaps the most famous and popular of the lot. Several low-priced pocket revolvers were chambered for the 41 Short. It has been obsolete since WWII, but special lots of ammunition have been loaded since the war.\n\nThe 41 rimfire Short is so under-powered as to be worthless for anything but rats, mice or sparrows at shot range. Fired from the average derringer at a tree or hard object 15 to 25 yards away, the bullet will usually bounce back and land at your feet. Nevertheless, it was a popular self-defense cartridge and at point-blank range could inflict a severe wound or kill a human being. 41 derringer pistols were more of a threat or morale builder than anything else. Original load was a 130-grain outside-lubricated bullet and 13 grains of black-powder. Late loads used smokeless powder.', ''),

(509946, ' [QUOTE=bird of paradise;347730]AoA, Hello everybody. This is my first post in pakguns.com. I have been going through pakguns.com for the last couple of day. I have found it very informative and interesting especially for guns & hunting lovers. Some of the threads are really captivating and thrilling. I myself have a passion for hunting. By profession I am a Lecturer at a Govt College. I started hunting with an AIR GUN (DIANA) since i was 7 years old. I live on the bank of river Indus, so hunting species like ducks(almost of all kinds), teeters (black & brown), quails, rabbits, doves, etc are in abundance here. Though not as much as used to be, because their number has significantly decreased due to increase in the number of hunters and new innovations in hunting. Pakguns is a very useful platform for sharing hunting experiences and also for learning different hunting tactics. I like and appreciate the work of the admins and moderators of this forum that they have arranged so many things quite systematically. \nlooking forward to having a positive and fruitful communication.\nThanks to all.[/QUOTE]\n\nMost welcome brother in the [B]GREAT PG BROTHERLY FAMILY[/B], stay tuned and enjoy your knowledge updating stay here.\nBest Wishes and Regards.\nAllah Bless.

The Enterprise #4, Favorite #4, Forehand & Wadsworth, Webley and other revolvers were available in this caliber. A few cheap, single shot rifles also chambered it. It has been obsolete since the 1920s.\n\nThe rimfire 41 Long is a better cartridge than the Short, but not much. There was some variation in bullet weight and powder charge, but the original load used a 163-grain bullet and 13 to 15 grains of black-powder. The center-fire 41 Short is an outgrowth of this cartridge. Guns chambered for the Long could also shoot the 41 Short rimfire.

(510144, 'Complete Newbie looking for a 9mm handgun Hello everybody.\n\nI have recently felt the NEED to be self armed. Me and my immediate family has gone through a car-capping/car-jacking situation and 2 cases and car dacoity in the last 5 years. Plus in the last 2 months, I have seen cases of auto-theft and house dacoity amongst extended family / acquiantensces. All this besides hearing urban myths/rumours of various kinds of evil incidents. \n\nAt a certain point of time, I decided that it would be best for me to arm myself to protect me and my family. I should point out, that till very recently I was actually had very much anti-gun opinions. But when a friend of mine suggested that he can arrange for a license, I jumped at the opportunity and gave him all the requisite docs/photos. I expect the license to arrive in a week or two. \n\nAnyways, that is my contextual background. After applying for the license, I began to research on what sort of weapon should I actually buy. \n\nFirst question was calibers. After having researched and asking around a few friends, the general concensus was that for a newbie, 9mm would be best. It has sufficient fire power whilst being able to manage the recoil issue as well for a newbie.\n\nThen my second issue was the type of gun. My issue with choosing a gun was that I did not even know what sort of features should I look for in a gun as a newbie. I cam across all sorts of lingos like Single Action/Double Action/Double Action Only/Quick Action/etc. Other terms like decocker/slide safety/trigger safety/etc. \n\nI asked friends what they were and what features should one look for in a first gun. They all seemed to suggest that they choice is really personal on how the weapon feels in the hand and "if they like the look" of the weapon. I could NOT get that. They always side it was like buying a phone. Honestly when I buy a new cell phone, then the feel and the look of the cell is a factor but I do look at specs like speed / memory size / and camera pixel quality. Unfortunately I do not even know what to look for in my first gun. I would appreciate if you can help in this regard.\n\nBut in any case, I read a number of reviews and made the following choices for the first potential gun. \n\n1. CF98\n2. Canik 555 TP9\n3. Cougar 8000\n4. Sarsilmaz CM9\n\nMy primary objective and intended use are as follows:\n1. Home Defense: Home defense is the primary objective. However, with three children in the house, I do not want to have to deal with big rifles / shotguns. I much prefer a pistol. Given the fact that I have 3 children, safety features of the gun are of big importance to me. \n\n2. Concealed Carry (infrequent): I do not intend to carry it concealed everyday, but perhaps during certain family excursions when I expect to be coming back at home late at night (family weddings / dinner parties / etc). My most probable areas of carry would be at the waist during time I am out of the car or in the ankle whilst driving.\n\nMy biudget is in the range of about 50k-60k. I have heard that recently the turkish guns have escalated in price and thus the prices indicated in [URL]http://www.pakguns.com/content.php?224-Pakistan-gun-price-9mm-pistol-shotgun-forum-hollow[/URL] might actually not hold true anymore. That would leave me with only CF98 being a probable contender. Please advise if what I am thinking is correct or are the prices of Caniks/etc still the range indicated in the post.\n\nPlus I would also appreciate if you can recommend any other pistol I may have missed out on. I would also appreciate if you can shed light on what features to look for in the first gun, with specific references to actiontype/ bore axis / safety features / etc.', ''),

It''s polymer continuation in shape of the PX4 Storm is worth around 300K''s! Beretta Cougar if imported would similarily stand around 250-300K''s if imported. Hence, by all aspects, Stoegar Cougar even at today''s prices retains a good value-for-money quotient here in Pakistan. \n\nAs regards the Vikings durability, it''s of no concern to 99% of our users. The will last you for long.\n \nYes, I''ve read even about cracks within the Viking frame, yet can''t exactly remember the source.\n\nMoreover, some close friends too have had their Viking experience and were not pretty convinced about it''s "reputed" robustness, deeming that there are other better options around, same price.\n\nFinally, it''s been my personal opinion, that the manufacturer has not been satisfied with a single model of the Viking and the frequent changes must have been a process of improvisation efforts, probably as a response to durability issues that we over here do not know much about, since the Viking''s home ground is a relatively "close circuit origin", still.\n\nIf the initial Viking had been flawless, I personally do not understand why another, heavier model needed to be manufactured with steel inserts for further fortification of the frame. Why make a well-performing gun heavier or combine polymer with more steel inside the frame, if the lighter one, all polymer had no complains?\n\nFinally, there is the all steel model launched just recently.\n\nHence, I''d prefer the uniform Stoeger Cougar, even though, I feel i''m gonna get torpedoed down here by Junooni "Vikings", lol!\n\n\nRegards.', ''),

I have found it very informative and interesting especially for guns & hunting lovers. Some of the threads are really captivating and thrilling. I myself have a passion for hunting. By profession I am a Lecturer at a Govt College. I started hunting with an AIR GUN (DIANA) since i was 7 years old. I live on the bank of river Indus, so hunting species like ducks(almost of all kinds), teeters (black & brown), quails, rabbits, doves, etc are in abundance here. Though not as much as used to be, because their number has significantly decreased due to increase in the number of hunters and new innovations in hunting. Pakguns is a very useful platform for sharing hunting experiences and also for learning different hunting tactics. I like and appreciate the work of the admins and moderators of this forum that they have arranged so many things quite systematically. \nlooking forward to having a positive and fruitful communication.\nThanks to all.[/QUOTE]\n\nWelcome to the community bro. No doubt its a great place to learn and share. Truly, this forum has saved me from a big loss. Couple of months ago I was going to purchase a Junk but after visiting this forum frequently, reading threads and experience of senior members and fellows I am in a position to debate the tricky arms dealers.

It has a control lever. I.e a lever that both acts as manual safety as well as decocks. (Lowers the hammer by itself without hitting the firing pin) and a dedicated loaded chamber indicator. the new one (Generation II NP 42) is available both with textured frame as well as accessories rail.

(510300, ' DJ, somewhere I read you mentioning that Glocks don''t have safety. This is incorrect. Glock has triple layer of safety designed into by considering that when you pull trigger, you meant to shoot. It won''t go bang if you drop it or a partial load had happened. Glock also fail to cycle with some ammo (very few though). The main reason why law enforcement in the US has adapted this pistol is because it can be chambered and holstered safely. In US safety is the most important thing and always considered first.\n\nThe gun you had been mentioning in your posts, does not have similar features. Lets assume you have your pistol chambered, cocked, either in your belt holster, pocket or hand and due to some reasons you stumble, fall and you gun gets a jolt enough to release the spring and your gun goes bang. Now would you know which direction your muzzle was and what was in the direction of muzzle? You don''t! This would be the most unfortunate situation.\n\nBuy Glock and keep a round chambered, it is all good. But the gun you are trying to play Glock with is nothing but asking for trouble.

Pull the trigger then and the result will be a crisp 5-pound trigger pull. Or, you can hit the decocker at the top rear of the slide.

Like I said, I actually thought about the different situations in which I would find myself where I would want to use the guns. ANd I realized that the situation would not allow me to cock a gun and shoot. Which is why I think it is necessary to have the gun chambered if one is carrying to. Plus I do realize that speed become more important than accuracy in times like these. It is said that it takes 1.5 second for a trained person to remove the gun from the holster and aim it. That is an eternity. Especially in Karachi where the bad guy also has a gun. Add to that the element of removing from an IWB / ankle holster. That time can easily go to 2 seconds. That is why I have made conscious decisions of when to use the weapon and when not. Plus I have also gone through loads of videos and articles at [URL="http://www.handgunsmag.com/tactics-and-training/"]Handgunsmag.com[/URL]. I found them to be very informative and educational. Especially some of the videos on how to handle carjacking incidents. Problem is that Pakistan does not have serious firearm training schools, let alone tactical training. I am seriously thinking of where to go for training. I cannot afford a membership to the PNS Karsaz. I hear that Airmen Club (Korangi) is offering walkin use of the range.', ''),

Like I said, I actually thought about the different situations in which I would find myself where I would want to use the guns. ANd I realized that the situation would not allow me to cock a gun and shoot. Which is why I think it is necessary to have the gun chambered if one is carrying to. Plus I do realize that speed become more important than accuracy in times like these. It is said that it takes 1.5 second for a trained person to remove the gun from the holster and aim it. That is an eternity. Especially in Karachi where the bad guy also has a gun. Add to that the element of removing from an IWB / ankle holster. That time can easily go to 2 seconds. That is why I have made conscious decisions of when to use the weapon and when not. Plus I have also gone through loads of videos and articles at [URL="http://www.handgunsmag.com/tactics-and-training/"]Handgunsmag.com[/URL]. I found them to be very informative and educational. Especially some of the videos on how to handle carjacking incidents. Problem is that Pakistan does not have serious firearm training schools, let alone tactical training.

Even though your pistol manufacturer tried to make it look alike and claims it has five levels of safety but it does not have GLOCK''s patented safe action. If it was just like Glock then why did they added an external safety??? Here is a copy and paste from Glock site.\n\n[I]GLOCK&#8217;s revolutionary &#8220;Safe Action&#8221;® System provides a consistent trigger pull from the first to the last round. The three automatic independently operating mechanical safeties are built into the fire control system of the pistol. All three safeties disengage sequentially as the trigger is pulled and automatically reengage when the trigger is released. This safe, simple and fast system allows the user to concentrate fully on tactical tasks, particularly while under stress. It is safe if dropped and functional at temperatures from -40° to 122° Fahrenheit.\n\n[/I]Is this statement comforting? Knowing company''s reputation, Absolutely. Your gun has a hammer while Glocks has striker pin. Results may be the same but functionality is different. If you go to youtube, you will find enough videos to explain safety systems of many guns including Glocks. Watch for information not for opinions. With enough information, you should be comfortable to make a good decision.', ''),

The second visible change is color of trigger which has been changed to black from previous silver color.\n\n@ 12GAUGE! Yes! I had selected Winchester but then there was change of heart.

Thanx :)[/QUOTE]\n\nI have both pistols in my house. Stoeger is my personal carry pistol, bought Viking for my younger brother. They are both good pistols but not the bestt options for conceal carry. I found my Stoeger heavy to carry and its abit bulky aswell. Its ok in Winter under your jacket but in summer under a thin Kameez it will be noticable. The only time I have ever been appraoched by the police asking me if I had a pistol under my Kameez was the first day I started carrying the Stoeger, after switching from carrying the TT all my life before which was nice and slim. I then bought a belly holster which I think is quite good nicely conceals most guns including the Stoegar under the kameez. Viking is also good, reliable and accurate with high Magazine Capacity of 18 Rounds but its a big/ full size handgun and may not very concealable, specially in summer. So If conceal Carry is the main issue then u need to go for something like Canik55 C100, or Canik Pirhana C etc. \n\nHowever if you have already made your definit decision between Viking and SC, then I''d say definitely go for SC even if you have one already in the house because.\n\n1) It is more compact and concealable comparing to the Viking.\n\n2) Its prefectly safe to carry chambered due to its ambidexterous safety/ De-cocking mechanism. Thats 1 of the main reason I was having it as my main carry pistol because night time I always had it chambered. I have heard de-cocking the Viking could be dangerous. I hope its wrong but you never know.\n\n3) In reality You are getting a Baretta Pistol for peanuts comparing to normal Baretta Pistol Prices .(the only difference is It says Stoeger on it, who cares about the Name/Logo what matters is the gun and its performance. I can get you a Barrette Clone made in Peshawar with all the Baretta names/Logo/signs etc on it but does that make the gun as reliable as a real Baretta 92? No)\n\n4) Its been tried and tested internationally and so far has a fantastic reputation and is more popular than the most Russian 9mm brands.\n\n5) Also it''ll fire upto 400 rounds without any cleaning. and it probably is the easiest gun to dismantle.\n\nHope it helps.', ''),

(510884, ' [QUOTE=Txshooter;348470]Dear members, we keep discussing and arguing ''the best weapon'' for SD, CC, HD etc. but we fail to emphasise on the proper training and usage of the weapon. A weapon in untrained/unfamiliar with the weapon person''s hand can be more dangerous to himself rather than any perp. Before any newbie just wants to buy a gun to carry and feel secure, they should first get familiar with firearms. At least the basics! I say this today because I got a call from an uncle of mine yesterday who just purchased a glock26 as the best protection his money could buy but he doesn''t even know how to unload his weapon once loaded. I walked him through the process praying that he wouldn''t accidentally shoot himself in his foot! Secondly, pulling out your weapon in an emergency situation is a critical move..for an untrained person, it would be like offering an additional 60-70k gun to your wallet and cell phone :)\nJust HAVING a gun does not provide any security. It''s knowing how, when, and under what circumstances to use it does.[/QUOTE]\n\n+1\n 1000''s of rounds fired on a  still paper at the range would not train any of us for a typical scenario, it requires a lot of specialised training.

The man was now out of her visible range and I thought she was a failure.\n \nThat is........till the man touched the gate with his hands............Voila, there was a fast loud bark and instantly the Russian poodle followed suit by the main gate! Both dogs went wild and I had to go out calm them. Strange enough, the poodle remained silent at first, although he was at only 7 feet distance from the gate, the Rott alarmed me first!\n\nWill be back with pictures.\n\n\nRegards.', ''),

(511009, ' [QUOTE=Snowbird;348473]That is exactly what I was thinking. We should have a seperate section inthe forum to discuss training and tactics. Like I said, I actually thought about the different situations in which I would find myself where I would want to use the guns. ANd I realized that the situation would not allow me to cock a gun and shoot. Which is why I think it is necessary to have the gun chambered if one is carrying to. Plus I do realize that speed become more important than accuracy in times like these. It is said that it takes 1.5 second for a trained person to remove the gun from the holster and aim it. That is an eternity. Especially in Karachi where the bad guy also has a gun. Add to that the element of removing from an IWB / ankle holster. That time can easily go to 2 seconds. That is why I have made conscious decisions of when to use the weapon and when not. Plus I have also gone through loads of videos and articles at [URL="http://www.handgunsmag.com/tactics-and-training/"]Handgunsmag.com[/URL]. I found them to be very informative and educational. Especially some of the videos on how to handle carjacking incidents. Problem is that Pakistan does not have serious firearm training schools, let alone tactical training. I am seriously thinking of where to go for training. I cannot afford a membership to the PNS Karsaz. I hear that Airmen Club (Korangi) is offering walkin use of the range.[/QUOTE]\r\n\r\nIt''s great to know that you are actually putting in effort to learn about firearms. The Arabian Sea CC offers you the range along with a tactical setup. There are other people who offer idpa training courses and competitions. But just thinking out aloud, imagine being in your car with your family, stopped at a red light.. Suddenly there a tap on your window and a gun pointed at your head. How would you react. Even with the fastest draw, do you think it would be possible to draw your weapon? Always be vigilant and pre-empt. ( In my personal opinion) I.e in a scenario of being stuck in a traffic jam where lootings commonly happen, get out of your car and stand guard a few steps away to keep your family safe.', ''),

(511478, ' I normally use air gun barrel cleaning pellets for the barrel and silicone cloth for the body.\n\nAirguns are different from normal firearms. Be careful. Some of the things which I learnt the hard way are: 1. Do not use normal gun oil or mineral oil for anything and especially for lubricating the air piston. It can cause "dieseling" which can damage the air cylinder. 2. Also normal mineral oils can deteriorate rubber seals which are a vital part of airguns. For lubrication of piston area special synthetic oil with high flash point is used. The good air guns like Diana or Gamo normally do not require such lubrication until thousands of pellets are fired. Also Clean/oil barrel very sparingly. May be after 500 or 1000 shots. You may see some improvement in accuracy. This can be done with a wire brush lightly soaked with gun oil as mentioned in earlier post. In any case avoid contamination of barrel rubber seal with the oil and wipe off excess oil immediately.\n\n\nIn my personal opinion airguns should be left as they are. The pistons and cylinder, trigger etc normally do not require additional lubrication. The factory lubrication is sufficient. You can use very little amount of grease or some motor oil on hinges of break barrel air gun. But do wipe any excess oil so that it doesn''t flow to other parts i.e., wooden or synthetic stock, rubber seals etc. Also avoid storing air guns in vertical position for long time. If stored in this position the oil in barrel or in the cylinder area may drain and may contaminate rubber seals or damage the stock.', ''),

They have been registered at the National Bank head office. The weapon that I buy has been entered at the DC office as well as the local police station both of whom require my full particulars.\nIn order to procure a license we have to be verified by the police who will then issue a certificate. After visiting the home of th applicant and procuring 2 guarantees from immediate neighbours. The certificate will enable the Home Sec to issue a letter allowing the aplicant to go ahead with the process. Once the challan is deposited in the bank. He will have to appear for bomertic scans and picture taking and data entry. The license will have a bar code which ensures traceability.\nThe weapon has to be purchased within a time frame after which the purchase period lapses. Once the purchase has taken place the license will be submitted to the local P.S along with full particulars as well as pics cnic copies and license copies along with fired empties of the weapon.\nLater a separate application has to be sent to the Home department for 144 permit which will enable carrying of the weapon. The applicant has to have a valid reason to carry. And if approved he will obtain a permit a permit valid for 90 days only. A copy of the permit wil then be sent to the DG rangers as well as the IGP. During snap checking the police will conform both from the headquarters as well as the local thana as to weahter the lic is real or not.\nThis is how a law abiding citizen gets a license.

This really creates panic in intruders minds.Such a collective response gives a good strong massage to BGs. \nMoreover, the safe locations where home members should get refuge, in which direction to fire from inside the room to ensure safety of ur home mates r things to chalked out in advance and practised regularly. Any bad guy taking any of family members hostage is due to the casual approach of opening inside room doors without any real confirmation.

(511713, '3/5ths of my gun collection I figured I''d post some pictures of my handguns and my only bolt action rifle for now.\n\nHere is my 1933 Mosin Nagant 91/30. It is a hex receiver gun, made in the Tula plant. Here in America we get these for about... $80 to $130. Even higher for the other more desirable models like the M44 or the ex snipers. This one was most likely used in WW2. \n\nIt appears to have been arsenal refinished by the Russians most likely after the war, though it doesn''t seem to be counterbored. The bolt is made of mix and match parts from different factories, as the Russians took them apart, threw the parts in a pile, and put them back together. The bolt handle is Tula, the cocking knob is Izhvesk. Some of the bolt parts are more crude than others, leading me to believe that some of the parts were made during peak production times during the war. The cocking knob seems to have been made by broken machining equipment. It functions fine, but it''s very crudely made.\n\n[IMG]http://i25.photobucket.com/albums/c89/jakashh/Guns/IMAG1812_zps0871d563.jpg[/IMG]\n\n\nHere is my Ruger Redhawk Hunter with a 7.5" barrel in .44 Magnum. Because .44 specials cost about the same as the magnums here, I mainly shoot magnums, as the recoil doesn''t bother me. In this picture, it''s equipped with a Pachmayr "Decelerator" soft rubber grip, which works great. However, I have grown a liking towards the factory smooth wood grips.\n\nIt is pictured below with some 340 gr +P+ Buffalo Bore .44 Magnum ammunition. It gets 1425 FPS out of a 7.5" barrel, and packs a big punch. I don''t shoot these much, since after shipping they cost about $2.60 per round, whereas standard 240 grain magnum loads only cost me $0.70 per shot. I''d rather save these rounds for something special.\n\n[IMG]http://i25.photobucket.com/albums/c89/jakashh/Guns/IMAG1530_zps4b8d10ab.jpg[/IMG]\n\n[IMG]http://i25.photobucket.com/albums/c89/jakashh/Guns/IMAG1533_zps9fe70066.jpg[/IMG]\n\nHere it is after a day at the range.\n\n[IMG]http://i25.photobucket.com/albums/c89/jakashh/Guns/magnum_zps9b5d2677.jpg[/IMG]\n\n\nHere it is with the factory smooth wood grips. The only gripe I have with these is that the trigger guard smacks my support hand finger. It doesn''t hurt, but it is annoying.\n\n[IMG]http://i25.photobucket.com/albums/c89/jakashh/Guns/IMAG1592_zps2c84881d.jpg[/IMG]\n\n\nHere is my Springfield Armory "GI" 1911, in .45 ACP. The GI is, or was, Springfield Armory''s basic entry level 1911, made to resemble the 1911A1 that was carried in WW2 and the Korea and Vietnam wars (or police action, if referring to Korea). The frame and slide is made of carbon steel, and forged by Imbel in Brazil. Some of the Springfield 1911''s were totally made and completed by Imbel, and some of their higher end models only had the frames and slides forged by Imbel, and the gun was completed in America by Springfield. I''m pretty sure this one was completely made there in 2003.\n\nI changed the grips to checkered wood grips, swapped the A1 short trigger for a longer aluminum Cylinder and Slide trigger, and removed the arched mainspring housing and replaced it with a Smith and Alexander straight mainspring housing with a mag well. I also have other grips for it which fill the gap between the bottom of the grip and mag well, but I prefer these ones. I had a gunsmith polish up some of the moving parts, but I''m not sure how much better that made the gun, if at all haha. \n\n[IMG]http://i25.photobucket.com/albums/c89/jakashh/Guns/IMAG1785_zps88a94896.jpg[/IMG]\n\nDon''t mind the electrical tape on the grip safety. I removed it since this picture. The way I grip the gun (as high as I can get to bore axis), sometimes my palm wouldn''t engage the grip safety as it''s so high it is pressing the tang of the grip safety more than the grip safety itself, so I taped the safety down to counter this, which helped a lot. I will eventually fix this by installing a beavertail grip safety with a "memory bump", like you see on some other 1911''s. This will remedy my problem. I also plan to have the sights and hammer swapped out too.\n\nSpringfield Armory is a great company. Their customer service is outstanding! I had some FTF problems, and others where the slide would lock back prematurely. I sent it in to Springfield. They paid for shipping, and they fixed it for me for free. They replaced the extractor, reamed the chamber (not sure why, I think it''s standard procedure to make sure it''s in spec), and replaced the plunger tube and assembly. The problems have been gone since.\n\n[IMG]http://i25.photobucket.com/albums/c89/jakashh/Guns/IMAG1792_zps1d7e16ee.jpg[/IMG]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[IMG]http://i25.photobucket.com/albums/c89/jakashh/Guns/IMAG1638_zps1b02ccfb.jpg[/IMG]\n\n\n\n\n\n[IMG]http://i25.photobucket.com/albums/c89/jakashh/Guns/IMAG1640_zpsba47a059.jpg[/IMG]\n\nI also have another gun that is, according to our government, considered a handgun, but only because it has no buttstock so that it would be allowed into the country for import. Normally this gun is sold with a folding buttstock in rifle configuration, so I''m not sure if I can post the picture here or not. It is semi-automatic.', ''),

A dog will not think twice before giving it''s all to protect what it considers it''s own.\nNot only do big, snarling dogs succeed in putting the fear of God in anyone''s heart, being on all fours and closer to the ground with more speed and agility than humans, they are very hard to shoot and hit (unless one is an extremely trained person, which most BGs are not).\nWhether this trespass happens during day or night (God forbid), the general commotion and noise gives one enough time to gather one''s wits alongwith their weapon and gain control of the situation.\n\nI already have a Rottweiler kept outdoors (who has very successfully protected me from a mugger, details posted in another thread)\nAnd I am soon getting a Doberman puppy which will be raised indoors.

I was as excited as you, when I came across this forum over a year ago when I was doing abit of online research on Zastava M57, after purchasing a couple of them. One reason for my excitement was that since my very young age I''ve had a natural love for guns but back where I spent ma childhood, according to my elders if you had an interest in guns or Fire Arms, sadly you were labelled as some one bad, some one with negative or anti-social interests and someone with no interest in education or academics, which I strongly disagreed with but sadly being so Young and alone (in terms of interest) there was not much I could do to fight or argue my case.\n\n I am glade finally there is now a forum (from Pakistan) where civilised, law abiding decent Pakistani and other citizens can express and share their common interests and opinions in fire arms, sports shooting, hunting, and other leisure and re-creational activities. Alhumdulillah academically I did well and now with the grace of Allah I''ve a very decent job like the majority of PG Friends from all types of different fields and backgrounds, so I hope this proves the point to them like it has to the many globally that not every man with a gun is a Criminals, if not I dont really care what ppl think now. I''ve learnt alot and gained alot of knowledge from reading different threads shared by fellow PG''s during the last year and so, I probaby wouldn''t have been able to gain this much in my entire life else where. Its been a great help. If it wasnt for the help and knowledge from PG I would''t have been ble to make the right choices for myself, brothers and other friends. Now sometimes friends and relatives consult me when they feel the need to shop, which I am more than happy to help with, however I am just a learner like the rest.\n\nlooking forward to hearing from you more and hope you ur stay here', ''),

(511947, ' [COLOR=#000080][B]SLIGHTLY OLD BUT LESSONABLE HOME INVASION STORY.\n[/B][/COLOR]\nSimilar kinda incident like TRAJAN''S friend happened to my Uncle too, in his village in Pak. They had locked the house gate, shut the bedroom door to call it a night, as it was around 9/10pm in the Winter (in the month of January), someone knocked on the house main (metal) gate, my Uncle armed himself with his M16 Rifle, opened the bedroom door, his plan was to climb up to the top floor via the stairs in the varanda and look down from above the ceiling which is open space surrounded by walls only, to check who is outside the main gate in the street, but soon as he opened his bedroom door he was confronted by 4 Masked BG''s outside his bedroom door, 2 put guns to his head from left and right while 1 of them took the rifle off his hands, and there was nothing he could do as his wife and children including his 2 yrs old daughter were all inside the bedroom while rest of the family members were about to sleep in the other rooms (ladies only because other uncle and grandmother had gone to perform Hajj). One of the BG&#8217;s went inside the bedroom and put a handgun uncle&#8217;s 2 yrs daughter''s head while she was fast asleep in bed and said "try anything clever and we will blow her head off". The BG&#8217;S immediately started searching the drawers, cupboards etc, and demanded Cash from him. They even started taking the pillow covers off the pillows in a desperate attempt to find cash and other valuables. One of them sarcastically said "We''ve cut your telephone wire too" which they had, but luckily they had another telephone line in another room those days and one of the ladies rang my Aunty''s house, she and her brother in law immediately came but couldn&#8217;t get inside the house because the house gate was locked from inside, the BG''s had actually gained entry into the house by climbing up to the neighbors guest house wall and from that wall onto our ceiling then climbing down quietly inside the house via the stair case. 1 of them had knocked on the house main gate from inside but obviously when you are inside the bedroom you can&#8217;t really tell if the gate was knocked on from inside or outside. That''s why now every time I hear a knock on the main house gate at night time the first thing I always check in the window is the area outside the bedroom door to make sure it is clear. Anyway my Aunty lot starting banging on the house gate very loudly, my uncle later said one BG said to another lets go their "Rishte Daars are here lets go". Luckily they left, but with the M16, and my uncle''s wallet. Obviously their intention was to collect alot more than but they were interrupted. While they climbed up the stairs my uncle ran to his brother''s room to pick up another rifle and open fire on them from top of the roof while they were climbing down out of the house BUT BUT&#8230;NOW HERE COMES THE LESSON OR ADVICE for us all in here. He [U]could not[/U] find the other 2 Assault Rifles, they had in the house, [U]Because[/U] his elder brothers had kept and locked them somewhere and had not told him or any one where they were so no one remembered where they were, along with 6 Magazines and a box of 1000 Rounds Ammo. Then my uncle desperately ran for my grandfather''s single shot lever action 12 Bore rifle to take a few shots while they were escaping, and he found the rifle BUT couldn&#8217;t find the Ammo Belt for it. Hence, USELESS. So the BG&#8217;s successfully escaped, leaving him mentally and emotionally scarred for a long time after that.\n\nNow as we can see, there is a series of things that lead to failure on our side and the BG&#8217;s scoring high during the incident.\n\n1) Leaving the stair case door leading to the upper ceiling floor unlocked, which they used to gain entry inside the house. Despite my dad had previously warned them not to.\n\n2) Most importantly Miss-Management and &#8220;ZERO&#8221; PLANNING.\n Having plenty of Weapons and Ammo is not just the only thing required but Good Planning and Management are also extremely important. Because its not just a case of buying an expensive, reliable car, a good driver behind the wheel is also very important.\n\nI think the HD guns should be kept where immediate access can be gained within seconds because when you get an unwanted surprise from unwanted/ unexpected guests in the house you only have afew seconds to retaliate or response. That too if you are lucky. 1 second delay and you may be surrounded by guns pointing to your skull and then you may be helpless along with your family. \nMost of us will probably remember the attempted home invasion of our Brave and Proud PG brother Om Khan&#8217;s Incident about a year or two ago. Had he not had his CF98 under belt/ Chambered and had he not responded immediately soon as he saw one of the BG''s pulling out a TT, God knows what would have happened to him or them. Even then he took a bullet to his chest despite being so quick and ready. So imagine the rest of us where in most cases our guns are locked in our Cupboards and boxes far up where most can&#8217;t reach or gain instant access. In that case Forget it we are not going to do anything, you might as well surrender to the BG''s and let them rule your house or premises. Its good to be careful and cautious when it comes to handling guns with safety but often we almost develop Phobia or a Paranoia from touching or even getting too close to a gun or guns. What&#8217;s the point having one in the house then. For decoration. They should be kept ready for instant access or reach somewhere most BG''s will not find or suspect to find them easily but you will.\n\nHowever the BG''s were caught about 8 months later and the rifle along afew other items they took were recovered from them. Out of the 4 BG''s, Two, The Ring Leader and another one turned out to be far relative of ours. The other 2 were their friends. Infact the ringleader was kind of closely related. Who admitted he/they (BG''s) knew the main man responsible for looking after the house had gone to Hajj with his mother and they thought there were ladies only in the house and were unaware of the fact my other uncle had come on a vacation from Dubai and was present in the house at the time of the invasion which they said was abit of a surprise to them. According to the ring leader their plan was to lock all the ladies in one room and loot the house.\n\nThe main reason I shared this story with PG friends here is because I think you learn from your experiences and this might give them hints and tips for home defence planning and improvements. May Allah safe guard us all. Ameen.', ''),

CF98 though inexpensive, is a combat pistol which have been adopted by an army (hint: chinese handgun) and it has been exported and has been adopted by other armies as well. \n\nwhat does that tell ya? CF98 is designed for performance not looks. if these HP77, NP34, NP22 were that good, why would china invest so much money and resources in designing a new handgun for themselves. i''m sure any rational person would agree that it is alot easier to just copy a good design and adopt.\n\nEconomics also play a very important role here. you''ll have to follow me for a while here. you see, when u copy and clone a good design to very letter and spirit (to the minutest of details and quality wise). the price difference diminishes. so its pointless to clone a good handgun if it will eventually cost you the same. sure some difference in price will remain, depending on the difference in labor and raw material costs. but that difference is negligible. therefore, the only way to make a clone and make money in the process is to sacrifice somewhere. that sacrifice could be in from of manufacturing quality/performance or looks. now think gentlemen, if a clone is designed while sacrificing on the looks, it would definitely be "adoption worthy" cause its a good design to begin with and it performs good too. Then why the Chinese didn''t adopt the HP77, NP22, NP34? WHY NO OTHER ARMY HAS EXPRESSED INTEREST IN THEM TOO?\n\nRegards.[/QUOTE]\nThanks 12 gauge bro, right as you always.', ''),

However as a 2-month old pup, very much like our own kids, they are mouthy and like to play and grab things in their mouths.\n\nIt should not be mistaken for biting, per se. However if it continues after another 1-2 months, you can use a sharp, harsh "NO" each time the puppy shows unacceptable behaviour and remove any pleasurable experience/object. Please remember not to "hit" the pup/dog with anything at all. Dogs do not discipline their young by hitting or throwing things at them or kicking them; they grab, bite and overpower them! In order to train or mould (is that the right spelling?!) ur pup, u need to behave in the way and use the body language that he understands, not what we use :)\n\nSo, if you MUST use negative physical reinforcement, first of all subdue your anger at being bitten (this is not about revenge, but discipline) and grab a handful of scruff (the loose skin right behind the head) and give the pup a shake or two, while growling NO!\nDon''t overdo it, the objective is to make the puppy feel helpless and show him who the boss is, not hurt him :)\n\nI hope it helps.', ''),

Fact is 1000s of them have been exported and they are selling like hot cakes in the american civilian market since they are the only faithful clone of the MP5 available in the USA, that can easily be converted to an SBR, which would make it into a real MP5 (which is almost every american''s dream gun) \n4. This .308 supposedly NPB rifle is neither NPB nor is it going to be produced for the Pakistani market. Just like Versace, Gucci and Armani are made in China but sold in Europe and America, while chinese sell fake copies of them that not only look cheap but also have no pizzaz.

I''m moving back to the states this summer and wanted to buy a few items, but I keep having this feeling that I''ll be subjected to unnecessary and extra background checks (or worse) because I''m of Pakistani heritage (read brown skinned) and a Muslim.[/QUOTE]\n\n\nNot at all! Background checks only take a few minutes at most, and I''ve never been delayed or anything. I''ve heard of other people (non eastern/Muslim) getting delayed because the feds get their identity mixed up with other people. I''ve never even been stopped at an airport either, but did get stopped for a random search on the border driving into Canada of all places :crazy:\n\nAs for unnecessary or extra background checks, there is only one, the "NICS" (National Instant Criminal Background Check), where you fill out a form called the 4473. You fill this out if you buy a gun from a store.  Here is a PDF document of the form. You only have to fill out the first page, the dealer fills out the rest. \n[URL="http://www.atf.gov/forms/download/atf-f-4473-1.pdf"]\nhttp://www.atf.gov/forms/download/atf-f-4473-1.pdf[/URL]\n\n\nHowever, if you decide to buy a gun from a person rather than a store, you don''t have to do a background check. Just give them the money and they give you the gun. This is legal, by the way. A seller might ask you to write down some information for record, but most people don''t care and are not legally obligated to do so. \n\nWhat state are you moving to? The laws vary greatly by state. In most of America, there is no gun registration, but some states such as New York or California do have one in place, but the state keeps track of it rather than the federal government.', ''),

I was as excited as you, when I came across this forum over a year ago when I was doing abit of online research on Zastava M57, after purchasing a couple of them. One reason for my excitement was that since my very young age I''ve had a natural love for guns but back where I spent ma childhood, according to my elders if you had an interest in guns or Fire Arms, sadly you were labelled as some one bad, some one with negative or anti-social interests and someone with no interest in education or academics, which I strongly disagreed with but sadly being so Young and alone (in terms of interest) there was not much I could do to fight or argue my case.\n\n I am glade finally there is now a forum (from Pakistan) where civilised, law abiding decent Pakistani and other citizens can express and share their common interests and opinions in fire arms, sports shooting, hunting, and other leisure and re-creational activities. Alhumdulillah academically I did well and now with the grace of Allah I''ve a very decent job like the majority of PG Friends from all types of different fields and backgrounds, so I hope this proves the point to them like it has to the many globally that not every man with a gun is a Criminals, if not I dont really care what ppl think now. I''ve learnt alot and gained alot of knowledge from reading different threads shared by fellow PG''s during the last year and so, I probaby wouldn''t have been able to gain this much in my entire life else where. Its been a great help. If it wasnt for the help and knowledge from PG I would''t have been ble to make the right choices for myself, brothers and other friends. Now sometimes friends and relatives consult me when they feel the need to shop, which I am more than happy to help with, however I am just a learner like the rest.\n\nlooking forward to hearing from you more and hope you ur stay here[/QUOTE]\n\nThanks :) Gun forums are a great way to learn and meet people with common interests, AKA range buddies haha.\n\n[QUOTE=MK47;350025]Sorry I know the question was intended for Imran, but being in the same boat as you two living abroad but just in a different Country, Yes the chances are that will likely be the case. Its often the same here aswell, If you apply for sensitive jobs for example at the Airports, in the Aviation Industry or for a Shotgun/ Rifle License (Handguns are banned in the UK, only Shotgun and other Bolt Rifles etc Licenses are allowed), You are more likely to be grilled with extra questions and most likely will be subjected to extreme background/ History checks etc. Thats probably the main reason I''ve never bothered applying for a Shotgun License here, because every month you get a random visit by the authorities, they check your gun safe to make sure everything is where it is supposed to be kept, and even ask you certain questions like how many rounds have you fired since the last visit etc.\n\nBut don''t worry about all that because despite all that as long as your previous record is clean and you fulfill the required legal/documentational criteria it should be ok and You will get what you intend to get. The only difference is they might ask you afew more questions and carry out afew extra checks. Let them. who cares.[/QUOTE]\n\nSorry to hear about the state of the UK''s gun laws.

I''ve never even been stopped at an airport either, but did get stopped for a random search on the border driving into Canada of all places :crazy:\n\nAs for unnecessary or extra background checks, there is only one, the "NICS" (National Instant Criminal Background Check), where you fill out a form called the 4473. You fill this out if you buy a gun from a store.  Here is a PDF document of the form. You only have to fill out the first page, the dealer fills out the rest. \n[URL="http://www.atf.gov/forms/download/atf-f-4473-1.pdf"]\nhttp://www.atf.gov/forms/download/atf-f-4473-1.pdf[/URL]\n\n\nHowever, if you decide to buy a gun from a person rather than a store, you don''t have to do a background check. Just give them the money and they give you the gun. This is legal, by the way. A seller might ask you to write down some information for record, but most people don''t care and are not legally obligated to do so. \n\nWhat state are you moving to? The laws vary greatly by state. In most of America, there is no gun registration, but some states such as New York or California do have one in place, but the state keeps track of it rather than the federal government.[/QUOTE]\n\nThanks for the Info! Yeah the laws vary from state to state....as for now, I''ll be in Maryland (Baltimore or one of its suburbs) for the next two years, but after that I''m not sure. I wont be conceal carrying or anything...it will be mostly for range shooting.\n\nI''ve also never been stopped at any Domestic airports...I only get stopped at JFK in New York when I enter the country, but that''s because my passport was issued from the US embassy in Islamabad and not from america.', ''),

Hence, they''re equally fragile, theoretically.\n\nIf they don''t come forth and explain the difference, they''re both pieces of crap to us. And if they do mention any difference, they''d be bound to explain as to why the C model was weaker built than the F!!\n\nBro, we''re passengers of the same bandwagon, the results in front of me contradict nothing of whatever I said about the C model, since my impressions were always limited to the technical performance only of the handgun, not it''s built/durability part, which both only time can prove of new handguns.\n\nYes, the results are in front of us now and Caracal need to come forth and explain this incidence and what they intend to change within the manufacture processes before replacements?\n\nAs far as the "isolated incidence" is concerned, I meant to say that this could be concluded as well if we send in an F model or another C model. That is, if Caracal keep insisting that this was an "isolated" incidence.\n\nIf the  metallurgy hardness of another model sent in - c or f, preferably F - appears the same as the C model tested, it will prove that it''s [B]not[/B] an isolated incidence.\n\nI believe I managed to explain better now.

(512356, ' Hi guys, if I may offer an opinion from what I have observed as an outsider, but what prevents dealers from placing price tags or stickers on their inventory, is it common practice in all industries for prices to be verbally presented? In North America, it is common practice for everything to be in writing. That way, a customer knows the price is the price... and not "the price for him" because he seems less experienced, or because the shop owner doesn''t like him, or because he''s a newbie, ect. If you don''t like it, you can walk out, if you can''t afford it, you can look at something else. It saves everyone time, suspicion, and headache. \n\nRegarding copies (what we like to call "replicas"), we get them as well, in the form of Taurus, and mostly Norincos. The justification for buying those guns is, you pay less and sacrifice some finishing, but gain exceptional robustness and reliability, as you are familiar is the case with Chinese guns. However it seems your local gunsmiths can make a gun look absolutely perfect, but seldom do they work perfectly, at least not for extended periods of time. Otherwise, you would have some extremely desirable firearms on your hands! So, I''m curious as to what exactly is the cause of these performance issues? Since major manufacturers have production tolerances of less than a thousandth of an inch, has anyone ever taken a micrometer and compared the parts dimensions of, for example, a Glock and a Clock? As for metallurgy, a simple test would be to use a magnet to compare the composition and purity between the metal of genuine and cloned parts. Would anyone be interested in conducting this experiment and posting the results?', ''),

(512448, ' What''s been proven, time and again, to be the most reliable and durable handgun in the world ie. Glock, is striker fired. Striker fired pistols have the advantage of being a less complex mechanism, with less parts, than a hammer fired. Without the hammer, they also have the advantage of being more "de-horned"(smooth profile) by default, which is extremely important for a gun being concealed behind clothing. It is amazing the ways you can get caught up when you have to quick draw from concealed retention in a sd situation. A final advantage with striker fired is the consistent trigger pull, which means no stiff and long double action first shot, to a short and light single action second shot. Again, in an sd situation, the first two shots are the most important. That''s why all the new pistols like Springfield Armory XD and XDm, Smith & Wesson M and P serires, Glock Gen4, FN Five Seven are striker fired. With the hammer fired, they are typically (but not always!) older designs ie. Beretta 92, Sig P226, 1911, revolvers!', ''),

A lot of boar hunts turned bad when two or more dogs got into fights with each other while the boar sat and watched with a big bowl of popcorn! :-)\r\n\r\nDogo Argentinos were bred keeping in mind the unrelenting tenacity of a fighting dog mixed with the steadfast courage and desire to hunt down prey of a hunting hound. They were observed and tested through generations and carefully selected to make the right dog. So first of all, we can''t consider any big, muscular guard breed or fighting breed to be capable of this, secondly if they can, it will only be possible by acquiring them and socialising them from a young age in the hopes that they will learn to do the job. Yes, it IS possible but requires a lot of hard work and training. Dogos on the other hand, have it in their blood! ;-)\r\n\r\nHaving said that, If you want to go with a locally and easily available breed, I suggest you mix and match 3-4 dogs like Bully, Gull Terr, Gul Dong etc and work with them from day one starting with just allowing them to be friends and focus on a game/task as a team', ''),

It is water proof,  scratch proof, shock proof. You can leave it out of the tent under the  open sky in a cold wintry night or even if it is raining.  \n2. It is  also useful for hitting bushes to force the bird to fly, or for making  one''s way forward in thick bushes and shrubs, especially in Belas. \n3.  No need for cleansing, applying oil, or pulling a cloth in barrels  after firing. It is internally lubricated by the manufacturer for life  time. In 15 years, it has never tasted oil or lubricants etc. \n4.  Even if not loaded with cartridges, it is a useful tool for safety, as  it can be used to hit dangerous animals like pigs on the head if they  turn round at you. For this purpose it is also useful to pull down  robbers if they come unexpectedly in you way. \nThere are still many  many more qualities in my ZIMADAR. I love it, and i feel a kind of  satisfaction when it hangs by my shoulder. I would not give it for a  Beretta A400 Xtreme Optifade.[ATTACH=CONFIG]19192[/ATTACH][ATTACH=CONFIG]19193[/ATTACH][ATTACH=CONFIG]19194[/ATTACH][ATTACH=CONFIG]19195[/ATTACH][ATTACH=CONFIG]19196[/ATTACH]', ''),

(512540, 'A Hero......... in all my jaded cynical existence I dont think I have came across a story as heroic as this one. I mean the man refused to take even a sip of water even up to his dying breath!!\r\n\r\n\r\n[url]http://tribune.com.pk/story/486425/rail[/url] ... f-his-own/\r\n\r\nThe train was 10 minutes late but not Sohail Mehmood. As the Super Express pulled into the Landhi railway station, he saw a small boy crossing the tracks unaware of the approaching danger. Without giving it a second thought, Sohail dashed toward the kid, pushing him off the track. The child was badly hurt but alive. Sohail was not so lucky himself.\r\n\r\nAt 9:35am on August 7, families at the Landhi railway station held on to their luggage – and children – as the train made its way to platform No. 1. But for six-year-old Aminullah, who had come to Karachi from Thatta just to spend a few days with his grandfather, this was a playground.\r\n\r\n“The boy was playing with some other kids at the platform when the incident took place,” recalled his 62-year-old grandfather Javed Hussain. He lives in Daud Chali just beside the railway station.\r\n\r\n“Aminullah was saved by a God-fearing man but he has not come out of the shock so far,” said Hussain. “He frequently fights with his brothers and bites them too.”\r\n\r\nSecond among four brothers, Aminullah was badly hurt on the head and the back when Sohail pushed him between the railway tracks and the platform. While he was saved, the 38-year-old railways police constable was caught under the engine’s buffer and was dragged on until the train came to a stop.\r\n\r\n“He saw the train coming,” said a vendor, Syed Mohsin Shah, a witness to the perilous jump. “He didn’t care and jumped to save the child.”\r\n\r\n“The child was bleeding and trembling but alive,” said the assistant station master at Landhi, Naseem Ahmed.\r\n\r\n“Although Sohail was offered water once he was pulled out from under the locomotive, he refused to take a sip as he was fasting,” said Landhi railways police station SHO, Muhammad Saleem. “He died shortly after.”\r\n\r\nWhile\r\n\r\nThe father of four, with the youngest only six months old, Sohail joined the Railways police in 2001. Since then, he had saved a lady from an approaching train at Cantt station and another man at some other place, Sohail’s elder brother, Faiq Mehmood, told The Express Tribune.\r\n\r\n“He was distressed for more than two months when he couldn’t save a mentally challenged man who was run over by a train,” recalled Faiq. “Sohail should be awarded a Sitara-e-Jurat for his bravery.”\r\n\r\nThe Karachi Metropolitan Corporation administrator had announced a reward of Rs500,000 for the victim’s family, but Faiq said the family has yet to receive a single paisa. While his spokesperson claimed the “relevant department” was looking into the matter, Muhammad Hussain Syed could not be reached for comment.\r\n\r\n“We are proud of Sohail. His sacrifice has lifted the morale of the Railways police,” said Railways SSP Arshad Kamal Kiyani. The Pakistan Railways inspector general, Syed Ibn-e-Hussain, has approved the recommended “Tamgha-e-Shujat” for Sohail, which would be complimented with a reward of Rs500,000 for the bereaved family. Defence Saving Certificates worth Rs1,200,000 were awarded to Sohail’s widow while Rs300,000 each would be given by the Railways Police and Pakistan Railways, Kiyani said.\r\n\r\nThe railways cop, who saved Aminullah’s life at the cost of his own, was laid to rest with full state honours in the Zafar Town graveyard.\r\n\r\nPublished in The Express Tribune, December 30th, 2012.', ''),

Not to buy it in the first place.  But if u absolutely must. Then go for a design that has been around for some time. Say the berreta 92 fs. After the tt its the most copied ddesign. An original Zafar Alam should be nice. However even Zafar''s products are being cloned. kind of like clones of clones. \n\nOther then that the weapon that u have yourself. its a sturdy design if made by a good gunsmith and finaly the Taurus PT 92. That the range master at ASCC GC has used and rates well (Around 1000 rounds life.. About all that''s expected from a clone) \n\nMy personal favourite is the Taurus 909 cause it looks so darned good!\n\nNO striker fired polymer offerings regardless of how they look!! \n\nEven reputed brands like Caracal and sigma have problems emulating the Glock design. I shudder to think what our local mistries will do with plastic parts and strikers...  Remember the chances are remote that they have access to weapons grade polymer....

I have used wood slab 3/4 inch thickness for target practice with Hatsan 125. Firing distance at my home is 11 yards (33 feet).

You may not want to on guns with free floating firing pins since it may cause excess wear and tear as they get slammed around with no resistance during dry firing. For rim fires, since the firing pin is aligned with the rim of the case, if there is no bullet there, it may strike the edge of the chamber as a result. Not only do I do a lot of dry fire practice, but often when I''m sitting in front of the TV, I like to fondle a fine firearm and dry fire it.

(512795, ' I just want to strongly second Txshooter''s sentiments that without proper knowledge and training, you''re better off not having a gun. I mean proper sd training. In no way am I trying to be discouraging, but there''s a lot of b.s. out there, like catchy phrases about carrying a gun, and slogans about defending oneself (just reading people''s signatures in the forums makes me shake my head sometimes-no offense to anyone here) yet no matter how many videos you watch, how many posts you read, how many times you go through it in your head, it will not prepare you IF that moment comes. Another thing I''d like to touch on, and admittedly I know nothing about the Pakistani legal system, but where I''m from it doesn''t matter if you''re 200% justified, 99.999 times out of 100 you will have to defend yourself in court (at your own expense) after you shoot someone. If you are shooting in a sd scenario, you are shooting to kill, and like Nazim Bro said, it is not done as easily as said. Taking a life is not something that is easy to live with. I know i live on the other side of the world and I''m not Pakistani, but we''re all human. Once again, I''m not trying to be discouraging at all, but just trying to offer you some food for thought based on my experience. Yes, it''s very scary being victimized, but when it comes to, guns it''s better to take things slow and one step at a time. You are brand new to guns, and there is nothing wrong with that as we all were at some time, but when you speak of carrying condition 1 (round in the chamber, cocked and locked) and drawing from concealed positions and ankle holsters, those are all very advanced techniques. Anyways, take advantage of all the brothers here who want to do all they can to help, keep safe and good luck!\r\n  \r\nIf you take away nothing from what I say, just remember this: your first mistake with a firearm, may be your last mistake in life.', ''),

(512837, ' [QUOTE=A.Abbas;86350]Dear bro, this is indeed a recoil buffer, here is my explaination\n\n1- The purpose of recoil buffer used in the handguns (specially ones the can fire P+ ammo and essential for ones with polymer frame) is to reduce the impact of slide on the frame under the pressure of the fired round to increase the life of gun.\n\n2- There are two kinds of recoil buffers used today, i) add ons are mostly silicon/rubber pads, ii)Spring type\n\n3- How it works? ones with silicon/rubber pads, principle is simple they just absorbs the energy, In spring based systems, it is usually built in guide rod and buffer spring is shorter and harder than the main spring, when the slide moves back under presser it depresses the main spring and when it reaches aprox 80-90 % of its travel, the tension of main spring increased enough to activate the buffer spring to slow down the slide speed aprox 30-50% (depends on the design) and avoids the hard impact of slide on the frame (act like a sort of shock absorber).\n\nNow let me explain why I think you are explanation is not correct.\n\nIn every gun design and you know much better than me that main criteria is the reliability and safety and now a day weight too and the cost to some extent, \ni) with more moving parts, there is more chance of failure.\nii) Economic point of view, there are more man hours needed to make (in this case) three piece guide rod (main rod, screwing with another one with spring to avoid unscrewing) don''t make sense. And if the weight was issue, they might have used polymer rod as they can make polymer frames and many manufacturers using polymer guides i.e. S&W, Barreta etc. or a hollow rod etc.\n\nhere is pic of CF 98 spring which I believe is recoil buffer.\n \n[URL="http://www.postimage.org/image.php?v=TsTpum9"][IMG]http://s2.postimage.org/Tpum9.jpg[/IMG][/URL]\nand let me add one more thing, rear part is a moving part.[/QUOTE]\n\n\nI have a question regarding the moving part screw.

Hence, they''re equally fragile, theoretically.\n\nIf they don''t come forth and explain the difference, they''re both pieces of crap to us. And if they do mention any difference, they''d be bound to explain as to why the C model was weaker built than the F!!\n\nBro, we''re passengers of the same bandwagon, the results in front of me contradict nothing of whatever I said about the C model, since my impressions were always limited to the technical performance only of the handgun, not it''s built/durability part, which both only time can prove of new handguns.\n\nYes, the results are in front of us now and Caracal need to come forth and explain this incidence and what they intend to change within the manufacture processes before replacements?\n\nAs far as the "isolated incidence" is concerned, I meant to say that this could be concluded as well if we send in an F model or another C model. That is, if Caracal keep insisting that this was an "isolated" incidence.\n\nIf the  metallurgy hardness of another model sent in - c or f, preferably F - appears the same as the C model tested, it will prove that it''s [B]not[/B] an isolated incidence.\n\nI believe I managed to explain better now.

(512930, '44 Short The 44 hort was largely a handgun cartridge although it could be fired in most arms chambered for the 44 Long rimfire. It is well established in old catalogs dating from the period around 1870 and was chambered in popular pistols and revolvers, including those made by Allen, Forehand & Wadsworth and Remington. It is best noted as being the cartridge for the single shot Hammond "Bulldog" pistol made by the Connecticut Arms & Mfg. Company of Naubuc, Conn. This pistol is believed to have been marketed before the end of the Civil War, and this would place the date of origin of the 44 Short at about 1864-65. It has been obsolete since the 1920s. \n\nThe rimfire 44 Short is a better handgun cartridge than the 41 Short or Long, but was not generally as popular. The type and variety of guns that chambered it were rather limited. Original load was a 200- or 210-grain outside-lubricated bullet and 15 to 17 grains of black-powder. Velocity was low, but with the 200-grain bullet, short-range stopping power would be fairly good. It is similar to the center-fire British 44 Webley cartridge in performance.', ''),

(512943, ' [h=2]7mm Mauser (7x57mm)[/h] 				   						 						 				 					 						[INDENT] 							Developed as a military cartridge by Mauser and introduced in  1892, the 7mm Mauser was adopted by the Spanish government and chambered  in a limited quantity of Model 92 Mauser bolt-action rifles, which were  a modification of the Belgian pattern 89. In 1893, Spain adopted a new  model Mauser in this same caliber. This rifle has been called the  Spanish Mauser ever since, although it was also adopted by Mexico and a  number of South American countries. Remington chambered their rolling  block and Lee rifles for the 7mm about 1897, and later the Model 30. The  Winchester Model 54 and 70 also chambered it. Currently, the Ruger  Model 77 and Winchester Featherweight bolt action, plus the Ruger Number  One single shot offer the 7mm as standard among American-made rifles.  However, most British-and European-made bolt-action rifles and  combination guns chamber the 7mm Mauser, as do many custom-made rifles  each year.\n\nAlthough originally a military cartridge, the 7x57mm Mauser has proven  itself as one of the best all-around sporting rounds ever developed. It  is particularly useful in lightweight rifles because it delivers good  killing power with  moderate recoil. It has been used successfully on  every species of big game on earth, including elephant. However, it is  no elephant cartridge in the true sense of the term and its success is  due largely to the hunting conditions and ability of the hunters who  have used it. Ballistically, it is only less powerful than 270  Winchester or the 280 Remington. It is adequate for most American big  game, but is perhaps on the light side for Kodiak bear or moose unless  used by an experienced hunter. The 7mm Mauser was discontinued in  American-made rifles about 1940 due to lack of popularity. Since the end  of WWII, it has become increasingly common due to the influx of surplus  7mm military rifles for several years after the war. The wide selection  7mm bullets now available for hand-loading has also contributed to an  increase in popularity. 						\n[/INDENT]', ''),

What I think is needed to put that into context, is a test of other guns (from Caracal and/or other reputable manufacturers producing the same class and category of product) to determine whether they too will fail under the same or similar conditions. Only then can the groundwork be formed, in a case for or against the issues at hand. Otherwise a single defective product is relatively meaningless when it comes to mass produced consumer products.[/QUOTE]\n\nI second Fudgepacker bro.

In the end, it is just one gun. It could be Quality Control error. Well, we must wait for Caracal to respond. They have called back a product worldwide. It is obvious that they are concerned and they must be busy in tracing the error and finding the solution. As per my knowledge, they have stopped all shipments since first / safety recall till they find the issue which is quite positive step.\n\nNow, regarding Pakistan''s market, in the past, many dealers imported Caracals. Now they are left with few pieces and they are more interested in getting rid of those, instead of going back to company and wait for replacement / repayments. By the way, there is no clear way as to how this recall thing will work in Pakistan as Caracal will not be able to export existing Caracals back to UAE.

As moeen bhai and skeeter sb have mentioned, the proof is in the pudding. No extra words necessary.  \nThis particular incident happened with kkhan8''s caracal. and with considerable help from moeen bhai and skeeter sb, proper testing was done on the said caracal and then the results  posted on this forum.\nIf anyone feels that this was an isolated incident and all other caracals are safe, it is possible.

The 6.5, in ture, was based on the 1893 7x57 Mauser  necked-down. Now this a very interesting situation because it means the 6x57 is practically identical to the modern 244 Remington. The only difference would be in the shoulder angle. The 244 Remington is the 257 Roberts necked-down to 6mm (244) and with the shoulder angle increased from 20 degrees, 45 minutes to 26 degrees. The commercial 257 Roberts was originated by simply necking-down the original 7x57 Mauser without other notable changes. By a long and devious process, different individuals and companies arrived at practically the same point, but at different times. It just goes to prove that there is really very little that is new under the sun.[/FONT]\n  [FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n  [FONT=&quot]Records of the ballistics or what specific rifle the 6x57 was used are in lacking.

(513168, '357 Auto Mag The 357 Auto Mag is an outgrowth of the 44 Auto Mag, and is based on the 44 Auto Mag case necked-down to the 357-caliber. The 44 Auto Mag in turn is made by cutting off 30-06 and 308 Winchester brass to a final length of 1.298-inch and inside reaming to accept a .429-inch diameter bullet. The first Auto Mag pistols were announced in 1970, but were not actually delivered until late in 1970. These were, of course, in 44-caliber and the 357 Auto Mag didn''t appear until 1973. For an extra $150 one could purchase both the 357 and 44 barrel and slide assembly units and convert the pistol to handle either caliber with relatively easy change of units. The 357 Auto Mag cartridge was never made commercially. However, the 44 case was made in Mexico for a time so that conversions of these to the smaller caliber can be encountered. The Auto Mag semi-auto pistols are not currently in production although there have been rumors that they may be manufactured again at some future date.\n\nThe 357 and 44 Auto Mag pistols were of stainless steel, had a 6 1/2-inch barrel. overall length of 11 1/2 inches and weighed 3.4 pounds. In other words, they were quite large and heavy. The 357 Auto Mag pushed the 158-grain jacketed bullet at a muzzle velocity of 1600 fps and the 110-grain bullet at over 1900 fps when loaded to maximum performance levels. This is certainly well over anything possible from the 357 Magnum revolver. Auto Mag pistols in 357 have been used with success on everything from varmint to deer and possibly even larger animals. Like practically all of the more powerful handgun cartridges, the ballistics of the 357 Auto Mag are on the marginal side for big game, but like the others, it will certainly do the job in the hands of a good shot and accomplished hunter. as a self-defense weapon, the Auto Mag pistols are a bit on the unwieldy side and were actually intended more for sporting use.', ''),

(513178, '44 Long The rimfire 44 Long apparently originated with the Ethan Allen carbine patented in 1860 and manufactured by Allen & Wheelock of Worcester, Mass. It was later adapted to rifles made by Ballard, Howard, Remington, Robinson and F. Wesson. It was a fairly popular round, but replaced by similar center-fire types. It became obsolete by the early 1920s.\n\nWith a 220-grain bullet an 28 grains of black-powder, the 44 Long was a fairly potent short-range cartridge for any small to medium game. The 44-40 WCF rapidly became the dominant 44-caliber cartridge after it was introduced in 1873. It could be re-loaded and was available in repeating rifles and revolvers, important factors on the western frontier. Other 44 cartridges, particularly the rimfire, gradually declined in use and popularity. The 44 Long is not powerful or as accurate as the 44-40.', ''),

(513190, ' [B]243 Winchester[/B]\n\nThe 243 Winchester was introduced by Winchester in 1955 for their Model  70 bolt-action and Model 88 lever-action rifles. The 243 was quickly  adopted by Savage for their Model99 lever- and Model 110 bolt-action  rifles. All or the British and European manufacturers began chambering  bolt-action rifles for this round, including BSA, FN, Sako, Husqvarna,  Mannlicher-Schoenauer and others. In fact, even Remington, who developed  their own 6mm, had to recognize the popularity of the 243 and start  chambering their rifles for it. The 243 (6mm) Winchester is nothing more  than the 308 Winchester case necked-down. Original development and  publicity was due largely to the efforts of gun writer, the late Warren  Page, who along with other wildcatters worked out a similar version  before Winchester. The 243 is probably chambered in more different  rifles than any other cartridge, except possibly the 308 Winchester.\nThe 243 Winchester represents a successful effort to develop a  varmint-to-deer class rifle that could hold its own with the various  high-velocity 22s for extremely long-range use on small targets and  still be adequate for the larger animals. The 243 does this job so well  that it has taken a lot of play away from the 222 Remington and all the  rest of the 22 cartridges. It eliminates the need to own two different  rifles for anything from small game and pests right up to and including  deer, antelope or black bear. The 80-grain bullet is intended primarily  for varmint and medium-sized game and the 100-grain bullet for deer  -size animals. The 257 Roberts and the 250-3000 Savage are supposed to  cover the same range and certainly do. However, the 25-caliber bullets  don''t have quite the sectional density for long-range varmint shooting  until bullet weights gets up around 120-grains, and then the velocity  falls off badly. All in all, the 6mm does a better job in covering the  intended range of game and shooting conditions.', ''),

In 1964, it was  officially adopted by the U.S. Army as the 5.56mm Ball cartridge Ma93.  It is used in the selective-fire M16 rifle, which is based on the  original AR-15 design. The cartridge was actually the work of Robert  Hutton, who was technical editor of GUNS & AMMO magazine and had a  rifle range i n Topanga Canyon, California. One of the requirements for  the cartridge was that the projectile have a retained velocity in excess  of the speed of sound (about 1080 fps at sea level) at 500 yards,  something you couldn''t get with the 222 Remington. Working with Gene  Stoner of Armalite, Bob Hutton developed a case slightly longer than the  222 and also had Sierra make a 55-grain boat-tail bullet. This  combination met the design requirements. All this was documented in the  1971 issue of the GUNS & AMMO ANNUAL. However, this author was not  aware of this and has stated in previous editions that he didn''t believe  that this information had ever been published. Originally an alternate  military cartridge, the 223 (5.56mm) is now the official U.S. and NATO  round, but we should note here that NATO forces, including the U.S.,  have standardizes a new 5.56mm round with a heavy bullet and the M193 is  no longer standard.\nShortly after the military adopted the cartridge, Remington brought out  the sporting version, which has largely replaced the 222 Remington  Magnum in popularity. Practically every manufacturer of bolt-action  rifles has at least one model chambered for the 223. In addition, there  are a large number of military-type semi-auto rifles available in this  caliber and at one time the Remington Model 760 slide-action was  available in 223.\n\nThe 223 is nearly identical to the 222 Remington Magnum, the only  difference being that the 223 has a slightly shorter case. The two are  not inter-changeable, although the 223 will chamber in a 222 Magnum  rifle. The result, though, is to create a gross head space problem, and  the 223 case will rupture if fired in the 222 Magnum chamber. The 223  has proven to be an effective military cartridge for fighting in jungle  or forested areas and for close-in fire support, and has been improved  lately by NATO with heavier bullets fired through fast-twist (1 in  7-inch) barrels. As a sporting round, it is just as accurate as any of  the other long-range, center-fire 22s. Military brass cases are usually  heavier than commercial cases and maximum loads should be reduced by at  least 10 percent and approached cautiously, because the reduced case  capacity results in a higher loading density and increased pressure with  the same powder charge. The 223 Remington can be classed as an  excellent medium-range varmint cartridge at ranges out to around 250  yards.\n\n[SIZE=5][B]EDITORIAL NOTE: In 1979, SAAMI cautioned shooters that 5.56mm military  chambers and throats differ from 223 sporting rifle chambers, and  therefore military ball ammo may produce high chamber pressures in  sporting rifles. At least one manufacturer, Ruger, harumphed that its  223 chambers would handle military 5.56mm with no problems. 						\n[/B][/SIZE][/INDENT][SIZE=5][/SIZE]\n[SIZE=5][/SIZE]\n[SIZE=5][/SIZE]', ''),

(513398, ' Everyone who has posted below me has each a valid point. It was I who was not very clear in my post.\n What i meant to say was that if someone, who is living in North America, views the cost of most things in Pakistan (not considering the high prices in Pakistan of automobiles, gasoline or any item that is imported especially from Europe and North America   etc), then prices of goods are much lower in Pakistan than in North America. \n\nOfcourse, if you are earning in Pakistan, then we also have to consider that  the average person''s salary/income is also far lower (therefore purchasing price is also lower) when compared to North America.\n Labour in Pakistan  is quite cheap when compared to the price of labour in North America.\nHence, the cost of gasoline in Pakistan, which is now in excess to USD 1 per litre, actually hurts the average Pakistani MORE as he does not earn anywhere close to what his counterpart in North America would earn.\n\n\nApologies to OP for going off-topic.   The Allion is beautiful vehicle, however, you have to keep in mind that its service and parts would be far more expensive when compared to a locally assembled Corolla which would be had for a lower price and would hold its value far better. Ofcourse, if these things are not a consideration then by all means go to the allion. \nBy the way, you have not mentioned the YEAR. If it is a 2007, then these are in the market for Rs. 1.95 million +  so the vehicle you are interested in seems like it is being offered for a  reasonable price. Ofcourse, you MUST always bargain and try for a lower price than what the vehicle is being offered to you.', ''),

(513406, ' Dear fudge packer, as mentioned earlier my experience with hand guns is so limited that I don''t consider myself qualified enough to profer an opinion on the matter and prefer to listen to the experts on this forum. Namely, moeen bhai and skeeter sb, however I have learned the hard way, and I would give the same advice to my own kid and younger brother, that when your life depends on something, you should get nothing but the best. \nWhen you want to go fast, you can get a Ferrari or you can get a civic and soup it up to go faster than a Ferrari. But with a Ferrari you know you''re safe out of the box. It doesn''t mean ferrari''s don''t catch fire when over heated, but you put your faith in the ferrari''s extensive racing experience that it will mostly do what it is made for I.e. go fast in a safe fashion.\nIn hand guns, after nearly getting my skull punctured I''ve figured that it would be best to stick with either a CZ or a glock and maybe a sig. The only thing probably more reliable would be a revolver. Frankly, i''m not even into handguns, I just like to kill clay pigeons with my ever faithful baikal o/u. Although, after the caracal incident kkhan8 did go out and get himself a gen4 g17. He already has a CZ75. He does feel more confident firing the g17 and he does fire it regularly at our farm.\nAs to your question about what I want from all this... I want you to be safe.

Unfortunately, it was introduced in the 1870s at a time when the 44-40 Winchester was establishing a reputation in the far West. It had a very short life and was obsolete by the 1880s. The exact date of introduction is a little vague, but probably between 1870-75. It is unmistakably listed in the 1876 catalogs as adapted to Ballard, Remington and F. Wesson rifles.\n\nThe 44 Long is not as good a general purpose cartridge as the 44-40 Winchester. For one thing it used as outside-lubricated bullet and in addition the overall length was long for many repeating actions. It was loaded with a 218-grain bullet and 46 grains of black-powder. It was not noted for great accuracy . In power it would be primarily a small to medium game number, possibly suitable for deer under ideal conditions.

(513454, ' [h=2]30-06 Springfield[/h] 				   						 						 				 					 						[INDENT] 							The 30-06 Springfield is a United States military cartridge  adopted in 1906 for the Model 1903 Springfield service rifle, which was  based on the Mauser bolt-action system. The 30-06 is actually a  slightly-modified version of the original 1903 cartridge, which was  loadedwitha 220-grain round-nosed bullet at a muzzle velocity of 2300  fps. Because of cartridge developments in Europe, it was considered  advisable to change to a 150-grain bullet at an increased velocity of  2700 fps, and at the same time the case neck was shortened by 0.7-inch.  This improved round was designated the " Ball Cartridge, caliber 30,  Model of 1906" but in practice, nomenclature was shortened to 30-06. The  30-06 version can be chambered and fired in any rifle made for the  original 1903 round, but the reverse is not always true because of the  difference in case length. For many years both the 1903 and 1906  loadings and case configurations were loaded by sporting ammunition  manufacturers. Shooting the ''06 in the ''03 chamber reportedly gave poor  accuracy. Old catalogs list both rounds, and occasionally the 1903  version is called the 30-45 because the original loading used 45 grains  of smokeless powder.\nAgain, because of military developments in Europe, the Army switched to a  172-grain bullet with a 9-degree boat-tail in 1926, the new round being  designated the "Ball, caliber 30, M1." Muzzle velocity, originally the  same as the 150-grain load of 2700 fps, was later reduced to 2640  because of difficulty maintaining pressure specifications at the higher  velocity. In 1940, the 150-grain flat-base bullet was re-adopted as the  "Cartridge Ball, caliber 30, M2". The return to the lighter bullet came  about, at least in part, because of difficulties adopting the then-new  Garand semi-auto rifle to handle 172-grain loading.\nThe rimless 30-03 and the later 30-06 replaced the older rimmed 30-40  Krag as the official U.S. military round. The 30-06 has, in its turn,  been superseded by the 7.62mm M59, also known as the 7.62 NATO or, in  its commercial version 308 Winchester. As a sporting cartridge, the  30-06 is one of the most popular and widely-used big game numbers ever  developed.  In Europe it is known as 7.62x63mm. Every manufacturer of  standard length bolt-action sporting rifles in the western world  chambers the 30-06.\nThe Winchester Model 1895 lever-action appears to have been the first  sporting rfle chambered for the new 30-03. The cartridge was added to  the line of available calibers in 1904-1905, the modified 1906 round in  1908. The Remington bolt-action Model 30, introduced in 1921, and the  Winchester bolt-action Model 54 brought out in 1925 both offered the  30-06, among other calibers. The savage bolt-action Model 40 and 45  Super-Sporter rifles were also chambered when introduced in 1928. At  present, in addition to the many bolt-action rifles, the Remington Model  Six slide action and Four semi-auto, as well as the Browning and  Heckler & Koch semi-auto, include the 30-06 as standard calibers.  The Ruger Number One single shot rifle is also offered in 30-06.\n\nThe 30-06 is undoubtedly the most flexible, all-round big game cartridge  available to hunter. For many years it has been the standard by whch  all other big game cartridges have been measured. To say that a  cartridge is in the 30-06 class means it is suitable for any game in  North America. The secret of success when using this cartridge is to be  sure and select the right bullet for the game and hunting conditions at  hand. The lighter bullets of 100 to 130 grains be used only for varmint  hunting. While these bullets can be driven at impressive velocities,  starting out at over 3000 fps, they  are made to expand rapidly on small  animals and will not penetrate properly on large game. For deer,  antelope, goat, sheep, black or brown bear, under most hunting  conditions, the 150- or 165-grain bullet is proper. For heavier game  such as elk, moose or the big brown bear, the 180-,200- or 220-grain  bullet is the best choice. These are also considered best for woods or  brush hunting, regardless of the quarry. Many experienced hunters  consider the 180-grain bullet the most satisfactory all-round loading  for the 30-06 because it can be used effectively on anything from  deer-sized animals to the heaviest varieties under almost any hunting  conditions. When hand-loaded with the 250-grain bullet, the 30-06  practically duplicates the performance of the British 318 Rimless-Nitro,  popular in many parts of Africa for shooting plains game. As a matter  of fact, the 30-06 will give a good account on all but the heaviest or  most dangerous African or Asiatic species under average hunting  conditions. The 220-grain bullet is generally recommended for African  game although the 180-grain also has a good reputation there. With the  proper bullet, this cartridge can be adapted to any game or hunting  situation in North or South America, whether in the mountains, plains,  woods or jungles. 						\n[/INDENT]', ''),

(513482, '6x58 Forster.   6x58R Forster These two cartridges are identical except that one is rimless and the other rimmed. They were introduced about 1904 and have obsolete for a good many years. Physical measurement indicates this round is based on the 6.5x58 Mauser necked-down. It apparently was used in both bolt-action and single or combination guns.\n\nThe rimless version of the 6x58 closely resembles the 244 Remington, although they differ in shoulder angle and length of the neck. Available ballistics list a 127-grain bullet, but at one time a 119-grain and a 123-grain were also available. Performance is a little below the 243 Winchester, but with modern powders and a strong bolt-action one could undoubtedly equal the 243 or the 244 in any given bullet weight. This would be a good deer-class or possibly elk cartridge. Ammunition could be made by necking-down 6.5x58 cases for the rimless version, but the rimmed type would be a problem.', ''),

(513509, ' Hi Imran;\r\n\r\n Gun law in Pakistan is very similar to US gun law.  There''s a Federal government with various laws and regulations, and then each province has its own laws and regulations.  \r\n\r\n The main law is the Ordnance Act of 1965, which is similar to the US Gun Control Act of 1968 in scope.  It is quite short and easy to understand, and like most official documents in Pakistan, written in English, which makes it a whole lot easier for those of us who are only fluent in that language. \r\n\r\n PakGuns'' moderators take a very conservative interpretation of the Federal and provincial gun laws, and there are things that are legal in some parts of Pakistan that are barred from discussion here.

(513524, ' [SIZE=+1]One weekend, a man from the city decided to go duck hunting. He headed \n for the country and stopped at a field that looked as though it could \n attract ducks. While walking through a field, several ducks flew \n overhead. He aimed, fired, and shot one of the ducks out of the sky. \n However, the duck landed on the other side of a large irrigation ditch \n with no signs of any nearby crossing. \n He briefly thought about leaving the duck but realized that the \n weather was becoming worse. Not wanting to return home empty handed, \n he decided to try and find some way across. About a quarter mile \n further ahead he found a crossing and, as he walked back along the \n other side, came across a farmer who was carrying his duck. \n "Excuse me?" he said, "I believe that''s my duck you''re carrying." \n "Oh I don''t think so," replied the farmer, "It landed on my property. \n This here''s my duck." \n They argued back and forth for a few minutes and then the farmer \n suggested a solution. \n "Let''s settle this the country way. We''ll take turns kicking each \n other in the balls and the first man to give in, gives up the duck." \n The hunter thought about it for a minute. At first he questioned the \n sanity of engaging in a "ball-kicking" contest but felt he was tough \n enough and accepted the challenge. \n "Alright then," Said the farmer, "I''ll go first." \n The hunter took a deep breath and prepared himself for the blow. The \n farmer reared back and kicked the hunter in the balls as hard as he \n could. The hunter moaned and dropped to the ground, rolling around in \n pain as he grasped his groin. After several minutes the hunter \n recovered to his feet, took several deep breaths and said, "Okay, now \n it''s my turn." \n The farmer looks at the hunter, shakes his head and says, "Oh, that''s \n okay, you can have you''re duck."

(513638, ' These kits aren''t available in Pakistan you''ll have to import them, and then you need a good hand who knows working with airguns to install them. Initially I was inclined on getting one of these installed but I then I held back. \n\nI''ve followed Rick Eutsler''s comments on Hatsan 125 and he advised against installing a gas ram as you''d loose some power (about 2fpe) and he just didn''t like the idea generally.\n\nif you ask for my personal opinion, I''d advise against it due to following reasons:\n\n-you loose power\n-it''ll cost you more\n-the gun is reliable enough to loose only 2fpe after an extensive use, even 26-27 fpe is VERY POWERFUL, not even NIB break barrel air rifle of any other brand gives you that much of power\n-the gun already is accurate enough\n-of all the hunting I''ve done, I didn''t have to keep it cocked for more than 4-5 mins. 95% of the times it was load and shoot immediately.\n-In the test above the extreme spread of Hatsan mod 125 is only 11fps, which is VERY acceptable and consistent.\n\nFrom the links you posted I believe newer generation of Hatsan airguns will come pre-installed (or have it as an option) with Vortex gas kits, so if you feel a need to change your gun, buy a brand new, latest model Hatsan air gun :D, they are not heavy on one''s pocket, have proven to be reliable (at-least for me) and off you the BEST BANG for your hard earned bucks in its price category.', ''),

(513824, '44 Henry Flat This is an old and historic cartridge, one of the milestones in the development of modern arms and ammunition. It was developed by B. Tyler Henry for the lever-action repeating rifle bearing his name, the forerunner of the first Winchester rifle. The Henry rifle was manufactured by the New Haven Arms Co. from 1860 to 1866, at which time it was recognised as the Winchester Repeating Arms Co. The 44 Henry cartridge was manufactured from 1860-61 to about 1934. There are two versions of the cartridge. The early case was .815-inch long. Bullet and powder charge were the same. Colt revolvers were also made in 44 Henry caliber. The Henry rifle and cartridge saw limited use in the Civil War.\n\nThe 44 Henry, although quite successful, was not a very powerful round. Hardly adequate for deer-size animals and certainly no match for buffalo or grizzly bear, its principal advantage was in the 15-shot repeating rifle. This provided an undreamed of firepower, something that could be decisive in combat. In recognition of this fact, Winchester brought out an improved rifle and the 44-40 cartridge in 1873. From that date on, Winchester was in continuing competition with the makers of single shot rifles and their big powerful buffalo cartridges. The 44 Henry used a 200-grain bullet and 26-28 grains of black-powder.', ''),

(513830, '357 Herrett Although the 30 Herrett proved to be a good handgun cartridge when used in 10- or 14-inch barrel of the Thompson/Center Contender single shot pistol, it was obvious that it could be improved for hunting heavy game. One solution was to neck it up to 357-caliber so as to use larger diameter, heavier bullets and this was done in the initial powder capacity of the original 30 Harrett case and so the final design used a case length of 1.75 inches which is .15-inch longer than the 30 Harrett case. The development of the 357 Harrett was the work of Steve Herrett and gun writer Bob Milek. It was introduced as the standard caliber for the Thompson/Center pistol in 1974 or 1975. Cases are made by reforming, shortening, and necking-up 30-30 or 32 Winchester Special brass. The case has a 30-degree shoulder angle, and after forming, the cases are fire formed to the final configuration.\n\nThe 357 Herrett is another example of a wildcat cartridge developed for a specific weapon and purpose where there is a gap in the commercial line of ammunition. It was intended primarily as a hunting cartridge for the heavier varieties of big game, however, it has also become quite popular among silhouette shooters. It does very well for both purposes, but one must bear in mind that as a big game cartridge it delivers ballistics inferior to the 35 Remington fired from a rifle. While it is perfectly capable of handling large animals under average conditions, much depends of the skill of the user, something that is true of all handguns and handgun cartridges when used on big game. The 357 Herett is, nevertheless, one of the best of the handgun cartridges for field use on large or small game. When fired from 14-inch barrel of a Thompson/Center pistol, 110-grain bullet loaded over 28 grains of "2400" powder produces the muzzle velocity of 2600 fps and muzzle energy at 1650 fpe, on the other side, a 180-grain bullet with 32 grains of "N200" powder reduces the muzzle velocity to 2125 fps but gains on muzzle energy which increases to 1808 fpe.', ''),

I thought, it was the usual prelude for asking money because the wallet got lost, so I told him, no, please proceed.\n\n"Sir, quit smoking", he said, to my big surprise ! I appreciated his genuine concern, I really did.\n \n2 minutes later he kicked off his bike and just when turning around for his ride, got a phone call and started answering this with one hand, head tilted to control the phone, other hand on the bike whilst still slowly taking his bike out of the parking lot. I had to intervene here and cried out to him to come back over. On his approach, I asked him "Bro, would you mind if I asked you for something"? "No", he said.\n\n"Don''t use your phone whilst driving", I told him. And further: "My cigarette kills myself mainly, your phone could kill others as well"! We both laughed and he sped off.\n\nBro, our people - generally - have a " who cares " kind of approach towards things in general. We''re not "regular" people, our Iesco and Sui gas bills are usually paid on the last due date, agree with me or not.

Sadly, our people are the least "regular" with things, no matter which area of social life we talk about.\n\nIn my opinion, fastening seat belts as one precaution and then talking over the phone whilst driving, wow, what a combo there, lolz!\n\n2 days back in Islamabad, tired from the days business, I stepped out of my car and leaning over a railing in front of some shops for a relaxing couple of puffs on the cig (yeah, I''m back on them!), a young chap came over and asked me :"Sir, would you mind if I asked you for something"? I thought, it was the usual prelude for asking money because the wallet got lost, so I told him, no, please proceed.\n\n"Sir, quit smoking", he said, to my big surprise ! I appreciated his genuine concern, I really did.\n \n2 minutes later he kicked off his bike and just when turning around for his ride, got a phone call and started answering this with one hand, head tilted to control the phone, other hand on the bike whilst still slowly taking his bike out of the parking lot. I had intervene here and cried out to him to come back over. On his approach, I asked him "Bro, would you mind if I asked you for something"? "No", he said.\n\n"Don''t use your phone whilst driving", I told him. And further: "My cigarette kills myself mainly, your phone could kill others as well"! We both laughed and he sped off.\n\nBro, our people - generally - have a " who cares " kind of approach towards things in general. We''re not "regular" people, our Iesco and Sui gas bills are usually paid on the last due date, agree with me or not. Seat belts usually are fastened by our people at entering/exiting toll booths, mainly, with Police standing to the sides.\n\n[B]@Deathrow[/B]..........Thanks for the kind words bro, appreciated, and thanks for the clarification as well.\n\n\nRegards.[/QUOTE]\n\n\n\nI second that... if we become just a little bit more careful in everything we do, we`d be living in a different Pakistan all together...\n\nOur problem is that our confidence upon our abilities and skills has become a threat to our own existence..', ''),

Many military rifles have been  manufactured in both full-length and carbine versions.

(513958, '244 Halger Magnum [FONT=&quot]Although this cartridge has an English caliber designation, it is a 6mm magnum that originated in Germany. It was introduced in the 1920s by Halger Arms Co. of Hamburg. The originators were named Halbe and Gerlich, and the Halger was formed by combining the first three letters of each name. The case is rimless (actually no more than the 6.5x57 case) for use in Mauser bolt rifles, but there were some few rimmed cases also made.[/FONT]\n  [FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n  [FONT=&quot]The velocity of the 244 Halger is impressive, at least on paper. However, the Halger line of cartridges turned out to be somewhat overrated when tested. Regardless, this would highly-effective cartridge even if velocity was a couple of hundred fps below that claimed. A factory load of 87-grain bullet claiming the muzzle velocity at 3770 fps and muzzle energy at 2745 fpe would be mostly for varmint shooting, but heavier bullets could be hand-loaded for deer or larger animals. In size and general performance, it is similar to the wildcat 6mm Krag, the old 30-40 Krag military cartridge necked-down.[/FONT]', ''),

Browning for Belgian  company Fabrique Nationale (FN), Herstal. Model 1910 had been developed  around two cartridges, also designed by Browning - the 7.65mm Browning,  also known as .32ACP, which had been developed around 1900 for FN /  Browning model 1900 pistol, and the 9mm Browning Short (9x17mm), also  known as .380ACP, which, in turn, had been developed about 1908 for Colt  / Browning model 1908 pistol.\n  	In 1922, Browning modified the original pistol to suit requirements of  the Jugoslavian military - he lenghtened barrel, enlarged the grip and  magazine capacity by two rounds. The slide was lenghtened by adding  removable frontal portion to the model 1910 slide.\n  	Both models 1910 and 1922 were manufactured in large quantities until  1983 or so, when these guns were replaced by FN model 140DA / Browning  BDA380 pistols. In the USA both model 1910 and model 1922 were imported  under the name of "Browning 380 pistol", chambered in .380ACP. After the  1971, these guns have had ajustable target-type sights and slightly  enlarged grips to suit new US gun laws. Between two World Wars these  pistols became very popular across Europe as a police, military and  self-defence guns. It is well-known also that the First World War was  started by the Browning m1910 pistos, which had been used in 1914 to  assasinate the Archduke Ferdinand.\n  	Technically, both m 1910 and m 1922 (also known as model 1910/22), are  blowback operated semi-automatic pistols. The recoil spring is located  around the barrel, the trigger is of single action type and the gun is  striker-fired. Both models featured three safeties - magazine safety  (which blocks the firing when magazine is removed), automatic grip  safety and manual, frame mounted safety.\n\nHope you PG Brothers accept my two cents for this thread.\nRegards.\nAllah Bless.

(514107, ' Well you''re not supposed to spray the spring with gun cleaning oil as oil/lubricant in that area (except for those specifically made for that purpose) is a bad idea and causes dieseling. Brunox has a low combustion point therefore there must be a lot of dieseling (proof of which is the smoke that comes out of the barrel when you shoot a pellet). Anyways what''s done is done, just dont repeat this mistake with ANY gun.\n\nThe best way to clean your gun would be to spray brunox on a cotton cloth and then wipe the gun clean with it instead of spraying directly on the gun, that way you control how much oil goes where and avoid the areas where oil shouldn''t seep in.', ''),

Wet-sanded with 1000 grit again.\n\nOne day to fully dry in shade & then lacquer...\n\nIts important to note, that both the colors that I rubbed were almost removed when wet-sanding leaving behind a very light (almost invisible) tinge that enhanced the impression of relevant surfaces once clear coat was applied.\n\n\n[QUOTE=AK47;352099]Did you use any wood sealer, and which?[/QUOTE]\n\nNo, nothing of that sort. The lacquer (having hardener in it) works as a wonderful sealer as well. Secondly it works great against scratches, dings, water & oil etc. Being designed for external automotive surfaces, it withstands all the abuse that is rendered to it.\n\n\n[QUOTE=AK47;352099]Finally, I was just thinking if at any time - during the project - you had considered matte finish lacquer as an option as well?[/QUOTE]\n\nI would have loved matte finish on plain base color. As the plan was to enhance natural wood grains & being fan of krieghoff''s effects & impressions, I decided on this finish.\n\nAnd unfortunately matte lacquer is not available in cans in our town.

Thanks in advance![/QUOTE]\n\nThank you brother for your kind words.\n\nThe most important part (for me) in adding the screw was to get the [B]correct length[/B] of the screw as the action base was closed in front of the nut & I didn''t want to pot a hole in there as bolt slides on the other side very closely.\n\nI found this old screw in my toolbox where I keep nut/bolts that are off from some vehicle or component as they are of way better quality than the ones available on our hardware stores. Secondly, most of them are having finer threads for precise tightening & more turns per millimeter.\n\nThe sequence goes like this:\nAfter physically calculating the available depths & space on both stock & action, I got the nut electric-welded where required [B]one spot at a time with wet cloth wrapped on the rest of the adjacent area and about 30 sec gap.[/B]\n\nMarked the area where nut was hitting the stock in action channel, drilled equivalent depth with a larger bit to accommodate the nut without touching sides. Same space was made on the bottom just behind the trigger guard.  \n\nA hole was drilled in the center of that pit for the screw to pass.\n\nAlHamdo Lillah it all went as a perfect fit without any corrections.\n\nI will post a link to the thread where bedding is done.

(627460, 'feed your horse like a horse I went for the first hunt of the season with my friends. It was a successful day with regard to hunt on decoys. After we were finished with our hunting activities and had lunch and some rest, a friend who brought along his licensed Type 56-1, thought to see the accuracy of his weapon by hitting the stones placed at 25 meter increments. But the weapon jammed after few rounds roared through the pipe. How can it be? One of the most successful and rugged weapon platform ever built jamming so miserably. The firearm was checked and it was observed that that the bullet case swelled in the chamber and thus, caused Failure to Eject. The face of the owner of the AK worth looked at. He was already depressed with thought of any mechanical problem with the gun and the slight jokes of the group added some insult to the injury. The gun was field stripped and stuck case was painstakingly removed. The owner again thought to fire some bullets to confirm the gun was OK. But this time the gun failed to complete the cycle with the very first cartridge it was fed with. It was once again field stripped to be checked and it was the same problem again. It was suggested by another friend that the matter seems to be ammo related thus the ammo available in other magazine may be used. When other magazine, which contained Russian &#8220;Tula&#8221; ammo, was inserted, the gun fired entire magazine without any hiccup.\n  In the night, we discussed the issue and when I observed the magazine with the ammo that caused the problem twice, I observed that it was filled with a variety of ammunition, with different headstamps ,with  one thing in common that it entirely appeared to be military surplus ammo.  I started to look at each and every cartridge carefully and the results were interesting. I found some bullets different from others. Some bullets looked and felt different particularly at the neck; shoulder and tip of projectile but only a minute and careful examination would reveal the differences. They had their primers to be looked unusual too. I shared the result with rest of group and invited them to observe them the dissimilarities in the bullets. My observation was agreed upon by as well as differed by  my colleagues and we had a good and productive discussion on the issue . Anyway, since it was a hectic day, we went to sleep after Dinner. \n  I have gotten PB licenses too, so when I returned, I took the ammo available with me and found that the ammo I have, also possesses the same variations. I segregated the bullets on the basis of such variation and thought to open them. When I opened the first of them, the results were shocking. That round was a fake one. It contained something greenish stuff like dry weed instead of silver gray (Chamankar Surmai) shining powder grains. I opened the second one, and the result was the same. It was also one of the fake bullets. I opened the third , but this time it was an original , I felt sorry to spoil an original bullet and decided to observe the differences more keenly , yet when I opened the next bullet , it happened to be the another original. Heck, what am I doing?  I said to myself, I should be more careful as I cannot waste my ammo on mere suspicion. I took another careful and over all inspection of ammo again and on the basis of that observation made the segregation afresh. Finally I started to open the &#8220;condemned&#8221; cartridges and one by one they revealed themselves to be the fake. Most of my stash of ammo consisted upon the supposed-to-be-Russian military surplus-ammo, which I got years ago but fortunately never fired a single one. All of those proved to be the fake. But I am happy I did not fire a single one in my gun.  \n  The differences I observed between original and fake ammo appear to me to be \n  [FONT=Calibri]1)      [/FONT]The difference between primers. The primers of fake rounds seems to be more depressed \n  [FONT=Calibri]2)      [/FONT]The neck and shoulder area of the fake round appear to be wider\n  [FONT=Calibri]3)      [/FONT]The tip of projectile of fake a fake round is more pointed and sharp.\n  [FONT=Calibri]4)      [/FONT]Some of the fake rounds even feel different in hand. It seems that those are made of inferior material.\n  We take a lot of care of our firearms that we purchase from our hard-earned money and discuss a lot about them for being sure to get a genuine firearm and to avoid to end up with a clone, but once we get a weapon of our choice, all of our concentration get focused on its maintenance, lubrication, oiling etc and a very less heed is paid on what ammo we are putting through it. It is enough for us to just to ask verbally the dealer selling us the ammo that &#8220;Ammo is OK na&#8221;, and we expect that if the ammo is fake, the eyes of that dealer would be filled with tears and he would say &#8220;No my brother, I have just sold a packet of fake ammo to you, I have betrayed your trust, I should be punished for that&#8221;.  However I this never happens, rather, the dealer locks eyes and says &#8220;how can i do this thing to any of my customer, especially with you, I consider you as my elder/younger brother&#8221; and we take that ammo happily and on the next day, we send all the lead down range and return home happily.  We are less knowledgqble and apprehensive about the havoc fake ammo could play with our firearm. I discussed the issue with a very good gunsmith of my area and he told me that he has seen countless rifles that have been devastated by such fake ammo. According to him, the fake ammo contains some propellant that has so severe bang that it badly damages the inner mechanism of firearm in first instance. Secondly, the bullet it sends in barrel is made of third class material and its jacket is made of iron instead of copper that literally destroys the groves, lands and chrome plating. The fake bullet is also open from the rear, instead of being boat tailed and the corners of the copper metal jacket are not folded/curved, thus, the lead used in automobile batteries (out of which those fake bullets are made of) injure the gun first (that fires it) and never hits the target as its weight and the force generated by that bogus propellant is never calibrated.  &#8230;&#8230;. Well , after what I saw on opening the fake rounds myself ,  I don&#8217;t  see any reason to disagree the gentleman . \n  Let me show you what I saw. \n   Please note that the ammo shown here is covered by a legally issued valid PB license and several pictures of one round are taken from different angles for general information and education purpose \n   \n   \n  My sophisticated tools for opening the rounds\n   \n  \n\n[IMG]http://i1270.photobucket.com/albums/jj613/zainulabdeen/35.jpg[/IMG]\n\n  \n  The bullet&#8217;s tail (Boat tail?)\n[IMG]http://i1270.photobucket.com/albums/jj613/zainulabdeen/2-4.jpg[/IMG]\n\n[IMG]http://i1270.photobucket.com/albums/jj613/zainulabdeen/1-4.jpg[/IMG]', ''),

I''m sure after the bedding job the accuracy must have improved a lot. now there are a few things on my mind so brace yourself for some constructive criticism. :)\r\n\r\nwhy use lacquer? it feels plastic-like, it will turn opaque over time due to UV damage and in high heat it can turn into a sticky layer of glue. on top of all that, wood shrinks and expands over time, the lacquer being a less elastic surface will eventually peel off. here in my humble opinion, boiled linseed oil would have been better. it also hardens as it polymerizes but instead of forming a layer, it seeps into the wood first. you get all the benefits of a lacquer and sealer without sacrificing the natural feel of wood.\r\n\r\nI don''t know but avoiding a proper wood stainer has given the rifle the look of that cheap Chinese airgun mostly available at children toy stores. don''t get me wrong you know I have utmost respect for you. using a wood stainer (available at most hardware stores) to enhance the natural grains of the wood without revealing the open pores would have given better results.\r\n\r\nanyways, I like how you employed steaming technique to raise the dents. I too did that once and learned that if you steam the whole wood you can also raise the fibers and then sand them down to get that "smooth as silk" or glass type surface we all love to fee/see on high end shotguns.\r\n\r\nRegards.', ''),

(514229, '357 Forsberg The Forsberg was developed in late 1983 by Lee Forsberg, a gunsmith with Pacific International Service Company located in Janesville, California. the cartridge is one of a growing family based on the original 308x1.5-inch case either necked-up or down or lengthened slightly. In this instance, the designer did both by necking the case to accept .357-inch diameter bullets and lengthening it slightly to 1.563 inches. This is the largest caliber to date based on the 308x1.5-inch case and has a relatively small but sharp shoulder. This is about as far as one can go in expanding the shoulder. This is about as far as one can go in expanding the case neck and still have a shoulder left.\nInitial development and testing was with a Remington XP-100 bolt-action pistol with a 12-inch barrel. Hercules Reloader#7 gave the best performance in the testing thus far. Fifty-yard groups of 1mtov1 m1/2minches were common, but Lee Forsberg is working to bring this down to minute-of angle accuracy.\n\nForsberg is practically unknown to the metallic silhouette circuit, but it is remarkably efficient cartridge delivers truly impressive performance from such a small case. A 220-grain bullet exiting the muzzle at 2190 fps and 2350 fpe (12-inch barrel) beats out the 35 Remington fired from the usual 20-inch carbine barrel. In fact, it is in much the pretty same class as the 375 Winchester with its much longer case. As a hunting cartridge the 357 Forsberg would be in the deer and black bear class and possibly larger game under proper conditions. As a silhouette cartridge , it certainly has the oomph to knock down the rams and pigs at extreme ranges. It is too early to assess the future of the 375 Forsberg because it has not been used widely enough to generate a following. However, it has the potential to make a first-class silhouette and field cartridge. The 357 Forsberg is particularly well-adapted to very short, light carbines where weight is a consideration.', ''),

(525515, ' @ Brother Saad Moin: \nI have read this post with interest. I have had the pleasure of owning both the Vepr12 and Saiga 12 simultaneously. \n\n Fellow brothers here are right, Vepr12 is  more refined and it is also better looking of the two cousins. Also , Vepr is easier to load and you do not have to worry about ''gas tube'' settings.\n\nThat said and done, i ended up getting rid of my Vepr and keeping my Saiga. Keeping them both was not an option as i had to make one license free for a hunting weapon. This was for personal reasons being that 1- i use simple buckshot for my self defense and hence do not need to meddle with the gas tube settings ; and 2 - I had more options for hi-capacity magazines for Saiga and ended having 12 round magazines (about 50% more capacity than the 8 rounders?) with an eventual option of purchasing a 20 round drum magazine (when i can find them for a reasonable price).\n\n Needless to say, even now each time i look at a Vepr molot i want to reconsider my decision for keeping the Saiga. :)\n\nHaving used both weapons, Vepr and Saiga''s do not and SHOULD not give you the problems of FTF each time. To narrow down the problem to  the gas recycling system or the magazine, you may find the following exercise helpful.\n\na- point the weapon in a safe direction with adequate backstop (like at a range).\nb- Load up a magazine  and insert it in the weapon\nc- Manually pull the bolt ALL the way back and let go (do not push or anything, just let go completely so the bolt slams forward with its own spring force freely).\nd- If the round chambers, pull the bolt back quickly to eject the round from the chamber, keep it back all the way and then let go as in step ''c''.\ne- Do the above for all the rounds in the magazine till the magazine becomes empty.\nKindly ensure that at all times during this exercise that the weapon is constantly pointed in a safe direction.\n\nIf there are no loading issues this way, then the magazine is fine. the problem is probably the gas system of the Vepr which would need tuning up by an expert. If there are loading issues with the method above, then the problem may be feeding mechanism with the magazine being the most likely culprit.\n\nIf the problem is with the magazine, get a replacement magazine and try the above again. \n\nOn the last note, if i were you, i would kindly hand the weapon back to the dealer and i would tell him to keep it give me  a replacement Vepr OR my money back. Badar arms are quite reasonable but you would have to be persistent and call them almost every 2nd day.\n\nVeprs are more costly than Saigas.\n\nHope it helps and your issue is resolved.\n\nRegards', ''),

As he needed to pick up something, I went for a little browse in the shops and behold I came across an NIB Piranha-F (same batch as Chief''s and Moeen bhai''s). This pistol is an amazing shooter and now that it is discontinued for a full steel version CZ SP01 lookalike version, finding an NIB was a done deal the moment I held it and had a good look. Moeen bhai rightly said that it is a rare find and as no more are coming to PK I shouldn''t miss on it if I have even a slightest doubts (that I didn''t). Having an empty licence in hand made it all too easy a decision.\n\nShe is in absolutely mint condition with not a single fault or even a minor scratch anywhere inside or out. Even frame to slide rail is scratchless. Trigger break is crisp and abs creep free! After 2 years of wanting and looking for one, I finally have her... as I''m also picking up a NIB CZ Tactical Sport, there were a few seconds of doubt on the TS but it was committed for (& backing out on a committed deal is downright rude & insulting) and furthermore it will be modified by the one and only Moeen bhai in upcoming months. He plans to outdo his previous customised LiteSpeed and Thunderbolt TS''s with this one.\n\nI also witnessed Moeen bhai''s skills on a particular item today that left me speechless! He''s not only Big and Sexy but a master guru when it comes to gunsmithing. I strongly believe that he''s a real treasure to PG community.

Folks used to shoot off their porch at game birds, and at raccons and other pests and whatnot.  Nowadays, where I am, if I did that the swat team would come rolling in with armored tanks, and helicopter gunships, etc.  I had a nasty neighbor call the local sheriff on me for shooting a bb gun at empty soda cans with a nice backstop designed to not allow the bbs to bounce back or over penetrate.  Alas it was a co2 air pistol and they thought I as shooting a .22 with a silencer...so the police came and made me stop.\r\n\r\nAerial shooting is very dangerous.  So is can shooting without a oversized proper backstop.  Always safety first, Sir.  I''ve seen too many shot with "unloaded" guns and other safety mistakes.

This should also have gone in the opening post ;-(.\n\nThough I mostly use both of my .22 rifles on bench, they are often used in varminting and that too during night time. While vehicle plays a pivotal role as source of lighting & rifle rest, sometime, trees trunks, dust, and debris gets into contact with the rifle when away from it and need a rest for slightly longer shots. \n\nI have experienced small dings & scratches on wooden stocks no matter how careful I am, and I hate to see a scratch or a ding on the gun like most. That lead me to buy a rifle in polymer stock earlier & I will change my WMR also as & when I find a WMR in polymer stock. \n\n[QUOTE=12GAUGE;352283]why use lacquer? it feels plastic-like, it will turn opaque over time due to UV damage and in high heat it can turn into a sticky layer of glue. on top of all that, wood shrinks and expands over time, the lacquer being a less elastic surface will eventually peel off. here in my humble opinion, boiled linseed oil would have been better. it also hardens as it polymerizes but instead of forming a layer, it seeps into the wood first. you get all the benefits of a lacquer and sealer without sacrificing the natural feel of wood.[/QUOTE]\n\n[QUOTE=12GAUGE;352283]I don''t know but avoiding a proper wood stainer has given the rifle the look of that cheap Chinese airgun mostly available at children toy stores. don''t get me wrong you know I have utmost respect for you. using a wood stainer (available at most hardware stores) to enhance the natural grains of the wood without revealing the open pores would have given better results.[/QUOTE]\n\nThe is no question & argument about oils being the best application to enhance the looks & grain of the wood. I read about linseed oil application for two days as it was suggested by @PakistanFirst as well. It sure gets hard enough to provide a pretty scratch resistant surface but that process of applying-drying-reapplying... takes about 1 week to 2 months to get to the desired hardness & the finish. I neither have that much patience & time not the quality of wood grain & the value of gun was so much that I should have spent so much of an effort & energy on it.\n\nThe reason I used lacquer was for more than one good things about it. Actually you have pointed out all the aspects of it from different angles, so let me add my experience with it here.\n\nWood inherently is far lesser effected by thermo-dynamics with expansion & contraction being most important of them as compared to metals. So there is way less effect of temperature on wood''s expansion than that is of moisture. Moisture does effect woods expansion.\n\nHaving said that, auto grade lacquer that has premixed hardener can withstand direct sunlight for many hours daily & temperatures around 40 degrees (c) for roughly 3 years if applied unbaked. Application on heated surface in sun increases it life & if applied in heated chamber, it goes many folds.\n\nBeing aerosol with very thin composition, it penetrates deep into the wood closing down all pores & veins that might attract moisture otherwise making it almost perfectly sealed waterproof. I spray lacquer in barrel channel, trigger channel & butt plate base as well as these areas have way more tendency to absorb moisture as compared to a finished outer surface.  \n\n \n[QUOTE=12GAUGE;352283]anyways, I like how you employed steaming technique to raise the dents. I too did that once and learned that if you steam the whole wood you can also raise the fibers and then sand them down to get that "smooth as silk" or glass type surface we all love to fee/see on high end shotguns.\n\nRegards.[/QUOTE]\n\n\nThank you so much on appreciating this part. It is a flawless and easiest way to get the job done.\n\nIn this whole process, what I achieved here was \n[LIST]\n[*]probably a much accurate rifle due to better fitting feature, proper action bedding & free floating barrel.\n[*]A way better looking rifle as compared to the factory finish\n[*]Much more resistant to scratches, dings & moisture\n[*]All of it in very short time & probably within Rs. 250 with a some of inspiration & lots of perspiration.\n[/LIST]', ''),

But its hard to find single-trigger with fixed choke. In fact it is hard to find these days o/u with fixed choke. Maybe you will find one old model which are made in USSR in o/u fixed choke but they are with double trigger and they are more expensive in good condition then new guns. They are around 70-80k. But for your information some of the commonly available model are:\n\n1. Baikal MP-43E   [i] Side by Side, fixed choke double trigger [/i]\n2. Baikal MP-43E-1C [i] Side by Side, Screw-in chokes, Single trigger [/i]\n3. Baikal MP-27EM-1C [i] Over and Under, Screw-in chokes, Single Trigger [/i]\n\nThese three model of shotgun comes in the price range of 50-60 depend upon your location and bargaining skills.

And somehow the double trigger have a slight advantage if you are using it particularly for hunting. Because in the fixed chokes, one barrel is full and other is modified. ([i]In side by side, ofcourse because as I told you, the over and under fixed chokes are also not easily available in new.[/i]). And the double trigger can let you decide quickly which barrel you have to use either full or modified. In the single trigger they are set to a preset order between under barrel first usually set with a choke less tighter then the top barrel.', ''),

(514719, ' AoA\r\n\r\nKindly allow me to offer my two cents on the subject. I was once talking to a very famous choke maker in the states and somehow he convinced me into his direction which is as follows:\r\n\r\n1. back-boring (a term cooked up by firearm manufacturers) is simply over boring and nothing else.\r\n\r\n2. to date no scientific study has ever proven that back-boring improves shot patterns. infact, the studies mostly ended with inconclusive results.\r\n\r\n3. due to extreme competition, heavily capital intensive firearms industry and less availability of customers, manufacturers tend to follow trends instead of what is "right" or "important". if customers expect their shotguns to sing and dance, they''ll surely come up with a shotgun that sings and dances to any tune. infact, I was told that firearms manufacturing industry does not follow "requirements", it follows "expectations" and customers these days expect back-boring.\r\n\r\n4. back-boring along with long forcing cones does improve patterns but the difference is only statistical in nature and in reality insignificant. for example: a difference of usually 5% or less. the difference is surely there but will it improve your score by 5%? most probably not but almost everyone on the competition circuit or pockets deep enough would happily spend money to obtain that 5% advantage.\r\n\r\n5. back boring along with lengthening of forcing cones reduces recoil alot as the pressure inside the barrel decreases due to the creation of the higher area to contain that pressure.\r\n\r\n6. back-boring only works with cartridges that provided enough gas seal. if the wad isn''t enough to provide adequate gas sealing then patterns will be adversely affected as propellant gases escape past the shot load. now you know why most cartridges don''t perform well with back-bored barrels.\r\n\r\nRegards.', ''),

Sometimes they squander the money ( these are avg street beggars im talking about, ), or take money and don''t have anything to show for it, I.e we asked him to use the money to setup a shop or blah, he used a few generic excuses, blah blah. Its been 3 years and not a single one has genuinely tried to do anything. They take, and leave, where they squander it and maybe come back for more. \n\n\nThe same thing is going on here.

Lightly coat the metallic parts with good quality gun oil. Do not use mineral oils for wooden parts i.e., for stock. Pure mustard oil is good for the stock.\n\nHumidity causes corrosion and also deteriorates wood. From my personal experience it is best to store your gun in a sealed box along with about 200gms of silica gel in a cloth bag.

My basic purpose to buy this gun was HD i bought combo model for occasional hunting. I fitted the 18inc barrel successfully. Then came the time to test it. I loaded 1 SG/LG cartridge in chamber, and 3 cartridges in tube. 1st fire went well. but on 2nd catridge, gun did not fire. I pulled the bolt and let it out of gun. 3rd cartridge fired and next cartridge loaded in chamber. but it also failed to fire. I changed the cartridges to Shaheen no. 8. Same thing happened. 1st cartridge fired but 2nd & 3rd failed to fire. 4th cartridge fired. then i pulled the magazine cutt off button and started loading single cartridge directly in to chamber and they were flying. The point to be noted here is that after every fire the next cartridge was in chamber and it failed to fire. I thoroughly checked. Im 100% sure that it was in chamber. there are no strike marks on primer. I have attached the pictures of fired cartridges.\n\n\nThese 3 Eley''s SG cartridges did not fire even when they were loaded in chamber.\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]19564[/ATTACH][ATTACH=CONFIG]19570[/ATTACH]\nThe picture below shows the used Shaheen 8 no. cartridges. \n[ATTACH=CONFIG]19565[/ATTACH][ATTACH=CONFIG]19569[/ATTACH][ATTACH=CONFIG]19568[/ATTACH]\nPic belows shows the Eley''s SG fired shells.\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]19566[/ATTACH][ATTACH=CONFIG]19567[/ATTACH]\n\n\n\n\n\nI called Trigger Happy bro he asked me to degrease the gun and change  the ammo.

(544398, 'Dear Nabeel [QUOTE=jog3ee;382343]Well apparently all is not lost my friends  I decided to try and fix it though my hopes weren''t high. So I opened up the illumination knob, checked the tube inside, fitted and O ring, tightened all the screws & re-assembled the knob. Re-mounted the scope from scratch, 1st shot landed 5 mildots low, so once again unmounted the scope, shuffled the rings, zeroed at 15 yards.\r\nnow all pellets are landing in 1 hole at 15 yards and sub 1 inch group at 40 yards. ALLAH ka shuker hai !!\r\n\r\nOnly downside is that I can''t use the illuminated reticle but the good thing is that I never had to use it anyways :D but still, its better to have something and don''t need it then to need it & not have it.[/QUOTE]\r\n\r\nI regret that you face such problems. As far as the scope is concerned, almost every scope dies on magnum Springer one day. \r\nThough your Hatson is more powerful than my soft tuned 54 which is giving around 790fps with 14.3 gr pellets.\r\n\r\nNow come to a technical point. Your gun is not recoilless. Hence all the double recoil is absorbed by the gun, scope and the shooters shoulders and hands. Thus the total recoil to scope alone is 1/5 as compared to Diana 54 because due to recoil less feature of 54 only the action takes the jolt and resultantly the scope is exposed to 5 Times more recoil than your gun.\r\n\r\nYou can try Braska scopes. Sometimes they survive much more than CPs. Also Hawk scopes are good option. Specially the Airmax series of Hawk.\r\n\r\nNow I come to the dieseling issue. It MUST not last so long. I am concerned about it. \r\n\r\nHow do you keep your gun at home? It must be kept in the position with barrel upwards and should never be put horizontally. If you keep it in the correct way, then the lube should not come in front of piston and hence there should be no dieseling.\r\n\r\nIf it still diesels, we can meet again and wash some of the internals with patrol instead of diesel. Then we would have to re assess it after using further 100 to 150 shots.\r\n\r\nKeep in touch, and Insha Allah the things will improve.\r\n\r\nAre you using one piece mount or two piece mount? You must use one piece mount if you are not using it.', ''),

Salams!\n\n4 years since my joining in here as a relatively dumb, ignorant yet nevertheless a bloodline enthusiast, I can look back today to those days when all I knew about a handgun was that it''s something made of steel that can fire, bang and sound impressive and that''s all.\n \nWho cared for things like recoil springs, guide rods, ease of field strips, felt recoil, accuracy, reliability, durability, technical built, chrome linings, shot placements, riflings, ballistics, gelatin tests, terminal energy & foot pounds, licences and legal implications, social responsibilities, [I]hawaiis[/I], etc, lolz!\n\nI take pride in this great community which conferred onto me all the knowledge that I have today, and more than the knowledge alone, also blessed upon me a wonderful fraternal integration of myself with the network of great and knowledgeable, learned like-minded fellows across the country. I, today, enjoy more off-forum interactions with respectable nobles of this lovely community on daily basis than my online activity here and I salute you all for all your gentle kindness, cooperation, both off and on forum. \n\nKindly excuse my off topic lines above, but it''s just that since I''m leaving for a Holy journey in a couple of days, I felt, the right sentiments needed an occasion to be passed out here.\n\nAnd now on to the gunz! \n\n\nAs you may have noted I''ve been disposing off from my collection recently.

(515289, ' As stated earlier, I had some objectives before I took in some new handguns and disposed off the older ones above. 1.st of all, I wanted fewer toys, since the kind of maintenance that I give to my cared for beauties is a real time-consuming PITA for itself.\n\nThe balance in collection calibers had to be as below to contain myself to 5 handguns maximum, and within calibers that I personally believe in as top priority:\n\n[COLOR=#ff0000][B] 9mm[/B][/COLOR].............. . 2X (One ccw, one all-rounder)\n[B][COLOR=#ff0000].40 S&W[/COLOR][/B]...........1X\n[COLOR=#ff0000][B].45 ACP[/B][/COLOR]............1X (Still not satisfied, may need an upgrade)\n[COLOR=#ff0000][B].357 Magnum[/B][/COLOR]...1X (Very few options available)\n\nI must say here that the ccw in the 9mm department was the greatest challenge before me, since my SD requirement basically was a reliable polymer handgun with no funny levers added to fiddle stupidly around with and having a [I]hot round[/I] status 2-4-7.\n\nThe Caracal C-QS was a sweet shooter no doubts and ideal in size for this purpose, until it screwed up for the worse with respected Kkhan bros. I had been carrying it hot status until the US recall over trigger issues, yet the local incidence was the straw that broke the Arab camel''s back for indefinite period of resolve.\n\nSome frequent and very joyful communion with respected Skeeter Sir recently and with his candid lectures, finally brought me to the conclusion that the best handgun that could possibly be trusted on for critical defense with a live round in the barrel and with the light carry-able weight load, would be the Glock, either the 17 or the 19.\n \nWhat I needed to know more about the Glocks in the market these days was learnt by respected member Gunfreak bro from Karachi who candidly gave the right guidelines and was a very cooperative fellow to interact with over the phone. My thanks to him, though he was more in favor of the G-26 which was also available to me at just around the same price, in Gen 4 even.[SIZE=5] [B]Special thanks to [COLOR=#ff0000]GUNFREAK [/COLOR]bro![/B][/SIZE]\n\nHence, landed the 3rd gen Glock 19[B] NPv[/B], [B]production dated 2012[/B]:\n\n[IMG]http://i1136.photobucket.com/albums/n497/wahstar1/GlockBoxopen.jpg[/IMG]\n\nWhen choosing, I had the option of picking up a Gen 4 G-17 at the same price, but on careful examination found that my smaller hands would be controlling the G-19 much better during use, and after playing around with both for some 15 minutes, I realized that the thumb rule of taking a feel of any new proposed handgun in your bare hands is the best golden selector mechanism. The[I] time tested[/I] Gen 3 selection was already pre-decided, since I was not interested in the Gen 4, anyways.\n\nSome more pics:\n\n[B]Glock 19[/B],[B][COLOR=#ff0000] [SIZE=4][I]The King CCW[/I][/SIZE][/COLOR][/B]:\n\n[IMG]http://i1136.photobucket.com/albums/n497/wahstar1/GlockCZSig/a755baa7-351e-462e-b60d-3782b8e0cc1f.jpg[/IMG]\n\n[IMG]http://i1136.photobucket.com/albums/n497/wahstar1/GlockCZSig/f0969be8-45b0-4214-8f71-69e6d8e8bcc5.jpg[/IMG]\n\n\n\n[SIZE=5][B]There''s a helpful link to verify the production dates of Glocks online, just in case you do not have the alphabetical codes handy with you:\n[/B][/SIZE]\n[B][URL="http://www.mujglock.com/en/glock-production-date.html?kod=ZOH"][COLOR=#0000cd]Production date of your GLOCK - MujGLOCK.com[/COLOR][/URL][/B]\n\nI''ll back on the Glock after field stripping it to show the kind of copper grease you should expect on an unused weapon. Also, there''ll course be a full fledged firing review as soon as I return in a couple of weeks.\n\nAll, I can say about the Glock so far is that next to my 1911, it was the 1.st handgun that my better half kept trying out in her hands and fell in love with to the extent that she insisted on 1 more in the house and for herself, probably the G-26. Yes, my personal limit has been crossed, no doubts, but... but.... but... but...

It''s a SIG! Oh yeah, it''s the traditional 15 shots US model, not the German. I believe there''s a difference, but I did not deem it worth expending added 150K''s on. I''m sure it''s still gonna work like a Sig. \n\nThe decocker is a great change in terms of feel, smoothness of action viz a viz other handguns I''ve had a decocker on.

I checked out the Sig Scorpion over the net, if one could lay one''s greedy hands upon it, but I was not really satisfied about the vulnerability of it''s dark earth finish for any regular use. The DW Valor is a fine option too, yet I am still to hear from somebody if they came back from the range with hands painless. I''ll try that one out one final day, but so far, the PT 1911 stays here with full honor.

I talked to the gunsmith at Armco and he said Norcs are usually loose fitting, as is the case with my 1911, I have swedged the frame and now the slide is tiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiight, hence I am waiting for the lapping compound to arrive in the mail to finish the job, also the Norc barrel bushing is so loose in the slide and so is the barrel in the bushing that my gub shoots all over the place. Shall fit a new bushing as well, then see how the barrel locks up etc. Once I have that fitted, then I shall shoot it and assess the situation, the trigger is not very crisp, but I can live with it.[QUOTE=Fudgepacker;352280]Dodo, the M93 Woodsman is worth getting 2 of... I did :) Mainly because it only came with 1 mag, and to get another was like $40, so it was like might as well get another gun for a hundred bucks!\nAlso, the USP is WAY over rated IMO. Wouldn''t pay that much for any "plastic" gun. I''d sleep on it for a while, maybe rent one at the range couple more times. I had one, and was like heck, could have a G22 AND an XD instead... so, sold it and did just that. You want a quality, accurate, 9mm, combat handgun that isn''t a glock and is famous for fitting like a glove, check out the CZ 75 SP01 Shadow. Or the Phantom if you prefer polymer.

(515371, ' In my experience rimfire cartridges suffer from lack of relaibility, for SD or HD you need a firearm that goes boom everytime the trigger is pressed, also the muzzle flash from Magnum in the dark might make followup shots difficult in low light situations, the sound can be deafening too, literally speaking. I would have recommended a centerfire cartridge for sure, with the biggest magazine capacity, 357 mags are a good choice because they are usually heavier and eat some of the recoil, and if you shoot 38 Speacials then it is even better. I personally would go for a 357 single/ double action, with a minimum 4 inch and maximum 6 inch barrel with a 8 round cylinder for SD, and I would use 38 special cartridges for SD.

(515589, ' Barrel length makes a world of difference in muzzle velocity and energy delivered, a 22 mag fired from a revolver (or pistol with 6 inch barrel) has lesser energy than 38 special, if you fire the same round from a rifle then it is a different story. I understand the loading and racking the slide part being difficult. The best bet is to get her to practice with the DW as much as possible, e.g. give her a 4 inch circle to shoot at 10 feet, once she is able to shoot it every time, set it at 15 feet and so on. Very important to do load and fire and reload and fire drills. A woman here in Canada killed a Grizzly with a 22 lr, when it attacked her, shot it right in the eye. Also stopping power depends on the type of bullet used. If one is entirely comfortable with their firearm, then caliber is not a huge issue, bullet placement is the thing that matters most. With any rimfire, I would do drills to deal with misfires quickly.[QUOTE=Saad Moin;353567]In pistols I have a good variety, but this revolver is specifically for my wife to use. For her loading bullets in magazine and cocking the gun are very difficult jobs. A month ago, 4 people tried to enter our house. My 12 year old son was there to load the pistol otherwise it would have been very difficult for her to manage the situation. Because it is very easy to load and fire a revolver, I want to go for it.\n\nAlso .22 mag JHP low recoil and stopping power almost equal to .38 special made me think to go for it.

(515669, ' [QUOTE=dodo23;353667]Barrel length makes a world of difference in muzzle velocity and energy delivered, a 22 mag fired from a revolver (or pistol with 6 inch barrel) has lesser energy than 38 special, if you fire the same round from a rifle then it is a different story. I understand the loading and racking the slide part being difficult. The best bet is to get her to practice with the DW as much as possible, e.g. give her a 4 inch circle to shoot at 10 feet, once she is able to shoot it every time, set it at 15 feet and so on. Very important to do load and fire and reload and fire drills. A woman here in Canada killed a Grizzly with a 22 lr, when it attacked her, shot it right in the eye. Also stopping power depends on the type of bullet used. If one is entirely comfortable with their firearm, then caliber is not a huge issue, bullet placement is the thing that matters most. With any rimfire, I would do drills to deal with misfires quickly.[/QUOTE]\r\nVery true Sir, ME &MV of 22 mag listed is mostly mis leading until you keep the barrel length in prespective.', ''),

I have the following questions from the seniors ..\n\n1. Now can I easily sale my stoeger if I dont get my licenses duplicates issued? and what will be the legal way of selling it as its still on my license and on my name (even though I lost the license) and also i didnt register the FIR for it as Police simply said its a very hectic process and I need to at least give them with my license numbers or a copy of my license cards but unluckily I just didnt even have a copy of them or dunt even remember my license numbers as I was a novice and got very excited to see my licenses, didnt even bother to write down my license numbers, so an advice to you all guys always keep a copy of your license cards .. so can I sale my stoeger now? cuz I think if i dont get the duplicates issued may be I can apply for a new license once licenses are opened up and then buy a new gun for it, as keeping my stoeger right now is illegal I know that which makes me a bit dump too and if I dont get my duplicate licenses issued in next 2 months I will surely want to sale it up ..\n\nThanks guys ..', ''),

Imagine that about our local made guns. Click on the link below and watch a drop test. All lab tests are conducted on concrete floor (worst case scenario).\n\n[URL]http://www.intertek.com/product-safety-testing/gun-drop-video/[/URL]\n\nIt is understandable that you don''t want to harm your gun but you should want to know more about your gun. As I said before, what is written in blogs and threads should be taken as guidance. The purpose of writing a test was to get you conduct practical testing yourself that can help you understand physics and mechanics of your firearm. Perhaps that could have led you to disassemble you gun and reassemble it to understand its function. Again, If you are not mechanically inclined, the ignore the disassembly part of the post.', ''),
