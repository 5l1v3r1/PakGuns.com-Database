(633863, 'Wrath of the Ear Muffs.. It was the same old monotonous weekend, Nothing to do, No one to hang with. Called up a friend and invited myself to his place, As I knew although he knows I like guns and shooting for some reason he never bothered to ask me or invite me over. I along with another friend reached his place Near Faiz Pur. I had brought along shaheen 8# for some casual shooting, We had Tea and prathay and went on to his fields. He brought along 3 PB guns and asked his helper to go and stack 3-4 bricks at about 35-40yards. With around 400 Russian rounds to waste I could not wait. But before we could start up the PB shooting he asked me to wait and lets begin with the Zigana 9mm, I happily agreed and shot bricks at about 15-20yard. Took turns and I think spit around 100 bullets. Than I took out the two 8# boxes, He had a double barrel Side by Side but which in reality was a single barrel for some reason he told me only to shoot from the right barrel, He had some cd disks and we shot them it was fun.\nNow his father arrives with 3 more people from the village, He told them [I]"Aye shery mundayan da nishaana vekho"[/I] and gave me the gun, I fetched my muffs from the car and as soon I was wearing them another person they called [B]Judge[/B] asked me what kind of Headphone were these and why would I wear them when I was going to shoot, [B]Sajju[/B] another person asked me to show him the muffs and said are these wireless, I told them what they were and suddenly [B]Baba[/B] another person started laughing and all 4 of the elders started laughing. [B]Sajju[/B] says [I]Aye shery mundayan de chunchalay honde ne, seedhi tarhan fire kad[/I], I hesitantly say I cant without them, I knew this be coming...... [B]Baba[/B] says [I]than give the gun to another boy[/I] I pass it along and 2 people start to fire at the bricks set in front, though none of them hit them I could see how much they enjoyed it. As I stood there counting the spent casing on the ground I noticed they were not quite aiming at the bricks and firing indiscriminately as if it was making them feel and good they liked the bang of the PB 47 weapon. I asked my friend to give me one gun and I would fire it with the muffs on. His Dad says [I] Men don''t need these type of things, why do you need muffs when you will fire to hear and enjoy the sound?[/I]  I humbly tell him Uncle it permanently damages your hearing and I cant accurately fire without the muffs on. Uncle calls Baba and tells him to tell me how [U][I]Mummy daddy[/I][/U] I sound........\n[B]Sajju[/B] comes and says [I]Putr chala kuch nai honda[/I] they somehow forced me to fire some good 100 rounds which none of them hit the target. After which I had a stinging sound in my ears, Than [B]baba[/B] says [I]Lo jee tera te nishana hi nai[/I] you cant hit anything? I tell if he could give me the muffs I might actually hit the target. slowly while we were having the conversation the friend whom I was over says only 150 bullets left......... I told them It was no use firing like this and I would sit in the car and they can come when they finish the ammo.\nAfter about 5 minutes they tell me how these Muffs are made for starters and real men don''t use them... I tried convincing them but it was in vain because it was 4 against 1 both my friends remained neutral as they knew I wont accept it but in the end they gave me a very silly nick name and said these things are mere distractions and they have been firing since ages and with no ill effects. On my way back they ordered Burgers and pizza and for me and rest of them enjoyed fresh fish brought just then by someone from the village, I told them why did they order it only for me and not for everyone I enjoy desi food as much as they do and my friend says, [B]because you are burger boy?[/B] I knew it I should never had brought the darn muffs along...............', ''),

Having a fabulous knife and not knowing how to sharpen it is like having an expensive handgun and no ammo with it. :D\r\n\r\nNow from what I have gathered on the topic. We need stones to sharpen. The stones will depend on the kind of steel we intend to sharpen with it. For example, 154cm is a good steel, but is difficult to sharpen. Once sharpened, it may hold the edge longer than cheaper steels, but that there''s a huge "IF" in between :D\r\n\r\nAlso, since this is a very difficult task, like hmd bro said, I think it makes more sense we get local made knives and learn how to keep them sharp.\r\n\r\nI am planning to take a few classes from a butcher. Then I am planning to check various Chinese knockoffs, check how they sharpen, and how long they hold their edge. I will then compare them to local knives made from materials that have no specs, rather are classified using jargons given by our local "mistris" :)\r\n \r\n\r\nRegards.[/QUOTE]\r\n\r\nKamran Bhai,\r\n\r\nPlease make sure u have seen Ray Mears sharpening videos, he does videos only on straight edge blades.

(634069, ' Salam All,\n@HNMZ - hey bro, this is the bull barrel and its length is now 10.5 inch down from 14.5".  I have another one just like it also new in sealed packet.  Aside from this I have a HBAR long length barrel.  I wanted two sets of uppers; one for long range and one for short CQB.  The CQB version shall have this 10.5" bull barrel setup with the old nostalgia style sliding stock and the long flash hider.  This new gen bull barrel provides more stability/accuracy if any for this shorty.  It will have the upper of an A2 body with full adjustable sights as the original upper was a A1 style with a wheel adj. rear sight which I never liked.  The longer option also being put together is with A3 flat top upper and a long free float handguard which joins at the rails of the upper.  The front gas block is without sight.  I have arranged a fully adjustable butt for that configuration.\nBasically, I will have two options but on the same firearm; rather than having two separate firearms.  I have another pb license pending now for over 8 months.  If that ever comes through then I will get another receiver and opt for two separate dedicated platforms.  But for now this modular config will have to suffice.  Magpul makes the CTR and the PRS stock for the AR.', ''),

Over the years, I had purchased most tools for assembly and disassembly.  Our Rotorcraft is also great when it comes to making tools and he made a very nice wrench for the free float hand guard.\n@Zia Raza - Same, just one has the name Hbar and the other I don''t know what to call it except bull barrel.  When we look at the Colt M4 14.5" length there are two variants - the standard M4 barrel (Most common here) basically thins out after the chamber and then near the front sight again becomes thick and the harder-to-find M4 A1 Carbine barrel which as shown stays thick throughout.  As for the Hbar barrel - its the same song and dance... the standard barrel again thins out after the chamber and then thickens up by the front sight where as this is thick all the way - Colt introduced a model based on this in the late ''80s called the R6600DH also known as the Delta Hbar.  Later they introduced a more common version called the R6601 Hbar.  This is the barrel I have - although its being used in other rifle variants as well such as the Colt LMG or more so the Canadians are using it in their weapons quite a bit.  The pic at the center is the Hbar barrel and you can see the thickness compared to the ones in the chart for the 20" A1 and A2 barrels.

An average idea would  be appreciated. \nThank you![/QUOTE]\n\nBrother, I am not an expert, but I will try to give you some idea..\n\nBr, bullet range is divided in two categories generally, that are\n\n1. Killing Range of a bullet\n\n2. Effective Range, that is the range till when a bullet has less potential to kill and greater potential to wound a target if fired at.\n\nHowever, there is one other type and that is maximum range, you can call it falling range, which is the range when the bullet falls eventually after loosing all energy and velocity+momentum.\n\nSo, generally, (leaving accuracy issue aside) I think Killing range of a normal 115gr 9MM bullet would be around 50 to 100 yards or so... that is when it has enough power to panetrare in a target or give a lethal blow...\n\nSecondly, effective range of a 115gr bullet would be around 100 to 300 to 400 yards. I guess\n\nLastly, falling range is between [b] 2200m to 2400m.[/b] :shocked:\n\nThese are my assumptions just togive you an idea, and are not 100% verified and tested data.', ''),

Both items are very rare to come in but I just happened to be there for the barrel at the time.\n@Jibz - bhai, all me and Rotorcraft.  Over the years, I had purchased most tools for assembly and disassembly.  Our Rotorcraft is also great when it comes to making tools and he made a very nice wrench for the free float hand guard.\n@Zia Raza - Same, just one has the name Hbar and the other I don''t know what to call it except bull barrel.  When we look at the Colt M4 14.5" length there are two variants - the standard M4 barrel (Most common here) basically thins out after the chamber and then near the front sight again becomes thick and the harder-to-find M4 A1 Carbine barrel which as shown stays thick throughout.  As for the Hbar barrel - its the same song and dance... the standard barrel again thins out after the chamber and then thickens up by the front sight where as this is thick all the way - Colt introduced a model based on this in the late ''80s called the R6600DH also known as the Delta Hbar.  Later they introduced a more common version called the R6601 Hbar.  This is the barrel I have - although its being used in other rifle variants as well such as the Colt LMG or more so the Canadians are using it in their weapons quite a bit.  The pic at the center is the Hbar barrel and you can see the thickness compared to the ones in the chart for the 20" A1 and A2 barrels.  The last pic is of the Delta Hbar as sold by Colt WITH everything you see.

As a result, these weapons were purchased only from tribal  elders belonging to the Federally Administered Tribal Areas.\nThe  import will only be allowed to registered dealers of prohibited arms.  There are only four or five such dealers in the country.\nCommerce  Minister Khurram Dastgir Khan told Dawn that the new policy would help  in many ways in regulating the arms import regime. This would not only  help in reducing under-invoicing but also contribute in generating  revenue for the government.\nOn the regulation side, the minister said, the government would have a clear picture of the arms imports. This, he said,  would discourage the irregular imports. The minister said the new policy was closer to reality.\nAt the same time, he said the policy was not evolved in a way to encourage arms import but rather to regulate it.  He said the role of the provinces in this regard had been enhanced. \n\n\nUnder  the new law, anybody can apply for a licence. However, it has to be  supported by a string of documents. The applications will be made  through the provincial home departments and in the case of Islamabad and  Fata through the interior ministry. \nThe provincial home  departments and interior ministry in their no-objection certificates  will propose quantitative limits for import of arms and ammunition  vis-a-vis the dealership licence.\n\n\nIn a cabinet meeting held on  March 7, 2013 the outgoing PPP-led government approved amendments to the  policy. It changed the provision for value-based imports to quantity  based and fixed a monetary ceiling, ranging from Rs100,000 to Rs20  million, on commercial arms importers. \nThere are more than 640  arms dealers in the country who are registered with the commerce  ministry for imports. Of these, 60 per cent (384) are small dealers who  have a ceiling of Rs100,000. \n\n\nUnder the new policy, in the first  phase, the monetary quota of the existing dealers will be converted into  quantity or no of weapons. However, all existing dealers will have to  apply for conversion with supporting documents. \nThe licence of the existing dealers who did not import any weapons in the past three years will not be converted.  However, such a dealer will have to apply afresh for licence. \n\n\nAn  arms expert told Dawn that that the new policy would filter small  traders from the business. He said the quantity-based authorisation  would make the scheme unattractive for small players. \nFor  example, an average $100 value of a Chinese make pistol will entitle a  small dealer to import only 10 pistols. This number will reduce in case  of European models whose prices range between $500 and $800, which means  entitlement for one weapon under the new scheme.  \nAll imports of arms and ammunition shall be allowed only against letters of credit to be opened by the bank branches.  The commerce ministry will also issue category passbooks to the dealers. \nAn  LC should mention provision of original equipment manufacturer  certificate and pre-shipment inspection and the bank will ensure that  the importer would not exceed his quantitative ceiling.\n\n\nCurrently,  the dealers land their consignments at different ports so that the  customs authorities clear their huge consignments in excess to their  monetary quotas. \nTo overcome this, the import through QBA will be  cleared only by the collectorate of customs in whose jurisdiction  registered business office of the importer is located.\nMoreover,  all QBAs will be entered into an automated customs system to ensure  foolproof computerised debiting and crediting of authorised quantities.  The weapons are declared as prohibited or non-prohibited by the  government under the Pakistan Arms Ordinance 1965.\nAccording to  the law, the contract for import of weapons under the value-based  authorisation prior to June 2009 will stand cancelled on Dec 31, 2014.  Contracts made prior to June 2011 but after May 31, 2009 will stand  cancelled on March 31 this year. Other contracts will be cancelled on  June 30.', ''),

(634173, ' I''d just like to elaborate on what 1stranger bro has said regarding [I]range[/I]. First of all, when discussing range, we are actually referring to a [I]weapon system[/I][I]. [/I]For example, a 9mm cartridge by itself has no range, a 9mm pocket pistol does, but it will be different than a 9mm AR15.\n\nAs 1stranger bro said, there are two concepts when discussing range. One is [I]maximum range[/I], and the other is [I]effective range[/I]. [B]Maximum range[/B] is a very straight forward measurement and exactly what it sounds like; quite simply, it is the maximum distance a bullet can travel... that''s it. I''ve never tried it myself, but a bullet usually goes the furthest when shot at around a 45 degree angle.\n\n[B]Effective range[/B] on the other hand, is not quite as straight forward. It is actually a term the military uses to describe the distance at which the average soldier can land over 50% of his shots on a human sized target. Contrary to popular belief, it has nothing to do with penetration, nor "stopping power", at least not in the term''s official usage. A lot of people have adopted the term "effective range" to mean different things, partly because they don''t know what it really means, and partly because of its relatively vague definition. \n\nLike caliber and stopping power, "range" is just one of those things that will be perpetually debated. It''s because there really is no [B]exact[/B] answer, there are just too many variables for guys to argue over :) For example, wind direction, wind speed, temperature, humidity, bullet type, powder charge, powder type, barrel length, barrel type, and even the direction in which you shoot are all things that could affect "maximum range", and there are just as many variables that could potentially affect effective range. \n\nWith regard to a 9mm, most accounts put its maximum range at just over 2000m... out of a handgun. Obviously 9mm would go much faster and farther when shot out of a rifle. It''s effective range is generally accepted to be about 50m, and again a rifle would increase accuracy, thereby extending effective range. Anyways, that all up for debate... what do [I]you[/I] think is the range of 9mm :D', ''),

May Allah give you and your family the courage to bear the loss.\n\nYes in case of death of a licencee the licence can be transferred to the spouse or children of the licencee. For this you would have to apply to the issuing authority for transfer of licence to your name. You would also have to submit an affidavit signed by your mother and siblings that they have no objection on transfer of the licence to your name. The weapon would have to kept in the custody of a dealer till the time it is transferred to your name. The process has also been discussed in other threads. \n\nHope this helps.\n\nRegards', ''),

CARACAL has been attending this show since their entry into the US market in 2012.   \n\nCARACAL F   \n[/FONT][FONT=Calibri]CARACAL officially announced enhanced design modifications for the full size Caracal [/FONT][FONT=Calibri]âFâ. This new design ensures better [/FONT][FONT=Calibri]performance and durability.

CARACAL 1911 is one the most mature and in demand designs available in the market.\n   \nCARACAL CC10 MODEL   \nCARACAL are working on bringing the highly rated and well received CC10 Model to U.S. this year. The CC10 is light a 9mm Carbine that uses interchangeable magazines from the Caracal pistol family. Many other features make it a distinct sporting rifle that is well differentiated from other carbines on the market.\n\n[FONT=Calibri]    CARACAL CS308 SNIPER RIFLE\n   The Caracal CS308 has been designed in direct relation to specific Military Procurement requests within the GCC Region. Currently all production of the CS308 rifle is being directed to fulfillment of the Military contracts. Should Caracal International have additional units once these contracts are complete we will review the feasibility of commercial sales within the US Market.\n   \nTeam Caracal will be utilizing the CS308 rifle in the 2015 Precision Rifle Series. This is being done as an effort to show the capabilities of the CS308 factory rifle amongst the best of the best in the US Market.\n   \nSHOT SHOW INDUSTRY DAY AT RANGE\n   For media members and buyers, an Industry Day at the range was arranged at Boulder Rifle and Pistol Club a day before Shot Show took place on Monday.

However, I would want to share my point of view wrt the size of this handgun. For me, 1911s have always been a likable handgun in its full size capacity, the bigger the fancier :) and I could never develop the taste for the comparatively compact versions. As far as the price is concerned, that too is turn off as it should ceil somewhere near 3.25 and I wouldn''t pay a penny more than that.  :)\n\n(The above estimated price is in comparative terms to the other high-end handguns that are found in our markets).', ''),

My honest suggestion would be to opt for 97B if you are looking for a .45 handgun; it is value for money in true sense. However, if your preference is a 1911 platform, then do consider Taurus PT1911 as well. Nowadays PT1911 floats around 100K. And if at all you are able to find NP44, because of their rarity they would retail around 85K+ and that too in used condition. I wish I could be of more help. :)\nCheers', ''),

Furthermore, it takes a lot of practice to become proficient with the 1911 battery of arms while under stress, especially if you plan on carrying with a loaded chamber. When it comes to recreational shooting, I prefer full size for the extra comfort and longer sight radius, and I prefer a steel frame (especially in a 1911) for it''s increased durability. So it''s kind of a "middle of the road" gun in my eyes. [I]However[/I], if it fulfills [B]your[/B] needs and desires, I''m certain you''ll be happy with the Sig. \n\nDisclaimer: I do not like Sig 1911''s and wouldn''t buy [I]any[/I] of them. The [I]only[/I] reason being... they use an external extractor. It may seem petty, but to me, styling is as important as anything else when it comes to 1911''s (I wouldn''t buy a 1911 with rails either). Having said that, I have shot their Nightmare and Super Target, and I must admit, the quality, smoothness, fitment, and accuracy, is impeccable :)', ''),

My honest suggestion would be to opt for 97B if you are looking for a .45 handgun; it is value for money in true sense. However, if your preference is a 1911 platform, then do consider Taurus PT1911 as well. Nowadays PT1911 floats around 100K. And if at all you are able to find NP44, because of their rarity they would retail around 85K+ and that too in used condition. I wish I could be of more help. :)\nCheers[/QUOTE]\nI will agree with you bro CZ 97B is an excellent pistol in 45 any one who is looking to buy a 45 get this pistol before it dries up in the market a true value for money and with no hiccups which you will normally face with 1911 .', ''),

The testing for each pellet was done by shooting it from 15 meters using Gamo Shadow on a stack of 50 Business Visiting cards held together by a rubber band. Well none of them made it through the 50 cards and its too much to expect from an Airgun specially considering its a 16 fpe category airgun. \n\n\nI have mentioned two values for each of the 3 shots I took and then average value for the 3 shots taken. The two values are penetration (the card number on which the pellet was found) and impact (the number of cards that got at-least a tear on them due to impact, the indent didn''t count)\n\n\nThe first shot had the least penetration for all pellets as on first shot the cards bundle was tight and firm but with every shot the bundle started opening up and the penetration would increase but since a fresh stack for used for each kind of pellet, the benefit / variation remains same for all kinds of pellets used. \n\n[URL="http://postimg.org/image/p6x4d1c7p/"][IMG]http://s26.postimg.org/p6x4d1c7p/Untitled.jpg[/IMG][/URL][/QUOTE]\n\nThis is very valuable info .. i think soon gamo company will appoint you as their local brand ambbassidor (just joking) :-)\nSo far my weekend is free .. i''ve this craze for going to itwar bazaar but seldom get the opportunity, so if possible keep plan on saturday but if u''ve other commitments even sunday is fine i''ll go to sunday bazaar next time .. plus do invite jog3ee and khilji as well .. thanks', ''),

(634595, ' [FONT=Times New Roman][SIZE=3][COLOR=#000000]  [/COLOR][/SIZE][/FONT][COLOR=#222222][FONT="Verdana"]The concept of copying works in two different ways.[/FONT][/COLOR]\n[FONT=Times New Roman][SIZE=3][COLOR=#000000]  [/COLOR][/SIZE][/FONT][COLOR=#222222][FONT="Verdana"]\nOne is to copy the exact thing. This is normally done to produce low cost products. Sometimes, this concept is used to offer very high quality product as well. The famous examples are of 1911 and AR-15. But in case of 1911 and AR-15, Colt made the designs public. Nobody stole their designs. Now, there are 1911s and AR-15s which are way better in quality than those of Colt and then there are 1911s and AR-15s which are cheap in price and inferior in quality. Then there is example of Norinco which copied every famous design from AKM to TT, from 1911 to AR-15 and Sig226 and so on and on. But the main purpose here was to produce cheap copies. For example, the factory price of copy of Sig226 called NP-22 is USD 50/-. Even then they guaranteed certain performance level. For NP-22, the claimed useful life is 10,000 rounds. But when it came to production of weapons for their LEA, they either acquired licenses (of AKM, TT & etc. from Russia) or innovated their own design NP-42 (aka CF-98). Here I am talking about legal copying only and not about production of counterfeit products. [/FONT][/COLOR]\n[FONT=Times New Roman][SIZE=3][COLOR=#000000]  [/COLOR][/SIZE][/FONT][COLOR=#222222][FONT="Verdana"]\nSecond is to take inspiration from already existing design. This method was widely used by Japanese. They never copied the whole thing. They reverse-engineered every successful design but when it came to production, they never produced the exact same thing. Their earlier cars were smaller in size but their shape and engineering was inspired from famous cars of Germany and US. There was lot of innovation involved. Now, they are at par with their peers in the market. In firearm world, Glock used polygonal barrel concept of HK, Steyr used striker fired design of Glock and Caracal used design of Styer to produce gun with lesser number of parts. Zastava produced CZ999 based on design concept of Sig226. Sarsilmaz produced B6 based on CZ 75B and ST-9 based on HK USP. Nobody produced exact same copy. Taurus produced AFS92 based on Beretta 92FS.[/FONT][/COLOR]\n[FONT=Times New Roman][SIZE=3][COLOR=#000000]  [/COLOR][/SIZE][/FONT][COLOR=#222222][FONT="Verdana"]\nAstoundingly, none of the manufacturer not even Norinco produced exact copy of Beretta. Why? May be due to design complications or patent. There are reasons when other cannot copy your product due to some trade secret or some secret process of production. For example, still nobody can copy KFC&#8217;s recipe even though its patent has expired a long ago because KFC is deliberately hiding ingredients of their recipe. They have spread production of their recipe in 7 different factories across US and the employees of one factory are not transferred to other. So, nobody knows all the ingredients. Same is the case with Coke and Fries of McDonald. I have read somewhere that locking lug and locking piece of Beretta are most tricky and material specific parts in Beretta 92FS. Even slides of Beretta used to breaking into 2 at locking area. Further, Beretta did not share their design even with Taurus to whom they sell their factory leave aside technical expertise. Despite the fact that DAK guys are making clones of Beretta 92FS for last 02 decades, their clones are still unstable. Why? Because they cannot match technical expertise of Beretta.[/FONT][/COLOR]\n[FONT=Times New Roman][SIZE=3][COLOR=#000000]  [/COLOR][/SIZE][/FONT][COLOR=#222222][FONT="Verdana"]\nThe case of POF is different here. Neither they produced copy nor theirs design is based on / inspired from other design. Rather, they picked up a copy produced by somebody else and tagged it as their own and priced it higher than every other copycat producing the same thing. Moon Star is producing a better copy with chromed barrel and selling it at Rs. 15,000/- to Rs. 20,000/-. Now, they may have shifted production to POF Wah but in the recent documentary (filmed in December 2014), they showed every corner of factory but they never showed pistol manufacturing unit or assembly line. There did not even mention the pistol manufacturing facility on their recently updated website.[/FONT][/COLOR]\n[FONT=Times New Roman][SIZE=3][COLOR=#000000]  [/COLOR][/SIZE][/FONT][COLOR=#222222][FONT="Verdana"] [/FONT][/COLOR]\n[FONT=Times New Roman][SIZE=3][COLOR=#000000]  [/COLOR][/SIZE][/FONT][COLOR=#222222][FONT="Verdana"]The more shameful aspect is that after years of manufacturing guns, they could not come up with indigenous design to fulfill needs of Pak Army and other LEAs and they meeting their needs with Glock, Beretta, cheaper NP-22 or now with Sarsilmaz&#8217;s B6. If their PK-9 design was so perfect, why did not Pak Army adopt it? Why they chose Sarsilmaz&#8217;s B6?[/FONT][/COLOR]\n\n[FONT=Times New Roman][SIZE=3][COLOR=#000000]  [/COLOR][/SIZE][/FONT]', ''),

The Euro models are the older ones and their mag release is located on the heel of the grip and the US models are the newer ones with an ambi mag release behind the trigger guard.  These are amazing guns and there aren''t that many people in the world with the training to disassemble the cocker/decocker grip system.  Also although very accurate the recoil is stiff as the barrel is fixed.  Secondly, you must be careful to shoot clean burning ammo through it as there are small gas ports for recoil operation in the chamber where the bullet separates from the case upon being ignited.  Dirty ammo will clog up the holes and the holes are very difficult to get to to clean unless you take the barrel out of the frame. \nAside from that its a great piece.  Have own many over the years... the M13 is a collectors item worldwide and the M8 is not.  Price is a bit on the high side.

Don''t know about future but things are not easy specially with reference to fake or if properly worded, licenses without proper record).\n\n[U]Now, my experience:[/u]\n\nI went there after paying fee at Omni Khan Mobile ( which took about 10 to 15 minutes, thanks to temporary faliure of printing device). Later, went to Nadra facilitation centre in DC Office, but to my utter surprise, I came to know that \n\n[b]tokens are issued in morning from 8am or 8:30am to 11am or 12 pm except Friday. On Friday, token issuance ends even early. Infact its not time period that matters but number of tokens.. and at present DC officr Nadra Facilitation Centre (NFC) has capacity to deal only about 80 applicants per day (till 2:00pm). So they issue only 70 to 80 tokens (plus minus few) and then only those are processed.[/b]\n\nSo, those who are interested, should go early at least till 9:00am, IMO).\nProcess is not quick, and it takes around 35 to 45 minutes approximately per applicant subject to speed of the staff and provided fee is already paid.\n\n\n[U]Now some observations/information:[/u]\n\n1. Nadra Staff is very polite and mannerable, specially In charge of NFC Lahore!\n\n2. Issues of licenses without proper record, is likely to go to courts, sooner or later.\n\n3. Nadra itself, advising/suggesting, to let the process finalised/mature in few days and then come for computerisation. (Showing lack of proper SOP).\n\n4. Importantly, this computerisation is at present only for Individual license holders, gratis and free licenses plus licenses of companies are not yet required to be computerised.\n\n5. About NTN, I was told, that it is not mandatory, but if one has been issued NTN, he has to produce a copy of the certificate. And when I ask further on the matter, I got the impression that its not must, but Nadra may verify your record later, that whether it is issued to you or not, and if your answer at NFC does not match with the record, it may become an issue later. However, its too early to say something confidently, as stated earlier, things are not finalised yet. But, they ask for NTN, and if it is issued to you then one should produslce the copy of certificate but if its not issued to you then you can simply say that you are not NTN holder and they will put NO in the field and process your application without it. But if later, it appears that you were issued a NTN, then there may be an issue.\n\n\nRegards', ''),

Squeeze the grip cocker and pull the trigger to fire.  2.  Pull the trigger first and then squeeze the cocker.  3.  Pull/Squeeze simultaneously together to get it to fire.

(635250, ' Hi Moeen,\n\nColt tried to sue Norinco over its M4 copy but it''s still available in Canada. The dealer doesn''t get sued, as far as I know, only the manufacturer. Besides, these laws are different from country to country. The market is full of cheap imported clones here. I for example own a clone of a 1911 made in the Philippines, I doubt they licenced the design.  But of course,  I will do more research on this though. \n\nAs for the quality, obviously that will have to be vetted before I commit to taking orders from the supplier. However, for civilian use, a rugged design is mostly what''s needed. No one really expects clones to have the same tolerances, which is why they''re cheap. I have a German made H&K and it just feels completely different then an American made AR, but the AR is much cheaper, which is why most people just buy the AR (and you''d be surprised how bad American made firearms actually are, lol).', ''),
(635251, ' Salam All,\nPoint well stated; however, you should know that the Colt copyrights expired long ago; hence, the reason everyone is making them.  Either way, do your checking as I believe you may be taking this a little lightly.  Century Arms was here and left ages ago.  I met the Turks here about ten years ago too, they too left.

I got the token (Manual) and then took another token (Computerised one). Then went for picture and thumb impression from there for data entry, then form got printed then one has to sign it and check for any errors or Mistakes, if all is in accordance with the licence details, then the arms license etc is scanned (i.e. each important page of the License), then a cerificate is printed and signed by the in charge of NFC, whereby license holder is authorised to keep weapon with him. It is being issued for three months but extendable by the authority.\r\n\r\nNormally pricess is not lengthy (approximately it should take around 20-30 minutes), but thanks to nipotism.. it took around 2 hours :shoked:\r\n\r\nSo, all those who wish to go for computerisation of the License, I advise them in the light of my experience to go at the earliest... i.e. at 8:15am or maximum before 9:00am. Because, the later you go the later you will finish the work plus number of applicants increase after 9:30am. So I highly suggest you to go there before 9:00am.\r\n\r\nAlso, when you go there remain vigilant about your token number and sequence so that no relative, friend or VIP can be entered or facilitated on your turn.\r\n\r\nLastly, try to make photcopies of your license and other details for your record and also of CNIC, because, with the license, Omni slip and CNIC copy is to be attached.\r\n\r\n\r\nP.S. It doesn''t matter how many bullets or shells you are authorised to keep as per your licence, NFC staff is entering data only of default limits i.e. 25 at a time and 100 annually.... I objected to this and was told that they were given orders to do the same and later in the process of data verification if my increased limit is proved to be genuine, that will be entered...

Sadly the quota is again diminished to 25, I argued but he said only DCO People can extend it.

How Much? they are unaware. Did people who went at DCO office paid any amount for renewal. I had already got one of my licence renewed for 2015. Waisay I got my licences photocopied.

At the moment getting a licence is an issue if one does not have contacts as the licences are not being issued to the general public presently.

We have a few Karachi based members like Enigmatic Desires who have extensive knowledge about the licences being issued in Sindh, i reckon that they would be of more help. As for getting a rifle and a pistol in your range is quite possible, depending on what you really want to buy, imported 9mm handguns start from around 45 thousand (chinese) and you can find a decent CZ pistol for around 100K (in Karachi).

(635464, ' [QUOTE=ali87;473225]So Gun Gurus Identify this gun.[/QUOTE]\r\n\r\nDear ali87, this is Dardick Series 1500 Pistol. The Dardick pistol was available commercially from 1954 to 1962. It was also tested rather extensively by the U.S. Army for possible use in rifles and machine guns. Patented by David Dardick, it was initially chambered for the .38 Dardick Special and best described as a 15-round, magazine-fed, double-action revolver designed to use a triangular-shaped cartridge called a Tround. The case was made of a special plastic and, since the three chambers of the enclosed cylinder had open sides for cartridge feeding and case ejection, it had to be strong enough to contain the pressure of firing.\r\n\r\nPulling the trigger brings an external hammer to its cocked position. As the cylinder revolves, one chamber positions a loaded round beneath the hammer, the second cylinder dumps the spent case of a previously fired round from the gun and the third cylinder picks up a fresh cartridge from a magazine located in the grip of the gun.\r\n\r\nThe Dardick Series 1500 pistol was introduced at a price of $99.50 and came with interchangeable .38- and .22-cal. barrels. The extra barrel and chamber inserts included with the gun along with a selector on its hammer enabled it to also use .22 Rimfire ammunition. Adaptors that allowed 9 mm Luger and .38 S&W to be used with the .38-cal. barrel were also announced. A carbine conversion unit with shoulder stock was also available. If ever there was a firearm design answer to a question asked by no one, the Dardick was it. [img]http://www.guns.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/unusualtrounds3.jpg[/img]', ''),

No worries; I will find many more M44s but a dear brother like him is rare to find.\n\nSome eye-candies here;â¦\n\n[URL="http://s1341.photobucket.com/user/Jibz77/media/Mosin%20Nagant%20M44%20Laminated/1_zpsqqeccucs.jpg.html"][IMG]http://i1341.photobucket.com/albums/o744/Jibz77/Mosin%20Nagant%20M44%20Laminated/1_zpsqqeccucs.jpg[/IMG][/URL]\n\n[URL="http://s1341.photobucket.com/user/Jibz77/media/Mosin%20Nagant%20M44%20Laminated/3_zpsqrlesswh.jpg.html"][IMG]http://i1341.photobucket.com/albums/o744/Jibz77/Mosin%20Nagant%20M44%20Laminated/3_zpsqrlesswh.jpg[/IMG][/URL] \n\nIn our telephonic conversation, my friend mentioned that he would want it restored and presentable and for me it meant that the-game-is-on and I started stripping down the whole rifle; each and every part like receiver, trigger assembly, bolt assembly and magazine etc. Its pictured below.\n\n[URL="http://s1341.photobucket.com/user/Jibz77/media/Mosin%20Nagant%20M44%20Laminated/IMG_2049_zpsgcwetr7e.jpg.html"][IMG]http://i1341.photobucket.com/albums/o744/Jibz77/Mosin%20Nagant%20M44%20Laminated/IMG_2049_zpsgcwetr7e.jpg[/IMG][/URL] \n\nThere were many markings on the receiver, barrel, bands, rear and front sites which needed to be preserved and I ensured that when blued, these markings should not vanish while removing any rust or pitting here and there. All the metals parts were blued after they had been treated with Rust-Killer solutions and smoothened. But thatâs all boring, letâs come to the interesting stuff which happened.\nI prepared the stock myself as I had enough time and zre-zoor (heart power, the Pashto speakers would know what I mean) to take on the furniture restoration project.\nFirst I started sanding of the stock with a 120 grit paper to remove the Shellac which you will find on these Russian rifles in almost all the cases. There are few other methods as well to remove these coatings however using a 120 grit sandpaper is a prudent way to do it. It removed all the Shellac and I noticed that the grains of the laminated wood emerged from underneath.\n\n[URL="http://s1341.photobucket.com/user/Jibz77/media/Mosin%20Nagant%20M44%20Laminated/IMG_2067_zpsuhyyrqsm.jpg.html"][IMG]http://i1341.photobucket.com/albums/o744/Jibz77/Mosin%20Nagant%20M44%20Laminated/IMG_2067_zpsuhyyrqsm.jpg[/IMG][/URL]\n \n\nFrom there onwards it was a case of using the elbow grease only, as extensively as possible. After I had completely sanded down the stock with one and a half sheet of 120 grit paper, the next in line was a 220 grit paper. And after the same treatment, I used a 300, 400 and in the end a 600 grit sandpaper. I used to move the sand paper along the direction of the grains in the laminated wood. There were very few ignorable and minor dents left in the stock which I could straighten out through the boiling-water method but as the stock was absolutely free of oil composites or dirt marks so I instead left those few dings and dents in place as this battle ridden stalwart needed its scars from the past.\n\n[URL="http://s1341.photobucket.com/user/Jibz77/media/Mosin%20Nagant%20M44%20Laminated/IMG_2065_zps39juld6o.jpg.html"][IMG]http://i1341.photobucket.com/albums/o744/Jibz77/Mosin%20Nagant%20M44%20Laminated/IMG_2065_zps39juld6o.jpg[/IMG][/URL]\n \nThe next step was to give it a coat and I opted for Boiled Linseed Oil- BLO (Boiled linseed oil refers to a combination of raw linseed oil, stand oil and metallic dryers; catalysts to accelerate drying). To be honest, the furniture makers in Peshawar were not aware about the existence of any such oil OR may be I was using the wrong term to explain it but the fact remains that I couldnât find it in Peshawar. To my rescue came my dear friend, who is now the new owner of the rifle and sent me this 750 ml canister from Islamabad. I first applied the 600 grit sandpaper till the time the wood was in the smoothest possible finish it could with my novice skill level. After that I cleaned it up with a rag so that there is no leftover from the sanding. The BLO was warmed a little bit, enough to make it less viscous and then was applied on the stock with finger tips. YES, thatâs how it has been traditionally done and the reason is that it is applied in very little quantity (just enough which gets spread on the finger tips).

(635555, 'Witnessing armed robbery Couple of hours ago, I left Police station for dinner, Instead of going to my routine place. I ended up on a new street hotel (hardly 10 mins walk). Had dinner and while I was having a cup of tea inside that hotel with my face towards street. I heard this familiar AK''s cocking sound. \r\n\r\nBelieve you me, I see 3 youngmen getting off of 2 bikes  honda 125. Pant shirts, Helmets, black shawl. Exactly opposite to my hotel..... they entered a electronics shop and  started beating the owners and their employee. \r\n\r\nI for a second or two..... Just felt paralyzed and convinced myself...this is some sick illusion. 2 went inside the shop and one stayed outside carrying an Ak style weapon. Standing maybe 15 feet from me.... Looking at the hotel...since it is the only nearest place with people. Most shops were closed by now. \r\n\r\nI stood up in fear..... stepped back and grabbed my phone....dailed SHO''s number (who, I knew is in thana). As call connected I quickly told SHO about the location and robbery in progress. \r\n\r\nPlease note - By now Only 40/45 seconds passed since they landed in that shop. \r\n\r\nAs I am done informing my official (8:55 PM). Both robbers inside came out... entered another shop on the left. I could hear the cries. They were talking less and beating more to present their intentions. \r\n\r\nEven with my best effort - I will fail to explain the fear it spread. In hotel, I was the only customer. Hotel owner ran into a linked street and stupid waiter tried to pull down the shutter. I warned him not to....shutter down sound alarmed the third robber and he came in middle of the road aiming his rifle right towards the hotel (well imagine just a small shop - not an actual hotel).\r\n\r\nDon''t know why I really thought for a second that.... Maybe he shoots to scare...and stray bullet may hit me. This thought really chilled me all over. I really felt like a sissy girl.\r\n\r\nNow HARDLY 90 seconds passed and I see them starting bikes.. I quickly called my Boss but it wasn''t answered. \r\n \r\nI can safely say that robbers came, robbed 2 shops and rode away in under 2 minutes. \r\n\r\nPolice arrived seconds later (first 2 in civvies  arrived on bike bearing arms...and then mobile van. But robbers were gone with margin of seconds. (Link streets are a mess in this suburban area). Response time couldn''t be any more better. Please no debate over that. Only superman could have come any faster in this particular crime scene. \r\n\r\nIf I may speak frankly for a moment here. I seriously feared for a bloody shootout if they have stayed a tiny bit more. Everyone would have been a fair game primarily Policemen (the first 2 who arrived on bike would require a moment to understand robbery location, giving robbers enough time to aim and pull trigger on those two...... then robbers and most importantly Civilians. \r\n\r\nDon''t think for a moment that a Policeman is showing cowardice. No. Took your permission to speak "frankly" on this. I just shared the strategic would-be scenario with my honest opinion. \r\n\r\nSHO is still gone with some constables on a lead. Though I am not too optimistic but we''ll see. I wish they are caught, Insha Allah. \r\n\r\nPakgun has been here for me whenever I needed. This is my community, reliable and caring people. Though I am not an active one here anymore but still when ever I am in need to vomit my feelings out... This is the place. Though I run my own personal blog but I was intrigued to come here and write this experience instead of on my website. \r\n\r\nGuys - Seriously It is killing me for what I witnessed tonight. People suffered in a great deal right in front of me. My heart goes out to them. \r\n\r\nHow disturbing it is to realize that amount of pain and suffering Innocent people go through becoming the victims. Alas.\r\n\r\nPolice has to and should go extra miles to take care of this robbery/mugging problem. It is Police''s responsibility to protect the innocent against these predator types. These muggers - armed robbers (bikers) are too fast. Police has to work on priority basis to address this issue for the sake of Public safety.\r\n\r\nTo a safe and peaceful community.', ''),

(635560, ' Let me try to explain:\r\n\r\nThis measurement is different for smooth bore and rifled bore weapons.\r\n\r\nFor smooth bore weapon such as shotgun, it is the fraction of 1 pound of Lead that will be used to make a round ball that will fit in barrel of your smooth bore weapon i.e. shotgun in this case. For simplicity, make a ball that will fit in barrel of your weapon, then weight it. If the weight of ball is 1/12 of a pound, your gun will be called 12 Gauge. If the weight of ball is 1/16 of a pound, it will be called 16 gauge.\r\n\r\nIn rifled bore, it is the inner diameter of barrel (obtained by measuring between 2 opposite lands of the barrel) or outer diameter of projectile in inches or in milimeters. 32 bore revolver means, its barrel has inner diameter of .32 inch. After 1950, they started using metric system to designate caliber like 7.62 mm which is .30 inch. That''s why you hear two different names of same caliber like 7.62 mm round is also known as .308. In this case .308 is inner diameter of barrel while 7.62mm is outer diameter of projectile. .22 LR is .22 inch. .32 or 32 bore is .32 inch. .38 or 38 bore is .38 inch.\r\n\r\nThis is what I have learned till now.', ''),

(635623, ' [QUOTE=Leon;473327]Let me try to explain:\n\nThis measurement is different for smooth bore and rifled bore weapons.\n\nFor smooth bore weapon such as shotgun, it is the fraction of 1 pound of Lead that will be used to make a round ball that will fit in barrel of your smooth bore weapon i.e. shotgun in this case. For simplicity, make a ball that will fit in barrel of your weapon, then weight it. If the weight of ball is 1/12 of a pound, your gun will be called 12 Gauge. If the weight of ball is 1/16 of a pound, it will be called 16 gauge.\n\nIn rifled bore, it is the inner diameter of barrel (obtained by measuring between 2 opposite lands of the barrel) or outer diameter of projectile in inches or in milimeters. 32 bore revolver means, its barrel has inner diameter of .32 inch. After 1950, they started using metric system to designate caliber like 7.62 mm which is .30 inch. That''s why you hear two different names of same caliber like 7.62 mm round is also known as .308. In this case .308 is inner diameter of barrel while 7.62mm is outer diameter of projectile. .22 LR is .22 inch. .32 or 32 bore is .32 inch. .38 or 38 bore is .38 inch.\n\nThis is what I have learned till now.[/QUOTE]\n\nLeon brother is correct.

If he is not being able to do it, than it put question mark on training and selection of the gentleman. Its crime at par with of a soldier who throws down his arm at the time of war.', ''),

Other wise you might pay 20-25 thousand rupees and end up having a fake licence. While you are at it ask for at least 2 licences, to the CM giving 4-5 licences is same as giving 1. I had one such opportunity and i asked for just one PB licence, as i was not sure if my source would be able to get it for me or not. to my amazement i had the PB approval in my hand within a week without paying a single rupee. Later on i requested for more licences but those days PPP government was about to go and my contact became ineffective.

Lawyers pointed out that due to target killings and abduction of doctors and the December 16 massacre at the Army Public School and College, the provincial government allowed the doctors and teachers to carry arms for self-protection. They said that lawyers were suffering attacks and thus had a strong case to be issued licenses for prohibited bore weapons.', ''),

When there is lawlessness... if the stubborn government is forced by the court to allow people (infact class of people) to carry and keep weapon for protection then its indeed a good news. Atleast they are given something to defend with and protect their basic fundamental right. I consider it a first drop of rain and in reality every one must be allowed to keep weapons for his and his family''s safety.\n\nSecondly, I agree with you and consider it also a faliure of government that circumstances reach to this level. But again, as we both agree that law and order situation is critical to say the least, then what if citizens are not armed... they will simply get preyed by BGs... and what if they are armed? At least they have something to defend or attempt to defend. Personally, I dont consider that at present in time of need (God forbid) any authority helps any victim. I mean against criminals of dacoity, murder, kidnapping etc... they are not cencerned or are already busy in "some other works" that individual citizen is not their priority anymore.\n\nSo when government is not doing its part, which it certainly not, then let the people have something to defend themselves.\n\nSo, its indeed a positive move in present circumstances specially. Lets hope its made for general public.\n\nThirdly, hoplessness is a sin and I am not hopeless but me too see that things are going towards "wrong destination". (GOD forbid, Aameen). All incidents in recent past and our responses and strategy is going to lead us astray. May my observations proved wrong. Aameen.\n\nBut even if its going to be so, (God Forbid, Aameen) in a chaotic situation I think armed person is better than an unarmed one.', ''),

Now thinking to get a low price compact/pocket size pistol/revolver that I can keep it in my pocket while going for morning walks or drives with my wife and kids, we all know that security situation is really bad.  I am looking fot something very compact and pocket size in 9mm, have been out of touched from the local market for years so would prefer to ask you guys for advice.

And great was their craft and great their number, which was one hundred and forty four thousand, give or take a few job-shoppers. Yea, they did strive mightily, too, for they knew what would happen if they strove not mightily. And the name of my capital improvement project was the Tower of Babel. \n\nYea, great was their craft and wonderful to behold what the Designers of Buildings wrought on papyrus. All who looked thereon did marvel at their genius. I, Abibarshim, did also look thereon and did declare their designs to have much nift. \n\nBut many days did pass, and many times did the moon wax and wane, and the tower was not yet builded. \n\nSo I, Abibarshim, King of Kings, did hie me to the palace by the Arakhtu where dwelt the Designers of Buildings and Makers of Engines. And there I found NOT Designers of Buildings and Makers of Engines, but Drinkers of Coffee and Tellers of Tales (whom mem call hurlers of bull dung). So I vented my royal spleen, which did perturb them mightily. \n\n"Look here, O King, etc.," saith the Chief of the Makers of Engines. "Some things can''t be rushed. If thou wantest us to get thy bloody tower builded on time, then thou hadst better givest us a little respect. For canst thou build thy tower without us?" \n\n      "But I have given thee this palace in which thy work may be done, and I pay thee many talents of gold and silver, plus all the usual fringes. What more wouldst thou have me do to get this project moving?" \n\n"Well, thou canst start with alabaster lamps for the draughtsmen," saith the Chief of the Makers of Engines, refilling his cup. "And maybe draughting instruments of silver and electrum..." \n\n      "Thou shalt have them. Just get my tower builded." \n\nAnd I, Abibarshim, King of Kings, did depart the palace of the Makers of Engines with my tail betwixt my legs. \n\nAnd many days did pass, and many times did the moon wax and wane, and the tower was still not yet builded. So I, Abibarshim, did corner the Chief Scribe and ask him, "What goeth on here?" \n\nThe Chief Scribe fell to his knees and said: \n\n"O Great and Merciful King, the Makers of Engines give us scrolls of material for to purchase. But, verily, no man knoweth what the scrolls signify, save the Makers of Engines themselves. For they call not a spade a spade, but call it here a delver and there a digger and another place an entrenching tool and yet another a geovolvometer, so that the scroll of material agreeth not with the design papyrus. And strange to behold is their numerology." \n\nSo I, Abibarshim, gave certain orders to try to keep the Makers of Engines from creating their own language, saying, "How did it come to pass that those who have such swiftness of mind, even as the gazelle, lack the sense of geese?" \n\nAnd many days did pass, and many times did the moon wax and wane, and the estimate did wax and never waned, and the tower was not yet builded. \n\nSo then I did ask the Chief Mason, "What giveth?" and he, throwing himself prostrate before me, spake thus: \n\n"O King, every day we toil from dawn until the dusk! Every week the Makers of Engines say they have wrought new and niftier designs, of which we knew not, and what we have builded hath been fashioned unto obsolete papyri. Then my team teareth down and starteth over, O Great King, Merciful King, King of Kings...." \n\nSo I, Abibarshim, gave certain orders that did fix those designs thenceforth. \n\nBut many days did pass, and the tower did rise slower than sap rolleth down the bark of a tree. \n\nSo I, Abibarshim, did seek out the Chief Aethyopean, who seemed to know where it''s at, and asked, "How come no tower?" \n\nAnd he did answer, \n\n"O Great and Merciful King, I run short of bolt tighteners." \n\n      "Well, buy some more!" \n\n"I have, O King, but each one either getteth used up or runneth off as soon as he learneth his trade." \n\n      "Which is?" \n\n"The Makers of Engines have designed the granite facing panels such that no man hath arms long nor thin enough to reach the bolts. Thus each panel requireth that a bolt tightener crawl behind and affix the bolts." \n\n      "So?" \n\n"So then he cannot get back out, O King, but is entombed there forever."\n\nI, Abibarshim, did then call for a redesign which cost us three months and one thousand gold talents. But the days did pass and the tower had attained only four tiers in height. So I did go to the Chief Scribe to inquire why. \n\n"O King, we have been awaiting, lo, these many months, the columns of Corinthian marble for the fifth tier." \n\n      "Is marble from Corinth so hard to find, then?" \n\n"Nay, Sire, but the Corinthian stone cutters make columns only in heights which be whole numbers of cubits. And the Makers of Engines have specified columns which be twelve cubits plus eleven-seventeenths part of a cubit. Such columns are not to be found in all of Corinth as an off-the-shelf item." \n\n      "Well, let''s just change the drawings and round them off to thirteen cubits even." \n\n"Nay, Sire, for they must match unto the interior columns, which are bought pre-cut from Ionia and which we have aplenty." \n\n      "Okay, we''ll cut the Ionian columns down and go unto twelve cubit columns all around." \n\n"Nay, for the Ionian columns be all of one piece with their capitals. To shorten them would mean cutting off their capitals." \n\n      "What in the name of Marduk is wrong with that? We can just fit new capitals on top of the shortened columns!" \n\n"Nay again, Sire. The entire structure unto the very top is designed around monobloc columns. To add new capitals would weaken the fifth and higher tiers and require a complete redesign!" \n\nI, Abibarshim, King of Kings, avouch that Makers of Engines, for all their craft, know not how to fly. For surely the Chief of the Makers of Engines and all his men would have flown down, had they known how, from the fourth level of my tower, from which parapet I, Abibarshim, King of Kings, had them flung. \n\nTherefore have I, Abibarshim, King of Kings, created this Code and ordered it displayed at the Coffee Machine and all other places where hangeth out the Designers of Buildings and Makers of Engines. \n\nTHE CODE OF ABIBARSHIM\n\nOnce thou decidest that name to call a thing, that shall be its name forever after, until eternity passeth. Nor shalt thou call any other thing by that name, for each thing shall have a name unto itself.\n\nAnd in like manner shall be the enumeration of each thing.\n\nContinue not to design a thing unto perfection, for, verily, an ounce of timeliness is more valuable than a pound of perfection. Once thou hast approved a design, go not back and improve it, unless of necessity most dire.\n\nCover not thy tracks but make thy calculations plain, that those who follow thee may trace any error to its beginning and thus set it and all its brethren upon the path of righteousness.\n\nAnd mock not the necessary papyrus work, for it is the handmaiden of what thou createst in stone and iron. Completest all thy papyri as thou goest and hoardest them not as a surprise for manufacturing.\n\nAttendest first to that which hath the most importance. Waste not time fixing thy wind to heavy papyrus with wire.\n\nHe who designeth without a plan is like he who rusheth forth into darkness without a torch. Rush not ere thou knowest whither, for there are many snares and pitfalls in the dark, and wild beasts to reach up and bite thine ass or camel on the path named Critical.\n\nSpecify not odd-ball sizes and kinds of things, but design unto standards, that the scribes may buy stuff off-the-shelf and dabble not with specials.\n\nDesignest not assemblies which require four arms to put together or operate. Verily, the guy we hire in these days hath not four arms but ten thumbs.\n\nRemember well that all which thou designest shall be a balance of time and cost and quality and function. If thou attendest not to all four, then miserable shall be thy lot and brief thy employment (unless thou knowest how to fly).', ''),

Going from Rwp to Lhr Its located approx 3-4 km on left side after crossing T chowk. Really easy to locate everyone there knows about NADRA office. Anyways, on the left side there is a kacha road adjacent to Nadra office. A few steps on the track and you will reach basement of NADRA office. There will be written Punjab License Site. Enter the biulding turn right and there you will see team of 4-5 people dedicated for this procedure. There is was no rush at all. The NADRA person told me that there is an omni shop just close by. Deposit 1400 rs there come back to us for rest of the procedure.\r\n\r\nIts better to get the books completely photo copied before handing over. Its Pakistan after all.\r\n\r\nAs far as renewal is concerned, guy from Arms branch told me to get the license renewed before going to NADRA. However,  Nadra representative said there is no need of renewal we need licenses renewed uptill 31 dec 2014 and renewal will be done along with computerisation as per the will of license holder.

(636103, 'DSA TRUSHOT: Range Review &amp; Report [b]DSA TRUSHOT: Range review & Report[/b]\r\n\r\n[img][URL=http://s883.photobucket.com/user/p080003/media/DSC_0050_zps1f81127b.jpg.html][IMG]http://i883.photobucket.com/albums/ac39/p080003/DSC_0050_zps1f81127b.jpg[/IMG][/URL][/img]\r\n\r\nTRUSHOT is the latest addition to the list of firearms produced by DAUDSONS Armory. TRUSHOT appears to be robustly made gun with good performance. Being inflicted with the motto of â Be Pakistani, Buy Pakistaniâ mentality, I believe I was one of the few people who laid his hands on the first production model of the handgun keeping in view the quality and workmanship of previous products of DSA that I have used. It was a risk worth taking.\r\n\r\n\r\n[b]Basic Specs:[/b]\r\n\r\nModel: DSA Trushot\r\nManufacturer: Daudsons Armory\r\nCalibre: 9x19mm\r\nTotal Length: 190mm\r\nBarrel Length: 102mm\r\nWeight :900gms\r\nCapacity:\r\nSlide: Forged Steel\r\nFrame: Aircraft grade Aluminum Alloy\r\nSights: Three dot sight\r\nFrame Finish: DSA Scratch less coating\r\nSlide Finish: Phosphate Coated \r\n\r\n[img][URL=http://s883.photobucket.com/user/p080003/media/DSC_0047_zps1fde6675.jpg.html][IMG]http://i883.photobucket.com/albums/ac39/p080003/DSC_0047_zps1fde6675.jpg[/IMG][/URL][/img]\r\n\r\n\r\n[b]Packing:[/b]\r\nTRUSHOT comes in a plastic pistol case which includes the pistol and two magazines. There is no cleaning rod or user manual as available with any other known brand in the marker.  Packing is adequate at least better than most of Russian and Serbian brands that comes in card board box.\r\n\r\n\r\n[img][URL=http://s883.photobucket.com/user/p080003/media/DSC_0052_zps8d23273c.jpg.html][IMG]http://i883.photobucket.com/albums/ac39/p080003/DSC_0052_zps8d23273c.jpg[/IMG][/URL][/img]\r\n\r\n\r\n[b]Finishing & Looks:[/b]\r\n\r\nSeeing the TRUSHOT one would immediately think of SIG P226 platform design. Although there are many changes aesthetically but the inner design/operation and assembly/disassembly resembles the SIG platform. The gun looks solidly built with smooth edges and tooling marks. The outer finishing is good if not better than many Chinese handguns sold in the market especially the scratch less coating which till now has sustained the day to day CC abuse of my daily routine. \r\n\r\n\r\n[b]Slide and Frame:[/b]\r\n\r\nTRUSHOT slide is made of forged steel and is solidly built with phosphate finish. The frame is made of Aircraft grade Aluminum Alloy. The slide and frame both seems to be solidly built. Slide to frame fitting of the gun is very good with some little loose tolerance which is usual and normal in all military grade handguns to enhance durability and reliability under adverse conditions. The firing mechanism of the gun is also crude in sense of reliability and the firing pin strikes are deep and well centered. The TRUSHOT has a safety switch which disengages the trigger mechanism form the hammer. There is no de-cocking lever in the handgun although it is a DA/SA handgun.\r\n\r\n[img][URL=http://s883.photobucket.com/user/p080003/media/DSC_0059_zpsf70cba1d.jpg.html][IMG]http://i883.photobucket.com/albums/ac39/p080003/DSC_0059_zpsf70cba1d.jpg[/IMG][/URL][/img]\r\n\r\n\r\n[img][URL=http://s883.photobucket.com/user/p080003/media/DSC_0058_zpsea29ffc9.jpg.html][IMG]http://i883.photobucket.com/albums/ac39/p080003/DSC_0058_zpsea29ffc9.jpg[/IMG][/URL][/img]\r\n\r\n\r\nBarrel:\r\nThe barrel is made of chrome molybdenum 4140 steel. The quality and rifling of the barrel is distinct and uniform. It has an enlarged feed ramp, much similar in design to SIG and NP22 models, facilitating the use of all type of FMJâs and JHPâs ammo.\r\n\r\n\r\n[img][URL=http://s883.photobucket.com/user/p080003/media/DSC_0060_zps8e6b9006.jpg.html][IMG]http://i883.photobucket.com/albums/ac39/p080003/DSC_0060_zps8e6b9006.jpg[/IMG][/URL][/img]\r\n\r\n\r\n[b]Trigger:[/b]\r\nFew of the things that I was not impressed at all starts with the trigger. The trigger pull is somewhat or should I say exuberantly heavy in DA mode and a very large play in SA mode. One literally has to wait for the trigger to engage the hammer because of the play and this at times ruins the shot and grouping at the target. Even NP22âs trigger is more crisp and tighter than TRUSHOTâs. In trigger department DSA need to bring improvement or at least modify my trigger to help me achieve better groups :-D\r\n\r\n[b]Recoil:[/b]\r\nOwing to the large and heavy size, the gun had a very low and controlled recoil and I had no problem in firing +P NATO and POF2Z rounds on my pistol as the recoil was manageable owing to the weight of the gun.\r\n\r\n[b]Sights:[/b]\r\n\r\nTRUSHOT has a three dot sights. Although it seems fine to me and the target acquisition is easy but for TRUSHOT to compete with other handguns in its league, it needs to improve sights. As far as my opinion is concerned I am OK with it.\r\n\r\n[b]Range review[/b]\r\n\r\nI was desperately waiting for testing this baby out on the range. As said earlier, a mix of ammo was loaded to check the reliability of the weapon along with the accuracy. At 10 meters i was scoring tight groups with along with few bulls. The shots at the lower left were before the alignment of sights. The pistol was hitting left below but after sight adjustment the gun was right on target. the small 8''s in the target were due to slight trigger play but after getting used to it the gun was hitting bulls. The gun is quite accurate considering the 4inch barrel.\r\n\r\n[img][URL=http://s883.photobucket.com/user/p080003/media/DSC_0046_zps900b42b9.jpg.html][IMG]http://i883.photobucket.com/albums/ac39/p080003/DSC_0046_zps900b42b9.jpg[/IMG][/URL][/img]\r\n\r\n[b]Reliability:[/b]\r\n\r\nOne thing that took me by surprise was the reliability. In the range session, I managed to fire 75 rounds in one sitting which was a mix of POF2Z, NATO WCC, Chinese Redbox and local custom made rounds. There wasnât a single FTE or FTF encountered which is a testament of TRUSHOTâs reliability. Even in quick draw and rapid firing session, the gun worked without a hiccup masha ALLAH. Further interesting fact was that I was able to hold the barrel immediately after the firing session with almost no sign of heating (held it with my bare hands!!!) This speaks of the metallurgy of the barrel and material used.(DSA try maintaining this standard and trust of the customer as it is a common dilemma with our manufacturers and industries that when the production model sales quadruples, they start compromising on qualityâ¦â¦ keep up the good work and make us proud of Quality Pakistani Products :-D)', ''),

Its significantly larger then the swiss thing-a-ma-jig, ( Dosent look that big, but it does show its silhouette/outline through my pants rather badly compared to the Sknife. Not good for discretion  unless you wear baggy pants and are a hipster. ( Now that i think about it, a  liberal hipster wouldn''t buy it after being offended about the sharp blade and how it could damage......Australian/Taiwanese red turtlekangaroofrog that happens to be endangered. )\n\nIts much, MUCH stronger and sturdier then the Sknife, but not through [B][U][I]"Amazing Metallurgy"[/I] [/U][/B]or [B][U][I]"Space Age Materials"[/I][/U][/B] ( Italics, underlining and emboldened for added effect and flair)\n\nNo. Its strength is through the use of bulky, heavy steel. Its just above twice the weight of the Sknife in my [B][I][U]esteemed estimate[/U][/I][/B] (once again, IUB for added drama and sex appeal)\n\nThe pliers are quite useful, but you can sense something has been sacrificed for the multi-functions in this contraption\nApply some force while the pliers are bent, and the handles will ever so slightly start to bend.They do not bend to any point of worry, or even to the point where i notice it through my head mounted optical analyzers, of which i have two. It can only be felt.If i had to give another...................................... [U][B][I]ESTEEMED ESTIMATE[/I][/B][/U] (IUB for added sex appeal to russian bikini models )\n\n\n\nI would say its only 1-2mm of bending at the ends of the handles. \n\n\nOnly other qualms with it are its design results in a shorter then desired blade,and the total length of all the other tools is less then the Sknife\nIts much like [SUB]this compared to the size of the Sknife[/SUB]\n\nand the blade locking/folding mechanism was designed by a conservative sadist.\nonce the tool is completely erected outwards, it refuses to go back down until you pull back the tab and simultaneously pull down on the tool. \n( ......Dont take that last line the wrong way.   :nono: )\nBeware of stubbed thumbs when trying to fold it back. \n\nWell, thats about it. Feel free to ask any other Qs, \n\n( No Qs about the price in pak though( over there its for 40-60 USD/GBP/Euro, my uncle brought it for me as a gift , and i havent seen one in pakistan so....maybe its not available here?)\nOh yes, almost forgot. It came with a 25 year lifetime warrenty.\n\nPics are as follows, probably not in order, at all, \nI put some other things alongside to help you guys to judge the physical size of it. \n\n\n\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]34169[/ATTACH][ATTACH=CONFIG]34170[/ATTACH][ATTACH=CONFIG]34171[/ATTACH][ATTACH=CONFIG]34172[/ATTACH][ATTACH=CONFIG]34173[/ATTACH][ATTACH=CONFIG]34174[/ATTACH][ATTACH=CONFIG]34175[/ATTACH][ATTACH=CONFIG]34176[/ATTACH][ATTACH=CONFIG]34177[/ATTACH][ATTACH=CONFIG]34178[/ATTACH]\n\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]34180[/ATTACH][ATTACH=CONFIG]34179[/ATTACH][ATTACH=CONFIG]34182[/ATTACH][ATTACH=CONFIG]34181[/ATTACH]', ''),

(I thought that he is exaggerating the situation)\r\n\r\n02: Yesterday i took off from office and reached DCO office at 7:15 am. Amazed to see that there were many people standing. At a counter a volunteer was preparing a list of people who were approaching there. I requested him to put my name there, I was at No 79. The volunteer preparing list claimed that he came here at 5:00 am.\r\n\r\n03: There was a capacity to serve 125 guys maximum in a day. At 8:00 am Nadra person came and start issuing tokens at 8:15 am. At 9:00 am it came to know that Nadra''s system is down and people inside office still waiting for the procedure to start. People start agitation on this and went to DCO office. After some time DCO came there and after some negotiation with Nadra incharge he announced that we are going to increase the No of centers for this process. Secondly DCO announced that he has requested Govt. to extend the last date.\r\n\r\n04: On initial List I was on No 79. My initial token No was 74. But when i went inside Nadra office My final token No was 83. (Nadra office by passing procedure and serving people with reference)\r\n\r\n05: Taking Picture, Data Verification was so quick but scanning of documents took some time. After that they issue me a receipt type letter with the validity of 90 days. Finally i got free at 1:15 pm after spending 6 hours there. :)\r\n\r\nP.S: Guys from Arm branch told me that in case of change of weapon: you will simply go to firearm dealer, sold your old weapon purchase new weapon and bring Sale and purchase receipt to DCO office. DCO office will issue a letter to Nadra and than new card will be formed by Nadra. Every time we have to pay card making fee to Nadra baji.', ''),

I keep the first round FMJ because cambering the bullet damages the rim of the bullet and after a number of chambers it is recommended to replace the bullet from carrying ammo atleast (same cartridge can be used at range). I can not afford replacing the hollow points so frequently so yes..my first round is a FMJ... next 5 are hollow point to deal with a Self defense situation...after 5 rounds the rest are again FMJ...why, well if you have to shoot over 5+1 rounds, then you are most likely to be in a terrorist tackling situation and not self defense...

They serve as pistols for home defence, self defence and as range pistols for those who have their technique right\n- do not get the Chinese TT if you do not have sufficient experience with handguns. They are extremely dangerous pistols with no safety features and no firing pin block. However they serve to be excellent choice for those who have good experience with weapons and understand the safety measures (they become part of their muscle memory)\n- do not get other variants of Chinese 9mm pistols such as Norinco NP34 or Np22. They are excellent pistols as well and very reliable, no doubt but they are difficult to conceal carry due to their size, bulkiness and weight. Also I personally feel that the CF98 and NP42 are much more accurate.\n- I do not recommend a Makarov as a first pistol because the rounds are difficult to find, much more expensive as compared to regular 9mm rounds, the Makarov rounds have slightly less stopping power as compared to the 9mm regular rounds. You have so many more options in regular 9mm rounds for self defence such as: SnB Hollow Points, Federal Hydro Shock, Speer Gold Dot, Critical Defence, Zombie Max (I strongly recommend you google for these rounds and learn a bit about them, they are very interesting). These are extremely powerful and effective rounds for self defense and you can only use them in 9x19mm pistols (which means you can not use them in Makarov which are chambered in 9 x 18mm)\n\nIf you are going to increase you budget above 50 then many more options are available but Np42 or CF98 basically offer you all that a good pistol is suppose to deliver. They might not be the best looking but are excellent value for price.', ''),

(636772, ' [QUOTE=Leon;473327]Let me try to explain:\n\nThis measurement is different for smooth bore and rifled bore weapons.\n\nFor smooth bore weapon such as shotgun, it is the fraction of 1 pound of Lead that will be used to make a round ball that will fit in barrel of your smooth bore weapon i.e. shotgun in this case. For simplicity, make a ball that will fit in barrel of your weapon, then weight it. If the weight of ball is 1/12 of a pound, your gun will be called 12 Gauge. If the weight of ball is 1/16 of a pound, it will be called 16 gauge.\n\nIn rifled bore, it is the inner diameter of barrel (obtained by measuring between 2 opposite lands of the barrel) or outer diameter of projectile in inches or in milimeters. 32 bore revolver means, its barrel has inner diameter of .32 inch. After 1950, they started using metric system to designate caliber like 7.62 mm which is .30 inch. That''s why you hear two different names of same caliber like 7.62 mm round is also known as .308. In this case .308 is inner diameter of barrel while 7.62mm is outer diameter of projectile. .22 LR is .22 inch. .32 or 32 bore is .32 inch. .38 or 38 bore is .38 inch.\n\nThis is what I have learned till now.[/QUOTE]\nthats grate bro......... thanks', ''),

At the moment the demand for this weapon is so high in the US,  the POF is rolling out to meet this.\nThis is a benchmark, an achievement by the POF as it is next to impossible to qualify the ATF  and compete in a free market. It is basically a military weapon and may lack the cosmetic make up, but the inner parts are of Un matched accuracy and finish. These are tested for hardness, heat treatment, accurately gauged and then test fired for accuracy and endurance. These go through destructive tests when 6000 rounds are fired at full auto in 30 shot magazines alternated with semiautomatic fire. At 6000 Rd  these are re tested for accuracy and wear of parts. It is an engineering marvel, of course made by Heckler and Koch / Rhine metal,  Pakistan wisely bought the plant and established factories to build the H&k family of weapons in 1960 s.\nTo day Pakistan is exporting Machine guns to Germany and MP5s to US, and DMRs to several other countries.\nThe guns are very sensitive to reputation, once bad ammo or a weapon misbehaves the stigma seems to last for ever.\nThe MP5 went through this due to some bad lots of ammo, this happens all over the world,  that situation has been corrected and the gun is now a delight to shoot.\nKeep your licenses ready these will be available at very attractive prices.[/QUOTE]\nSir,\nThe good news is out there and I have my licence  ready as well but the price is not as attractive as for US citizens.I want to know is there any way to buy extra mags and colapsible butt for it from POF ,because it is supplied with no extra mags.looking forward to your reply.', ''),

If you dont mind can you please describe in detail the work done on the metal parts? can it be done by anyone? if yes how to go about it? I would really appreciate the advice brother.[/QUOTE]\nYes dear, here are the details. \nFirst the metal parts are removed from the wood stock and upper hand-guard. Then they are scrubbed with Kerosene Oil to remove all dirt and gunk. \nLater they are dipped in Sulfuric Acid to remove the prior bluing/browning, if any, and then cleaned with water and detergent powder. \nNext, the metal parts are buffed with a surface grinder to remove the dents. Here it is imperative that the person who is grinding the surface should be attentive to the markings on the barrel, bolt, receiver and the magazine assembly. There are some very minute markings on the barrel rings as well which need to be preserved. \nAfter this, if needed, a sandblast to the metal parts would ensure that all rusty and gunky areas are cleaned thoroughly. \nThe last step would be bluing which is done in a tray or drum heated through a furnace. \n\nTo be honest, I wouldn''t recommend any of these steps to by tried at home or by a novice (I too didnt work on the metal parts myself). Because these steps involve handling of acid, highly heated furnace and sandblasting which requires proper equipment. However, you can always scrub the metal parts with Kerosene Oil to give it the preparatory look. \nI hope these details help. \n\nRegards', ''),

(636897, ' [QUOTE=Jibz;474590]  Yes dear, here are the details.  First the metal parts are removed from the wood stock and upper hand-guard. Then they are scrubbed with Kerosene Oil to remove all dirt and gunk.  Later they are dipped in Sulfuric Acid to remove the prior bluing/browning, if any, and then cleaned with water and detergent powder.  Next, the metal parts are buffed with a surface grinder to remove the dents. Here it is imperative that the person who is grinding the surface should be attentive to the markings on the barrel, bolt, receiver and the magazine assembly. There are some very minute markings on the barrel rings as well which need to be preserved.  After this, if needed, a sandblast to the metal parts would ensure that all rusty and gunky areas are cleaned thoroughly.  The last step would be bluing which is done in a tray or drum heated through a furnace.   To be honest, I wouldn''t recommend any of these steps to by tried at home or by a novice (I too didnt work on the metal parts myself). Because these steps involve handling of acid, highly heated furnace and sandblasting which requires proper equipment. However, you can always scrub the metal parts with Kerosene Oil to give it the preparatory look.  I hope these details help.

(637313, 'Restoring M1 Garand: The Warhorse Another quest which I am pursuing nowadays is to collect rifles from each of the armies which fought WWII. I already had a British BSA SMLE Enfield and a Russian Mosin Nagant so next in line were the American M1 Garand and German K98 Mauser. It is imperative to share here that M1 Garand is the first Semi Auto rifle which was used by an army as its primary combat rifle and few days back, M1 Garand made it to my list of collection. Honestly speaking itâs the cleanest piece I personally have ever come across. Its wood and metal parts are simply in the mint-est possible condition one could ask for.\n \n[URL="http://s24.photobucket.com/user/JibzPG/media/M1%20Garand/Jibz%20Garand%201_zpsie9npkeq.jpg.html"][IMG]http://i24.photobucket.com/albums/c15/JibzPG/M1%20Garand/Jibz%20Garand%201_zpsie9npkeq.jpg[/IMG][/URL]\n \n[URL="http://s24.photobucket.com/user/JibzPG/media/M1%20Garand/Jibz%20Garand%2016_zpsvomjjwls.jpg.html"][IMG]http://i24.photobucket.com/albums/c15/JibzPG/M1%20Garand/Jibz%20Garand%2016_zpsvomjjwls.jpg[/IMG][/URL]\n\nBut STILL it is not good enough for me and I had to work on it in-my-own-way.

(637319, ' I noticed that just like the Garand&#8217;s externals, the internals too were in immaculate working condition and I couldn&#8217;t find any signs of visible wear & tear on them. In a country like ours it would be a huge pain-in-neck to find these parts if something needed replacement. I had to refer to a website [URL]http://www.garandgear.com/[/URL] which in my opinion has hell lot of info regarding The Garand. There is a particular article there which gives you an idea how a specific part should look like. The article is quite helpful in identifying parts which are worn-out and may need replacement.\nI started working on the metal parts which had few scratches on the externals like the barrel/receiver, gas port, front sight, bolt assembly and the magazine/trigger assembly. I wanted to give these parts a smooth finish so they were first drenched in Sulphuric Acid to remove previous bluing/browning. They were then washed with clean water and detergent powder. After drying them out in sun, they were buffed with a surface grinder. This initial surface grinding diminishes the scratches and in some cases smooths out the dents as well. It is important to note here that while grinding, one should be careful enough not to overdo anything.

(637334, ' There are three parts of the Garandâs wooden furniture; a buttstock, front handguard and rear handguard. The front and rear swivel need to be removed from the buttstock. The front swivel has a screw underneath it, which when unscrewed removes the swivel from the stock while the rear swivel automatically comes out when the two screws of the buttplate are removed.\n\nThe wooden furniture of my rifle were in good enough condition with minor scratches and dents in some places. To work on the stock, I first removed the lacquer polish with a sandpaper. I used 220 grit paper as it easily strips off the polish without damaging the grains in any way. It is important to note that the movement of the sandpaper should be in the direction of the grains in the wood. (Details of the sanding session will be in the following posts).\n\n[B][U]IMPORTANT:[/U][/B] The front handguard has a spacer which is clamped on the wood and should not be removed unless the wood is damaged and needs replacement.

(637345, ' The sanding process for the wood, which I normally adopt, starts with using lower grit sandpapers like 220, 320 and 400 grit; and then I move towards using 600, 1000, 2000 and in the end 2500 grit sandpaper. I would always recommend that if you follow this pattern, there will be very few chances for a mishap (which you definitely would want to avoid as a mishap with wood stock is as problematic as like getting rust inside a non-chromed barrel). I sanded down the stock step by step with all the sandpapers mentioned above and in the same order i.e. starting with 220 grit and ending with 2500. Once the stock had been sanded down with 2500 grit paper, it got a smooth and shiny finish and for me the indicator of that finish is that light from a bulb can easily reflect from the surface of the wood stock.\n\n[URL="http://s24.photobucket.com/user/JibzPG/media/M1%20Garand/During/Day%201b_zpsqvz0uh5u.jpg.html"][IMG]http://i24.photobucket.com/albums/c15/JibzPG/M1%20Garand/During/Day%201b_zpsqvz0uh5u.jpg[/IMG][/URL]\n\n[URL="http://s24.photobucket.com/user/JibzPG/media/M1%20Garand/During/Day%201a_zpskzzd13xk.jpg.html"][IMG]http://i24.photobucket.com/albums/c15/JibzPG/M1%20Garand/During/Day%201a_zpskzzd13xk.jpg[/IMG][/URL]\n\nOnce this finish was achieved, I noticed the small dents and nicks on the buttstock and the two handguards. I used the wet cloth and ironing technique to take care of these dents. The process is quite simple in which I used a clothing iron to steam the dents out of the stock. First I applied some water on the areas where there were dents. Then I covered that area with a wet small rag of cloth (I used the normal cleaning cloth which has red lines on it and is used to clean the bores). With the iron, quite hot, I held it over the dented area and made small circular movements while pressing down firmly. I continued ironing the area until the wet cloth had dried up. (It must be kept in mind that while doing so, the surface of the wood should be checked from time to time to see if there is any unwarranted discoloration in which case the process should be stopped immediately). The idea behind this technique is that the wood starts to absorb the water and with heat it starts expanding back to where it was originally. (If needed, one can continue this process and repeat by adding more water until the dents rise up completely.)\nOnce the dents had risen up, I used sandpaper to go over those areas very lightly.

(637368, ' After the dents and nicks had been removed, the next step was to polish it. Like the Mosin Nagant on which I had worked few weeks back, for the Garand also I opted to polish it with Boiled Linseed Oil- BLO. It is important to mention here that BLO should only be applied once the dents and nicks have been removed because the steaming process does mess up the finish and requires sanding. \nI cleaned up the stock and the handguards with a clean rag so that there is no leftover from the sanding. The BLO was heated up, just enough to make it less viscous and then it was applied on the stock with fingers. It has been traditionally done with fingers and the reason is that it is applied in very little quantity and requires some level of friction to be absorbed by the wood. The proper application method is to rub the oil on the stock in the direction of the wood grains and in a way that the temperature of the wood increases with friction of the fingers. I applied a total of 4 coats; each one after 24 hours of the last one. The following pictorial will show how the stock turned out after application of each coat of BLO.\n\n[URL="http://s24.photobucket.com/user/JibzPG/media/M1%20Garand/During/Day%202a_zpsbv6r0dv1.jpg.html"][IMG]http://i24.photobucket.com/albums/c15/JibzPG/M1%20Garand/During/Day%202a_zpsbv6r0dv1.jpg[/IMG][/URL]\n[URL="http://s24.photobucket.com/user/JibzPG/media/M1%20Garand/During/Day%202b_zps0za7xhza.jpg.html"][IMG]http://i24.photobucket.com/albums/c15/JibzPG/M1%20Garand/During/Day%202b_zps0za7xhza.jpg[/IMG][/URL]\n\nAs stated earlier, the coat should be given almost 24 hours to dry. Some people opt to dry it in the sun but then the downside of doing so is that the stock becomes too dark at times. I believe that the color should reach the desired shade of dark with each application of BLO coat and should not be hurried by placing the stock in the sun. \n\nAfter the second coat the stock and the handguards took a darker shade and this was exactly what I wanted to achieve. The furniture was polished with a [I]Malmal Cloth [/I](Somebody help me with the English here). The trick here is to polish it not-too-vigorously, but enough to slightly raise the temperature of the wood and bring out the shine.\n\n[URL="http://s24.photobucket.com/user/JibzPG/media/M1%20Garand/During/Day%203b_zpswibtae1f.jpg.html"][IMG]http://i24.photobucket.com/albums/c15/JibzPG/M1%20Garand/During/Day%203b_zpswibtae1f.jpg[/IMG][/URL]\n[URL="http://s24.photobucket.com/user/JibzPG/media/M1%20Garand/During/Day%203a_zpscsdfemb3.jpg.html"][IMG]http://i24.photobucket.com/albums/c15/JibzPG/M1%20Garand/During/Day%203a_zpscsdfemb3.jpg[/IMG][/URL]\n\n\nWith its last coat, I could see the dark brown finish which I had been craving for. \nThe shine in stock has not been properly captured in these photographs but believe me, Its there. :)\n\n[URL="http://s24.photobucket.com/user/JibzPG/media/M1%20Garand/During/Day%204a_zpsy3z7ongb.jpg.html"][IMG]http://i24.photobucket.com/albums/c15/JibzPG/M1%20Garand/During/Day%204a_zpsy3z7ongb.jpg[/IMG][/URL]\n[URL="http://s24.photobucket.com/user/JibzPG/media/M1%20Garand/During/Day%204b_zpsomzd9h2y.jpg.html"][IMG]http://i24.photobucket.com/albums/c15/JibzPG/M1%20Garand/During/Day%204b_zpsomzd9h2y.jpg[/IMG][/URL]', ''),

(637399, ' I would also want to share an interesting incident here. While doing my homework to restore the Garand, I came across an article in which the concept of Garand Thumb had been mentioned. I really had a good laugh when I read that "For many it instills fear, others dread and for some just sore thumbs" :D :D.  \nThe saying goes that there are two types of M1 Garand shooters. Those that have received their M1 thumb and those that are going to. To explain this phenomenon a bit in detail, the M1 thumb is what the shooter ends up with when the bolt closes at high speed and smashes your thumb into the receiver. The high bolt speed makes this event equivalent to smashing your thumb with a hammer. It''s one of those events that you won''t forget. It''s almost impossible to get M1 thumb while loading the rifle. M1 thumb almost always occur when cleaning, or handling the weapon unloaded.\nWell, my story is a bit different. I made a wow to myself that I will take every possible precaution not to receive my Garand Thumb but I guess luck had something else installed for me. What happened was that when I was removing the front swivel from the stock (the nasty little screw is very tight), the flat-head screwdriver slipped and embedded it self deep in my left thumb. Hahahahaha. Blood was literally gushing and spurting out of the wound and despite the pain I had a long muffled laugh at my self and my newly acquired M1 Thumb. So in the end I did receive my Garand Thumb, not with the closing-bolt-of-the-Garand but with a screwdriver while disassembling-a-Garand. :D. I still wonder if it would count the same as an M1 Thumb.', ''),

A Garand-Thumb often occurs when you try to close the bolt on an empty  magazine. To close the bolt on an unloaded M1 Garand you need to push  down on the magazine follower before the bolt can close, and if your  finger doesn''t get out of the way in time it will be caught.\n\n[URL="http://postimg.org/image/adr905v4h/full/"][IMG]http://s8.postimg.org/vnevb0bf9/image.jpg[/IMG][/URL]\n\nOften people will get a Garand-Thumb because the bolt has not been  pulled fully to the rear. When the bolt is to the rear it is locked in  place by the bolt catch and won''t be released until you relieve the  pressure on it. However if you don''t manage to get the bolt all the way back it might  rest on the magazine follower instead of the bolt-catch, and it might  slam shut without warning.\n\n[URL="http://postimage.org/"][IMG]http://s8.postimg.org/5gdof1t5h/image.jpg[/IMG][/URL]\n\nThe best way to prevent a Garand-Thumb is to operate the gun with your  right hand, having the palm of your hand flat against the side of the  gun and the back of the hand resting against the charging handle, as  seen on the picture above. This will prevent the bolt from closing while your thumb is still in  it''s path.\n\n[IMG]http://i1052.photobucket.com/albums/s459/miananjum/Miscellaneous/1_zpsk0oho7wh.gif[/IMG]\n\nHere is a clip recorded at 1200 frames per second. As you can see, the bolt was resting on the follower and released as soon as it was touched with a thumb.\n\n[IMG]http://i1052.photobucket.com/albums/s459/miananjum/Miscellaneous/2_zpsxsmktkmr.gif[/IMG]\n\nDon''t try this at home (unless you are recording it).\n\n[IMG]http://i1052.photobucket.com/albums/s459/miananjum/Miscellaneous/3_zpssgppi7ni.gif[/IMG]\n\nHere is what the clip looks like in real time, to give you an idea of how suddenly the bolt can slam shut.', ''),

It is sub-machinegun. The weapon was not made for 5.56x45mm but for 7.62x39mm. So, you should not expect accuracy. Second issue would be of spares. You can have lot of options for CQA.

But for persons\n                with thinner faces and less wider chests get fine with neutral and well centered combs.\n\n                 Pitch is the REAR PAD''S or PLATE''S  angle in relation to RIGHT ANGLE of gun''s muzzle.

(637809, ' Oooh...so much to tell...so little time.\n\nLets get started. \nIn pakistan...ive got a list of 16 restaurants that i frequent.\n\nMainly in lahore. \n\nhoo boy.\n\nthe lack of dramatics here is drying the air.\n\nFlavours,Gujrat. On some sort of main road.\nGujrat being pretty much a redneck town; just ask around and you will find it. \n\nOne of the largest places to eat in gujrat; not very big at all by lahori standards; its about 15-20 marlay.\nStandard food, slightly bland, cheap-ish, nice rooftop view at night.\nnothing special. Go here for a quick meal if you just want a full belly.\n\nKhabe , Lahore ( shut down )\nThis used to be one of my fav places to go. mostly because it was near to our house. Literally the first restaurant i went to after i came back from the land of ice and snow at the impressionable age of 8. \nBack then....brilliant food, the atmosphere was like a farm/small town resturant, with the furnishings simplistic, made of mud, open air and cheap food. After having only tasted bland westernized crap for the earlier portions of my life, this place blew my socks off. \nThere was a point where i went here twice a week for about 3 months straight. \nIn 08 it changed ownership and the new guy quite literally, drove it into the ground. you can still see it if you keep going left while standing in front of the paradise plaza on walton road lahore. \n\n* A interesting story here, about the 5th month in after i came back we had a full on family diner; with everyone we were related to in the punjab with us. At that time i remember benazir going for president and all that. It was summer and the electrical outages were horrible. After a blackout ; my uncle went to the mens restroom( single squat toilet )  ( mind you; it was in the dark, they did not have a backup supply ) Since it was in the dark, he left the door partially open for fear that he accidentally....you know would not release his bowels on his own foot or something. So this other guy comes in; completely unaware my uncle was there, and proceeds to...in the complete dark...urinate on what he thought to be the toilet.\n\nNeedless to say we did not let him live it down for a long...long time. \n\n(Note that i consider y block and z block to be the same thing, and will refer to them collectively as y block. They are on the same road, both commercial areas, just on opposite sides)\nONWARDS!\nDominos..Y block,lahore.\nPopular, well known, tastes good; the pan pizza is brilliant. Nothing much to say here, you lot are all probably familiar with it already. \nJust try the marniara sauce and bread sticks ( ask them to go light on the oil) \nExpensive though. expect to pay 1200-1500 for a good meal for two. \n\npizza hut. Y block\nLike domino''s, but stupider. costs more, smaller pizzas.and more oil. LOTS more oil. not to say it tastes bad though.\n2k for 2. \n\nSarpinos pizza. New pizza place. DHA phase 5 lahore. ask for the huge huge mosque and LGS school and the flagship gourmet caterers store. behind it. \ninterior etc on same level as pizza hut and the others,slightly cheaper then domnios, convinent compared to going all the way to y block for pizza if you happen to live in the phase V area, downsides are only that the pizza sauce and the cheese are of somewhat weaker taste compared to the others. Not bad by any means..but it just neads that..little ''extra'' sauce is sweet compared to dominos and pizza huts bitter spicy ish sauce. \n\n\nOnto the burger plces. \n\nMcdonalds Y block DHA. MASSIVE for a restaurant, has its own play place; next to a amply sized park and my school/collage. Its also 24/7. \nThats it for the plusses. Food is bland, overpriced and completely not worth it. only come by if your kids wont shut up about the toys and the playplace, or you cant find anywhere else in your time frame ( 3am or sundays ) \n\nKFC, h block \na better alternative compared to donalds, taste is better but is of course very heavy on the oil. for those who cant handle too much oil but can do spice, not a good choice. 500 ish per person. \nparking is almost always available. \n\nfri chicks. Y block, opposite the street to mcdonalds. \nA wannabe mcdonalds. Food supplied is just as bland, small and still a rip off, just costs less money. Tell your kid that your taking him to mcdonalds and take him here. it will shut him up and cost you less; two rabbits with one stone. \n\nsubway; y block. \nNice, somewhat healthy, small place compared to to others and as always, customised subs are the best. \n.4 to .6k per p\n\nJalal sons.Y block. LITERALLY RIGHT NEXT TO DOMINOS.\nits like a gourmet+mini restaurant in one; seating on second floor ( or do you call it first floor in pakistan ) ( the floor above the ground floor ) \npizza? OIL OVERDOSE. I couldent even down it . cheese used was also that crap nurpur or something stuff, i could taste it in there. not proper pizza cheese. idk where they get the proper stuff from but this wasent it. Imagine a normal pizza, except the cheese is swapped with the crap cheese they use on gourmet to go pizzas. and dunked in oil. \nThey do have sandwitches on order though(about 200 each), a mini subway at 2/3 the price. i take them frequently, they are pretty good. The bakery stuff is also up to the mark. (breads of course. mithai and the others; try them yourself, i dont have a taste for them)\n\nhardees y block. \nWhere you should be going in stead of mcdonalds. better tasting, fries are better and the best part...UNLIMITED SODA REFILLS\n.4-.8 per p. Dont stack patties though, it costs way too much. \n\ncock and bull h block\nShwarmas are good, simple and cheap-ish. \nhavent tried anything else. \ncomparatively quick service.\n120-150 per shwarma.\n\n\nkarachi bbq H block. Same place as C and bull, across the street. \nNice cheap place, seating is crap the food is good. If you have the stomach, try out the double paratha roll. ( bit oily though)\nFor those of you who remember this was the exact place the gas cylinder went boom in H block a while back. It was everyhere on the smaller news channels. \n.2-.5 per p\n\nhot and spicy;right next to karachi bbq, same pros and cons, same price range but the especially good part is that the burgers they serve are very good while being cheap( 200 rs for one, something you would pay 400 for in hardees ) avoid the ones with the deep fried patties( i had a bad experience just recently, was starving;ordered two burgers, a jalapeno beef one, brilliant and cheap, but their special burger; the cordon blue ( deep fried chicken with a molten cheese filling tasted like crap. 2 years earlier when i last visited the cordon blue was a star...i couldent even eat it this time around) \n\nTandoor. same area as others\nsignifacntly more expensive then the others ( like 30 rs for a naan ) ; but overall good. has open air seating. \n.4-.7 per p\n\ncone heads-y block\nbrand new place/franchinse, and it is\nABSOLUTELY JUNK ( forgive me for the grammar) \ni paid 200 for just a fist sized cone of mcdonald type(hence crap) french fries. and that was supposed to be their special dish. \n\narizona grill y block- now renamed bar and grill- last time i went (a week ago ) couldent find it, looked like it either moved or shut down. \nbrilliant steak, awesome deserts and everything else. downsides are that its more expenisve, for a proper meal .8-1.2k per p. \n( ill post here if i find where it moved to,) \n\ngourment grill, in..well..everywhere. ( Y block, H block, anoher one near sarpinos)\noverall good family restuaunt, steak is nice,nothing much to say here. the toyota of the dining world. \n .4-.6 per p. \n\nyogen fruz y block. frozen yogurt place.\n.4-.7 k\nhas a nice seating arragement in basement that permits smoking. \nstay away from the more unusal flavours and youll be fine. \nMost notable is that the basement of this place and the bathrooms in the back are where the A level M/F couples like to get down on their frisky buisness away from the publics eye, and most importantly their parents. No kidding.More then one girl sat on a guy and played rodeo in the basement of this place. \n\nhaji fish. really well known fried fish place, on walton road lahore. to me it dident seem like anything speical, a bit too oily but it has quite the crowd every night. \n.4-.7k per p \n\nmedina,speciallises in dairy. waltion road.\nnot exactly a resturaunt but their milk, yogurt and bottled lassi is extremely popular , and i believe they also sell frozen kababs and the lot similar to K&Ns but much better tasting. \n\nhaji chanay.  Walton road. \nWoo boy, this guy had nothing before, and then he opened his chanay/chiikar cholay place and now in 2015 he pulls up in a merc. This place is outragiously popular, on hoildays the line streches..quite literally 30-50m long for the cholay( if they rabid mobs manage to make a line that is) \n\nthe last resturant...here it is. \nIts MASSIVE. Its in Gujrat, overlooking the ravi river...or some other one..my memory is slipping. \nits called Qinara\n\nas tall;approximately as PC in lahore. it mainly functions as a marrage hall;and a hotel , but it has a brilliant view of the river, has a mini theme park nearby.\nThe resturaunt is not exatly a main attraction but it is very nice. Go there less for the food and more for the views. \n\nabout .8k per p\n\nIn terms of what is in my list to try....\nin lahore there is chen hui ( huge upscale place , near the mercedes dealer) and a new steak place opened up in Y block, and is called...wait for it...\nwait for it...\n\ntooOp khana\nLiterally translated cannon cabin\n\nSomeone else post some more in here.', ''),

She cared little for  the other game the grown-ups were so obsessed with. Cricket bored her.  Her dolls were her world. Her instincts were right; cricket took her  life in the end.[/B]\n\n That fateful day, Pakistan won the match against Ireland. Misbah lost  her life to the aerial shots fired by over-zealous fans over Pakistan&#8217;s  win against Ireland.\n Misbah, a student of class II, lived in a small house at Nishter  Basti, near Old Sabzi Mandi, within the limits of PIB Colony police  station. &#8220;She was playing in the yard when suddenly she fell on the  floor bleeding,&#8221; said her father, Rasheed who is a labourer by  profession.\n The devastated father said a stray bullet killed his daughter.\n &#8220;There was intense firing in the area. Before I could take her inside the room, the bullet had been hit and killed her.&#8221;\n The family immediately took her into the Abbasi Shaheed Hospital but  she had breathed her last before they could reach the facility.  The  family staged a demonstration to protest the incident. Not many people  cared to join.\n The police were informed about the incident.

But I don''t own one so cannot comment by personal experience. However, dear brothers Fraz, Nazim Sb, Colt1911 and Aquarius are well informed in this regard and may guide you better.\n\nAs far as EZ9 is cocerned, it should be around 55k to 58K in Rawalpindi... Secondly, its barrel life, as informed to me by Zastava is 50000 Rounds, but on Internet some claim that CZ999 has a barrel life of 200000 rounds. But, its a solid pistol, I dont think some one in Pakistan will shoot 50000 rounds from his pistol. Barrel Life generally only depicts the manufacturer''s confidence in his product. Secondly, CZ999 is not available in the market and now only EZ9s are available.\n\nThirdly, I am not sure but I guess, you may be able to get a Turkish Pump Action Shotgun in 35K.

Does anybody know about the barrel life of EZ9 and CZ999.  Can I find a turkish shot gun in 35000 Rs price range? Sorry for so many questions. Your skilled advice and up to date information required.\n\nThankyou, and Regards.[/QUOTE]\n\n[QUOTE=1stranger;475647]About quality of Daudsons, well they are highly rated among local manufacturers. But I don''t own one so cannot comment by personal experience. However, dear brothers Fraz, Nazim Sb, Colt1911 and Aquarius are well informed in this regard and may guide you better.\n\nAs far as EZ9 is cocerned, it should be around 55k to 58K in Rawalpindi... Secondly, its barrel life, as informed to me by Zastava is 50000 Rounds, but on Internet some claim that CZ999 has a barrel life of 200000 rounds. But, its a solid pistol, I dont think some one in Pakistan will shoot 50000 rounds from his pistol. Barrel Life generally only depicts the manufacturer''s confidence in his product. Secondly, CZ999 is not available in the market and now only EZ9s are available.\n\nThirdly, I am not sure but I guess, you may be able to get a Turkish Pump Action Shotgun in 35K. (But not sure)\n\nRegards\n\nMay Allah SWT help you getting a best piece in very reasonable price. Aameen[/QUOTE]\n\nDear Tashfeen bro the DSA pump actions are by far the best among the local guns and a true value for money. As for their performance Nazim Sb shall be posting a video sometime in the near future. But i assure you that the gun is highly reliable. As for the turkish pump actions you may get the hatsan pump actions around the 35k (+ a few Ks) range. \n\nNo idea about the EZ9''s price or availability.\n\n1stranger bro thanks for taking my name among the learned lot :) though i am not learned in any way :P', ''),

(638079, ' Several years ago some schools in the USA started allowing teachers to carry guns.   The USA is a patchwork of jurisdictions much like Pakistan; most schools are run by the individual states or the fractional (county) governments.  In a great many places, the county school commissions control and fund the local schools.  Sometimes a large city will have its own independent school district.\n\nCarrying of firearms on school property by anyone not a police officer is prohibited in most places; a few states have begun allowing teachers to carry.  Though there has been talk of some kind of special training, most states seem to simply require the teachers to have a normal Concealed Handgun License or its local equivalent.\n\nMy state straddled the fence and decided to let the individual counties make their own decision.  (there are 75 counties in Arkansas...)  So far only one county that I know of has allowed teachers to carry.\n\nAs far as I''ve noticed from the news there has been only two "incidents" with an armed teacher.  It was a female teacher in Utah who managed to shoot herself in the leg in the ladies'' room.  Another was an Idaho professor who also managed to wound himself right in the classroom.\n\nDetails of both incidents were sketchy, but other than "playing with the gun", the most common type of accidental discharge seems to be someone who dropped the gun and tried to catch it before it hit the ground.  That''s why most trainers tell you to just let it fall and pick it up afterward... but grabbing for it is an automatic reflex it''s hard to suppress, particularly when the object falling can represent a substantial chunk of your wages... but that''s better than being held up to national news as a fool, maybe a trip to the emergency room, or losing your job.  I don''t know that''s what happened in either of the two incidents above, but it''s a good reason why you want a proper holster that retains your gun as you move about.\n\n\nAmerican law considers teachers and school authorities to operate "in loco parentis", that is, as legal representatives of the parents.  Plus they are agents of the State on State business; basically, that''s the same authority that gives the police their power.  Considering both of those, I wouldn''t oppose additional training for teachers to carry guns in the classroom; "force on force" and hostake-taking scenarios would be good ideas in my opinion.', ''),

Lacking moisture to a degree and has lost almost all of its original taste. \r\n\r\nAll the equivalent breads,lentils, fruits, vegs, and meats ( I dont even know how, but its true ) taste like this. Ive resorted to covering them in siracha sauce, eating them and feeling sorry for myself. The unique taste of every basic ingredient , is 1/2 to 1/4th of what we get here. \r\n\r\ni can grab their red and green peppers and start munching like its nobodies business there, but here i would not even DREAM of it. \r\nIf you cut out the superstore from the process, and grow your own or get it from a farmers market ( fancy name for sunday vegetable bazaar ) \r\nThe taste is only marginally better. \r\n\r\n\r\nFinally speaking, i believe this to be because of either 1.) the soil 2.) The repeated freezing/thawing and long wait times till the produce is brought to market. ( I have noticed even here that meat when frozen it loses much of its taste ) \r\n\r\nPerhaps some of the more floral members here ( floral? Are you guys plants? That would explain much. ) Like ED and sand would have better luck with this mystery.[/QUOTE]\r\n\r\nThere is no mystery here. U dont have tastebuds. Any one who mealy mouths Gourmet grill simply was born ''tasteless''. (Bad pun intended)', ''),

Flintlocks were prone to misfire in wet weather, and many flintlock  firearms were later converted to the more reliable percussion system.\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]34559[/ATTACH][ATTACH=CONFIG]34560[/ATTACH][ATTACH=CONFIG]34561[/ATTACH]\n\nThe percussion cap is a small cylinder of copper or brass with one closed end. Inside the closed end is a small amount of a shock sensitive explosive material such as fulminate of mercury.  The percussion cap is placed over a hollow metal nipple at the rear  end of the gun barrel. Pulling the trigger releases a hammer which  strikes the percussion cap and ignites the explosive primer. The flame  travels through the hollow nipple to ignite the main powder charge. (Courtesy Wikipedia)\n\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]34562[/ATTACH]', ''),

(638242, ' ha ha ha cant understand:mmph:[QUOTE=TRX;473782]The Code of Abibarshim\nan Internet classic \n\nRecently excavated clay tablets shed new light on the most famous engineering failure in antiquity. Although some of the words are conjectural, this translation contains a clear message for modern engineers. Do you know someone who might benefit from this voice from the past?\n\nBy Paul Pendragon (Translator) \n\nI, Abibarshim, Great King of Kings, Ruler of Kish, Babel, Agade, and Sankhar, and of the regions across the Hills, conqueror of Nineveh, destroyer of Sepharia, having striven mightily and met with grief, lay down this Code that ye may not also strive mightily and meet with grief, nor fall flat on thine ass. \n\nFor I, Abibarshim, King of Kings, and all that, did buy many Aethyopeans and hire many artisans and scribes and masons and Makers of Engines and Designers of Buildings. And great was their craft and great their number, which was one hundred and forty four thousand, give or take a few job-shoppers. Yea, they did strive mightily, too, for they knew what would happen if they strove not mightily. And the name of my capital improvement project was the Tower of Babel. \n\nYea, great was their craft and wonderful to behold what the Designers of Buildings wrought on papyrus. All who looked thereon did marvel at their genius. I, Abibarshim, did also look thereon and did declare their designs to have much nift. \n\nBut many days did pass, and many times did the moon wax and wane, and the tower was not yet builded. \n\nSo I, Abibarshim, King of Kings, did hie me to the palace by the Arakhtu where dwelt the Designers of Buildings and Makers of Engines. And there I found NOT Designers of Buildings and Makers of Engines, but Drinkers of Coffee and Tellers of Tales (whom mem call hurlers of bull dung). So I vented my royal spleen, which did perturb them mightily. \n\n"Look here, O King, etc.," saith the Chief of the Makers of Engines. "Some things can''t be rushed. If thou wantest us to get thy bloody tower builded on time, then thou hadst better givest us a little respect. For canst thou build thy tower without us?" \n\n      "But I have given thee this palace in which thy work may be done, and I pay thee many talents of gold and silver, plus all the usual fringes. What more wouldst thou have me do to get this project moving?" \n\n"Well, thou canst start with alabaster lamps for the draughtsmen," saith the Chief of the Makers of Engines, refilling his cup. "And maybe draughting instruments of silver and electrum..." \n\n      "Thou shalt have them. Just get my tower builded." \n\nAnd I, Abibarshim, King of Kings, did depart the palace of the Makers of Engines with my tail betwixt my legs. \n\nAnd many days did pass, and many times did the moon wax and wane, and the tower was still not yet builded. So I, Abibarshim, did corner the Chief Scribe and ask him, "What goeth on here?" \n\nThe Chief Scribe fell to his knees and said: \n\n"O Great and Merciful King, the Makers of Engines give us scrolls of material for to purchase. But, verily, no man knoweth what the scrolls signify, save the Makers of Engines themselves. For they call not a spade a spade, but call it here a delver and there a digger and another place an entrenching tool and yet another a geovolvometer, so that the scroll of material agreeth not with the design papyrus. And strange to behold is their numerology." \n\nSo I, Abibarshim, gave certain orders to try to keep the Makers of Engines from creating their own language, saying, "How did it come to pass that those who have such swiftness of mind, even as the gazelle, lack the sense of geese?" \n\nAnd many days did pass, and many times did the moon wax and wane, and the estimate did wax and never waned, and the tower was not yet builded. \n\nSo then I did ask the Chief Mason, "What giveth?" and he, throwing himself prostrate before me, spake thus: \n\n"O King, every day we toil from dawn until the dusk! Every week the Makers of Engines say they have wrought new and niftier designs, of which we knew not, and what we have builded hath been fashioned unto obsolete papyri. Then my team teareth down and starteth over, O Great King, Merciful King, King of Kings...." \n\nSo I, Abibarshim, gave certain orders that did fix those designs thenceforth. \n\nBut many days did pass, and the tower did rise slower than sap rolleth down the bark of a tree. \n\nSo I, Abibarshim, did seek out the Chief Aethyopean, who seemed to know where it''s at, and asked, "How come no tower?" \n\nAnd he did answer, \n\n"O Great and Merciful King, I run short of bolt tighteners." \n\n      "Well, buy some more!" \n\n"I have, O King, but each one either getteth used up or runneth off as soon as he learneth his trade." \n\n      "Which is?" \n\n"The Makers of Engines have designed the granite facing panels such that no man hath arms long nor thin enough to reach the bolts. Thus each panel requireth that a bolt tightener crawl behind and affix the bolts." \n\n      "So?" \n\n"So then he cannot get back out, O King, but is entombed there forever."\n\nI, Abibarshim, did then call for a redesign which cost us three months and one thousand gold talents. But the days did pass and the tower had attained only four tiers in height. So I did go to the Chief Scribe to inquire why. \n\n"O King, we have been awaiting, lo, these many months, the columns of Corinthian marble for the fifth tier." \n\n      "Is marble from Corinth so hard to find, then?" \n\n"Nay, Sire, but the Corinthian stone cutters make columns only in heights which be whole numbers of cubits. And the Makers of Engines have specified columns which be twelve cubits plus eleven-seventeenths part of a cubit. Such columns are not to be found in all of Corinth as an off-the-shelf item." \n\n      "Well, let''s just change the drawings and round them off to thirteen cubits even." \n\n"Nay, Sire, for they must match unto the interior columns, which are bought pre-cut from Ionia and which we have aplenty." \n\n      "Okay, we''ll cut the Ionian columns down and go unto twelve cubit columns all around." \n\n"Nay, for the Ionian columns be all of one piece with their capitals. To shorten them would mean cutting off their capitals." \n\n      "What in the name of Marduk is wrong with that? We can just fit new capitals on top of the shortened columns!" \n\n"Nay again, Sire. The entire structure unto the very top is designed around monobloc columns. To add new capitals would weaken the fifth and higher tiers and require a complete redesign!" \n\nI, Abibarshim, King of Kings, avouch that Makers of Engines, for all their craft, know not how to fly. For surely the Chief of the Makers of Engines and all his men would have flown down, had they known how, from the fourth level of my tower, from which parapet I, Abibarshim, King of Kings, had them flung. \n\nTherefore have I, Abibarshim, King of Kings, created this Code and ordered it displayed at the Coffee Machine and all other places where hangeth out the Designers of Buildings and Makers of Engines. \n\nTHE CODE OF ABIBARSHIM\n\nOnce thou decidest that name to call a thing, that shall be its name forever after, until eternity passeth. Nor shalt thou call any other thing by that name, for each thing shall have a name unto itself.\n\nAnd in like manner shall be the enumeration of each thing.\n\nContinue not to design a thing unto perfection, for, verily, an ounce of timeliness is more valuable than a pound of perfection. Once thou hast approved a design, go not back and improve it, unless of necessity most dire.\n\nCover not thy tracks but make thy calculations plain, that those who follow thee may trace any error to its beginning and thus set it and all its brethren upon the path of righteousness.\n\nAnd mock not the necessary papyrus work, for it is the handmaiden of what thou createst in stone and iron. Completest all thy papyri as thou goest and hoardest them not as a surprise for manufacturing.\n\nAttendest first to that which hath the most importance. Waste not time fixing thy wind to heavy papyrus with wire.\n\nHe who designeth without a plan is like he who rusheth forth into darkness without a torch. Rush not ere thou knowest whither, for there are many snares and pitfalls in the dark, and wild beasts to reach up and bite thine ass or camel on the path named Critical.\n\nSpecify not odd-ball sizes and kinds of things, but design unto standards, that the scribes may buy stuff off-the-shelf and dabble not with specials.\n\nDesignest not assemblies which require four arms to put together or operate. Verily, the guy we hire in these days hath not four arms but ten thumbs.\n\nRemember well that all which thou designest shall be a balance of time and cost and quality and function. If thou attendest not to all four, then miserable shall be thy lot and brief thy employment (unless thou knowest how to fly).[/QUOTE]', ''),

The first set of changes were made in the trigger assembly. All contact points of the trigger mechanism were polished. Next the adjustment screw was replaced with a slightly longer one... Finding a 2.5 mm diameter screw was a little diffcult but Alhumdulilla[/FONT][/COLOR][COLOR=#141823][FONT=Helvetica]h eventually managed to do so.. this longer screw allowed me to decrease the second stage of the trigger. Now this is a dangerous bit...sometimes the trigger becomes so light that as you load the airgun, the sear is released and the gun shoots... Sometimes the gun would not lock and load...at this point you need to loosen the screw a bit... Secondly I played around with the spring and piston....I polished the piston a bit, greased entire airgun. The guide rod in New shadows is polymer but the head is metal. I fixed a polymer head on top on the metal head which provided about 2.5mm of shimming in the spring...\nResults: The trigger is a lot smoother and my gun was previously shooting at 700 fps with H&N ftt pellets. Now it''s shooting at an average of 733 fps with some shots even touching 750 fps which makes it into a 17.5 fpe gun from a 12 fps gun...

(638487, 'BARREL LIFE OF px3. [QUOTE=Jibz;455013][B][U]EVERY DAY CARRY[/U][/B]\nWith my stature (in dimensional termsâ¦. :D ), even CZ97B is an everyday carry gun so I donât consider myself to be the right person to give his opinion on the matter, however, if one feels comfortable in carting around NP22 for everyday carry, PX-3 would also not be a turn off. I guess a simple belt holster should suffice for carrying PX-3. The full-sized grip might create some issues for certain holster choices. PX-3 offers more than reasonable capacity (considering its old aged competitors in similar calibre) and is still very much concealable.\nDear Jibz, brother do you know about barrel life of this gun? Kindly please find out if possible. NP22 has barrel life of 10,000 rounds. and we know barrel life of many weapons.

Yes, yes I am sure it must be a surprise to some but that is the fact which our dear commentators need to realize that you actually require a technical lab/facility to analyse metallurgy and canât actually be done while sitting in-front of a computer. I also donât have access to any such lab so would refrain from commenting on it. If at all I have to comment, I will do so with regard to PX-3âs built quality and that too in comparative terms. So here is how I can put it in simplest possible way; [I]âThe built quality of PX-3 seems similar to NP22 or HP77Bâ[/I]. I donât think anything else needs to be stated here anymore.\n \n[B][U]RANGE REPORT[/U][/B]\nFor many shooters, TT has always been considered exceptionally accurate and thus the same may be expected from PX-3 as well. At the range, since the only available ammo was Norinco, we could not run a selection of other popular ammunition through it like the Czech S&B or Serbian Prvi etc, well next time, inshAllah. \n \nAs one might expect that due to its 7.62x25 calibre PX-3 may have a hard recoil, in fact thatâs not the case and its recoil can be categorized in medium-recoil pistols (You will observe that in the videos). The full-sized grip certainly makes recoil manageable, though, and I found it to have more than acceptable accuracy for a carry gun. BTW, I really liked its full-sized grip.\n\nAs stated earlier, felt recoil was at an average level and seemingly due to its large grips the muzzle flip was very much in control. I personally, donât feel comfortable with TTâs grips as they tend to be too skinny (in weaponry termsâ¦. lol) for my taste. Iâve always found the grip on NP22 to be better contoured for my hands and PX-3 (despite being slightly larger) was no exception. Not only it fit well in my hand, I can confidently report that Aquarius and Colt1911 also felt comfortable with them. Shooting the PX-3 didnât disappoint me or the other esteemed members present at the range, rather we all were sufficiently impressed with the accuracy level that can be obtained with its 7.62x25 caliber round. [B]Having put about 180 test rounds through PX-3, we didnât experience a single malfunction.[/B]\n\n[URL="http://s1341.photobucket.com/user/Jibz77/media/PX-3 Test and Review/PX-3718_zps5c5f7141.jpg.html"][IMG]http://i1341.photobucket.com/albums/o744/Jibz77/PX-3 Test and Review/PX-3718_zps5c5f7141.jpg[/IMG][/URL]\n\n[URL="http://s1341.photobucket.com/user/Jibz77/media/PX-3 Test and Review/PX-3719_zps61aa04d9.jpg.html"][IMG]http://i1341.photobucket.com/albums/o744/Jibz77/PX-3 Test and Review/PX-3719_zps61aa04d9.jpg[/IMG][/URL]\n\n[URL="http://s1341.photobucket.com/user/Jibz77/media/PX-3 Test and Review/PX-3720_zpsf8ec142a.jpg.html"][IMG]http://i1341.photobucket.com/albums/o744/Jibz77/PX-3 Test and Review/PX-3720_zpsf8ec142a.jpg[/IMG][/URL]\n\n\nStay tuned.

(638564, ' Dear Sir (B-King)\n\nBy the Grace of Allah Almighty the DSA Trushot has performed excellently and competed in the top 5 with other well known brands like colt, cz, Grandpower and several others. It clearly surpassed performance in torture testing compared to Turkish brands as well in recent Pakistan Army 9mm Pistol induction trials.\n\nTo top that off the DSA Trushot offers best in class coatings such as DSA Scratchless on frame and barrel which no other company in the industry offers. If you know of any please enlighten us too! From our company''s executive representative at the Shotshow 2015 we learned that in USA people are paying anywhere between $200 to $350 to get additional custom coatings done on their firearms. The DSA Scratchless is not an ordinary coating and we have consistently done months of R&D on these coatings before implementing them on our products. So essentially you get an incredible and unique coating on every Trushot as a standard feature while being in a very competitive price range.\n\nLastly it is unfortunate that a competitive price cannot be appreciated by individuals like yourself when the product quality and performance exceeds others in a similar price range and DSA offers a two year warranty plus a lifetime parts availability guarantee in Pakistan. This fact should not be ignored or under appreciated. \n\nWe do accept that the Trushot grip needs improvement and we will work on newer grips as the product evolves in due course. We have continuously worked hard on making necessary improvements ever since the product was launched and this process will not stop.\n\nWe hope that you will support the local industry and use the products safely and share your valuable feedback and thoughts just as many other Pakistani citizens have already done. \n\nTake pride and participate in this National achievement and not just point fingers as an observing critic. Be a part of it so you can also be remembered as one of those who supported a world class firearm while it was still a fresh idea!\n\nplease view the review [url]http://www.pakguns.com/showthread.php?13788-DSA-TRUSHOT-Range-Review-amp-Report&highlight=trushot[/url]\n\nand several other in depth reviews on PG to get some reassurance and confidence.\n\nThank you,\n\nSincerely, \n\nDSA\n\n//visit us @ [url]https://www.facebook.com/daudsonspk[/url]  for recent pictures and developments.', ''),

Like the bullet when it leaves the mag does not go into the chamber properly or are you referring to a stovepipe jam?

The reason why pof ammo is not jamming is because it tends to be at higher pressures then the others, pushing the slide back completely anyway.

TRUSHOT appears to be robustly made gun with good performance. Being inflicted with the motto of â Be Pakistani, Buy Pakistaniâ mentality, I believe I was one of the few people who laid his hands on the first production model of the handgun keeping in view the quality and workmanship of previous products of DSA that I have used. It was a risk worth taking.\r\n\r\n\r\n[b]Basic Specs:[/b]\r\n\r\nModel: DSA Trushot\r\nManufacturer: Daudsons Armory\r\nCalibre: 9x19mm\r\nTotal Length: 190mm\r\nBarrel Length: 102mm\r\nWeight :900gms\r\nCapacity:\r\nSlide: Forged Steel\r\nFrame: Aircraft grade Aluminum Alloy\r\nSights: Three dot sight\r\nFrame Finish: DSA Scratch less coating\r\nSlide Finish: Phosphate Coated \r\n\r\n[img][URL=http://s883.photobucket.com/user/p080003/media/DSC_0047_zps1fde6675.jpg.html][IMG]http://i883.photobucket.com/albums/ac39/p080003/DSC_0047_zps1fde6675.jpg[/IMG][/URL][/img]\r\n\r\n\r\n[b]Packing:[/b]\r\nTRUSHOT comes in a plastic pistol case which includes the pistol and two magazines. There is no cleaning rod or user manual as available with any other known brand in the marker.  Packing is adequate at least better than most of Russian and Serbian brands that comes in card board box.\r\n\r\n\r\n[img][URL=http://s883.photobucket.com/user/p080003/media/DSC_0052_zps8d23273c.jpg.html][IMG]http://i883.photobucket.com/albums/ac39/p080003/DSC_0052_zps8d23273c.jpg[/IMG][/URL][/img]\r\n\r\n\r\n[b]Finishing & Looks:[/b]\r\n\r\nSeeing the TRUSHOT one would immediately think of SIG P226 platform design. Although there are many changes aesthetically but the inner design/operation and assembly/disassembly resembles the SIG platform. The gun looks solidly built with smooth edges and tooling marks. The outer finishing is good if not better than many Chinese handguns sold in the market especially the scratch less coating which till now has sustained the day to day CC abuse of my daily routine. \r\n\r\n\r\n[b]Slide and Frame:[/b]\r\n\r\nTRUSHOT slide is made of forged steel and is solidly built with phosphate finish. The frame is made of Aircraft grade Aluminum Alloy. The slide and frame both seems to be solidly built. Slide to frame fitting of the gun is very good with some little loose tolerance which is usual and normal in all military grade handguns to enhance durability and reliability under adverse conditions. The firing mechanism of the gun is also crude in sense of reliability and the firing pin strikes are deep and well centered. The TRUSHOT has a safety switch which disengages the trigger mechanism form the hammer. There is no de-cocking lever in the handgun although it is a DA/SA handgun.\r\n\r\n[img][URL=http://s883.photobucket.com/user/p080003/media/DSC_0059_zpsf70cba1d.jpg.html][IMG]http://i883.photobucket.com/albums/ac39/p080003/DSC_0059_zpsf70cba1d.jpg[/IMG][/URL][/img]\r\n\r\n\r\n[img][URL=http://s883.photobucket.com/user/p080003/media/DSC_0058_zpsea29ffc9.jpg.html][IMG]http://i883.photobucket.com/albums/ac39/p080003/DSC_0058_zpsea29ffc9.jpg[/IMG][/URL][/img]\r\n\r\n\r\nBarrel:\r\nThe barrel is made of chrome molybdenum 4140 steel. The quality and rifling of the barrel is distinct and uniform. It has an enlarged feed ramp, much similar in design to SIG and NP22 models, facilitating the use of all type of FMJâs and JHPâs ammo.\r\n\r\n\r\n[img][URL=http://s883.photobucket.com/user/p080003/media/DSC_0060_zps8e6b9006.jpg.html][IMG]http://i883.photobucket.com/albums/ac39/p080003/DSC_0060_zps8e6b9006.jpg[/IMG][/URL][/img]\r\n\r\n\r\n[b]Trigger:[/b]\r\nFew of the things that I was not impressed at all starts with the trigger. The trigger pull is somewhat or should I say exuberantly heavy in DA mode and a very large play in SA mode. One literally has to wait for the trigger to engage the hammer because of the play and this at times ruins the shot and grouping at the target. Even NP22âs trigger is more crisp and tighter than TRUSHOTâs. In trigger department DSA need to bring improvement or at least modify my trigger to help me achieve better groups :-D\r\n\r\n[b]Recoil:[/b]\r\nOwing to the large and heavy size, the gun had a very low and controlled recoil and I had no problem in firing +P NATO and POF2Z rounds on my pistol as the recoil was manageable owing to the weight of the gun.\r\n\r\n[b]Sights:[/b]\r\n\r\nTRUSHOT has a three dot sights. Although it seems fine to me and the target acquisition is easy but for TRUSHOT to compete with other handguns in its league, it needs to improve sights. As far as my opinion is concerned I am OK with it.\r\n\r\n[b]Range review[/b]\r\n\r\nI was desperately waiting for testing this baby out on the range. As said earlier, a mix of ammo was loaded to check the reliability of the weapon along with the accuracy. At 10 meters i was scoring tight groups with along with few bulls. The shots at the lower left were before the alignment of sights. The pistol was hitting left below but after sight adjustment the gun was right on target. the small 8''s in the target were due to slight trigger play but after getting used to it the gun was hitting bulls. The gun is quite accurate considering the 4inch barrel.\r\n\r\n[img][URL=http://s883.photobucket.com/user/p080003/media/DSC_0046_zps900b42b9.jpg.html][IMG]http://i883.photobucket.com/albums/ac39/p080003/DSC_0046_zps900b42b9.jpg[/IMG][/URL][/img]\r\n\r\n[b]Reliability:[/b]\r\n\r\nOne thing that took me by surprise was the reliability. In the range session, I managed to fire 75 rounds in one sitting which was a mix of POF2Z, NATO WCC, Chinese Redbox and local custom made rounds. There wasnât a single FTE or FTF encountered which is a testament of TRUSHOTâs reliability. Even in quick draw and rapid firing session, the gun worked without a hiccup masha ALLAH. Further interesting fact was that I was able to hold the barrel immediately after the firing session with almost no sign of heating (held it with my bare hands!!!) This speaks of the metallurgy of the barrel and material used.(DSA try maintaining this standard and trust of the customer as it is a common dilemma with our manufacturers and industries that when the production model sales quadruples, they start compromising on qualityâ¦â¦ keep up the good work and make us proud of Quality Pakistani Products :-D)[/QUOTE]', ''),

This fact should not be ignored or under appreciated. \n\nWe do accept that the Trushot grip needs improvement and we will work on newer grips as the product evolves in due course. We have continuously worked hard on making necessary improvements ever since the product was launched and this process will not stop.\n\nWe hope that you will support the local industry and use the products safely and share your valuable feedback and thoughts just as many other Pakistani citizens have already done. \n\nTake pride and participate in this National achievement and not just point fingers as an observing critic. Be a part of it so you can also be remembered as one of those who supported a world class firearm while it was still a fresh idea!\n\nplease view the review [URL]http://www.pakguns.com/showthread.php?13788-DSA-TRUSHOT-Range-Review-amp-Report&highlight=trushot[/URL]\n\nand several other in depth reviews on PG to get some reassurance and confidence.\n\nThank you,\n\nSincerely, \n\nDSA\n\n//visit us @ [URL]https://www.facebook.com/daudsonspk[/URL]  for recent pictures and developments.[/QUOTE]\nOne of the best best selling point is that you guys are offering after sale parts availability , customer service and custom option of your weapon according to one specification  which we don''t have it here .

For example you said earlier that the B6 polymer was not very much stable....[/QUOTE]\nGentlemen, i have been in Navy for 30 years and was a part of Navy SSG. If you allow me, i can add something for your kind assistance. I will be short, precise. those who can spend 65000/- or more just blindly go for CZ-999 or ZE-9 by zastava arms. Barrel life is more than 66000 rounds. and those seeking for a barrel life 25000 rounds but budget is 50,000 maximum, go for sarsilmaz B6 by POFWAH. Infact it is NOT assembled by POF, it has been imported from turkey and then assembled with POF hot stamped on the grip and polymer frame.\n\nTRY TO AVOID CHINESE GUNS, please.\n\nNow. when you choose a gun, always remember barrel length makes hell of a difference. The cz-999 has 4.25 inches barrel, stoeger has 3.6 inches, whereas sarsilmaz B6  has 4.6 inches.\n\nDO not get confused, I am stating you the prices of today 29 March 2015. The price of sarsilmaz B6 at POF WAH is 48000/- confirmed.\n\nPrice of ST9 is 57000/-\n\nBut in 55000 you MAY HAVE Norinco NP 44 .45 WITH 14 ROUND Mag. \n\nBut, in combat, different aspects are considered., therefore in close quarter of 40 meter combat, we prefer 9mm rounds. \n\nIn maximum 65000 Rs you can have a extremely good weapon. No need at all to think about beretta, or glock, etc etc. But, always remember, spend a little more but get the best ammo. THE BARREL LIFE DEPENDS ON AMMO USED, just like engine oil for the car and how regular you change engine oil along with the oil filter.\n\n48000 Rs is an excellent price for an imported turkish gun.\n\nChinese guns are just like Cherry qq car, so many features, but no reliability, therefore choice wisely. Never cut your budget from weapons..never, would you leave Dunhill and start smoking beeri, or K2? I have been reviewing more than 50 different makes and have been in contact with our former colleagues from army and army school of infantry quetta. \n\nPOF WAH is a genuine base to buy weapons....need not to get tricked and into debate with weapon dealers and tolerate there attitudes. Just go to POF WAH and get yourself gun.', ''),

We all got replaced guns back in the first recall and now they have sent out a new recall this last week saying the guns we got are not safe.  So call it a recall of the recalled that were replaced......anyone confused yet?:)\n\nMuch like last time one of the fellows on caracal forum called and asked alabama where caracalusa is located. ...if they have the replacements for this new recall and they do not.  Alabama said they don''t have much info from caracal.  So another waiting game.\n\nI wanted to let y''all who still own and shoot about this recall as i know companies react quickly in america due to the problematic lawyer industry we suffer from.  Not sure how long before it carries across the big pond to y''all.   They might not recall y''alls at all?  I only know what they are doing here in the usa.\n\nBe safe and i hope this is posted in the correct forum and is useful information for y''all.  My only goal is to keep my Brothers on here and around the world safe and informed.    \n\nIf i posted incorrectly...i apologize to the Moderators.\n\n[IMG]http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v74/jhileb/Mobile%20Uploads/20150330_180735_zpsinzoznw4.jpg[/IMG]\n\n[IMG]http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v74/jhileb/Mobile%20Uploads/20150330_180750_zpsbjkt4q69.jpg[/IMG]\n\n\n[IMG]http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v74/jhileb/Mobile%20Uploads/20150330_224905_zpsjjuqsnsd.jpg[/IMG]\n\nI apologize as my picture taking is poor.\n\nWhile it may seem the way the letter is written that i never returned my original recalled pistol. I did and the serial number they are recalling now is the replacement gun.  So basically they are adding all the replacements they sent out to the recall.

There is a reason why the POF is selling these by the name of pistol (without stock) with 15 round mag. \nIf the MOI notification is completely interpreted the CQA becomes a PB even in semi auto mode as its barrel is smaller than 18 inches and comes with 30 round mags.

The probability of .223 going to PB is high, as it has been declared PB in the past too. There is a certain purchase period on every licence, if the weapon is not purchased on it then it is kind of suspended and you have to take permission of the issuing authority for purchasing a weapon it (after expiry of the purchase period).

(638889, ' [QUOTE=jhb;476478]Sirs,\n\nHere across the ocean caracal has sent out letters to those of us who still own the recalled but already replaced model f.  We all got replaced guns back in the first recall and now they have sent out a new recall this last week saying the guns we got are not safe.  So call it a recall of the recalled that were replaced......anyone confused yet?:)\n\nMuch like last time one of the fellows on caracal forum called and asked alabama where caracalusa is located. ...if they have the replacements for this new recall and they do not.  Alabama said they don''t have much info from caracal.  So another waiting game.\n\nI wanted to let y''all who still own and shoot about this recall as i know companies react quickly in america due to the problematic lawyer industry we suffer from.  Not sure how long before it carries across the big pond to y''all.   They might not recall y''alls at all?  I only know what they are doing here in the usa.\n\nBe safe and i hope this is posted in the correct forum and is useful information for y''all.  My only goal is to keep my Brothers on here and around the world safe and informed.    \n\nIf i posted incorrectly...i apologize to the Moderators.\n\n\nI apologize as my picture taking is poor.\n\nWhile it may seem the way the letter is written that i never returned my original recalled pistol. I did and the serial number they are recalling now is the replacement gun.  So basically they are adding all the replacements they sent out to the recall.  Meaning even the safe replacements are now deemed unsafe.[/QUOTE]\n\nthanks alot for the heads up brother', ''),

(639098, 'Discussion on Supressors.; Discussion on Supressors.; I am creating a post regarding supressors/ silencers as a discussion. I do not intend to break any laws, or encourage anyone to break any either. \n\nFrom what I know, there is is no legal law peohibiting silencers. But everyone, including gunshop owners and law officials, keep claiming that "it is strictly prohibited". \n\nI would like your opinions on supressors, a\nlong with valid reasons with advantage and disadvantages.\n\nSo gentlemen, just for the sake of information, let me explain how these simple yet effective devices work. \n\nWe all know that there are three forms of noise which a firearm makes. \n1. Mechanical noise eg. Racking of the slide, dropping of the hammer, etc. \n2. Muzzle blast eg. When the firing pin hits the primer and an explosion is made by the gunpowder. \n3. Super-sonic crack. Anything which travels more than 1100 FPS (Feet per second), creates a sonic boom. \n\nSupressors only reduce the noise of the muzzle blast by slowing the propellant gasses and cooling them which reduces the sound of muzzle blast, but does not make the sonic-boom go away. That is achieved via subsonic ammunition eg. 147 grain 9mm, etc which travels below the speed of sound. \n\nThe supressor has a number of basic components. \n1. Outer tube. \n2. Baffle assembly. \n3. Nielson device/ recoil booster. \n\nThe outer tube is usually made out of alluminium because of it''s capacity to absorb large ammounts of heat and rapid cooling properties. It is also light, which adds minimum weight to the barrel when threaded, thus it does not lead to any FTE''s (Failure to Eject) or FTF''s (Failure to feed).\n\nthe concept on the baffle assembly is that it provides chambers for the expanding gasses to expand and cool, which reduces noise. The first baffle is made out of stainless steel because the first baffle will endure the muzzle blast, thus steel is durable. Stainless steel is preferred becsuse it is easier to clean and the first baffle is more prone to buildup of gunk! The rest of the baffles, are made out or alluminium because to save weight. \n\nThe nielson device serves one purpose and one purpose alone. It''s job is to maintain normal function of the firearm by reducing the chances of failures due to the added weight on the barrel by the supressor. It does this my momentarily disconnecting the supressor from the barrel and increases recoil (not felt recoil) so the fired round can be ejected and the next round may be chambered. \n\nI can explain this article in more detail, but i do not wish to do so because i know what I am talking about, and I have supressrd many rifles and handguns in the US with my cousin, where supressors are legally allowed if you pay the ATF the $200 tax stamp.', 'Discussion on Supressors.'),

Thier weight was around 6-7kgs and after the aluminium riser attachment ( which was not up to the standard as well) it might''ve increased even more. The limb material on the other hand was probably the worst thing for limbs ( stated by you as medium steel) they were heavy and the shots were inconsistent. And as it was expected . You werent able to use that thing. As for the stabilizer, I did work on it a lot. ( weight issues and stuff and wasn''t ale to make a good one considering the threads. And the hollow rod with a wooden piece attached at the end) the arrows were all bent( well. The delivery procedure is to be blamed for that ) but the fletchings and the finishing on the arrows was not good. I used acrylic spry paint on all the stuff back then, so the riser and the arrows+ stabilizer were all painted with that. I do understand how you might''ve felt and all the things that you dosay are true. But it was one of my first bows after I started making them. And you gave me quite an idea after your bad rewiew on the last thread,which was in November I reckon. I redesigned my bows, got imported limb material and started from basic hoyt designs. German stuff is known for its durability ( and the next bow did stand upto my expectations) it was lighter. 3lbs was its weight ( normal for a recurve bow- as you said in your last review tha they have 3lbs weight. Even though wood in lighter and i used a different material i still managed to make it close to the weight limit.) As for the video. I did make one, last month i suppose but it was of me shooting at a tree and i was just testing my  technique chages and stuff after my accident recovery. I can upload tha for now before making another one as i cant hold thr arrow for an extended period of time cuz of my shoulder. And its a recurve bow so it doesnt have any let-off , Mian-50 wuld know.

But just before payment I thought I should check the Air Rifle and believe me that thought saved my 28K.\n\nGun was flawless, even more beautiful and attractive as advertised but the main problem was that even with my best effort and technique as instructed by shop boy I was unable to cock it and even Mr. Nafees Malik himself tried but same results. He showed me 2-3 other close models as per my requirement ( 5.5mm @ 1000 fps ) but same outcome.\n\nMore powerful Air Rifle you want more effort than enjoyment is required to simply load it. Common thinking is that spend some good amount on a quality Air Rifle and then there is very less to spend in the form of ammo, maintenance and above all no license required. And all is true but everything comes at a price in this scenario it is your physical exercise. I am 34 young active 5 9 and a half, 70 Kg still I was feeling like I need a separate servant with me at range to cock the rifle every time.\n\nDont know about others but more than 10 shots fired by an aging gentleman with a co-morbid condition ( going 50 years and plus ) can give a Myocardial Infarction. That is its Lethal Dose of Hatsan Sniper 125 that is my estimation and I have no doubt or even a second thought about it.\n\nSo, with all the above drama in the shop I simply put money back in the wallet, said sorry to Mr.Nafees Malik for wasting his time and moved out. There are other options such as Baikal MP 61 with two clips of five and side lever easy cocking mechanism but can only give you about 380 fps with accuracy in doubt.\n\nAll what I said is just my personal experience and opinion others may totally disagree but before paying please do check the Air Rifle ( though in life it applies to everything you purchase ) whether you can have a real fun with it or at the end will say " what a waste of money and achy limbs".\n\nRegards[/QUOTE]\nmyocardial infarction!!!! is it this hard ?????', ''),

Here is the findings. \n\n\n\nWebley began experimenting with semi-automatic action in 1900 and in 1909 they began producing a series of semi-automatic pistols for civilian and police use. Their .32 Automatic Pistol was adopted by London''s Metropolitan Police in 1911. The same weapon in .38 calibre was used by the Royal Navy as a substitute standard weapon during World War II. The Ordnance Factory Board of India still manufactures .380 Revolver Mk IIz cartridges,[7] as well as a .32 caliber revolver (also known as IOF Mk1) with 2-inch (51 mm) barrel that is clearly based on the Webley Mk IV .38 service pistol.[8]\n\nIn 1924 Webley produced its first air pistol, the Mark I.[9]\n\nIn 1929 Webley introduced its Mark II air rifle. During World War II Webley air rifles were used for rifle training as well as civilian target shooting and hunting.[10]\n\nThe Mark II, known as the service air rifle because of its use by the UK military, used break-action with a superimposed barrel locked by bolt action. The detachable barrel was easily interchangeable with others of the three calibres available.[10]\n\nThe Mark II was discontinued in 1946 and replaced by the Mark III, in production until 1975. The Mark III was a top-loaded air rifle with a fixed barrel and used underlever cocking. It was only made in .177 and .22 calibres.[10]', ''),

IF a license is valid for kpk only, then how can they put a stamp of attock or pindi on it. either a lincence is provincial or for whole pakistan.[/QUOTE]\n\nEhsan Khan is right. All the licenses from Haripur (KPK) are made with that stamp allowing to carry the weapons in pindi/attock distt. the reason is while travelling from northern KPK to suthren KPK you must go through these two distts (pindi/attock). there is no alternative way to go peshawer for the people belongs to hazara without crossing these two distts. thats why almost all the license from Hazara it is always written.

(639516, ' I hold a certain negative bias towards certain animals...  at a young age a friends parrot left me with a scar on my right arm; completely unprovoked. I was just walking by and happened to stop next to its cage when it took a potshot at me. \n\nAfter that, ive been wary of all beaked-creatures. Same with dogs, my uncles pet dog jumped me the first time it saw me, and i was on my smartphone at the time.\n\nThe only animals i feel comfortable with now are cats. \n\nIm living in lahore at the moment. No amount of complaining to the authorities will get me anywhere. I might have to resort to talk to them about it. \nBut any ideas on getting rid of it without premeditated murder are welcome, But TBH when i squawks that is what i want to do to it. \n\n\nOnto the topic at hand, Typically, well, at least in pakistan CQB is within 120 meters, short enough for a pistol bullet to have useable ballistics. I know the defination of CQB is under 300 M, but really, in places like lahore, islamabad and karachi you will be hard pressed to find a open place wider then 100M or so within the urban areas. \neven the roads of DHA are a maximum of 15-20 meters wide, you wouldent even be able to get to a area where you could make use of the benefits of a rifle round\n\n\nI understand there are smgs, but the thing i am suggesting is that a 7.62 G3 cartridge case is resized to fit a 9mm or a .45 acp round ( imagine a +++++P Fmj 9m ). Doing so would result in heavy hitters, massive flesh damage and low costs. \n\nD3Ad, im not talking about a full on war scenario, im talking about much more low level stuff, like SSG and police missions in urban areas. A target takedown in these areas are typically within 50-70 meters. \n\nEssentially what you would be getting is something like a semi auto slug shotgun. but since its in 9mm or .45 acp a licence will be easier to get. \n\nThe real question that im asking is why dont we have a entirely new class of weapons? \nshaped like a assault rifle or a smg, \nfiring very heavy subsonic rounds, ( imagine something like a 300-500 grain .45 acp bullet with the same amount of gunpowder behind it as a .223 ) in a semi auto fashion\n\nsame ammo capacities as your typical rifles\n\nA heavy hitter against flesh, massive ammo capacity, and cheap on costs. \n\nFunctionally they will be a cross between a slug gun and a smg. \nIdeal for security uses, check points, and most urban offence operations. \nBasically the poor mans semi auto slug gun, just slightly toned down in power. and a ammo cap rivalling that of rifles or pistols.\n\n( Why is it everyone always just assumes im living in canada at the moment?

(639559, ' [QUOTE=D3AD!;477061]AoA everyone i am thinking of buying an airgun with a good scope, never have bought one, used a gammo shadow 1000 quite a few times, dont know much about these so i need your opinions, personally i am leaning towards Hatsan 125 sniper .22cal, due its power , accuracy and reasonable price.\nall i need is a powerfull, accurate and longlasting airgun.\ni have some concerns regarding Hatsan 125 sniper air rifle,\ninquired about it a bit and came to know that it is difficult to fix if gets some issue,\njog3ee and other Hatsan 125 owners kindly help me in this regard.\nthe scope which comes in box with hatsan any good ???\nin which modles it is availble ???\nwhich is best among these???\nmy location is lahore, buget around 35k max.[/QUOTE]\n\nThe hatsan tends to be a very...finicky gun, as do most others with poly stocks, not to mention its a heavy gun, hard to practice the artillary hold with. \nI would ask you to go for B9/B11 or a gs1250. They rival the hatsan in terms of power and accuracy, but are lighter owing to the nitro piston instead of the mechanical spring and are also significantly cheaper, a gs1250 is for about 11-12k. \n\nNowdays you will be hard pressed to find a brand spankin new harsan 125 with a scope etc all for under 35. the gun itself is for about 33-35 or so. add 2k for good scope mounts and you will need a minimum of 4k for a half decent scope. \n\ngo to anarkali and opposite the banks and the few surgical eqipment plaza there is a small shopping mall with many firearm shops also selling airguns. Go in, and ask for a B9/B11 ( It was callled something like that. B something ) Check out the build etc, ( its brilliant ) and if you like it pick up a gs1250 from the same company, ask around on this fourm for details on how to find one. learn with iron sights first, at least for a week or two, then mount the scope on it and zero it. Make sure to practice the artillary hold, the gs1250 being a nitro piston is less sensitive to beginners holding it incorrectly then the hatsan. \n\nNormally the combo scopes are useless POS, even a cheapo chinese scope can outperform it. \n\nIn terms of reliability etc, all break barrels are extremely reliable provided they are of a decent repute, and if its a nitro piston even more so. \n\nOtherwise back onto the hatsan, it comes in the mod 125 and sniper 125 flavours, mostly the same, only that the sniper has a buncho stupid useless tacti-cool addons.\n\nThe Dianas are also a good option, but realistically speaking if you are already shelling that kinda cash on a airgun, id tell you to ignore the diana 31 or 34, and instead add about 10k more and pick up a RWS 350 magnum. Really, after spending all that cash why not wait a little longer and get the absolute best?\nThe best available is typically weihrauch but you will have a hard time finding them. \n\nMy advice, if you want buy a airgun dont go for something middle of the road like the hatsan. Either get a 1250 or a B9/11 from SPA ( snowpeak airguns ) or save and pick up a 350 magnum. ( or as jod3ee as suggested a D34 if you dont want to pay for a expensive scope )', ''),

(639566, ' [QUOTE=czman;477278]I hold a certain negative bias towards certain animals...  at a young age a friends parrot left me with a scar on my right arm; completely unprovoked. I was just walking by and happened to stop next to its cage when it took a potshot at me. \r\n\r\nAfter that, ive been wary of all beaked-creatures. Same with dogs, my uncles pet dog jumped me the first time it saw me, and i was on my smartphone at the time.\r\n\r\nThe only animals i feel comfortable with now are cats. \r\n\r\nIm living in lahore at the moment. No amount of complaining to the authorities will get me anywhere. I might have to resort to talk to them about it. \r\nBut any ideas on getting rid of it without premeditated murder are welcome, But TBH when i squawks that is what i want to do to it. \r\n\r\n\r\nOnto the topic at hand, Typically, well, at least in pakistan CQB is within 120 meters, short enough for a pistol bullet to have useable ballistics. I know the defination of CQB is under 300 M, but really, in places like lahore, islamabad and karachi you will be hard pressed to find a open place wider then 100M or so within the urban areas. \r\neven the roads of DHA are a maximum of 15-20 meters wide, you wouldent even be able to get to a area where you could make use of the benefits of a rifle round\r\n\r\n\r\nI understand there are smgs, but the thing i am suggesting is that a 7.62 G3 cartridge case is resized to fit a 9mm or a .45 acp round ( imagine a +++++P Fmj 9m ). Doing so would result in heavy hitters, massive flesh damage and low costs. \r\n\r\nD3Ad, im not talking about a full on war scenario, im talking about much more low level stuff, like SSG and police missions in urban areas. A target takedown in these areas are typically within 50-70 meters. \r\n\r\nEssentially what you would be getting is something like a semi auto slug shotgun. but since its in 9mm or .45 acp a licence will be easier to get. \r\n\r\nThe real question that im asking is why dont we have a entirely new class of weapons? \r\nshaped like a assault rifle or a smg, \r\nfiring very heavy subsonic rounds, ( imagine something like a 300-500 grain .45 acp bullet with the same amount of gunpowder behind it as a .223 ) in a semi auto fashion\r\n\r\nsame ammo capacities as your typical rifles\r\n\r\nA heavy hitter against flesh, massive ammo capacity, and cheap on costs. \r\n\r\nFunctionally they will be a cross between a slug gun and a smg. \r\nIdeal for security uses, check points, and most urban offence operations. \r\nBasically the poor mans semi auto slug gun, just slightly toned down in power. and a ammo cap rivalling that of rifles or pistols.\r\n\r\n( Why is it everyone always just assumes im living in canada at the moment?

It used to give less jerk and recoil. \nOlympics/asian games are a separate class. Guns are different than what we use. Thats pure game with match guns. That''s not even live shooting.

Just a few things id like to add...\n\nTo be honest judging by fps ratings is a very very stupid thing to do. You can just use those useless PBA pellets and obtain supersonic speeds with every gun. \nLook around for ft-lbs ratings. the shadow is a 12, the gs1250 and 350 mag are roughly the same at 27-29 and the hatsan tops out at 32\n\nAny gun made by a reputable manufacturer is accurate, its up to you how to use it. the longest range is as youve said the hatsan, but honestly speaking with any sort of springer you will want to AVOID any hunting shots beyond 50m for humane reasons. Anything more, use a PCP. Air rifle hunting is based on headshots with land animals and body shots on birds. due to the nature of a springer, having to hold it with a artillery hold etc, longer shots are hard to pull off without a sling or a stand ( the stand that comes with the hatsan is crap ) \n\nANY SPRINGER that is high in power and range, will be a heavy, very heavy gun. And massive recoil. Dont kid yourself on this. \n\nthe 350 series is basically the same. for the most part. Get any one you like, but the most popular is the 350 mag. \n\nAnyway, if you want to be shooting any good, until you actually buy the 350 mag, you better visit the gym regularly. \n\n\nAnd in other news, ive been scavanging enough money now to buy a GS1250. \nCan anyone tell me who is the best supplier for one of them, and whats the current market rate?', ''),

You shall observe once I`''ll start sharing the groups I have got from this gun. I know a very very senior airgun shooter who moved from Gamo to X to Y to Z and then in the end his verdict was that Gamo Shadow is all that any airgunner (springer) should ever need. (anyhow, everybody has the right to disagree, that was his own personal opinion)[/FONT]\n[*][FONT=arial]Gamo Shadow is capable of delivering up to 16.3 foot pounds of Energy (approx. 690fps with Gamo Promag pellets) which make it a strong enough airgun for bird and small game hunting from ranges up to 50 meters (that''s the farthest that I have tried my Shadow, it might be capable of doing more)[/FONT]\n[*][FONT=arial]Even though this airgun might look very feeble but it''s not. The Gamo Shadow is quite durable and capable of taking much abuse[/FONT]\n[*][FONT=arial]One of the best features of this airgun is that it''s only 2.8 kgs, making it the lightest airgun available in the medium powered airguns Category (Even the Panther series of Dianna weights 3.3 kgs). This light weight makes this Airgun extremely practical and convenient in outdoor hunting[/FONT]\n[*][FONT=arial]The size of this airgun is just perfect, not too long or not too short to make it look like a toy (this basically means that a person of any size can handle this gun... tall, medium or short and also conviniet to carry around in car, in the long run such factors do matter)[/FONT]\n[*][FONT=arial]Another reason, love the way this gun looks...

They can not be assembling guns in China and write made in Spain on it. Even when a big company like Iphone make a phone in China, they write ''Made in China''\n\n- What you are trying to speak about is internals. Those who have been opening up Gamo Shadows will be very familiar with this. There are 3 different kind of internals coming for Gamo Shadow. The previous two are slightly better in terms of built. The latest model comes with alot of plastic parts and the spring quality has dropped.

I came to experience this last yr. that a broken child''s feeder nipple was given to a lawyer and the seller refused to return,well long story short he was fined 20K by the judge and after that the shop guy was licking lawyer''s boots and begging for mercy :)\nThe laws are there one has to know them to get the "ghee out"  :)\nNearly all weapon dealers have small or big quota depending on connections for PB weapons, that is where the real money is and especially if one is getting cheaper smuggled arms.\n\nI got very disappointed about Buksh Elahi as since long my father and uncles used to deal with them the owner used to treat them as Nawabs. About 14yrs. or so I visited them to buy some ammo for various bore rifles and some crates of #4 12 ga. (on my father''s and uncles'' licenses it is written "unlimited" and usually in hunting season we used to buy around 3000 #4 12 ga. cartridges usually from them on discounted rates. I was shocked at the rude behaviour of salesman when I started asking about any new model shotguns and tried a normal informative conversation with him as my last buy was a Franchi SPAS 12. I immediately told him to give the licenses back and I don''t even want to buy a pellet from him. looked like he woke up at the wrong side of bed :). I treat people the same way they treat me.\nAnyway we don''t hunt anymore at least won''t be playing role in the extinction of game birds.\nI still shoot but with cameras now :)', ''),

I went with my uncle to receive it after 6 months.He knew me for sure.I''m sure if the owner was there he would have never let me leave.They imported my uncle''s Mauser.458 and over the yrs. we have bought many guns and different ammo from them.\nNot boasting but our family has always kept very good top shelf stuff and only dealt with prime dealers of the day.\nThere''s been a gap of 16 yrs. since I stopped hunting and not "in" the field of firearms and hearing Turkish,Brazilian or Filipino names now :)\n\nRegarding salesmanship, I went to USA and Canada in 98'' and tried to visit as many gun shops I could ,in Nebraska alone (one of the redneck considered state) , I visited many gun shops the salesmen were very informative and even after knowing that I''m a foreigner and won''t buy a gun I was handed as many as I asked for (was just trying to get my hands on off limit guns) they all were more than happy to provide info and guidance on whatever they had.Nearly all of them had the testing or sample gun and you can shoot before you buy at some places.I shot Uzis ,desert eagle,M16s and many more which we could not get in Pak. or could only see in movies even shot a muzzle loader circa 1840s.\n\nHere, first they cannot afford a sample gun for every model and regarding our general culture of the buyer and seller they ought to get frustrated,I do not blame them entirely as have seen buyer''s behaviour too,with a new license they will straight away ask for Webley and will get out holding a Sikandar in their hands :)\n    \ncheers!', ''),

(639869, ' Salam All,\nD3AD Bro hope u''re well. I have been into guns a long time, but came to the airgun scene pretty late. And am glad that I did, its great practice with no hassle and legal issues involved. :)\n\nFew things you should know. FPS(feet per second) is a very relative term when talking abt airguns. Since the power plant stays the same, the FPS will vary if you vary the pellet weight and type. So a more apt rating for power is usually FPE(foot pounds of energy). Now say you have a 30 fpe gun, it will shoot lighter pellets very fast. Even though that might seem cool and all, the problem is that the .22 pellet performs the best if the velocity is kept in 800-900 fps range. So when using high power airguns, heavier pellets are used so that velocity is kept in check while the output FPE is high.\n\nSo FPE.....well the FPE of a gun depends on a number of factors. Two main ones are spring power and swept volume. Spring power is self explanatory, while swept volume is the volume of the compression chamber. That depends on the diameter of the piston seal and length of stroke. Noteworthy guns with high swept volume are the Weihrauch hw80, diana 350 and hatsan 125. Now these are all great guns, but are high maintenance(hw80 being the exception). See, the more FPE u''re guns produces, the more vibrations. Now these guns can really take a beating, but u''ll face things like screws going loose, and obviously face things like spring weakening and breakages. Also, guns that produce such high FPE, are in my opinion very hard to master and shoot accurately.\n\nI have a Diana 34 Premium, that I have shot a lot. At around 3600-3700 pellets, it broke its spring, but was still shooting. At around 4700-4800 it broke the spring completely. Now its out of commission, and even though there are replacement parts readily available, I am waiting for a cuzin of mine to bring a me a vortek kit from the states. I have taken 60 yard shots with it, and using the right pellet have taken down many crows. Almost all were instant kills. Further guide to D34 power \n\n[url]http://www.gatewaytoairguns.org/GTA/index.php?topic=2613.0[/url]\n\nIf you still want a magnum springer, I would suggest that you get a D52 or D48. I also own a D52, haven''t scoped it and TBH its a pain in the a** to carry around. Even the D34 when scoped, is a heavy gun but still manageable. Also, the D52 has high swept volume, but instead of increasing the stroke(like the D350 and the Hatsan 125) diana have increased the diameter of the piston. This makes it possible to get more FPE without having to increase spring power and stroke too much. And IMHO, the internals take less of a beating. It might not be as powerful as a 125, but its close enough to the 350. But keep in mind u''ll have to increase u''re budget. Also scoping magnum springers is also another issue to be kept in mind.\n\nPhew..... thats a long post, but bro jes buy a D34, u wont be sorry. Dont get greedy with the power thing. :D\n\nRegards.', ''),

(639985, ' [QUOTE=Kamranwali;477630]Salam All,\nD3AD Bro hope u''re well. I have been into guns a long time, but came to the airgun scene pretty late. And am glad that I did, its great practice with no hassle and legal issues involved. :)\n\nFew things you should know. FPS(feet per second) is a very relative term when talking abt airguns. Since the power plant stays the same, the FPS will vary if you vary the pellet weight and type. So a more apt rating for power is usually FPE(foot pounds of energy). Now say you have a 30 fpe gun, it will shoot lighter pellets very fast. Even though that might seem cool and all, the problem is that the .22 pellet performs the best if the velocity is kept in 800-900 fps range. So when using high power airguns, heavier pellets are used so that velocity is kept in check while the output FPE is high.\n\nSo FPE.....well the FPE of a gun depends on a number of factors. Two main ones are spring power and swept volume. Spring power is self explanatory, while swept volume is the volume of the compression chamber. That depends on the diameter of the piston seal and length of stroke. Noteworthy guns with high swept volume are the Weihrauch hw80, diana 350 and hatsan 125. Now these are all great guns, but are high maintenance(hw80 being the exception). See, the more FPE u''re guns produces, the more vibrations. Now these guns can really take a beating, but u''ll face things like screws going loose, and obviously face things like spring weakening and breakages. Also, guns that produce such high FPE, are in my opinion very hard to master and shoot accurately.\n\nI have a Diana 34 Premium, that I have shot a lot. At around 3600-3700 pellets, it broke its spring, but was still shooting. At around 4700-4800 it broke the spring completely. Now its out of commission, and even though there are replacement parts readily available, I am waiting for a cuzin of mine to bring a me a vortek kit from the states. I have taken 60 yard shots with it, and using the right pellet have taken down many crows. Almost all were instant kills. Further guide to D34 power \n\n[URL]http://www.gatewaytoairguns.org/GTA/index.php?topic=2613.0[/URL]\n\nIf you still want a magnum springer, I would suggest that you get a D52 or D48. I also own a D52, haven''t scoped it and TBH its a pain in the a** to carry around. Even the D34 when scoped, is a heavy gun but still manageable. Also, the D52 has high swept volume, but instead of increasing the stroke(like the D350 and the Hatsan 125) diana have increased the diameter of the piston. This makes it possible to get more FPE without having to increase spring power and stroke too much. And IMHO, the internals take less of a beating. It might not be as powerful as a 125, but its close enough to the 350. But keep in mind u''ll have to increase u''re budget. Also scoping magnum springers is also another issue to be kept in mind.\n\nPhew..... thats a long post, but bro jes buy a D34, u wont be sorry. Dont get greedy with the power thing. :D\n\nRegards.[/QUOTE]\nIll have to agree with you here, TBH more then 15 fpe is not needed unless you are shooting large game. \nUp in the UK, people pick off crows etc at 50 or so meters using 11.7 fpe springers. \n\nBack onto the gs1250, i hear it has a very...variable output, depending on how well build your particular model is. so ranging it in bw 17-22 fpe seems a okay ish range to judge the gun\n\nBut fpe ratings vary quite a bit, somebody says one thing, somebody else says etc etc. \n\nD3AD, kamranwali is guiding you in the right direction. If you can, pick up a D48 else go for the D34. make sure its light, and that extra cash you have, make sure to put a good 3-9x40 scope on it. \n\nAlso id like to inform you that if you choose to get a magnum springer, aside from having to purchase a very high quality scope ( and maybe having it broken anyway ) You will have to pay more attention to the scope mounts. The general consenus is that for a magnum you have to use a one piece mount, which in turn limits your selection of optics a bit. \n\nBut if all of a sudden you want to go the cheapo route, a big cat 1250 is not a bad option...', ''),

It was alarming to see the amount of people gathered at PECO road branch for arms license validation. Here is a brief detail of what I went through for submission:\r\n\r\n1- Make a copy of your license as a backup for good practice. Everyone applied individually or through a dealer so its best to have a personal copy of the manual booklet including DCO entry for the weapon you have.\r\n\r\n2- Make a payment of Rs1400 at any OMNI agent against your NIC (license holder) and mobile number.The agent may charge 20/30rs extra for his services and retain the slip.\r\n\r\n3- Reach the Nadra designated office (no executive centre in my knowledge is processing) early with your original booklet, Original NIC card and OMNI slip. Also make sure your NIC is the one with the fresh fingerprints in them i.e old NICs did not have the fingerprints available in the system for a friend whose NIC was nearly expired in April 2015.\r\n\r\n4- Get a token number (dont lose it) and wait till your turn is called out. \r\n\r\n5- Submit license and have data particulars entered.\r\n\r\n6- Fingerprints again for left thumb and photograph.\r\n\r\n7- Validation of data form and sign.\r\n\r\n8- Wait for delivery of letter in lieu of license which will have NADRA and DCO Office stamp. Validity is 3 months till approval whichever comes first and may be renewed if approval process takes longer.\r\n\r\n9- Give receiving for Letter (and retain the token receipt) on register and you are done.\r\n\r\n\r\nPlease not that standard limits of 25 bullets at any time and 100 purchase in a year still apply eventhough I have a DCO order for 200 bullets duly stamped with office diary number not dealer mode application. That can be increased again after validation but I was confused as to why they dont do it now.\r\n\r\nSecondly, if more ammunition is to be purchased how can one get that entered on the letter?', ''),

Thnx.[/QUOTE]\n\nForgot to mention a few things, you cannot go above #4 and cannot shoot steel shells with any choke otherwise mentioned by the manufacturer, you can only shoot #9,8,7 or 7 1/2, 6 and 4 lead only shots.\nThis is for hunting and chokes as per their assigned designation from IC to XF either expand the pellet pattern or keep it tight as in XF (extra full) the pellets will travel longer in a tight pattern to hit the target at longer distance or if you have F or XF mounted and #6 shots loaded and a Jackal comes nearby in shooting range you might be able to bring it down,as the whole group will enter with greater force but barrel length also plays a part e.g a 26" barrel vs a 34" barrel will expand pellets quickly and 34" barrel will take them tight much more further depending on load''s power.\nM4 is a military version with built in M choke or you can say no choke, there is choice of shooting any kind of shells especially larger ones with heavier loads and steel shots too.\nIn military they use buck shots and slugs with heavier loads that is why it''s problematic with 2 3/4" Shaheen''s lower power shots.\nYou can shoot Shaheen''s 4s heavy load.Rottweil SG etc. (bari topi)\n\nFor recoil ,if you are right handed ,use your left hand that is holding the gun like a shock absorber.\nPlace the gun lightly on your shoulder away from collar bone,do not press it hard otherwise you will get bruises ,now firmly hold the gun with left hand and slightly raise it to gun level,the recoil power will be diverted towards your left arm and the elbow will do a shock absorber work,hence very less power will go towards the right shoulder.I don''t know about others but I''ve been shooting like this all day for more than 25yrs.\n\nCheers!', ''),

(640530, 'Fixing Cross eye dominance Today I spent the whole day learning reading and figuring out cross eye dominance.\nFirst off let me tell you what it is, Cross eye dominance is when your strong eye does not pair with your strong arm.\nIn other words when your Right eye dose not go with your right hand and vice versa.\nThis can really let you down as it effects your aim, In pistols you can move your head on the right side in case if you are left eye dominant like me for your left eye to center the pistols sights. But same is not the case with rifles and shotguns.\nBefore I continue let me also tell you what most of you don''t know.\nSixty-five percent of people have a dominant eye that is the same as their dominant hand. That is, if they&#8217;re right handed, their dominant eye is their right eye (or left eye if they&#8217;re left-handed).Eighteen percent of people are like me, with their dominant eye different from their dominant hand, while 17 percent of people have no identifiable dominant eye.\nFor anyone to figure out their dominant eye all they have to do is form the triangle shown below center an object they can see clearly through the formed triangle and stretch your both hands in-front of you while keeping the image you choose in center, Now when both your arms are fully extended you have made a triangle shape and have the image in between the traingle slowly pull back your triangle while keeping the image centered if the image gets distorted or you you lose it start again while keeping it centered, slowly pull your hand back towards your face.Now either it will come on left right or middle.\nLets suppose you are right handed like most people and the triangle you formed falls on your left eye than you are left eye dominant if it falls in middle of your forehead your both eyes are dominant and if it falls on right you are right eye dominant.\nHope you have understood this by now.\nNow today I searched for a solution to this problem or you can say a gunners curse.\nI read on the internet that wearing an shooting glasses and covering your dominant lenses of the eye wear ( [B]IN case if you are right hand and left eye dominant[/B] would help your non dominant eye to come back in focus.\nBut this cannot always work. Sometimes the only solution is to change your strong hand, If you are right hand and left eye dominant you should learn to fire from left hand.\nWell I tried and shooting with the left hand would through me off balance or putt me off stance because of the recoil which my left hand could not handle and because the position did not come naturally to me, I decided to check this with my Airgun I managed to shoot where I was aiming when I shot from left hand but that was because of the non existent  recoil of the airgun and less weight.\nI tried to find myself an easy solution and after brain storming for hours I came up with this.\nI am right handed and Left eye dominant. When I shoulder my gun on my right shoulder which is my strong arm my aim is approximately 10-15inches further right which makes me miss my targets.\nI thought why not I aim ahead of the target so my aim falls back on the target.\nMakes sense?\nIt will when you see the picture.\n[I]The black line coming out from the shotguns barrel and hitting the skeet is my vision what I am getting from my non dominant eye which is my right eye, the actual aim is behind the target which is the red line.\nIn order for me to hit the target I should aim leftwards of the target, The green line shows you were I should aim so my aim falls back on the target.[/I]  Now all I have to do is calculate the distance and not over lead the target.\nBut this situation is when the target is going away from me or coming at me.\nWould I compensate more? ( double the lead ) for targets going leftwards?\nAnd Should I decrease the lead for targets going rightwards?\nI seemed to have solved some part of this mind excruciating curse.

(640551, 'SARSILMAZ KLINC 2000 (from the Cat to the Sword) Hello Guys,\n\nThis thread is dedicated to my journey from the Caracal F (the Cat) to the Sarsilmaz Klinc 2000 (the Sword). In this thread I will be reviewing the Turkish Klinc on various different factors from time to time. \n\nWell, lets start this by the discussion how I landed with a Kilinc 2000. I was a more than satisfied user of Caracal F despite its bycott and rejection by all senior Pakgunners. I had shot over 2500 rounds with the desert cat and had participated in precision shooting and tactical shooting drills with it over time. It was my EDC as well. I was very confident carrying the Caracal F with one in the pipe.\n\nAbout a month ago, Caracal issued yet another recall for both models F and C (in USA only ofcourse since that''s the only piece of land on this entire planet where valuable human beings are left). Rest we are all vegetables so our lives and safety don''t really matter. This was done by mailing letters to all Caracal owners. \n\nAnyhow a fellow Pakgunner posted about this letter and thats how I came to know about it. The link to the thread is\n\n[URL]http://www.pakguns.com/showthread.php?13852-caracalusa-recalling-replacements-from-first-recall[/URL]\n\n The manufacturers strictly instructed NOT TO SHOOT OR LOAD the weapon. So after that, despite how many shots I had fired through it and no matter how much I had trusted it, I had to change the weapon.\n\nAs a matter of principal I didn''t want to sell it to get resold in the market to someone else. I was kinda stuck...tough situation...even though my office colleagues were willing to offer me decent amounts for it, I couldn''t not have passed the disease to them.... in frustration, thought of writing some bitter words to the Cat Management. I did so, and wrote again and wrote again... they finally replied and I was supposed to be contacted by their distributor. That never happened, after weeks of coordination with them I realized that its worthless expecting anything out of the Caracal Management.\n\nI was just window shopping through the market past Saturday and that''s when I came across Klinc 2000, the Turkish version of CZ75, prepared by collaboration of Tangfolio (the Italians) and state owned weapon producers Sarsilmaz (the Turks). Many like to refer to the Kilinc as a Clone of CZ75, where as in reality its a cousin of the Tangfolio TZ75. The affair is pretty much the same as the Beretta/Cougar and Stoeger/Cougar. In USA Market, this gun is sold as Armalite Ar24 with slightly different finish, sights and grips.\n\nI was reviewing between a Canikk L120 and Kilinc 2000 and after about 30 minutes of very detailed analysis and comparing both to an actual CZ75B, I felt in love with the Turkish Tank (the Sword, Kilinc 2000). \n\nTrying my luck, I went to Tayabally, the official representatives of Caracal in Pakistan and asked them how much they would buy my Caracal F for. They offered me a decent price so I sold my gun right there... the legalities took all the time till yesterday when I finally got my hands on my NIB Kilinc 2000.\n\nWhy did I sell my gun to Tayabally? well because they are supposed to sell back the gun to Caracal F and they get their refunds from them (full price as far as the rumors go)\n\nAnyhow, that''s the start of this thread, next I''ll be sharing a bit about the technical specifications of the beast.\n\n[url=http://postimg.org/image/jk445slqt/][img]http://s26.postimg.org/jk445slqt/IMAG1027.jpg[/img][/url]\n\n[url=http://postimg.org/image/dn08oz4lx/][img]http://s26.postimg.org/dn08oz4lx/IMAG1030.jpg[/img][/url]', ''),

If you know about scopes kindly guide me.[/QUOTE]\n\n\nHonestly, just get the mid level diana and a bushnell 3-9x40 scope. it will serve you well,and the scope mounts that come along with it are perfectly fine. \n\nAfter you actually get used to your gun, you will not need or want a nasty recoiler or some other high power beast, unless it is a PCP. \n\nSince you havent gotten into this properly yet, you dont have a proper "feel" of the sport yet. Dont bother with a really fancy-ass scope, or a ultra powerful or expensive gun, buy that mid level diana with a 3-9x40 bushnell scope, and it will serve you well. If after 2 years or so you STILL feel the need too get a magnum springer, get a scope designed for it alongisde. A magnum scope will be unnessacarily heavy and expensive for your first one, and if you end up breaking it by dropping the rifle or having it fall over on its own, it will be a sad sad day. \n\nMy advice. Ignore the future for now. focus on the present. Buy the mid level rifle, put any decent quality 3-9x40 scope on it, and enjoy yourself. If you really want to go for a magnum after you have reached the limit with your current rifle, then go for a PCP. Magnums are a hassle. Heavy, hold sensitive, expensive, springs like snapping and the stock smacks you in the face, and sometimes they even manage to break the scopes meant for magnum rifles.', ''),

(640599, '10 common concealed cary mistakes (cc) [ATTACH=CONFIG]34837[/ATTACH]\n[h=2]1. Having the minimum required training[/h][COLOR=#444444][FONT=Arial]In many states, a hunter safety course is enough to qualify you for a concealed weapons license. However, these courses often focus solely on being safe with a rifle in the woods. Although itâs great to know youâre not allowed to shoot over a road the next time you go hunting, it doesnât exactly prepare you to go out into the regular world and interact with others now that you all of a sudden have a gun on your hip\n[/FONT][/COLOR][COLOR=#444444][FONT=Arial]Even some classes that are specifically designed around qualifying you for a concealed weapons permit donât do much in the way of preparing you. Do your research before choosing a class and find a reputable one that is more concerned with proper training rather than getting you out of the course as quickly as possible. The course concerned most about money will often go through some of the basics, have you shoot a few rounds, and send you on your way. You want a course that has instructors who are going to help you in every way possible to make sure you leave their class prepared.\n[/FONT][/COLOR][COLOR=#444444][FONT=Arial]Finally, donât think that just because you met the minimum requirements for a license youâre now ready to navigate every situation you find yourself in. A responsible person who carries concealed is constantly learning, both mentally and physically. As legendary football coach Bo Schembechler often said, âEvery day youâre getting better or worseâ¦you never stay the sameâ\n[/FONT][/COLOR][h=2]2. Printing/Exposing[/h][COLOR=#444444][FONT=Arial]\n[/FONT][/COLOR][COLOR=#444444][FONT=Arial]Printing, where the outline of your gun appears from pushing against your clothing and exposing a part of the gun are mistakes that often arise from complacency. When you first start carrying, often youâre so concerned about your gun showing in public youâll do anything and everything to make sure it never happens. After carrying every day for years, itâs still a thought but youâre nowhere near as scared of it happening. Just take that extra second to make sure youâre not printing or going to expose your gun at some point.\n[/FONT][/COLOR][COLOR=#444444][FONT=Arial]Honestly, most people are pretty ignorant to their surroundings anyways, but it certainly isnât worth the trouble of someone freaking out if they do notice because you didnât want to bother changing your 2 sizes too small shirt. Although some people are extremely concerned about printing, itâs not the end of the world if it happens at some point (although it may be illegal in some localities). Itâs certainly not something to get into the habit of doing, but compared to exposing your gun, printing is nowhere near as big a concern. If your gun is exposed, you could find yourself in some serious hot water. The last thing you want to deal with is half the police station closing in on you with guns drawn because you bent over to pick something up and the lady behind you happened to notice your gun.\n\n[/FONT][/COLOR][COLOR=#444444][FONT=Arial]Trust me, if someone sees your gun and theyâre scared, the 911 call wonât be a rational explanation of what happened. Take your time to make sure youâre not printing or in danger of exposing your gun before you leave the house.\n\n[/FONT][/COLOR][h=2]3. Using a cheap holster[/h][COLOR=#333333][FONT=Georgia]This mistake is made not from purchasing an inexpensive holster, but a poorly made one. That nylon holster you got on special for $2.99 probably isnât going to become your go to holster. There are some [/FONT][/COLOR][URL="http://aliengearholsters.com/?=concealed"]great holsters[/URL][COLOR=#333333][FONT=Georgia]that arenât overly expensive and some pretty awful holsters that are way too expensive. Whatever material you prefer for your holster, it needs to be able to retain your gun properly and be comfortable enough to wear day in and day out.\n\n[/FONT][/COLOR][COLOR=#444444][FONT=Arial]Thereâs a reason those who have been carrying for years have a drawer full of holsters in their house, the holsters didnât perform the way they needed to. Donât be afraid to experiment with several different holsters to find the one fits your lifestyle and your body properly. The benefits of a quality holster far outweigh the true cost of buying a holster solely based on price.\n\n[/FONT][/COLOR][h=2]4. Wearing improper clothing[/h][COLOR=#444444][FONT=Arial]There are two different aspects to this mistake. The first goes back to the mistake of allowing your gun to print or become exposed. Just because you carry a gun doesnât mean youâre doomed to a life of Hawaiian shirts and baggy pants. You can still have a sense of personal style while carrying, you just need to be sure that the clothes youâre wearing accommodate the gun you carry. With a little bit of experimentation you should be able to find the best way to do this that fits your own personal style.\n[/FONT][/COLOR][COLOR=#444444][FONT=Arial]The second aspect of this mistake comes with wearing tacti-cool clothing. Walking around in head to toe BLACKHAWK and 5.11 Tactical clothing just screams gun. The idea is to conceal the fact you have a gun on you, not announce it to the world.\n\n[/FONT][/COLOR][COLOR=#444444][FONT=Arial]Fun little fact: dark-colored shirts will conceal your firearm better than light-colored shirts.\n\n[/FONT][/COLOR][h=2]5. Fingering/Checking the gun[/h][COLOR=#333333][FONT=Georgia]This is a bad habit often seen by those just starting to carry concealed. As they go about their routine, theyâll casually reach back and touch the gun with their fingers or sometimes blatantly just check to see if itâs still there. Donât worry, if youâve gotten a proper holster itâs still there. If you catch yourself doing this when you carry, suppress the urges and leave it alone! All youâre doing is giving people another chance to see that you have a gun on you. With a bit of experience and self control this urge will go away.\n\n[/FONT][/COLOR][h=2]6. Not practicing with SD ammo[/h][COLOR=#444444][FONT=Arial]A self defense situation is not the time to find out that your gun doesnât like to feed your chosen self defense ammo. Take the time to practice with several different brands of SD ammo and find the one that your gun likes best. Yes, itâs more expensive than strictly shooting white box Winchester, but the extra expense is worth knowing that if the time comes to defend yourself or your family, youâre actually going to be able to do so\n[/FONT][/COLOR][h=2]7. Adjusting in public[/h][COLOR=#444444][FONT=Arial]Unlike checking to see if the gun is still there, this mistake comes when the holster has slid to an uncomfortable position or something has happened that you now need to re-adjust your holster. Doing this in public is a very bad idea. The movement of re-adjusting will draw quite a bit of attention to yourself, much more so than just touching the gun. If you do need to make an adjustment and youâre in a public area, the best places to do so are in a locked bathroom stall, your car, or a dressing room without security cameras. Just find a private place where youâre able to fix whatever needs to be fixed without worrying about someone figuring out what youâre doing.\n\n[/FONT][/COLOR][h=2]8. Carrying on occasion[/h][COLOR=#444444][FONT=Arial]If youâre going to carry, do your best to [/FONT][/COLOR][URL="http://concealednation.org/2014/05/i-dont-carry-when-i-dont-feel-the-need-is-a-bad-state-of-mind-to-be-in/"]carry all the time[/URL][COLOR=#444444][FONT=Arial]. You wear your seat belt every time you drive (at least I hope you do) but you likely wonât end up in a car accident. The same concept applies to carrying your gun. You never know when youâll find yourself in a situation where you need it, whether youâre away from home the whole day or just making a quick run to the gas station. Incidents happen when you least expect them, it pays to always be prepared.\n\n[/FONT][/COLOR][h=2]9. Not understanding firearm laws[/h][COLOR=#333333][FONT=Georgia]Itâs your responsibility when you decide to carry to know all the laws that can effect you, whether local, state, or federal. Every state and area is different. Find out what the exact law says for every area you find yourself in. Know whether youâre in a stand your ground or a duty to retreat state. Know where youâre allowed to carry and where youâre not. These laws are typically very easy to find with a quick Google search so you have absolutely no excuse not to know.\n\n[/FONT][/COLOR][COLOR=#444444][FONT=Arial]Luckily, the vast majority of people who carry are extremely responsible and have studied the laws so much they could pass as a lawyer. If youâre not one of these people and havenât taken the time to know the ins and outs of firearm laws in your area, take the time to do so now.\n\n[/FONT][/COLOR][h=2]10. Having the wrong mindset[/h]\n[COLOR=#444444][FONT=Arial]As I previously mentioned, most people who carry concealed are extremely responsible and have the [URL="http://concealednation.org/2013/12/concealed-carry-your-draw-muscle-memory-mindset/"]mindset[/URL] that theyâll do everything in their power to avoid a conflict, but if violence comes their way, theyâre prepared to do what it takes to protect themselves and their family. This is a great mindset to have. A big mistake that some less responsible people make is having an invincible or escalation mindset. These people will go out of their way to go down that sketchy alleyway or will intentionally escalate a fight. Just because you carry a gun it doesnât mean itâs time to start looking for trouble or trying to start a fight. In fact, it means the exact opposite. By carrying a gun, you must do everything in your power to avoid trouble.[/FONT][/COLOR]\n[COLOR=#444444][FONT=Arial]Go out there every day as a respectful and responsible person just going about your daily business and you likely will never have to use your gun in a self-defense scenario. Should the absolute worst happen, you and the police will know you had no hand in bringing the situation upon yourself. Donât leave any room for doubt.[/FONT][/COLOR]', ''),

(640665, ' Finally, this is it...what everyone here has been waiting for... range report for Kilinc 2000, the Turkish sword...\n\nI had no plans of going to the range today but late evening yesterday, a cherry popping range session was scheduled for today morning. \n\nThe session was a well planned one\n- 20 x shots of China red box in 4 strings of 5 shots each at 25 meters\n- 20 x shots of POF 1z in 4 strings of 5 shots each at 25 meters\n- Some tactical shooting using S&B JHP 115 grain\n\nAs usual, the plan was made to reach the range early morning but we made it when the heat was at it max and the scorching sun was blazing on our heads. The time was around 12:30 pm and condition extremely windy...\n\n[B]- 20 x shots of China red box (311) in 4 strings of 5 shots each at 25 meters\n\n[/B]Below is the group that I got from China Red Box (311). Tell you what guys, I was just shocked to see the accuracy of this gun. I regular score from 25 meters is between 125 to 140 out of 200. No hiccups faced during these 20 shots. All 3 magazines were used and they performed flawlessly.\n\n[url=http://postimg.org/image/okb7oln2t/][img]http://s26.postimg.org/okb7oln2t/IMAG1071.jpg[/img][/url]\n\n[url=http://postimg.org/image/660okmas5/][img]http://s26.postimg.org/660okmas5/IMAG1072.jpg[/img][/url]\n\nAll shots were within the black circle except one... It was a flier due to the harsh winds  else all would have easily been inside the black circle. The score was 158 / 200 which is the highest I have scored till this point from 25 meters. I have shot many many handguns and I think this just might be the most accurate gun I must have ever shot. The trigger is extremely nice and considering that this is an NIB weapon, the trigger is supposed to get much much better after about 300 shots (as mentioned in other international forum reviews).\n\n\n[B]- 20 x shots of POF 1z in 4 strings of 5 shots each at 25 meters\n\n[/B]By now I was getting the hang of this beautiful Turkish sword and I started to understand it a bit better. The results were as evident in the pictures below:\n\n[url=http://postimg.org/image/rnbxrz21h/][img]http://s26.postimg.org/rnbxrz21h/IMAG1077.jpg[/img][/url]\n\n[url=http://postimg.org/image/en58snlsl/][img]http://s26.postimg.org/en58snlsl/IMAG1078.jpg[/img][/url]\n\nI just beat my high score again, scoring a total of 168 / 200 this time and trust me, I was so not expecting this. Please note, all shots in the black circle. In my heart I was just praying that the Turkish Sword (Kilinc ) turns out to be equally accurate as Caracal F if not better. I had never scored this high with my Caracal. During my last range session about 2-3 weeks ago I scored between 125-130 / 200 from 25 meters (using the Caracal F).\n\nNo hiccups were faced during this string as well. One interesting observation, the pistol was extracting the cases atleast 15 feet away. Much further away as compared to the usual guns.\n\n\n[B]- Some tactical shooting using S&B JHP 115 grain\n[/B]I shot some S&B JHPs 114 grain to see if the gun is capable of cycling hollow points. All shots were made in rapid fire mode and again, dead accurate with no hiccups faced.\n\nFor those who might consider this gun to participate in precision shooting competitions, there''s something I would like to bring into your information.\n\n[url=http://postimg.org/image/mtn4pzz85/][img]http://s26.postimg.org/mtn4pzz85/IMAG1045.jpg[/img][/url]\n\nIf you observe in the image above, the pistol has combat sights, which means the sights are pretty thick and big. Such sights help in tactical shooting and quick acquisition of target. However I feel If the sights were like those of the actual CZ 75B in which the dots are pretty small, that would help in shooting this gun more accurately at long distances.\n\nI won''t say that the sights are bad and there''s room for improvement. That''s the general feedback you would find on on other forums about the Kilinc''s sights. Remember that this is military weapon (Official sidearm of the Turkish Army) and they have made the sights for combat purposes and not precision shooting. For that purpose the circles of sights have been made big and obvious for quicky target acquisition.\n\n\nHow do I wrap this up? All in all, not only am I satisfied with the superb performance of the Kilinc, I am actually delighted...', ''),

When I was at the shop I was more inclined towards a Canikk L120 which had sights exactly like that of a CZ 75B (precision shooting sights but not adjustable) and a lighter frame compared to the Kilinc 2000.

Upon close inspection I realized that the Kilinc had better finishing and trigger as compared to the L120. Secondly the weight and toughness of Kilinc (made from Alloyed forged steel) made it a natural pointer. \n\nWhat I am going to explain now, I don''t know if it''s going to make sense or not.. but that''s just the way it is..Even though the Kilinc 2000 is heavy, but the way the weight has been distributed, you dont feel it... Since I had my holster on I tried concealing the Kilinc at the shop right there... I sat down, walked around, did some movements only to realize that I was very comfortable carrying this one kg of solid forged steel. \n\nEnigmatic Desires kept repeating..."Conceal carrying is a mind game and behavior more than anything" and now I know what it means.... \n\nIn terms of weight, the Kilinc was not that much of a bother carrying...

Phenomenon is that x-rays cant cross a specific thickness of metal and dont pass through a normal track but when some faulty or cracky part of track comes x-rays pass through it and distinctively express the fault in form of display on monitor.\n\nNow what this has to do with your Glock ????\n\nAnswer is, brother they use xray beams to detect microlevel cracks and tearings in track that are not visible to [B]normal naked human eye[/B]. these [B]neglected cracks[/B] can easily break or expand furthur if the faulty track is not replaced on time it can break away from weakening spot and can cause derailing of train and consequently loss of many human lives. same is the case here you might not be able to see those microlevel cracks or tearings in your barrel or other parts of glock yet. which is continously killing your barrel internaly without any visible signs like a termite eats away wood from inside. then suddenly one day it will explode and your glock will go kaboom and worse part would be that this kaboom will not only destroy your gun but it can blewoff your hand in such a way that no orthopaedic surgeon will be able to fix it possibly leading staight to amputation (cutting off a limb i-e hand) and if any sharpnels from gun hit your face they will cost you million bucks for cosmetic surgery and still you might  dont get your previous look and if any of the sharpnel entered your eye than you can also go blind. so why are you putting yourself at such a potential ,great and meaningless risk just to save some bucks.\n\nin conclusion:\n[B]Stay away from darra ammo[/B].\n\n(i would also recommend you to do some research on squib loads,\ndarra ammo can cause a squib load easily. it can also make your glock kaboom)\n\nGlock is not meant to eat away what ever you feed it.\nHaving a high price gun like Glock dont makes it[B] Invincible[/B].\n\nstay safe............', ''),

Sooo, auto or semi is up to the user by installing of a switch in the back plate.\nI put one together in semi a few years back... it was a very time consuming project not to mention very very expensive.  I used a LWD upper and used many lower parts from a G17 frame.  The grip and the rails were a total pain to get aligned right as the grip folds with the trigger guard forward and must open with the same alignment angle as the Glock pistol for proper feeding.  The front rails for the slide were separated from the rear unit and then had to be aligned inline with the rears.  Over all it turn out to be a great challenge especially machining the plastics.  I never really like the torch handle feature on it and after removing it - it became a very nice compact unit that fits in the pocket though the pocket had to be kinda on the deep side.  Aside from the covert carry advantage, I must say that there are too many small parts and the more the parts - the more the likely hood of something either breaking or coming loose or worse not work right at a time of need.

More likely then not you cannot teach such a person who is afraid of nothing but a piece of metal. A dangerous piece of metal, but metal nevertheless.\n\nbut if i were you, id first take into account if the person who is to be taught ACTUALLY wants to learn, or if it isent you forcing your own desires upon them. If so, forget about it. if they weren''t eager to learn about it in the first place, having them use a handgun in defense is a oxymoron. At best it will be useless in such a situation with such a shooter being unable to shoot another human or shoot effectively( or even keep the weapon on their person at all times ), at worst he/she will be shot immediately by the aggressor thinking that he is about to be killed, or they will draw at the least of provocations. Might even get you shot accidentally  , god forbid.  \n\nGet a air rifle, a B3 for about 3-4k and teach on that. afterwards if some confidence etc is gained, then 9mm directly, or .22 lr. ( gun safety is to be taught at this point ) \n\nmake sure to REPEATEDLY EMPHASIZE that the gun is nothing but a tool, and it will not do anything that it is not commanded to. \n\nAlso, after you are done with the airgun part, hand a unloaded pistol to them. Teach things like cleaning, taking it apart and so on, along with some dry firing for a whole 1-2 weeks, at least a hour a day. This will enforce a habit of good safety and gun use, and also drive home the concept that the gun is not a otherworldly thing, or supernatural, it is a object that you can hold in your hands as well as any other. ( teaching thoroughly how a gun works will help with this quite a bit ) \nFor the whole week or two that unloaded weapon must be with them AT ALL TIMES(from morning to night, 24/7. In the bathroom, under their pillow and in their pocket) . as i said before constantly telling them that its just a piece of metal to the point that they are annoyed about it must be done. \n\nMost children are afraid of dogs and cats until they get familiar with them. living alongside one, will inevitably result in familiarization. \n\nAfter this fear is erased then start shooting with the normal concepts of shooting and practical lessons.\n\n\nAs far as teaching females, mian-50 is correct. Id also like to add in that use a very light weapon, in both caliber and weight. Ive tried teaching quite a few, and without exception they have to use their own body weight to counter balance the weight of my shadow 1000\nAlso without exception they will hold the gun improperly, the stock butt is never against the shoulder. they either instinctively put it on their collarbone or below their shoulder. Ive also seen some try to put it on their collarbone. The usual result is that the rifle jerks and drops directly onto her breast, causing pain and discomfort. If not corrected, usually she will keep doing this, complain about the pain afterwards and never shoot again.( pain is not from recoil, is from the skin being pushed by the rifle butt in odd directions, similar to the indian burn ( grab forearm of somebody with both hands close together tightly then rotate hands in opposite directions ) \n\n\nThey also seem to always have a issue with a scope, either putting their eyes directly on it, or angling their head incorrectly and not being able to see out of it. \nIf the caliber is too heavy, she will either start limp wristing or adopting a really bad grip to ease the recoil, or complain about pain in the palm of her hand. If so, stop immediately, take a break , and use a smaller caliber . In my experience this point is at .357 magnum/40S&W and above. \nSome of them flinch when about to fire, tell her its loaded and see if she does the same when pulling the trigger. You can also tell if she closes her eyes when about to shoot. \nFinally, hot bullet casing down the shirt happens occasionally, make sure her top is properly covering everything. \n\n\nThats about it. Also note to tell them that when putting a gun down, make sure it is facing in teh correct direction.', ''),

I personally have fired a custom made desi XF/C DB SbyS gun (both barrels were on extreme side, no middle ground).If you measure chokes with vernier caliper there is minute difference but can see how a cylinder is getting wider vs a full one.And most importantly it depends on barrel''s length,if you cut short a 28" single barrel as close you can, you can see that it will even exceed Cylinder choke''s width.(a very dangerous weapon btw:) ) \n   \nM4 or guns like this are mass production models and other than a few cosmetic changes or pistol grips the barrel is same.\nM2 even designated as a tactical gun comes with 3 chokes and I use IC mostly,it can fire steel shots too.But IMO an embedded or forged M choke would have been better to my needs.As I could fire AAA,SG,LG and Slugs with it, that would be more fun.\nWin. 1300 Def. has embedded Cylinder choke due to it''s shorter barrel and main purpose to expand the pellets quickly (more chance of hitting even without aiming)\nSo, begging your pardon,I think I tried my best to clarify the intentionally innocent mistake :)\n\nBTW, a few days ago a young man was showing me his latest wild boar hunt pics and he used a Russian OU with Full choke and used LG shells according to him the seller specifically told him you can shoot like this.This is purely news to me.\nAny thoughts or info about this ? as I have never read any gun''s manual where they exceed beyond IC choke on larger pallets, but LG on Full!? If a gun like this exists,I want it! :)\n\ncheers!', ''),

We have found that by carefully choosing alloys and applying proven methods of heat treatment, we can produce castings of high quality, strength and wearability. The casting process better lends itself to making parts where internal cavities are required.[/FONT][/COLOR]\n[COLOR=#4C4C4C][FONT=Tahoma]The advantages of casting include:[/FONT][/COLOR]\n[LIST]\n[*]No real upper size limit in casting weight\n[*]Large range of alloy choices\n[*]As forgings remain solid, custom alloys are far more difficult to get into production whereas with casting, alloys including Chrome, Nickel and Moly can be added at the molten stage.\n[*]Tooling is often less expensive than forge dies\n[*]Smaller production ârunsâ required\n[*]Complicated/complex parts are no problem\n[/LIST][COLOR=#4C4C4C][FONT=Tahoma]For general GET as well as large and complex components - casting is a fantastic method of manufacture.\n [/FONT][/COLOR]\n[h=2]Why use forgings?[/h][COLOR=#4C4C4C][FONT=Tahoma]Forging offers uniformity of composition and structure. Forging results in metallurgical recrystalisation and grain \nrefinement as a result of the thermal cycle and deformation process. This strengthens the resulting steel product particularly in terms of impact and shear strength.[/FONT][/COLOR]\n[COLOR=#4C4C4C][FONT=Tahoma]Forged steel is generally stronger and more reliable than castings and plate steel due to the fact that the grain flows of the steel are altered, conforming to the shape of the part.[/FONT][/COLOR]\n[COLOR=#4C4C4C][FONT=Tahoma]The advantages of forging include:[/FONT][/COLOR]\n[LIST]\n[*]Generally tougher than alternatives\n[*]Will handle impact better than castings\n[*]The nature of forging excludes the occurence of porosity, shrinkage, cavities and cold pour issues.\n[*]The tight grain structure of forgings making it mechanically strong. There is less need for expensive alloys to attain high strength components.\n[*]The tight grain structure offers great wear resistance without the need to make products âsuperhardâ We have found that, on a blank HRC 38-42 forged grinder insert wear/wash is about the same as a high alloy HRC 46-50 cast grinder insert. The difference being a HRC 46-50 casting does not have the ductility to handle high impact grinding.\n[/LIST]', ''),

America/some NATO countries where these famous branded weapons are produced have imposed various restrictions/bans on exporting weapons to Pakistan (us being an unstable country and constantly under terrorism''s threat)... consequently the importers in Pakistan have to go through complex importing processes... once they do import they set really hi/inflated prices for these American/Nato countries weapons (Beretta, Glock, Browning etc) to cover their costs and \n\nluckily for us CZ is made in Czech Republic...similarly there are chinese, russian, central american firearms in the market... which are arguably as good in quality and performance as the Glocks or Berettas...and they are easy to import... thus their prices are not so high...', ''),

I went looking to buy a CQA and put some Magpul furniture on it, but after having seen this, I changed my decision and bought this. I bought it for 490k from Saddar Armory, shafi bhai is a good friend as well. The Eotech red dot is a chinese copy (ofcourse) and when viewed in a bright sunny day, its really not of much use. So off it went.\nI went to the RSSC shooting range with a friend and after the initial dialing in of the Magpul style flipup sights, it is very very accurate. My first time shooting I got a hit at 260 yards! \nBut first things first, this is a gas piston powered rifle, and has an 18" barrel. Comes with two 20 (30?) round mags which Im told can have their capacity increased to full potential if I take out the locking pin. The mags are made in Bulgaria, MWG IK510. Theyre good quality and so far have held up well for the 200 odd rounds Ive shot. This gun, I should warn you, absolutely DOES NOT like Norinco 223 ammo. And honestly, I dont think you should run that ammo in ANY rifle. Period. \nThe crappy norinco ammo had loose primers, had the tip of the bullet falling out of the cartridge as it is, then when it shot, it didnt go for more than 5 rounds, and then I would get that dreadful ''click'' knowing that I have to clear the rifle. Two of these bullets ended up getting stuck in the chamber, which required a cleaning rod to push it out from the other end of the barrel, then there was so much debris in the ejector and bolt carrier due to the bad quality of the brass used in the bullet casing. A couple of bullets actually had their rims broken free where the ejector is supposed to catch them. I wish I had taken pictures, they speak so much louder than words. Bad ammo. Ive used norinco 9mm ammo in my cz pistols and they have shot fine, but this was a different story altogether. Some even had their shape twisted out of the box, and Im pretty sure their tolerances were off the mark as well. Bottom line, use good ammo with such an expensive rifle. Thus, we used the green tipped rounds, which are commonly referred to as the ''american'' rounds, and didnt have a single failure. \nCleaning this rifle is a breeze as well, provided you have a rifle cleaning rod. So all in all, very happy :)\nBtw going to mount a sniper 4x32 prismatic scope on it very soon, and then ill update with the results.', ''),

Addressing the meeting, the Interior Minister observed that in past not only various laws were grossly misused but other privileges and permissions that are only granted by the state strictly on case to case basis and after thorough consideration and scrutiny were granted in bulk without any checks and balances. \nConsequently, private guards, prohibited guns  and bullet-proof vehicles not only became a fashion and a status symbol but it also created serious security implications. \nThe minister said that in view of the new challenges due to prevailing security situation, it is important that not only the existing arms licences are properly documented through Nadra but a comprehensive mechanism should be put in place to regulate and monitor the flow of arms into the country. \nEqually important is to bring standardisation of policy of the federal government and the provinces vis-Ã -vis arms licensing in the country, continued the minister. The interior minister said that in the first instance all licences issued from 1973 till June 2013 would be computerized through Nadra. \nThe cut-off date for the validation has been fixed till December 31st 2015. The minister said that no further extension would be granted \nin this date and directed Nadra and Ministry of Interior to launch an aware ness campaign to motivate people to get their licences validated.\nThe meeting also discussed various proposals regarding regulating and monitoring the flow of arms in the country. \nIt was proposed that a  complete ban on import of prohibited weapons should be put in place. Only Ministry of Defence Production and security agencies should be allowed to import prohibited weapons. \nIt was proposed that individuals or entities who stand qualified for these weapons should procure their weapons only through Pakistan Ordnance Factory, Wah Cantonment. The interior minister also observed that regulating the business of arms dealers was also critical. \nThe minister also underscored the need for putting in place a policy on issuance of arms licences in the provinces as well as in the federal government. The meeting decided that nobody under the age of 25 years should be issued arms licence. \nWhile discussing eligibility criteria for issuance of arms licences under the new policy, the minister stressed that the licence should only be issued keeping in view the security requirements of the applicants. \nAmong others, media houses and media persons should also be facilitated as they face security challenges in their professional pursuits, said the interior minister.\n[/TD]\n[/TR]\n[/TABLE]', ''),

[/B]\nThe decision was taken by Interior Minister Chaudhry Nisar Ali Khan in a meeting on Monday.\n&#8220;It was proposed that a complete ban on import of prohibited weapons should be put in place,&#8221; an official statement read. According to the decision, only the Ministry of Defence Production and security agencies should be allowed to import such weapons.\nThe interior minister also proposed that individuals and entities, who are qualified for such weapons, can procure them only through Pakistan Ordnance Factory, Wah.\n&#8220;Regulating the business of arms dealers is also critical,&#8221; Nisar said.\nFurther, the interior ministry declared that that all manual licences, which have not been verified, would be invalidted after December 31, 2015. The meeting also decided that &#8220;nobody under the age of 25 years should be issued arms license.&#8221;\nThe proposal came four month after the government had lifted a ban on the import of commercial prohibited arms, by changing the entire import arms policy with an aim of eliminating under-invoicing and improving documentation. The Pakistan Muslim League &#8211; Nawaz (PML-N) government in its previous tenure had also imposed a ban on import of prohibited weapons in 1997.\nThe interior minister also underscored the need for putting in place a policy on the issuance of arms licenses in the provinces and the federal government.\nWhile discussing eligibility criteria for issuance of arms licenses under the new policy, the minister stressed that the license should only be issued keeping in view the security requirements of the applicants. Among others, media houses and media persons should also be facilitated as they face security challenges in their professional pursuits, the Interior Minister added.\nAddressing the meeting, the Interior minister observed that in the past various laws were grossly misused with certain privileges, which are only granted strictly on a case-to-case basis after thorough consideration and scrutiny, were granted in bulk without any checks and balances. As a result, private security guards, prohibited guns and bullet-proof vehicles had not only became a fashion and a status symbol, but had also created serious security implications.\nIn view of new challenges the National Database Registration Authority (NADRA) is regulating all the existing arms licences, the minister observed. &#8220;But a comprehensive mechanism should be put in place to regulate and monitor the flow of arms into the country,&#8221; he added.\nThe Interior Minister said that in the first instance all licenses issued from 1973 till June 2013 would be computerised through NADRA. The deadline for the validation is December 31, 2015. No further extension would be granted in this regards.', ''),

But for the performance side (experimental test), shoot some bricks (of the same size) with both 9mm and 7.62x25 you will see the result.

I was in contact with another dealer through a friend, who DID quote me the mk3 and the cqa at cheaper prices, but when I made the decision to actually go ahead and get a .223 rifle he simply declined saying his license guy couldnt do it. So, off i went to Saddar armory and he got it done in a couple of days without any hiccups. Also, hes a reliable guy and not into any kind of shady activities which might end up getting one screwed later when one finds out that the license they hold so proudly for their pride & joy is actually not enitrely authentic. And I know for a fact, that the rifle I got has some minor differences compared to the mk3s being sold by guns and accessories. How do i know this? Coz a friend of mine bought the mk3 before me, and yeah we compared notes:\n1. My rifle came with 2 20 round mags, whereas his had a smaller capacity (probably 10 round mag)\n2. He said my rifle''s barrel was also different when we had to open it up at the range to clear out the norinco junk.', ''),

I''ve started this new thread with all the relevant information regarding MOI. Please post all future MOI queries here. Please note [B]we strictly prohibit any discussion of P.B licenses.  [/B]\n\n[SIZE=5][B]Important Update: For all those friends who have questions regarding MOI (book) to Nadra (Card) Licences. Read this for more info:[/B][/SIZE]\n\n[URL]http://www.pakguns.com/showthread.php?2288-The-MOI-Arms-Licenses-Thread-%28All-Pakistan%29&p=210349#post210349[/URL]\n[U][B]\n\n\nSTATUS:[/B][/U]\n\nAs of right now, [B]N.P.B licenses are CLOSED[/B] but some old applications are being issued. \n\n\n[U][B]REQUIREMENTS:[/B][/U]\n\nThe general and easy procedure to get a license made is go to a firearms dealer with:\n\na). Copy of your CNIC\nb). Two Passport size photographs\nc). Filled out form (Available at [URL]http://www.pakguns.com/armsform.pdf[/URL]\n\n\n[U][B]COST:[/B][/U]\n\nCost of the licenses vary from city to city with Islamabad being the cheapest. Approximate rates for major cities are:\n\n1). Islamabad = Rs. 13,000\n2). Lahore = Rs. 14,000\n3). Karachi = Rs. 15,000\n\n\n[U][B]TIME:[/B][/U]\n\nTime for getting a license varies depending on your dealer''s agent but generally it does take about 30 to 40 days. An efficient agent can get one made within two weeks, a less connected agent will take two to three months. \n\n\n[B][U]AMMO LIMIT:[/U][/B]\n\nThe standard ammunition limit on MOI N.B.P licenses is 100 rounds per year. This limit is also the maximum amount of ammo you can legally carry with your weapon. Ammunition limits can also be enhanced with an application to MOI along with reason for request example sport shooting etc. More commonly is it done though dealers who charge about Rs. 2 ruppee per bullet increase. i.e getting it increased to 500 bullets a year will cost you Rs. 1000. I strongly suggest doing so as 100 bullets a year is useless for any enthusiast or sports shooter. \n\n\n[U][B]VALIDITY:[/B][/U]\n\nMOI licenses are valid for 5 years from date of issue, after 5 years renewal is required which is a simple matter of paying fees for the next 5 years.\n\n\n[U][B]LEGAL LIMITATIONS OF A MOI LICENSE:[/B][/U]\n\nThe MOI license is all Pakistan which means you can transport and use your weapon legally in all provinces of Pakistan. This is unlike provincial licenses which are only valid within the province issued, so as soon as you leave the boundaries of that province the weapon becomes illegal. \n\nAll other rights/obligations/status of both kinds of licenses are the same. \n\n\n[B][U]144 Status and MOI[/U][/B]\n\nMOI licenses get no special treatment during imposition of Section 144. Don''t ever carry your weapon on your person during it, it will get confiscated if found. If you need to carry one, then go to your provincial home department and ask them to issue you a 144 permit. If however you are not carrying but rather transporting your weapon (to the range, to another city etc) during 144 then unload your gun and magazines and put them and your ammunition in separate locked bags in your trunk and have your license handy for any checking. There is no ban on transportation of unloaded weapons. Loaded weapons which are ready to fire and carried on the car or on person are problematic during 144.\n\n\n[U][B]I GOT MY LICENSE, NOW WHAT ?[/B][/U]\n\nWhen you get your new license you have 30 days from the date of issue to register it in the main branch of your local National Bank of Pakistan branch. For example in Lahore it is the one on Mall Road, next to GPO, in Isb it is in Aabpara.\n\nThe bank official will register your license in his computer and file, write the N.B.P registration number on your license and sign and stamp it. This is usually done on the first page of the book. A date stamp is also applied.\n\nNext you have a six months or in rare cases a three month grace period to purchase your weapon. This can be found on page 10 of your MOI book.\n\nWhen you find and decide on your weapon of choice then simply go to a firearms dealer, present your license and he will make an entry of the gun serial number on it, along with his dealer stamp and date. He will also give you an original sale receipt of the purchase. \n\nYour last step is presenting your license along with original sale receipt to the D.C.O office within 30 days. They will keep the original receipt, make an entry into their computer and return your license stamped saying your weapon has been registered with them. Ideally your license should be returned the same day and cost nothing but in pursuit of ''Chai Pani'' your perfectly valid firearms license will get stuck and take forever unless about Rs. 300 to 500 is presented to the lower staff to move things along.   \n\n\n[U][B]My license says "One N.P.B", What does it mean ?[/B][/U]\n\n\nOne N.P.B stands for One Non Prohibited Bore weapon. In a nutshell you can buy any semi automatic pistol or revolver on the market, any pump action or semi automatic 12 Gauge shotgun or a .22 rifle. In some cases like Sindh the Provincial Government there also allows Bolt action rifles in other calibers like 7mm.  \n\n\n[U][B]MOI License Verification:[/B][/U]\n\nGenerally with the N.B.P registration and the D.C.O office, you really don''t need anything else. Just MAKE SURE YOU DO THESE TWO THINGS YOURSELF. Licenses that come stamped with N.B.P and or D.C.O are suspicious and probably fake.\n\nFor the more paranoid, you can call MOI and follow their guidelines.\n\n\n[U][B]Recommend Dealers / Agents: [/B][/U]\n\nFor the time being we are [B]not [/B]recommending any dealers or agents. I would suggest checking out our dealer review section for guidance.\n\n\n[U][B]How to Transfer A Gun from One License to the Other:[/B][/U]\n\nThis is a simple procedure. Take both licenses and the firearm to a registered firearms dealer and ask him to transfer the gun from one license to the other. He will do it for you and also give the buyer a sale recipt. Dealers charge around Rs. 1000 for this service. The buyer will have to deposit his license to the D.C.O office like normal for registration of the new weapon. The seller must also keep in mind that if he''s buying another weapon on the same day then no procedure is required, if however he buys a weapon at a later date then he will have to ask his dealer to send his license to the D.C.O office for extension, that costs around Rs. 500/1000 and takes a few days. There is no grace period of even a single day.\n\n\n[B]Here is the form for Grant of new Arms License[/B] [B]:[/B][/QUOTE]\n Thankyou, if you have time, can I ask you something?\n\nIf I hold, an NPB license (Islamabad) for Pistol/revolver, under one license how many "relevant" weapons in possess, buy? or, for every weapon i need to have a new license? \n\nI am not very frequent on this site, therefore, I would appreciate of you could let me know on my email [email]ceo.ccgi@outlook.com[/email].', ''),

(641518, ' [QUOTE=sto0pid;479210]I believe there is nothing wrong with cqa rifles, but rather the problem lies with the dealers who are selling them. I''ve heard of dealers in karachi selling it for as low as 170k, but if you go to reputable people likme al-haris etc. they will quote you somewhere in the neighborhood of 200-205k. And they say that there are issues with the rifles being sold elsewhere. For all we know this could be just a sales pitch designed to frame the customer into paying higher prices, but I would certainly not take a chance with a 200k rifle. Also, I did the math on swapping out parts in a cqa, with magpul furniture, bolt carrier, charging handle and barrel upgrades, it ends up costing almost 400k. So I decided to skip all that and go for a weapon which is not only more reliable (being gas piston powered), but also doesnt need all the aftermarket upgrades as it already comes with premium quality parts.[/QUOTE]\nYou could not have said it any better. I bought first CQA with the intention of changing it completely to what I wanted and how I wanted it to be putting in quality parts to get the most out of it. My total cost of putting that CQA together was 400k+. So it comes back to the fact that, building an AR or buying a quality AR at the end of the day is the SAME, you would probably save 10k MAX in building, if I actually sit down to consider how much I spent on my rifle, bro I am sure you got a better deal with that Tan MK3 than me because to come at par with your rifle I would have to cerakote my rifle Tan, which would mean dishing out even more money.

Nisar also said a court order will be mandatory to place anyone on the ECL.\nThe federal interior minister also shed light on the state of private security agencies operating in the country, saying that his investigation had revealed alarming irregularities. âHundreds of private security agencies have employed personnel who cannot operate weapons.\nâSuch agencies need to be regulated and proper checks need to be in place so that only trained and worthy individuals are employed to provide security,â Nisar said\n\n[URL]http://www.dawn.com/news/1181123/unevaluated-arms-licences-will-expire-at-year-end-nisar[/URL]', ''),

The gun is easy to CC as compare to my EZ-9 but I like EZ-9 more then NP-42 because as soon as you hold it, it gives you a very different feeling the quality, trigger etc is very different but having said that NP-42 in any given day is a reliable gun.\n\nNow I am getting the opportunity to trade it off and I am thinking to buy a B6 instead of it. I haven''t actually seen any of Sarsilmaz guns except Canik (But never fired  one) like B6 and ST-9 etc. but have read good reviews what I am looking for is a very good and THE MOST RELIABLE GUN IN MY HAND (Please don''t say GLOCK can''t afford it in Pakistan) In my opinion NP42 is one of the MOST reliable gun when you pull the trigger it will fire for sure.

Now i am a slug kinda guy and the idea of buying a shottie and not feeding her slugs does not appeal to me. \r\n\r\nI checked the DSA website. All it says is that its ''not recommended'' for high power loads.  I have absolutely no idea what that means.  What defines high power loads? I know that it has a 2.75 inch chamber and therefore cannot handle 3 inch magnum loads. \r\n\r\nNow I have seen low brass slugs as well as high brass ones. Does a low brass slug qualify as a ''high power round'' ? And what about SG (Small game) and LG (large game) they ''look'' 3 inches but when fired their shells remain the same length since they are not crimped and fired shells when juxtaposed to regular No. 4 to 9 are the same height. So do they qualify as ''high power rounds'' or do only high brass rounds qualify as such? \r\n\r\nDoes the ''high power load'' specification apply only to Super and excell and other high brass shells only? \r\n\r\nDSA claims that its forged alloy and made to international standards. And I don''t know if anyone here has heard of a blown up DSA security. \r\n\r\nI will really really put her through her paces and do a detailed review I would love to know how far i can push her.

I love the trigger on the C100. \n\nHowever, in all my days of carrying a CC fire arm. It has been my observation that the butt end protrudes from an IWB holster. I.e its not the size of the barrel (which is always concealed in the trousers) but the butt end that sticks out. if it has a big one then CC becomes difficult. When i juxtaposed the C100 with its other full sized cousins. The butt sized remained more or less the same. Its both quite long and wide. I.e  only the barrel being small. \n\nIMHO cc-ing it is the same as cc-ing its full sized cousins.  As regards the shark FC. The same thing applies. Only she has a ported barrel for low recoil. And the largest Loaded chamber indicator i have ever seen in my life. \n\nAdvantages: Low recoil due to porting.\n\nDisadvangage: Low power hence shorter range since the gases escape though the ports.', ''),

(641784, ' [QUOTE=fezan;479481]I think rifle or carbine is too much of a platform for 7.62x25. \n\nThis round goes well in handgun or SMG at max.[/QUOTE]\n\nrifle is perfect to get best out or any caliber, e.g an average 9mm handgun shots effetively at 50meters while a 9mm carbine mp5 for suppose shots same bullet with reasonable momentum and accuracy at 100meters \n\nWhy ???\nbecause of big barrel, Now what big barrel has to do with Range, velocity and momentum ???\n\nBro if you had opened a cartridge and burnt a gun powder you might have noticed that whole powder never burns instantly.Same goes when you fire a cartridge out of a gun. Whole powder never burns instantly. if barrel is like 3-5 inches then less powder will be burnt and before whole powder could burn the projectle already gone out of the gun barrel rest of powder goes waste in air and it does not contributes in adding any pressure which can accelerate the projectile at even higher velocity. On other hand in big barrels like 7-8 inches more powder will be burnt before the projectile exits the barrel this adds up more kinetic energy to the projectile due to more pressure that is being produced by burning of more powder.\nMoreover a bigger barrel provides more stability to the motion of cartridge. Initially bullet resonates a bit just after popping out of the shell bigger barrel reduces this resonance more effectively (resonance reduces accuracy) and it does this by help of providing a bigger uniform cylindrical straight path,\n\nAs a bonus,\nRifling does the rest of job bigger the barrel more resolutions and spins could be achieved by a bullet in barrel and more accurate the bullet will be, and this is because of centripetal force the rifling grooves provide to bullet by spinning it. centripetal force prevents rapid and early loss of momentum and kinetic energy so it aids in maintaining accuracy and velocity of a bullet at long ranges.\n\nIn semi-auto sniper rifles (like Dragunov SVD, barrets .50cal and HK41X platforms) other than Gas system modifications bigger barrels also play keen role in increasing the minimum effective range of weapon.\n\nI assume:\nFor 7.62 cal something like 8-9 inches should be sufficent, 12-16 should get the best out of it, 18+ is too much and any thing above 20+ is not worthy.', ''),

(641788, ' [QUOTE=Aquarius;479537]@ED: You mean that the grip portion is long & difficult to conceal ??[/QUOTE]\n\n\nBro the thing is.... there a very few people who have experience of carrying different sizes of guns and on daily basis for hours... ED would agree with me, Conceal carrying is a lifestyle... and you have to adapt your self, everything about your self according to your weapon instead of adapting your weapon according to yourself. That statement has been learned by us the hard way but here we are trying to save everyone from the hassle and sharing the learned knowledge straight up.\n\nSome myths about Conceal carrying that I would like to break:\n\n1- Only compact and sub compact pistols can be conceal carried - WRONG, even full frame weapon can be conceal carried easily by an average framed person\n\n2- Conceal Carry guns should be light - WRONG, how the gun sticks against your body has a lot to do with the design of the gun, its balance and the holster your are carrying it in. I carry a 1000 gram gun made from solid forged steel and don''t feel it much. The way the weight has been distributed over the body of the gun makes a huge difference\n\nOther than these factors, if you do genuinely want a smaller gun for comfort and ease, then look for a gun which is smaller on the grip side as well... It''s not the barrel end that protrudes, it''s the grip that sticks out and creates the imprint. Shorter grips do create problems in having a proper grip over the gun but one can''t have everything right... For every added advantage  there''s an attached disadvantage as well. Another such example is that when you compromise on the barrel length, you are compromising on Accuracy at distances. Short barrel handguns might be very accurate at distances up to 10 meters  but as you cross 15 meters the bullets scatter all over the place. Having said that, on the contrary it is also established that over 90% of self defense situations occur at a distance less than 10 feet but I am just stating out the facts. There are many out there who have just one handgun which functions as their range gun, SD and HD...\n\nThere''s much more to share about conceal carrying, perhaps ED can shed some light upon the topic as well..', ''),

"may Allah reward you with the Best / Good", \n\n\n  So the correct way is to say Jazakallah khair & not just  JazakAllah. Though someone might say that the intention by saying  JazakAllah is the same like JazakAllahu khayran, if it''s so, then why  not use the complete wordings as used by Prophet(salallahu alaihi wa  sallam) and the Sahabas (radiAllahu Anhum), which is "JazakAllahu  khayran"\n\n\n Jazak Allahu Khair depending on situation:\n Masculine: Jazak Allahu Khair/Khairan\n Feminine: Jazaki Allahu Khair/Khairan \n Plural: Jazakum Allahu Khair/Khairan\n\n\n  You may also use "JazakAllahu khairan katheeran" which means May Allah  reward you with good in abundance" as "Katheeran" means  "abundance/abundantly".\n\n\n Instead of Jazakallahu khair you may also use:\n Feminine:  Barakallahu Feeki\n Masculine: Barakallahu Feek\n Plural: Barakallahu Feekum\nWhich means "May Allah bless you", which is an appropriate way of  thanking someone and replying to someone who''s said JazakAllahu Khair to  you. \n\n\n It can be used both as a thanking and a reply.\n\n\n As a reply you may also say:\n (Below are the replies to someone who has thanked you with JazakAllahu Khair or Barakallahu Feek)\n Feminine- Wa Iyyaki \n Masculine- Wa Iyyak\n Plural- Wa Iyyakum\n They all mean, "same to you".\n\n They are the most appropriate replies.\n\n\n Another reply could be\n Feminine- Wa Anti Aydan\n Masculine- Wa Anta Aydan\n Plural- Wa Antum Aydan \n They all mean, "you too". (Not very preferable, but it''s okay to use this as a reply too).\n \nAnd another reply could be:\n\n Feminine: Jazana wa Iyaaki \n Masculine: Jazana Wa Iyyak\n Plural: Jazana Wa Iyyakum\n\n Translation to it is: may Allah reward you and me too with the same.\n\n Same" here means Khair which is good from Jazakallahu Khair or\n Barakah which means blessing from Barakallahu Feek.\n\n\n  If someone has said "Thank-You" or "Shukran" and not used "Jazakallahu  Khair" or "Barakallahu Feek" to thank you, then reply them with  "Barakallahu feek" or "Jazakallahu Khair", as replies like "wa iyyak" or  "wa anta aydan" means "you too" and you can''t use that as a reply as  it''s inappropriate. \n\nJazakallahu Khair.', ''),

(642010, ' [QUOTE=Mian Jee;479756]Thank you for explaining that.\n\nYou are right, it''s "feek" for a single & "feekum" far a plural, not feekoma.\n\nNow please allow me to share a bit more.\n\n Jazaak comes from the root word jazaa'' (&#1580;&#1586;&#1575;&#1569;) which according to the  popular Arabic-English dictionary, Al-Mawrid, has two meanings that are  completely opposite to eachother!\n\n\n Thus jazaa'' (&#1580;&#1586;&#1575;&#1569;) can either mean reward OR punishment. \n\n\n So :"JazakAllah" can may either mean "may Allah reward you" or "may Allah punish you", while\n "JazakAllah Khair" means ... "may Allah reward you with the Best / Good", \n\n\n  So the correct way is to say Jazakallah khair & not just  JazakAllah. Though someone might say that the intention by saying  JazakAllah is the same like JazakAllahu khayran, if it''s so, then why  not use the complete wordings as used by Prophet(salallahu alaihi wa  sallam) and the Sahabas (radiAllahu Anhum), which is "JazakAllahu  khayran"\n\n\n Jazak Allahu Khair depending on situation:\n Masculine: Jazak Allahu Khair/Khairan\n Feminine: Jazaki Allahu Khair/Khairan \n Plural: Jazakum Allahu Khair/Khairan\n\n\n  You may also use "JazakAllahu khairan katheeran" which means May Allah  reward you with good in abundance" as "Katheeran" means  "abundance/abundantly".\n\n\n Instead of Jazakallahu khair you may also use:\n Feminine:  Barakallahu Feeki\n Masculine: Barakallahu Feek\n Plural: Barakallahu Feekum\nWhich means "May Allah bless you", which is an appropriate way of  thanking someone and replying to someone who''s said JazakAllahu Khair to  you. \n\n\n It can be used both as a thanking and a reply.\n\n\n As a reply you may also say:\n (Below are the replies to someone who has thanked you with JazakAllahu Khair or Barakallahu Feek)\n Feminine- Wa Iyyaki \n Masculine- Wa Iyyak\n Plural- Wa Iyyakum\n They all mean, "same to you".\n\n They are the most appropriate replies.\n\n\n Another reply could be\n Feminine- Wa Anti Aydan\n Masculine- Wa Anta Aydan\n Plural- Wa Antum Aydan \n They all mean, "you too". (Not very preferable, but it''s okay to use this as a reply too).\n \nAnd another reply could be:\n\n Feminine: Jazana wa Iyaaki \n Masculine: Jazana Wa Iyyak\n Plural: Jazana Wa Iyyakum\n\n Translation to it is: may Allah reward you and me too with the same.\n\n Same" here means Khair which is good from Jazakallahu Khair or\n Barakah which means blessing from Barakallahu Feek.\n\n\n  If someone has said "Thank-You" or "Shukran" and not used "Jazakallahu  Khair" or "Barakallahu Feek" to thank you, then reply them with  "Barakallahu feek" or "Jazakallahu Khair", as replies like "wa iyyak" or  "wa anta aydan" means "you too" and you can''t use that as a reply as  it''s inappropriate. \n\nJazakallahu Khair.[/QUOTE]\nAssalamo aliakum BarakALLAHfeekoma wah jazakALLAh khariun fidunya wah akhri . Thank you for the information brother. How ever let me further emphasize on what i said in regards to koma being plural, in the arabic language they are two types of plurals and one singular ka is singular. koma is plural but it refers to only two people . kom is also a  plural and is what one would refer to as a plural in the english language or in sindhi or urdu and would refer to more then one person but not two people. Therefore BarakALLAHFEEk =singular BARAKALLAHFEEKOMA =plural(two) BARAKALLAFEEKOM=plural(any number more then two) . BARAKALLAFEEKOMA assalamo alaikum', ''),

(642040, ' KA-BAR 1255 short tanto:\n\nThis is going to be my first ever review of any thing so far on PG, and  that is happening because i am very impressed with this new lethal  Beauty i nicked\n"Schwarz Konigin" which means "Black Queen".\n\nFirst unboxing impression:\nwhen i unboxed the Knife for first time. what i noticed was that every  thing was well oriented and well placed in the box, i dont like messed  up things and inappropriate packaging style. Box was appropriatly sized  not too big not so small.\nFollowing Items were present in a reasonable quality Blue box:\n1. US made Knife covered in cardboard\n2. A pamphlet (which many call a booklet)\n3. A Leather Sheath (Mexican-made)\nWhat i highly appreciate About KA-BAR is that they put a great job in  placing the knife blade in a nice cardboard paper instead of sheath the  cardboard paper is sized to be bigger than the knife blade which  prevents the knife blade from stricking or pushing against its end thus  it not only protects the sharp tip of blade but also prevents knife from  damaging the inner part of box and other items in the box.\n\nKnife:\n\nFinish:\nWhen i removed that cardboard paper off to unveil beauty the first thing  i noticed was its finish of course. There is no doubt that from  appearance the finish (coating) looks very uniform and sturdy, as i have  no EDC or usage experiance with this knife so far, i cant comment that  how much it is practicaly durable.\n\nBlade:\nIt is almost 5 inches long made from 1095 cro-van steel, which is like a  standard and staple alloy used By KA-BAR for manufacturing Knives, what  actualy is meant by 1095 cro-van is that it denotes number of carbon  present in alloy i-e the 95 in the end represents the percentage so if  its 1045 it means 0.45% carbon, if it says 1055 it means 0.55% carbon and if  like in case of KA-BAR 1255 it says 1095 it means 0.95% carbon (Greater  number of carbon the greater will be the strength of steel)\nCro-van means Chromium-Vanadium this means steel has abundancy of  chromium and vanadium as compare to other fractions of elements like  manganese used to make 1095 steel. what this contributes to knife is  that such compostion of alloy is easy to sharpen, It is durable and  tough, hold its edge more efficently under usage and normal wear. but it  has one big flaw this type of steel is not good in preventing rust and i  think for its compensation KA-BAR has put some nice finish on the  blade.\nAs far as sharpness is concerned, what i have witnessed is that the  blade is very sharp nearly razor sharp out of the box which is a very  good thing. More over as it is a tanto blade which is it self the most  strong and durable sort of design you dont have to worry about the  performance of this knife incase you have to use it for self-protection,  It is made as a fighting knife,  it is not a multipurpose type of knife  but it does not means that you cant use it for other tasks. The  serrations on the blade are of reasonable size and well located on the  blade. since i am not going to use this knife as an axe for cutting  woods. i dont bother serrations on knife. \n\nTang:\nMany people consider tang as a vital spec of Knife. This knife is full  tang. but its tang is of narrow size as compare to blade. The KA-BAR has  a unique style of Fixing blade and that is its Pin locking design,  simply explained as:\nWith blade there is a reasonably sized double knife guard (This makes it  ambidextrous can be used by both left and right handed person) after  guard Grip is fixed on tang followed by a tough Powder metal made cap in  cap there is a small hole from which the pin passes into the tang  fixing the whole knife together.\n\nGrip:\nThe biggest plus point of this knife. The grips are made of hard rubber  like material which gives you very nice and comfortable kind of  non-slipping grip the mid portion of grip is bulging out words which  feels so nice while holding the knife giving you an excellent firm grip.  the tough cap located on its end can be very usefull in case of fight  this can provide a blunt edge thus you can only hurt the attacker  without penetration. (Note! This cap is not made for hammering)\n\nSheath:\nThe sheath is printed with KA-BAR logo. Material is leather it is well  sewen together there is a small hole in the end which provides route for  escape of water incase if some one dives with this knife in pool or  something. This hole is mostly mistaken by buyers to be made for  attaching Paracord. The upper portion of sheath has a small leather  strip with a button. it fastens around the grip to prevent it from  falling out of the sheath. On its back there is a hollow space which can  be used for passing belt through it to fix the knife with your  cloathing i-e trousers and pants or for attaching leg straps incase you  are intrusted.\n\nTwo things that i am concered about sheath:\n1.The type of leather used to make sheath either It is Bovine derived or Pig made.\nIt is a common practice in states for using Pig leather in making things  like boots, belts, sheaths and pistol holsters etc. I didnt searched  for any authentic proof of Pig leather usage by KA-BAR yet (this is the  matter that needs to investigated).\n2. A single metal screw which is very absurdly attached to the sheath  (although there are many more) it looks like they have attached it to  hold the leather strap with sheath from the middle, to me its pointless  since whole strap is sewen together at both edges very tightly already.\n why this screw is bothering me ? \nReason is when ever you slide in and slideout the knife from sheath this  screw rubs against the blade thus it can damage the finish or atleast  can produce weird linings on the blade.\n\nHold:\nReasonable weight, Center of gravity is well adjusted, comfortable  grips, reasonably sized blade. On plus Dark black colour with shining  edge (realy Mean looking knife)\n\n                                                          END\n\n(Edited after "Malang" pointed out a mistake)', ''),

However the POF 5 is nothing more than an extremely oversized pistol.  Unlike its original it does not have a 30 rounder. or the select fire ability that makes its original a great weapon.  After its barrel has been chopped off it does not have  a longer barrel to aid in accuracy and extended range. not even a buttstock to hold it steady.  I tried to aim it. but without a stock it was too front heavy.  It is basically a 15 round 9mm pistol that is absolutely unconcealable and offers no discernible advantage over my Np 42. \n\nIf intimidation is the reason it has to be handed over to guards.

Some major initiatives include the Ten Year Plan of Action, and 1441 Hijri Vision. The President of Pakistan is the Chairman of COMSTECH, which was an initiative of the Pakistan Government. Previous Coordinator Generals have been Dr. M.A. Qazi and Dr Atta ur Rehman. Dr. Khan&#8217;s tenure as Head of COMSTECH should be interesting; it will certainly be different.\n\nA Rhodes Scholar at Oxford, from where he obtained his BSc in Engineering Sciences and a D.Phil in Laser Applications, Dr. Shaukat possesses nearly 40 years of experience in R&D, teaching, production, technical management and policy planning. He is a Fellow of the Pakistan Academy of Sciences, and had retired in 2005 as Chief Scientist from the Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission (PAEC). He has briefly served as Rector GIKI and Executive Director of SOPREST (parent body of GIKI).   He has 28 scientific publications in international journals and conferences apart from lectures at international conferences dealing with energy and the emerging relation between science and society in this century. He took part in the 2010 summit in Japan of 100 scientists from Europe and Asia which examined cooperation between the continents on large multi-disciplinary projects and programmes.\n\nDr. Shaukat started the laser program in the PAEC, which has now grown into the National Institute of Lasers and Optronics (NILOP) with several hundred professionals, engaged in research, teaching and production. As visiting scientist at CERN in Geneva, he helped design the laser based position monitoring system for the massive CMS detector, where forty such systems designed and manufactured in his laboratory are installed. Nearly US$ 150 million worth of lasers and allied products have been produced, with exports to countries in Asia, Middle East and Europe.\n\nHe has served as Member, Planning Commission, Government of Pakistan, where he looked after science and technology, higher education, industries and minerals. As Project Director and principal author of the major foresight exercise &#8211; Vision 2030 in 2007 &#8211; he gathered the best hearts and minds of the country, and attempted to identify the preferred future of the country for a whole new generation of young people. He also drew up a major policy programme &#8211; Making People Employable &#8211; which emphasised reforms in secondary education and stressed different and higher skills for young people, based upon an internal technology transfer from the best &#8216;mother&#8217; institutes within the country.\n\nDr. Shaukat was a member of the Steering Committee on Higher Education set up by the President of Pakistan in 2002 &#8211; which led to the establishment of the Higher Education Commission (HEC) &#8211; and the World Bank team which drew up Pakistan&#8217;s National Industrial Policy in 2011.\n\nHis current passion is identifying the critical options which Pakistan must deploy in order to manage the energy crisis, and has lectured and written at various forums such as the National School of Public Policy on various aspects of this issue, including renewable Energy and the economics and politics of trans-border energy trade.\n\nApart from cricket, squash, and rowing for his college at Oxford, he was President of several Oxford Societies such as the Ralegh Club, Pakistan Society and the Oxford Majlis. Prior to joining COMSTECH, Dr. Khan was working as Vice Chancellor (Designate) at CASE, a leading institute in Islamabad with the largest enrolment of post-graduate engineering students in the country.', ''),

(642227, ' [QUOTE=Enigmatic Desires;479953]Well.. The MP 5 is primarily an SMG and a pretty good SMG as well. However the POF 5 is nothing more than an extremely oversized pistol.  Unlike its original it does not have a 30 rounder. or the select fire ability that makes its original a great weapon.  After its barrel has been chopped off it does not have  a longer barrel to aid in accuracy and extended range. not even a buttstock to hold it steady.  I tried to aim it. but without a stock it was too front heavy.  It is basically a 15 round 9mm pistol that is absolutely unconcealable and offers no discernible advantage over my Np 42. \n\nIf intimidation is the reason it has to be handed over to guards. Then the CQ can do a far far better job in both looks as well as performance as well as capacity and at virtually the same price.  The B6 at 48k is the only value for money product apart from their ammunition that I liked. That and the Azb rifle.[/QUOTE]\n\nI agree on your points but I am thinking about pof 5 with 9 inch barrel if I put a folding stock on it and use 30 round magazine with it will be cool.I ignore more then 22rd mag thing.What you say.I like the look of mp5 and nowaday it''s not possible to get a pb licence.', ''),

Instead of them playing along with your statement. \n\n\nIf I told you to look at kagefox and see how a good school boy behaves , honestly tell me. Would you have replied in kind or a joking manner, or would you have issued a statement on the lines of \n\n"I can assure you, I am no school boy....etc"\n\nThe people who have chosen to not post their age know this, and have chosen to let their post count and repuatokn do the talking. As it should be. \n\nIts natural human behavior at its finest. A 14 year old who knows the would about a certain topic would be pushed over in exchange for the 37 year old who cannot differentiate between a 92fs and a cz75 and talks in terms of "yeh changa hai aur yeh best hai"without giving any reason whatsoever.', ''),

(642440, 'Taurus owners... First off for all the regulars, I''ve been away from Pakguns for a while, and I missed you all... well... most of you anyways :lol: \nAnd for those who missed my long, drawn out posts (if there actually are any of you)... this one''s for you!\n\nI started this thread in hopes of seeking some guidance regarding Taurus. I am interested in their revolvers, specifically the Tracker line. They don''t have the greatest reputation over here, but truth be told, most of the criticism comes from people who have never owned one. Another reason for their lack of popularity in this market is because they are seperated from a real Smith and Wesson (I say a "real" Smith because they got a lot of inspiration from... cough-copied-cough, cough...  S&W design) by only several hundred dollars, even less for a Ruger, and both those brands are far more established in the world of revolvers. \n\nWhere Taurus excels however, is through innovation. Their original designs are quite often products for which there are no competitors. Take the Judge for instance, it became such a hit, S&W was left playing "catch up" with their Governor. Then there''s the Curve, and the View; whether they become successful only time will tell, but regardless, they are extremely innovative designs. \n\nThis brings us to my situation. A double action, rimfire, combo revolver is a rare animal (at least among the major manufacturers), and consequently another product unique to Taurus. To clarify, its a double action/single action revolver that can shoot 22 short, 22 lr, and a separate cylinder for 22 WMR (aka 22 magnum). If you''re thinking Ruger makes something like that, you would be correct... almost. The Ruger Single 6, along with the Pietta 1873 reproductions are indeed combo guns, but they are also SA only. The combo part isn''t actually a big deal since I''m only interested in the 22 magnum chambering. Then why don''t I get a Smith? Because the Model 48 only has a 6 round capacity, and as such, the Taurus has a 50% increase in capacity which is worth more to me than an S&W logo on the gun. \n\nI don''t have any Taurus products but I''ve seen quite a few PG members with them. I would really appreciate it if current or past owners, or anyone who is experienced with them, could share some thoughts and opinions on these revolvers. Are they accurate? Are they reliable? Have you had any issues? If so, was the problem easily corrected? Which model/caliber do you have? Have you added any accessories, or done any upgrades to your gun? As far as quality and trigger feel, how would you compare it against a Smith? \n\nAs a side note: I don''t see 22 magnum being discussed much. Is the cartridge, or are the guns chambered for it, not popular/available in Pak?', ''),

(642598, ' [QUOTE=miradULLAH;480318]assalamo alaikum yes brother i heard of that russian krinkov and was quoted around 7 lakh for it . I didnt  see it though , It could have been bulgarian i have seen dealers try to sell bulgarians of as russian krinkovs quite a bit . I aslo dont see how they could get a nib russia krinkov here. There is a high probability that it was a used russian krink or a new bulgarian one. And iam a bit suspicious of the bulgarian and russian krinkovs selling for around 2 k that have recently flooded the market i am skeptical about them being orginal bulgarian krinkovs as a have examined a number of them. Yes brother mohammad m those ar 15s uppers are very steep in regards to their price . a good alternate would be getting a cq norinco sbr or an orignal chinese short barreled upper and then upgrading it where one thinks an upgrade is neccessary that should cost one around 2.5-3.5k . Granted that one can find such an upper.And thank you for the advise  BaraKALLAfeekoma Assalamo alaikum[/QUOTE]\n\nThe thing about SBRs is that for terminal performance they need a certain velocity.  and that holds true especially for the krinkow.  The 7n6 round on which it is based has a hollow pocket in the projectile and a steel penetrator rod. once it hits terminal velocity it does very very nasty things to the human body. The bullet tumbles and the rod forces it to tumble as its centre of gravity is pushed backwords more ever teh rod also penetrates and deforms the tip completely and forces it to expand. \n\nI saw pics of a wet telephone directory that was hit with the 7n6 .222 rounds then commercial .222 and finally .223 ammo. While the rest of the stuff made little knitting needle holes. The 7n6 did truly horrific damage to the directory and the wooden boards behind it. \n\nThis however is generally not the case with SBRs since their short barrels to not allow them to achieve terminal velocities.  \n\nIMHO for SD one is better off with a hand gun loaded with quality hollow point ammo.', ''),

(642650, ' Assalamo alaikum thats true 7 n6 should be the most potent round and ALLAH knows best. but i think that the soft point boat tail .222 round can also be quite damaging . It offers more penetration then a hollow point round even though its expansion is lesser and  is known to penetrate through a single ''fleshy'' target wild game or human. and the boat tail allows for accuracy at a distance . But in all honesty any round when used effectively can  cause devastation. Just recently two people living in the same vicinity as myself were killed and one was severely wounded after a petty squabble over nothing . The person who survived told me that there was a slight argument over some petty matter where excessive hostility was not shown by either party. how ever the ones that they had an argument with followed them in a motor cycle and proceeded to methodically shoot all 5 inhabitants in the car with what was said to be a TT 30 bore pistol.3 of them died and 2 were left for dead but survived May ALLAH give us all good. i also saw the entrance wounds of the person that survived and they seem to be from a small caliber pistol. And might i add that one of the people in this story was a fire arms carrier but did not have it with him at the time of the incident and no one else was carrying a fire arm. If even one of them had a fire arm they could have put up a fight but all 5 were shot by a lone stone hearted shooter . Thus i would advise every one to always keep a licensed fire arm with you wherever you go with the necessary 144 permission as we live in troubled times .

(642773, ' As far as ammo is concerned, the M85 Nato green tip 5.56 rounds are as best a price as they can be anywhere. On my last tip to USA they were selling it in private gun shops at 55 cents a pop and walmart was selling it at 50 cents a pop. Both these prices are more than the price in Pakistan. This tells us 2 things\n\n1. All the M85 Ammo in Pakistan has been smuggled in and that is the reason for its price being even lower than in America\n2. Any commodity that is being smuggled in bulk has a huge price dependency on its presence in where it is coming from, i.e. normal supply and demand do not count\n\nAs the american presence in Afghanistan depletes and America makes its exit. M85 supply will decrease and slowly dry up time over time. Once it gets lesser and lesser, its price is going to go higher to the point where .223 commercial ammo available right now will be cheaper to buy than M85. Once M85 price goes higher than commercial .223 ammo no one will buy M85 and the smuggling will stop completely. Give it max 2 years, M85 ammo prices will increase, but that will only happen if America keeps making its exit at the rate that it is making now. Not just the military but as long as civilian military contractors are present in AFG in a large amount M85 will remain affordable because they get their ammo from the private market and "lose" their ammo quite often.\n\nLesson from it all, start collecting M85 ammo as soon as you have your CQA. Stock up on at least 5000 rounds (besides your normal shooting ammo) over a period of these two years if you want to enjoy your shooting sport later on. Those rounds will last you about 2 years and maybe things change by then.', ''),

You just can''t stop cats to sneak in & please share your technique if you have ever caught a cat...\n[/QUOTE]\n\nMian Jee brother,\n\nFrankly I have never caught a cat in my life... not even in my childhood... :) but catching it, would not be an issue for a wise like you...\n\nHowever, as you asked me, so I will very humbly suggest you some practical ways, which will work In Sha ALLAH.\n\n1st is a bit lengthy I mean DIY type, i.e. just make time tested trip wire type trap. Which children use for birds... \nThings you need are:\n\n1. One Crate of mangos :p not for the cat but for your kids bro... ;) only empty crate is needed :)\n(you can also take empty crate from fruit seller) or alternatively you can use normal plastic washing tub used in house hold...\n2. One Stick,\n3. One String\n4. Bait (Bowl of Milk/piece of meat etc)\n\n\nNow you just need to put the milk bowl/piece of meat (bait) under the crate/tub and raise it from one side, with help of the stick, and tie the stick with the string. Make the other end of the string placed under the milk pot or tied gently with the piece of meat, as soon as the cat comes to take the bait, and touches the bait the crate or tub should fall over her because string will make the stick fall that is holding the crate/tub. \n\nCaution: Just make sure that you put some weight on the tub or crate, so that when it falls cat does not makes her escape by jumping under it and making it flip over.\n\nFor reference I have found this page for you, hopefully you get better idea.\n[url]http://www.instructables.com/id/Cat-Trap/[/url]\n\nSecond technique is way more easy but a little tricky, just put some sleep causing material in the bait, (I am not a veterinary doctor so cannot comment on the recommended dose and medicine, may be some one from the forum or some Vet. doctor in your area can guide you in this regard). Put the smallest amount just to make her sleep for few hours and not for days... and when it wakes up, then drop her off at some distant place... make sure that the medicine must effect immediately.\n\nHowever, the most simple and easy way is is to make a cage type trap for the cat, just similar but bigger in size, to the ones used to catch mice.\n\nFor giving you some idea, attaching following pics for you\n\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]35130[/ATTACH]\n\n\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]35131[/ATTACH]\n\nAnd following, you can make easily through any simple steel workshop. Its easy, simple and importantly cost effective too.\n\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]35132[/ATTACH]\n\nAnd don''t forget to tie your cage with some string so that cat does not run with it. (If it could)\n\nHope this will help you in solving the problem. \n\n\nP.S. I don''t think catching it with bare hands like stated by dear member Dead is a wise and convenient idea.\n\nRegards', ''),

Provincial home secretary Mukhtiar Soomro said that  the verification process had been initiated for the 1,057,456 arms  licences that had been issued in the province since they started  maintaining records. According to him, the government had so far  received 462,310 licence verification applications, of which 56,891  licences had been verified while 184,750 were pending with the National  Database and Registration Authority (NADRA) and 272,510 others were  awaiting approval with the relevant deputy commissioners.\n &#8220;These figures show that 595,146 licence-holders have not applied for  verification,&#8221; said the CM, pointing out that the May 19 deadline for  verification had passed.\n A CM House spokesperson said that, in the wake of this decision, a  circular will be issued to arms dealers, post offices and National Bank  to consider licences verified by NADRA as valid for renewal. &#8220;The  government had already told people to verify their arms licences during  the campaign so all the stakeholders know about it.&#8221; The arms  verification process was initiated in October 2013 on the directives of  the Supreme Court but the deadline was repeatedly extended by the  government.\n\n[url]http://tribune.com.pk/story/893341/arms-verification-sindh-govt-cancels-over-595000-arms-licences/[/url]', ''),

(643655, ' Mian jee, in the modern manual of arms taught in different rifle classes in America, the use of a forward assist is rarely ever considered. Sure it can be used to push a BCG into battery if it is slightly out of battery, but many times on a dirty or well carbon infested gun even that would prove fruitless. Its a good option to have just to say that you have the capability of putting an out of battery BCG into battery. Without it you wouldnt be able to push that BCG that extra micrometer or an inch should you not release the Charging handle correctly or the gun malfunctions. \nOne can do without it easily, even consider it useless weight, but id like to have it on my gun to have that slight capability even if I have not used it till now and also lastly because of asthetics, im a civilian who owns an AR-15 I enjoy the cool factor of the gun as well.

(643812, 'I Made A Legal &amp; Untraceable AR-15 âGhost Gunâ in My OfficeâAnd It Was Easy [QUOTE]\n[SIZE=4][FONT=century gothic]This is my ghost gun. To quote the rifleman&#8217;s creed, there are many like it, however this one is mine. It&#8217;s known as a &#8220;ghost gun&#8221;&#8212;a term popularized by gun control advocates but increasingly adopted by gun lovers too&#8212;because it&#8217;s an untraceable semiautomatic rifle with no serial number, existing beyond law enforcement&#8217;s information and management. And if I really feel an unusually private connection to this deadly, libertarian weapon, it&#8217;s because I made it myself, in a back room of WIRED&#8217;s downtown San Francisco workplace on a cloudy afternoon.[/FONT][/SIZE]\n \n[video=dailymotion;x2skc8f]http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x2skc8f_i-made-an-untraceable-ar-15-ghost-gun-in-my-office-and-it-was-easy-wired_tech[/video] \n\n[SIZE=4][FONT=century gothic]\n  I did this mostly alone. I have nearly no technical understanding of firearms and a Cro-Magnon man&#8217;s mastery of power tools. Still, I made a completely metallic, functional, and accurate AR-15. To be particular, I made the rifle&#8217;s lower receiver; that&#8217;s the body of the gun, the only part that US legislation defines and regulates as a &#8220;firearm.&#8221; All I needed for my completely legal DIY gunsmithing venture was about six hours, a 12-yr&#8211;old&#8217;s understanding of pc software program, an $80 chunk of aluminum, and an almost featureless black 1-cubic-foot desktop milling machine known as the Ghost Gunner.\n The Ghost Gunner is a $1,500 computer-numerical-controlled (CNC) mill sold by Defense Distributed, the gun access advocacy group that gained notoriety in 2012 and 2013 when it started creating 3D-printed gun components and the Liberator, the world&#8217;s first totally 3D printed pistol. While the political controversy surrounding the notion of a deadly plastic weapon that anybody can obtain and print has waxed and waned, Defense Distributed&#8217;s DIY gun-making has advanced from plastic to metallic. Like different CNC mills, the Ghost Gunner uses a digital file to carve objects out of aluminum. With the primary shipments of this sold-out machine starting this spring, the group intends to make it vastly simpler for regular folks to manufacture gun elements out of a material that&#8217;s practically as sturdy as the stuff utilized in industrially manufactured weapons.\n[/FONT][/SIZE]\n[/QUOTE]\n\nRead More & Source: [URL]http://gadgtecs.com/index.php/2015/06/03/i-made-an-untraceable-ar-15-ghost-gun-in-my-office-and-it-was-easy/[/URL]', ''),

I am interested in purchase but before I make final decision I want respected Pakguns member to share their experience with this handgun. I would be obliged if anybody mention its current market price and availability of ammunition. \n\n\n[url=http://postimage.org/image/8fcjdu1w/][img]http://s2.postimage.org/49rEr.jpg[/img][/url]\nFor More Details follow the URL [url]http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_77_pistol[/url]\n[b]Type: Single Action \nCaliber: 7.65x17 Type 64 ball \nWeight unloaded: 500 g \nLength: 148 mm \nBarrel length: 86.5 mm (3.4 in)\nCapacity: 7 rounds[/b]\n\nThe Type 77 pistol is a fairy simple pocket-sized pistol, which fires a marginally effective, low powered 7.65mm Type 64 cartridge, originally developed for the Type 64 silenced pistol. Type 77 pistol is intended as a self-defense weapon for officers of Chinese army (PLA) and police. It has been developed in the late 1970s and was officially adopted circa 1981. Military issue Type 77 pistol shall not be confused with much bigger and much more powerful 9mm NORINCO Type 77B pistol, available commercially and made in China only for export purposes.\n\nType 77 pistol is a blowback weapon, with striker-fired single action firing mechanism. The only unusual feature is a so-called Chylevsky device, made in the form of a separate front (vertical) part of the trigger guard. This device (originally developed by the Swiss designer Chylevsky in the first decade of the XX century) is used to load and cock the weapon by using only one hand. To do so, shooter must pull the front part of the trigger guard by its index finger. As it is connected to the slide, this pull will retract the slide back, and upon the release of the finger, the slide and front part of the trigger guard will return forward, chambering the cartridge and making the gun ready to fire single action. To avoid damage to the index finger, moving part of the trigger guard is automatically locked forward when trigger is pressed. If the gun is to be carried "cocked and locked", it also features a traditional manual safety on the frame, above the left grip panel. Single stack magazine holds 7 rounds of ammunition. magazine release button is located at the bottom of the trigger guard, on the left side of the frame. Bottom of the grip is provided with lanyard ring.[/QUOTE]\n\nDear Saleem Sb\nhope you doing well and happy..\nI need Type 77 Pistol (Norinco) cartridges from where i can buy and price.\nRegards\nOmer\nCont # 03339111999', ''),
