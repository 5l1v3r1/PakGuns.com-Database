I went looking for a Weihrauch HW100 ( which I''ve now found out through my research to be a better gun) but these too we''re sold out.\nFinally, I decided to import an airgun. Importing to Pakistan is a big headache but if one is successful the reward is great - you get to own a gun of your choice. \nI searched and went from BSA to Air Arms to Weihrauch to FX, when one day a new genre of airguns caught my fancy - bull pups !\nBull pups are small but as powerful and accurate as the conventional PCP''s with the same shot count per fill.\nI wanted to share my joy, with all the avid airgunners, of owning a bull pup PCP.

ATF would be for automatic transmission/gearbox only and not for power steering as PS oil is quite different. \nYour suggestion of using a quality ATF makes good sense to use in guns - genuine Honda ATF 1quart costs 1k and that''s plenty to lube many many guns. Mixing oils of different viscosities and weightings, i.e ATF and Mobile 1 or fully synthetic with semi-synthetics or mineral oils, however I wouldn''t recommend as that can cause early degradation of the oil. Castrol GTX 10-30 is also a very good mineral oil and cheaper too (not checked availability in local market however) - it is injected in rotary engines combustion chambers (such as in Mazda RX7 and RX8).', ''),

(589308, 'BSA Ultra Multi Shot I just could no longer resist the itch that I developed a few months back for a PCP. Tried to reason with it by getting a Gamo Shadow CSI which in its catagory is a hell of an air rifle (it really is). But then @sansyed keeps posting the clips of his unbelievable shots. Plus the performance equal to that of a .22lr (or even better) and the No need for a license No problems in carrying it around were good enough reasons to get one. One of my main concerns was the weight as I intend to carry it in the field for birds hunting. Walther Dominator and Diana P1000 were few excellent options but the weight of these kept me away from these. after some thorough research I managed to get my hands on a masterpiece of its catagory the BSA Ultra Multi Shot. BSA has been making rifles for over 100 years and this surely tells of their fine work.\n\nIt weighs around 3Kg which is very comfortable to carry around.\nThe rifle is 100% accurate that means one can get a single hole group at 50 yards. while test firing I was hitting a half inch pipe at about 25 yards while standing.\n10 Rounds Magazine.\nHammer forged free floating match grade barrel.\n2 stage adjustable match trigger.\nMicro movement cocking/decocking system.\nMine has a beech stock and is fitted with AGS 3-9x40mm mil dot AO scope which provides a very crisp view of the target.\nthe thing you notice right after the first shot that it is a very quiet shooter. Its sound is lesser than my Gamo shadow csi.\nAlso got a 3 stage FX pump. The rifle is relatively easy to fill up to 220 bars.\n\nI am thankful to brother sansyed, verve and other friends for their help, support and to motivate me to make the choice which I am certain I wont regret. sansyed often said Life starts with a P and Ends with a P, now I know why he said that.\n\nNeed some good pellets now @sansyed bro  your help will be greatly appreciated :)\n\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]28852[/ATTACH]\n\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]28853[/ATTACH]', ''),

(589322, ' [QUOTE=Verve;427045]1stranger brother, just a slight correction if you don''t mind .. ATF would be for automatic transmission/gearbox only and not for power steering as PS oil is quite different. \r\nYour suggestion of using a quality ATF makes good sense to use in guns - genuine Honda ATF 1quart costs 1k and that''s plenty to lube many many guns. Mixing oils of different viscosities and weightings, i.e ATF and Mobile 1 or fully synthetic with semi-synthetics or mineral oils, however I wouldn''t recommend as that can cause early degradation of the oil. Castrol GTX 10-30 is also a very good mineral oil and cheaper too (not checked availability in local market however) - it is injected in rotary engines combustion chambers (such as in Mazda RX7 and RX8).[/QUOTE]\r\n\r\nWhy I mind brother???\r\n\r\nBrother, actually this is not my recipe, I have read it on PG in a thread memebr Jagga and 12 guage has contributed...\r\nsecondly by ATF I meant Dextron III ATF, which is of broght red colour.  And I dont know that whether it can be used in automatic gears or not but people certainly used it for power steering oil.\r\n\r\nmee too think that mobil oil 10/30 should be synthetic mixed with ATF of good quality.as other oils may not work as required.\r\n\r\nHowever, I still think that for cleaning one should chose a good CLP... atleast NASA... (avaliable un around 200 to 250 Rs.) And can last many cleaning sessions.', ''),

As Castrol GTX is drip fed in the combustion chamber, a small residue of it I doubt will do any harm in a barrel.

(589426, ' Thanks for the responses. That makes things way more clear for me because I have a different definition of long range in my mind. For 600m competitions, my suggestion would be for 308 since it is well known to be a competition cartridge and by nature, it is very accurate caliber. At 600m, you will also have 1050 foot/pound energy left in bullet with 180gr Accoubond which is enough energy for a clean kill for any animal in Pakistan.\n\nYou will also be set for 1000m as well with this 308 for paper shooting but at this distance, you don''t have enough energy to kill clean a halal animal. You may be able to kill a jackal or monkey since they are not big and don''t have tough skin. (no joke here)\n\n338 lapua is an ultimate caliber for long range but in your case and in my opinion, it is not necessary. I don''t know how is the availability of 338 ammo in Pakistan but here there is no problem. I reload for my two lapuas here along with lots of other calibers and once I find my load, I get 3 bullets touching at 300m. All my long ranges firearms are ''zeroed'' at 300m or 330 yards and are topped with Nightforce scopes.', ''),

(589527, ' Thanks Bro Aquarius for your warm welcome and reply.\n\nAs you might have known, hunting is totally prohibited in India, so I just keep these weapons as great family heirloom in good condition and Alhamdulillah I love these weapons.\n\nBoth my rifle and 12 bore gun are very rare to find in India. \n\nI have heard of Westley Richards double trigger gun with someone, but never heard of single selective trigger, it''s patent of Westley Richards.\n\nWhile searching that day, I went to Westley Richards site, new gun with the same configuration like that of mine was around British Pound 47,000.00 - 50,000.00\n\nDouble barrel rifle is mostly used for big game hunting, my great grand father, grand father and father have hunted many tigers by this rifle.\n\nTiger hunting was open through a permit until 1972 in India', ''),

(589529, 'Review : EZ9 Vs Mp 446 Gentlemen !\nI purchased a NIB EZ9 last week along my friend who also purchased NIB Baikal Viking MP 446. We both had different views regarding what to buy or not, in the beginning we both thought about Viking and went to the market to see as we had heard about its reliability, robustness and high magazine capacity , my friend bought  it after 02 days of negotiation for 65.5k from Ali Mohammad & Co , whereas i waited  to arrange the ksss for the purchase, During that time i felt that viking was not for me as i didnt like its look, honestly speaking i find it more like a heavy and strange gun (Not able to find the right word for saying this ) finally bought an EZ9  last week as mentioned in my last post [url]http://www.pakguns.com/showthread.php?9814-The-CZ999-Skorpion-Club/page28[/url].\n\nThen this Thursday me and my friend both brought our guns to the range to test it , we had a 5 round session each\nThe target was set at 25m range , round I started then I fired Ez9 he fired Mp446 , The result are as follows :\n\nRound I\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]28885[/ATTACH]\n02 X rounds hit the target whereas 03 X rounds Missed - MP446\n\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]28886[/ATTACH]\n04 X Rounds hit the target whereas 01 X round Missed - Ez9\n\nRound II\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]28887[/ATTACH]\n01 X round hit the target whereas 04 X rounds missed - Mp 446\n\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]28888[/ATTACH]\n05 X rounds hit the target , No Miss - EZ9\n\nAfter this we fired 10 more rounds directly on the target i could not take the picture of Mp446 as my friend didnt want to take anymore :P due to his poor shooting however i took mine :\n\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]28889[/ATTACH]\n\n:)\n\nAfter this session we took off the targets and went for Rapid fire , firing more than 150 rounds each from both the weapons . Allhumdullilah no FTF/FTE reported in any of the Pistols .\n\nHere i want to add that the trigger of Ez9 was not that much of smooth as compared to Viking , but the recoil was more in Mp446 as compared to Ez9. Another point to highlight here is the round capacity of Viking, 18 rounds in the magazine does feel a lot especially when you r out and the other one is still going :)\n\nPS : During the course of firing on to the target 01 X round FTF in EZ9 , I was unable to determine y that happened, as my friend started making fun of it but after clearing the round from the barrel ,the gun fired smoothly . The rounds fired were POF 1z', ''),

In Sha Allah.\r\n\r\nWell, both are good and quality guns... and I think your friend was new to firearms, otherwise viking mp446 is not a bad target gun. Infaact Baikal company categories it in sporting pistols... so your friend needs a bit of practice and hopefully he fill not miss after doing so.\r\nIn Sha Allah.\r\n\r\nAs regards to EZ9, well, me too feel it more good looking than viking mp446\r\n(and Al Hamdulillah own one) but its a personal preference.. so not a big deal...\r\n\r\nBut its a solid, reliable, durable and accurate too. Further cleaning EZ9 is simple and easy, as disassembling and re assembling it is very easy and comfortable as compare to Viking mp446. IMO.\r\n\r\nWell in mag capacity there has a difference but not big difference,  that is EZ9 has 15 rounds mag and Viking mp446 has 18 rounds mag, so differencr is only of 3 rounds...not much...!\r\n\r\nFTF of one round.... hmmm... that could be due to many reasons, but its a curable issue, clean your gun thoroughly,  lubricate it, hopefully it will not give any issues.

(589609, ' dear cancer_doc, I''ve been looking a lot of new Zastava M57 .30 pistols in the market and particularly on PG, are fake instead of the original Zastava M57. However, they are being ordered from our Pakistani gunmakers/companies or might be G.M. Dossals. Also, some of my PG brothers are still assuming these pistols original Serbian. So after quite a some time and getting various comments/reviews from local gunsmiths/ustads... I eventually decided to inform you fellows that Zastava M57 pistols having M57 TT markings on right slide and ZASTAVA ARMS on left are fake.\n\nSecondly, using a very common sense that the word ''TT'' (Tula Tokarev) has never been seen on Russian neither on any Chinese .30 pistols. Therefore, you may have noticed that the older models Zastava .30, markings ''ZASTAVA SERBIA'' and the right markings ''cal 7.62x25mm M57'' have no such issues nor quality differences.\n\nBest Regards', ''),

If I shoot 3 shots, the 3 bullets are touching with each other, its that accurate. The reason its that accurate is that I RELOAD and to find the perfect load for my TRG42, it took me over 200 shots. Even though I reload, each shot is about $3 so in other words it costs me about $600 to just find the load. My longest HIT shot with it is at 1435 yards so far. Its -38C here today and once the weather is nicer in few months, I will shoot it again at a mile or longer. If I use factory ammo in same gun, I get 3 inches group at 300 meters. Same gun, different bullets make a lot of difference..\n\nNow coming back to your question, I think that you are better off with 308 because I think you can try different ammo and see which one is most accurate in your 308.

However, they are being ordered  from our Pakistani gunmakers/companies or might be G.M. Dossals. Also,  some of my PG brothers are still assuming these pistols original  Serbian. So after quite a some time and getting various comments/reviews  from local gunsmiths/ustads... I eventually decided to inform you  fellows that Zastava M57 pistols having M57 TT markings on right slide  and ZASTAVA ARMS on left are fake.\n\nSecondly, using a very common sense that the word ''TT'' (Tula Tokarev)  has never been seen on Russian neither on any Chinese .30 pistols.  Therefore, you may have noticed that the older models Zastava .30,  markings ''ZASTAVA SERBIA'' and the right markings ''cal 7.62x25mm M57''  have no such issues nor quality differences.\n\nBest Regards[/QUOTE]\n\n[B]@Leon, where are your views?[/B]', ''),

They are: hardness (Rockwell scale rating), hardenability, strength, ductility, toughness, initial sharpness, edge retention, corrosion resistance, wear resistance, and manufacturability. \nI have little interest in fixed blades and swords, and since I live in a city, my use for them is even less. With the type of pocket knives and collecting I am into, we speak mostly of hardness, initial sharpness, edge retention, corrosion resistance, and strength.

Mostly smaller blades are made from singe solid pieces or billets and shaped by means of grinding, whereas in swords which are to be used for combat the metal is folded and hammered and than grinded.

(590333, 'Transporting Firearms to Pakistan from the United States ? [FONT=arial]I am a Dual National of Pakistan and I''m taking a trip to Pakistan on an American passport in 7 days and I plan to take 2 firearms with me (shotgun &, rifle). I''m staying in Pakistan for one month and I plan to visit some ranges while I''m there and then take my firearms back with me. The only official Pakistani form of identification I have is a NICOP which identifies me as a dual national-- I''m not sure how relevant that is to this discussion, but I''m stating it in case you know something that I don''t. I''m traveling from JFK in NYC to Allama Iqbal Airport in LHE. I''m flying Etihad Airlines which, naturally, has a layover in Abu Dhabi. I have all the American paperwork for the firearms which were purchased in the United States. I have a firearms ID in the state of NJ in the United States (which is basically like a driver''s license for guns). The State of NJ does not issue permits for shotguns or rifles, they make you go through an online federal background check; they only require permits to purchase handguns. I have contacted JFK Airport as well as the State Police in NJ and NY to confirm the proper procedure for transporting firearms from my home in NJ to the airport. Pretty simple. I have to drive DIRECTLY (no stops) to the airport from home. Once at JFK, proceed IMMEDIATELY (no stops) to the terminal to check in baggage. Also, NY Port Authority Police have made it very clear to me: I''m not allowed to have [B]possession[/B] of a handgun in nyc, so I''m leaving that at home. At this point, per Airline regulations and per regulations at JFK airport, I must check my firearms with the Airlines staff as unloaded, separate from ammunition, and locked in proper case, etc. etc. (you can refer to Etihad Airlines website as well as TSA website for more details on this part). This must be done with TSA (security at JFK airport) observing and verifying to such. I have already met with Etihad Airlines staff at their office in NYC. They handed me a form to fill out for each firearm (wherein I detail the make, model, etc of the firearm, reason for transport, a copy of my passport (photo page), a copy of my firearms license, plus more). This form must be scanned and emailed to Abu Dhabi International Airport Security Department with a copy of the email forwarded to the Airlines (as the staff member at the NYC office explained to me). I asked for the number for the Abu Dhabi Airport Security Department to which the staff member refused. I was able to get that number by an airline call center employee who unwittingly handed it to me! I called Abu Dhabi Airport Security and they were not amused by my call since it was unexpected (their number isn''t supposed to be handed out). Nonetheless, they politely answered my question on how to avoid being arrested at Abu Dhabi International Airport with fireams in my luggage. The staff member at the Security department explained that I only need to fill out the forms as was explained to me by the Etihad NYC office and that my baggage would not need to be rechecked at the Abu Dhabi airport, even if I entered Abu Dhabi during my layover (as I intend to do; I''ll be visiting the Corniche and Shaykh Abu Zeyd Mosque if you''re wondering why). My forms are filled and have been emailed. I''m on the last leg of this painstakingly researched Journey. I would like to know what my best option is to LEGALLY enter & exit Allama Iqbal International Airport with both of my firearms and to transport within Pakistan from my wife''s residence to the gun range. During the course of my research, I could only find ''hearsay'' and what amounted to unsubstantiated information that is hard to verify. Since I originally posted this on another website, I only have 1 update which is that I can''t take my handgun with me, per NYC law: I don''t have a handgun permit in NYC, only in NJ, so it''s illegal in NYC for me to have even possession of a handgun. Secondly, over the course of the last two weeks: the embassy of Pakistan in D.C. and the consulate in NY has been of very little use. Back and forth calling, being put on hold on the line for over an hour only to be transferred to another department has taken up all my free time outside of work and school. They know NOTHING! I''m going to make an attempt to make some calls overseas. I''m not sure where or whom to start calling. Perhaps the Defense Ministry? Customs? Border Protection? I''ll try to figure it out and make calls when I can. Can anyone provide me with reliable AND verifiable information on what procedure I need to follow? Contact information for the proper channels would be highly appreciated. I''ll try to state this in the most nicest way: please, please refrain from one-sentence replies or from replying without referencing some source that I can double-check. If I do find out the proper procedure on my own, I will be sure to report it back. Insha''allah, that''ll be very helpful to others in my situation. P.S> I have been recording all of my calls and conversations with the different authorities mentioned above, so if anyone else in my situation ever needs some clear evidences before they follow the same procedure, I would not mind sharing.

If you ever care to read, please try reading statistics about how much hunters benefit an ecological system and also the regulating bodies and also how ecological systems work. Hunters (people that hunt within the law) are the eyes and ears for the regulating bodies and provide valuable insights and information to them. e.g. we have a disease called Chronic Wasting Disease spreading among deer species in some areas, we submit the heads from our hunts for testing and management of disease. I recently received an email to take part in a survey if I had hunted in specific areas, that was to learn more about a species of wolf in that area.

Human stupidity and greed has no bounds, if a species was hunted (read poached) to extinction that was wrong and unethical and immoral.

Also there is no requirement for psychological evaluation of would be gun owners in Canada generally (there might be in a special case, but I am unaware of even that), so you made that up as well.

(590440, ' [QUOTE=Verve;426415]Glad you are all safe.\n\nWe had plenty of such visitors in our home in Kuala Lumpur in addition to a few resident iguanas and lots of obnoxious monkeys!!! House was in the middle of a forest with a fair bit of land. Lizards were common living space invaders but had 1 rattle snake and 1 black cobra grace us. Rattle snake was spotted by our cat Tom, who ran out of that room like he''d been scared s''less, which gave us the indication something was in the room next to my room. I, 14 or 15 then, walked in the room to find the rattling sound .... ''mommmmm .... snaaaaaake ....'' close door, and ran to call Juma Waan (our hard core Indonesian gardener). This guy was fearless ... arrived with a long stick he had for catching snakes and in 5 minutes the rattle was bagged. Second time was the cobra coiled up outside parents room, mid-afternoon. Mom was snoozing and when she woke she called the maid to remove the ''rassi'' from the front of the room. Baffled maid walked to the corridor only to scream ''sapppp baaji'' ... again the gardener to rescue. Both times living snakes were handed over to pest control govt agency - they killed the rattle snake but took the cobra away live, don''t know why ...\n\nOne thing Juma Waan told us was to avoid killing the snake inside the house as where one kills the snake the others are likely to visit. On the single lane road to the house from the main road, every other week a snake of some kind would fall victim to the car tyres. After the rattle snake incident and watching the agency people smash it''s head, we started driving slow to avoid wrecklessly killing these creatures. \n\nWould recommend you get a garbage picking stick, modify the length and picker face, or order a snake catcher stick.[/QUOTE]\n\n@ VERVE, very interesting story.

(590628, ' I am having an exact same issue with me, my friend. I have agricultural land and I want to convert it into a business.\n\nBro first thing to keep in mind is that 1stranger is correct about bank interest. It''s haram. No matter how big is the profit, it''s like eating poo.\n\nI wouldn''t advise you to invest in property because that gives you profit after a long time. At least 2-3 years. And I understand you need to invest in a business which gives you monthly income at least. It also looks like you don''t have any business experience and like me, none of your family or close friends are in business.\n\nFriend, I will advise you to invest in cattle farming. I think you have around 10 million money with you. With this, you can set up an excellent cattle farm with all the modern technologies. The milk gives you daily return, you can use the animal''s dung in a bio-gas plant for free gas and electricity, and the animals breed and increase for free, which is an added bonus. But it will take a lot of careful planning and an experienced management to run the cattle farm. You can''t do it alone from the start.\n\nNext is my friend that you go and visit China and see if you can become an importer/exporter. It is incredibly simple and easy. Only you need to select the right products for export and import. For this, you will need to first travel to china and make a broad survey of their market and prices. Then see what things are in demand here. With God''s grace and careful planning, you can make more than 100% profit per year. But for the first two three times, you will need to visit china with someone who is already an exporter/importer. Try your friends and family contacts. You will hopefully find a contact. I am myself planning my first visit in June.\n\nAnd of course you can make a carwash pump with a fuel station too. I won''t advise a fuel station in the start as it takes some 5 million nvestment only for the pump machinery. The price of land will be other than that. Carwash you can easily set up with upto 700k, including all the machinery expenses and land price. I have set one up myself in just around 150k, but the land was my friend''s so it''s price isn''t included. It gives a good little money every week for an lol and small personal expenses. I think 4-5 carwash stations in suitable locations can easily give you more than 1k for your daily expenses. Don''t try a carwash as your main business though.\n\n in the end it all comes to experience. Don''t invest in ANYTHING unless you get an understanding of how that business works. However, if you have any relative or friend already in a business which is going successful, if you can trust them, put your investment with them and be their business partner. It''s the safest way (if they are really honest and doing good business, that is).', ''),

Any accessories that should be bought for the care and maintenance of the gun?\n4. I''d like a Conceal Carry license/permit. What would be the procedure to procure license in Karachi?\n5.

(590688, ' Something usefull i read on BSA website and would like to share.\n\nWhen deciding on which calibre to use there are many factors to consider. A .177 pellet travels at a greater velocity than the heavier .22 when fired from guns of identical power, but this does not mean that .177 is more powerful. For example;\n\n.177 pellet weighing 8.4 grains, fired at 802 fps (244mps) = 12 foot pounds of kinetic energy.\n.22 pellet weighing 16 grains, fired at 581 fps (177mps) = 12 foot pounds of kinetic energy.\n\nThe lighter .177 pellet has a flatter trajectory which means that when aiming less hold over is required than with a .22 over normal airgun ranges. The benefit of this is that targets are easier to hit with a .177 even if there are slight inaccuracies in range estimation; this is why .177 is the calibre of choice in Field Target and paper target disciplines.\n\nIn countries with laws limiting airgun power, .177 is gaining popularity for hunting, as their flatter trajectory is seen as an advantage over .22. Where .22 scores over .177, is in their retention of down-range energy.\n\nAt the UK power level of 12ft/lbs the difference is fairly small, but as the power increases, the trajectory of both calibres flattens out so reducing the advantage that .177 would have over .22 at lower velocity. However, when a pellet approaches the speed of sound (which is about 1100 feet per second), it can become unstable, resulting in poor accuracy. This problem is almost exclusively confined to .177. The .22 really comes into its own as the velocity increases, when it&#8217;s heavier weight means that the pellets retain greatly superior down range-energy, and do not suffer from the loss of accuracy that can affect high velocity .177 pellets.\n\nDo not confuse velocity with power, they are not the same. Velocity is simply a measure of speed; power as measured in foot pounds or joules, is a measure of kinetic or striking energy, which takes into account the weight of the pellet as well as its speed.', ''),

If you ever care to read, please try reading statistics about how much hunters benefit an ecological system and also the regulating bodies and also how ecological systems work. Hunters (people that hunt within the law) are the eyes and ears for the regulating bodies and provide valuable insights and information to them. e.g. we have a disease called Chronic Wasting Disease spreading among deer species in some areas, we submit the heads from our hunts for testing and management of disease. I recently received an email to take part in a survey if I had hunted in specific areas, that was to learn more about a species of wolf in that area. Man has been hunting since his existence, farming and crops came later on. Human stupidity and greed has no bounds, if a species was hunted (read poached) to extinction that was wrong and unethical and immoral. As a paradigm if a guy commits a crime with a gun, is banning guns from the country your solution, if not then you have double standards and unfortunately that makes you a hypocrite. Also there is no requirement for psychological evaluation of would be gun owners in Canada generally (there might be in a special case, but I am unaware of even that), so you made that up as well. And I am sure that since you have a low opinion of our psychiatrists, they probably are contemplating suicide out of shame as I type this message.

I am laying my supporting hand (palm open) under the forearm around 3" away from the trigger guard (the natural balance point on my gun) and very lightly wrapping my firing hand around the pistol grip. The index finger not touching anywhere on the stock but the trigger and the thumb lined up just behind the receiver. A light cheek weld and the stock end just touching the shoulder. \n\nI can now shoot consistently at approx 25 yards hitting the bottom of thin coke tin cans and also took out bottle caps yesterday. Tried my hand at a longer distance as well and managed to hit a med size tin can [formula milk :) ] placed approx 52 yards away. I was using H&N FTT''s & Gamo pro magnums and amazed to see that the gun could hit at this distance without any mil dot compensation.\n\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]29192[/ATTACH]\n\nI know many bros may not find above very impressive but I am glad that I am improving my shooting skills and gradually learning how to tame the beast.....\n\nA very big thanks to you and other PG bros for their words of advice.\n\nRgds', ''),

Performance wise they both are the same, i cleaned my two air rifles with it and it works perfect and a very handy tool for all kind of rifles, air rifles, shot guns and hand guns. The only difference between this and Otis is that this one is universal means for all type of guns and in Otis i had to buy separately for hand guns, also there is a price difference of about $15 -$20 between this and Otis. This one is slightly expensive but worth it and they both are military grade cleaning kits and are very handy and reliable Because before this i bought another kit from UK which was the cleaning rods one but was a complete piece of rubbish especially its rods were very cheap and they got bent when i use them 2nd time while i was cleaning my Brno. 22 thats why i wanted to go for a pull through kit but which should be reliable and I''m glad this one din''t let me down and it cleaned my air rifles like crisp...so I''m quite happy with it.\r\n[QUOTE=musk;428688]Congratulations for nice purchase[/QUOTE]\r\nThanx Musk Bro :)\r\n\r\n[QUOTE=hmd;428696][QUOTE=Ahtsham Raja;428591]Real Avid''s universal pull through cleaning kit with a nice case...\r\nCongrats bro on your purchase .[/QUOTE]\r\nThanx hmd Brother :)', ''),

(590881, ' Thank you all for your compliments.\n\nHonestly I am still a novice when it comes to air rifle maintenance / tuning. The Chinese AG and the Diana are from my high school days. You will be surprised to learn that both of these guns have never been opened. I just make sure they are used gently and never dropped to hurt accuracy / finish. The finish on the West German Diana is just incredible. The bluing on the barrel and receiver still looks like it came out of box and stock is made of very fine wood. My 11 year old son now shoots it and these guns are truly pieces that you can pass on to generations. \n\nI just make sure that every time I use these guns, I wipe them with a good gun oil leaving no finger prints behind which also result in rusting since skin has natural oils that can the mar finish of metallic surfaces over long use. The Chinese gun also gets an occasional wipe of WD-40 followed by oiling. A drop on the moving parts like the barrel hinge / cocking arm keeps the sweaking away. Only recently, I cleaned the inside of the barrels using alcohol swabs and fishing line as suggested by a dear PG bro. Screws are tightened after every 3~4 shooting sessions. That''s just it. If you want to learn more, just google or visit youtube and you will find loads of info that can help to make these guns more accurate and durable. I am yet to find a synthetic oil from Lahore which can be used to lube the main springs so just add a drop or two of regular gun oil on the spring but this is very rare as too much of it can cause dieseling which can damage a powerful magnum springer. Never pour oil in the barrel or the air port / chamber as this can damage the piston seals. That''s just about it.\n\nAs for performance, I have never chronied these guns but I have a good guess that power has remained fairly consistent throughout the years. I am not a sharp shooter and just love to plink with my guns. Can hit small tins at 25 yards and that''s good enough for me :) \n\nAm using the Hatsan these days and going thru the learning curve of taming this beast. If held properly (artillery hold), it is accurate and way too powerful as u may have read about it.\n\nThanks', ''),

This one is slightly expensive but worth it and they both are military grade cleaning kits and are very handy and reliable Because before this i bought another kit from UK which was the cleaning rods one but was a complete piece of rubbish especially its rods were very cheap and they got bent when i use them 2nd time while i was cleaning my Brno. 22 thats why i wanted to go for a pull through kit but which should be reliable and I''m glad this one din''t let me down and it cleaned my air rifles like crisp...so I''m quite happy with it.[/QUOTE]\n\n\nBrother thanks for a detailed reply...\nHowever few questions need your reply... :)\n\n1.

No matter what you call it, interest is interest and disallowed.\n\nI would repeat, Faixan friend, that you should first make up a mind whether you want to invest in a sales business or a services business. Sales business includes all types of merchandising, reselling, dealership, shops and that sort. Services include all business where you charge money for your services e.g hotel, carwash, tourism company and all that.\n\nConsidering you don''t actually have any first hand experience of any business so far, I would advise you to first join take up a job in the business you are interested in. Work there for at least six months and get the experience and understanding of it. Only then you can start up a business like that.\n\nDepending on where you live, what type of corporate contacts you have, how much money you want to invest and how do you want to set up your business, I would again say that china export/import, cattle farming, poultry farming and food business are some of the safest investments in our country.\n\nBtw if you''re interested in import/export, we can make a joint trip to kashgar this coming july and see how things work on the other side of the himalayas.', ''),

But, shots/slugs can do unacceptable damage to the home you are defending.  Indoors flash and noise can be deafening and disorienting for the defender.

Finally, you cannot answer every door-bell with a shotgun in hand, plainly visible.   \nLike a rifle, shotgun also needs use of two hands.  You may be needing one hand to open/close doors, gather family etc.\nFor HD the only way to go is a handgun.

Yes Bro it is 100% air safe, i''ll copy here the description of the seller provided as well which states that also.\n2. Bro i haven''t tried Real Avid''s Rods one but i can imagine it would be very good like this and my preference is always with a rods cleaning kit the reason I''ve chosen this pull through kit was ike i said before that because the one i bought last time was completely rubbish especially its rods were useless and simply trashwhich was this one\n [ATTACH=CONFIG]29285[/ATTACH] \nthat''s why this time i wanted to go for a nice pull through kit secondly a friend of mine recommended me this one.\n3. Bro Real Avid uses Brass and Aluminium both types for its connectors and brushes, also they have some kits with the plastic connectors aswell but i don''t think going for a kit with the plastic connectors is a good option.\n4. My preference is still the rods kit because with the rods especially for the big bore rifles cleaning of lead in the barrel can be done very easily because they can be moved both forward and backward very easily and rapidly with the cleaning brushes on but although pull through kits can be used both ways aswell but because they are pull through and not stiff like rods so they can not be moved in the barrel very fast like rods one can so i still prefer the kit with the rods even though i have bought a very good pull through kit.\n5.

(591254, ' the scope upon fitting to the gun, revealed some major drawbacks. the scope is too long and once the single piece mount is attached to the rifle, the front end of the scope , exceeds the breech and leaves very little margin for positioning. in my case i  have only 1 mm clearance for the barell break point and this is also achieved after removing the front plastic cover off the front end.\n\nthe second more serious drawback is that the scope isnt centred in its case from factory. this is a new scope and once i determined its centre by the mirror method, I found that it was exceedingly deflected. so using the windage and elevation adjustment knobs, I centred the scope in its case. Upon fitting to the gun and zeroing ,I discovered that I had already exhausted the windage adjustment. This as you gentlemen might understand, is a serious flaw. In my effort to achieve zeroing by rotating the windage adjustment knob, I seem to have damaged the knob,s adjustment mechanism, as the knob now rotates freely without any clicks.\n\nso all in all , I am left with a huge scope which right now is a little better than total trash.\n\nGuess that cant be classified as a pleasant experience.Am considering going to the seller and discussing my misery with him. lets see whats in store for me.', ''),

(591265, ' Well, please don''t mind but most of the errors have been on your part! You should always match your airgun''s dimensions with that of the scope so as to avoid these commonly made mistakes. 1 very common thing ppl tend to overlook the most is the size of objective lens and height of the mount in relation to length of the receiver. For a biiger objective lens you need a higher mount. For your use a 4-16x40 or a 3-9x40 scope would do better. I personally have this scope and its quite big, and its NOT one of my favorite scope. \n\nSecondly, most of these under 150$ scopes do not come optically centered and its not really a big deal once you know how to optically center your scopes.\n\nThirdly, you need to be very careful with the windage & elevation knobs esp when the clicks start to feel mushy, STOP tight there. This means that the adjustments are almost fully done and have no room for more clicks. If the windage and elevation adjustments run out, simply reverse and re-fit your mounts and the problem generally goes away. There''s mostly a problem with improper mounting when this sort of an issue arises. \n\nMy email ID is there in my PG profile, send me your no I MAY have a way out.', ''),

As for pricing, once cannot compare the price of this weapon with foreign weapons (esp Chinese) as there is a thing call ''economy of scale'' which basically means that that if a factory is producing 10,000 units of a pistol and another is producing only 1,000 units of the same , the price of the units from the smaller factory would be higher. \nI think 33k is VERY reasonable. It seems like the toolings were obtained under license of some sort by POF.\nAs for the barrel. This is not a Darra made weapon. The barrel would meet and exceed army and international standards. We must remember that the same factory produces barrels for our machine guns, assault rifles and even for heavy weapons.

But, shots/slugs can do unacceptable damage to the home you are defending.  Indoors flash and noise can be deafening and disorienting for the defender.   Also, unwieldy, longish weapon which may be snatched by attacker in confined spaces.   Finally, you cannot answer every door-bell with a shotgun in hand, plainly visible.   \nLike a rifle, shotgun also needs use of two hands.  You may be needing one hand to open/close doors, gather family etc.\nFor HD the only way to go is a handgun.  One may super-carry a handgun when moving within home.\nI know, this goes against conventional wisdom,  nevertheless some HD consultants are now advocating handguns over shotguns.\nAll above is from the internet sources, I am converted.[/QUOTE]\n\n+1... very well summarized.\n\nthese are the reasons I''ve put away my shottie cleaned & lubed in it''s case under the bed :)\n\nThe house is now covered by 4 strategically placed handguns where only my wife and I can reach.', ''),

(591743, 'Local Or Imported? Salam friends.\r\n\r\nI went to sargodha the other day and before returning, went to an arms production facility. They had a stock of both, their own made guns and imported ones.\r\n\r\nThe imported ones started from 50 and the local ones were starting at 10. I picked up both of them in my hand and did not feel any difference in the weight, weight orientation, metalwork etc. I told him I''m new to guns and what would be his advice for me. He said ''bhai ji hamaray liay to jo bhi sale ho, munafa hi hai. ap nay mashwara manga hai to mera mashwara hai ap hamari factory ka mall bay fiker ho ker lay jao. aik sal ki warranty hai. kabhi koi masla karay to hum zimadar. a ker raddi main phenk jana or apnay pesay lay jana. agay bhai ji apki apni marzi hai''\r\n\r\nHe also made a long speech about how the imported guns required a lot of care, oiling and performed flawlessly only with certain type of ammo while (according to him) the one they made was a hardy breed and performed flawlessly with all ammo types and in the dusty conditions of our neighborhood. He restated the one year warranty thing again too.\r\n\r\nAs you might have guessed, I know nothing about guns (I shot 7 cartridges at sitting doves with number 8 cartridge, the other day and even a feather didn''t fall :( ).\r\n\r\nI can spend upto 60k for a quality handgun, but frankly, I''m not a person to care for a sleek handgun like my girl. I could disassemble and oil it once every decade, and that''s all about it. And it will be used excessively too (need to get my aim straightened and my hand used to shooting).\r\n\r\nIn the light of all this (and considering I will smash an erratic gun on my head if it malfunctions -ftf/e-  during action), which handgun do the experts deem for me?

However if you use sub standard or low quality ammo, then any gun of the world may cause problems...!\n\n3. Well, like all valubale items guns also need care but not daily or weekly... after 1st out of box cleaning,  one should clean the gun after every session/usage. . And then remains no need for cleaning till next session or usage. However, if gun is not used regulary, then seniors advise lubricating the gun every month or so.. even if its not used...!\nBut even if one delays cleaning and lubricating gun for some time, there will not be any immediate serious damage to the gun, but over the period it may tend to catch rust, or start miss fire/failure to feed etc...!\n\n4. Well metal can be damaged by rust or water, and its a univeral phenomenon. Guns can also suffer that problem, but there are good rust prevention liquids and cleaners/oils easily available in market, whih can minimize the problem. Also if you are so worried about rust etc... then go for a polymer hangun....there are some very good quality polyner handguns. Polymers are basically a tyoe of plastic, which mean no chance of rust.... on frame etc... but barrel and some other parts still needed to be taken care of and cleaned and oiled periodically. ..!\n\nIts my understanding, seniors may guide you well.', ''),

Both locals & imported. \r\n\r\nI mean were they .22 .32 9mm or .30. Were they their own hybrid designs or clones of actual imported products. \r\n\r\nWhich imported guns did U see. Hand guns I assume revolvers or pistols again which calibre. which design which model. Did u see berretas and their copies glocks and their copies. tauruses and their copies. again which models. Polymer offierings or alloys or full steel.. COmpacts, sub compacts or full sized.. \r\n\r\nA few pics would definitely help. \r\n\r\nLastly if U dont clean it u may as well not buy it. Every thing requires care. be it a gf a car or a weapon. If U are going to use it for home def. then it is imperative that it works when U want it to. For that U will need to take care of it. \r\n\r\nMy humble suggestion. If U don''t want to take the responsibility of taking care of a fire arm. I strongly suggest sticking to the blow gun.[/QUOTE]\r\n\r\nAll of them (local and imported ones) were .30 size. No idea about their model. There was a beretta. Couldn''t recognise any others. No revolvers. All semi autos. (Though he said some of the locals could operate at full auto too, which was a new awakening for me). Didn''t ask if the locals were clones of overseas models or not. By their shape, I would think they were copies of some gun of the same shape (grooves in the body at several places, western design and sleek shapes, very much resembling the handguns you would expect to see in hollywood movies).\r\n\r\nThe guy claimed they were the originals. No idea if he was making me his mother''s brother or not with that as all I know about guns, can fit on one side of a matchbox. Will take pics next time I visit the place.\r\n\r\nI guess yes, I would rather prefer keeping the gun in my brother''s room as he is more caring and attentive about machinery. Blowguns are definitely more fun when it comes to killing vermin like crows, snakes and rats. The only thing is, if you shoot a human vermin (aka a burglar) with a broadhead dart, he will die after 2 hours due to critical injury and infection in the jugular region. This isn''t much fun, considering you want that two-legged vermin to die sooner than that, and that too, BEFORE he kills you and all your family, smokes a cigarette, yell around in pain and runs around, trying to figure out why is the world getting blurrier every moment.', ''),

(592242, 'Discovery trigger [ATTACH=CONFIG]29432[/ATTACH]\n\nDiscovery has a very simple trigger. Many modifications are available to lighten its heavy factory trigger pull.\n\nI did it by replacing two springs in there.\n\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]29431[/ATTACH]\n\nSpring 1 contributes to 1st stage pull. I replaced it by equal length of ball pen spring.\nSpring 2 elevates and helps in engaging the sear. I replaced it by a spring, I made from a strong but thinner steel wire. It contributes to 2nd stage pull. Now 2nd stage is lighter and smooth.\nThis is a potentially dangerous mod. If push on sear is too light, rifle may fire without pulling the trigger with a bump. I was careful not to make it too light. and after the mod, I cocked and bumped it in every possible direction till my hand started aching, no fire, still I take care to keep the barrel in a safe direction when loaded.', ''),

In this way when both screws are tight they squeeze the barrel and cylinder together, and the front sight touches the cylinder cap ( could it affect accuracy?). \nTo keep the barrel and cylinder parallel, yet tightly clamped. I shimmed below the barrel and above the cylinder using piece of thin but tough x-ray film.

It would have been a real surprise to see it first hand that day but unfortunately I couldn''t. \n\nA very good choice of rifle for your specific needs & purpose. Lightweight, quick & easy fill-up, pretty accurate with decent number of shots per fill. A classic elegance.\n\nOn top of a good choice of platform, you have done a magnificent job on stock & trigger. Honestly speaking, more than seeing it perform, I''m more interested in spending lots of time in your guidance to finally start making the type of stocks I wish to have on the guns I shoot.\n\nDo we need to remove the cylinder to fill or its the fixed type? It probably must be fixed type as there''s a clamp. In this case, tightening clamp should not stress barrel or cylinder from its free float alignment.\n\nYou are right with the barrel shimming...as its not free floating, once the measurements of the gap between barrel & cylinder are noted (without fixing clamps) while the barrel floats freely...according adjustments can be made.', ''),

One is obvious it is fixed at the breech. 2nd is at barrel band which is about midway between breech and muzzle ends. In factory settings it slightly squeezes barrel and cylinder together, and front sight slightly touches the cylinder cap. Purpose of shimming was to reduce that squeeze. Now front sight stays free of cylinder end cap by about 1mm.\n\nThere are many many imperfections in this stock. Many questions are to be answered, which we will discuss in next meeting. In fact its me who is to learn so so many things from your experience and expertise in making any such stock in future.\nThanks', ''),

At this point I stopped and Backed out the screw by 1/8th of a circle.till the point at which cocking just takes place. Then screw is further backed out for 3/4th of a complete twist. At this point 2nd stage travel is appreciably short. Tightening the screw will decrease the 2nd stage travel (making it more unsafe). Backing it out will increase the 2nd stage travel (making it less unsafe).\nThen cocked the gun and usual thumps and bumps to check the safety profile of this ILLEGAL mod.It seems safe, but obviously I will be careful. This is a real dangerous mod. If done too much, gun will fire without notice. \nAny how, 2nd stage is shortened and very crisp now. Checked it in the field today.

So basically, regardless of the law, now matter how badly it is interpreted, their directive under section 144 has to be taken in the right spirit (minus the entire letter) and consider it as a legal ban on carrying licensed weapons. It defies logic. In the days of the Raj, we were all treated as criminals and anti state, barring the few ghaddars and chamchas. That is why their laws and interpretations were as such. But even after independence, you are treated the same. In spite of the law and order situation, you are banned from carrying your licensed weapons. If you had freedom to defend yourself, criminals would not dare approach you with intent of crime. In my opinion, just a government directive allowing people to carry their licensed weapons for self defence will result in significant drop in crime rate. But then, it is just my opinion.

NR called them and was offered 25k for an NPB pistol lic and 35 or 38k for the .223/.222 lic+permit. \n\nAt the shop they were more circumspect. They showed me a Peshawar arms company''s tt very well packaged with a letter from the U.S BATF (Bareu of alcohol, tobacco & firearms) which was a permission to allow the weapon to be imported to the U.S. The TT was very well made and nicely finished and its final price was 15k \n\nAs far as I know since 1986 the U.S does not allow import of any pistols without some sort of safety device which is why Badar and Brothers had to put a manual safety on their TT 33 export model. In fact thats one of the basis of the BATF inspection. To see if the weapoon has the manual safety or not. \n\nHe said he will give good rates on imported weapons and sold Chinese red box for 36 a pop.

Advance 40 and reminder to be paid after weapon is delivered to Karachi from Peshwar.

NR was kind enough to come over and pick me up (sorry for making U wait buddy) \n\n\n\nAfter doing the rest of the survey, we went to Mega where a very bored looking Daniyal brightened up visibly when he saw us. He must have been like really really happy since instead of his usual I-have-sold-noting-all-week he actually told us that business has been brisk. \nHe showed us a Turkish shotgun, very light with front optic sight and back rifle sights and a â&#8364;&#732;3â&#8364;&#8482; inch chamber. 7+1 asking 44k and was willing to give it away for 41k. This led me to realize that there is flexibility in his prices. \n\nHe also expressed a desire to visit the range with us next Sunday. He also has an excellent verity of FMJ ammo including a few brands and types I have never seen before. Fiocchi lead nosed slugs (Italian), All steel Lugers (German) Tula (wolf) Russian. Around 65 a pop or so. \n\n[B]Note:[/B]\n\nHe had a Zastava M57TT. Asking price 38k Now if one were to go online and go though various pictures of the Zastava â&#8364;&#732;TTâ&#8364;&#8482;, one will see that The term TTâ is not used by most gun manufacturers of the weapon. Pakistani gunsmiths do put TT on their Tok clones though. \n\nThe Zastava company makes a tok clone called M57 not M57TT. Which leads me to understand that the myriad problems associated with the M57 TT here in Pakistan may well be due to the fact that they are not M57 pistols but rather local TeeTee pistols. Again, the finishing on the weapon available here is not as good as the weapons pics that I have seen online. \n\nWhen I told Daniyal what I think He yelped that he has gotten them from Tahir & brothers one of the biggest whole sellers around. Be that as it may..

(592812, ' [QUOTE=1stranger;430251]ED brother, cannot speak before your vast knowledge and experience in this field... :tape:\n\nHowever Brother, if a gun''s barrel has 10K claimed life, and then it will starts giving larger groups, then obviously a gun having barrel life of 50k or more will give that larger groups after 5 times the amount of a gun having 10K life... Isn''t it simple..?\n\nAlso, in my humble view (which you may differ from), barrel is the most important part of a gun, and if that is worn out/damaged, then the gun becomes useless... No matter what is the condition of other parts, like springs, firing pin etc.\n\nSo, I think barrel life should be given preference in considering a gun (if one is buying for longer period of time), because others parts like springs, firing pins etc can be arranged locally but [COLOR="#FF0000"]a barrel is almost impossible to replace[/COLOR] if damaged or worn out! (except with clone barrels).\n\nRegards brother[/QUOTE]\n\n\nNo sir, I am just a learner. Thats all. Lots of info but not enough shooting experience.  10,000x 36= 360,000 \n\nMost people simply wont shoot 3.6lac worth of ammo in a single weapon. Similarly, I seriously doubt any one will put 1.8 million rupees worth of ammo though his gun. (50kx36)\n\nAgain if I have that kind of money I would buy umm lots and lots of PB  goodies. \n\nThe only weapon I know that had gone though thousands and thousands of rounds was the range gun at the ASCC Gun club. It was rented at Rs 500 per session. \n\nIt was a CZ 999 Scorpion. While the barrel life ensured that it was accurate. It had long sense lost its mechanical reliability and had to be manually charged for every round. \n\nU see 1st stranger, the barrel life is a very clever gimmick used by gun companies to sell their wares. They know that almost no1 will go though the barrel life so they argue about that one thing as a criterion for durability. Not a word in promotional literature about firing pins, springs and such like. \n\nThe Chinese simply give a few extra springs and stuff that they know will break in the long run as part of the package. Which is another reason I like their stuff.  They acknowledge a problem that others simply pretend does not exist.', ''),

SP01 in fact copied some of the mechanism used in the BHP, such as the short recoil system, especially how the barrel and slide lock together! \n\nTrue Dr Zakir, i have noticed BHP is not so common here, but the CZ range somewhat is. Perhaps karachi will have a greater variety? \n\nHi Aquarius - thats a very interesting point and thanks for raising it - i thought the same as well but discovered that the BHP actually can fire +P rounds. The use of hotter than the standard ammunition used does in fact accelerate wear and tear but it does not make the BHP explode or break on firing.

(593101, 'BRNO Hybrid .308. Review and Zeroing Report I always wished to have a bolt action hunting rifle chambered in  308/7.62x51 being a round of my choice as this round possess better  ballistics qualities. But the prices of bolt action rifles chambered  in  7.62x51/308 are  insanely high in this part of world.  Some friends  came up with the suggestion of re-barreling a rifle in to 308. The idea  seemed workable  but since a 308 round generates an enormous chamber  pressure thus it was a genuine matter of concern to select a rifle and  design to withstand the gigantic pressure of 308 round . Finally , with  the help and advice of a very knowledgeable friend , located overseas ,  having a practical experience of gunsmithing , the design of mauser 98  and caliber of 7x57 was chosen. \n\nI had 2 rifles in 7x57 , a parker hale and a BRNO ZKK600, I  always love  BRNOs and  selected the BRNO for rebarreling, though my friend opined  that the bolt of a Parker Hale is nearer to the original mauser 98 bolt  design. The integrated dovetail to mount scope was another plus in  BRNO  so I proceeded with it. My friend also gave a nod and told me that the  action of ZKK 600 was the standard action that BRNO used in many  calibers including 30-06.\n\n[COLOR=#000080][B]THE BARREL[/B][/COLOR]\n\nThe barrel of 308/7.62x51 was hardest thing  to come by. Another friend  told me availability of machine gun barrels, coming from Afghanistan  (presumably supplied by NATO to Afghan Government Army who sale them  subsequently) in the area bordering with Afghanistan. The area was  extremely volatile and unstable, yet my craze for the gun drove me  there. I remained there for several days and heard something horrible  every day. Once a friend came to see me and on his return , his car was snatched just minutes after he left the place i was staying. Those circumstances were horrifying  but finally I got the job done and the task of re-barreling  was accomplished. Here is the result \n\n[IMG]http://i1270.photobucket.com/albums/jj613/zainulabdeen/oldpic1.jpg[/IMG]\n\n[IMG]http://i1270.photobucket.com/albums/jj613/zainulabdeen/oldpic3.jpg[/IMG]', ''),

(593103, ' The people live in a primitive style here. Houses made from Mud. No electricity for days even weeks is a routine matter. The mobile coverage is the recent blessing of modern times but they are charged on batteries and money is charged on mobile charging. the village I went to zero the gun is situated at a buffer zone between civilization and stone age style of life  as the dirt tracks end here and rough mountain tracks lead to rest of human dwellings situated  deep down in the mountains . The distance is measured in nights on camel back. I had visited the caves those contain very old pictures made by their pre-historic residents. These caves of Stone Age human dwellings are located at the distance of two nights on camel back.  \nThe modern life articles ( which are no more modern for all of any more) are a scare commodity here . Such scarcity so intense that there was not a proper table to be used as a rest. but I am  used  to it now and have adapted to use our cradle to grave companion, “the Cot” as a rest. This cot is very multi-dimensional tool. It is used as Chair,   as a sofa, as a resting chair, as a table , as a dining table  ,as a bed , as a hospital sick bed and yes, as a rest to zero a gun too. After one has breathed his last, his body is taken to grave on a cot also. [B][B][COLOR="DarkSlateBlue"]Ashes to ashes , dust to dust .[/COLOR][/B][/B] You may say that we are born and taken to be  buried on a cot. \n\nDue to lack of recreational facilities , everything that is done in a village is collective event and is  watched upon with open eyes and dropped jaws  keenly. Not only this but  the event is talked about for days , weeks and months. If something extra-ordinary happens, it survives through  the generation as an anecdote  and every narrator adds the spices of his choice .  so one has to be very careful in doing anything in any such like event if he does not want to be funny character of local folk lore :o . \nI was well aware of the tradition and did not get bothered when a mob of all aged\nvillagers gathered around me when I started the process of zeroing my gun.\n\n[IMG]http://i1270.photobucket.com/albums/jj613/zainulabdeen/z5.jpg[/IMG]\n[IMG]http://i1270.photobucket.com/albums/jj613/zainulabdeen/z6.jpg[/IMG]\n\nIt is obvious that when I cannot get a table and chair to be used as a rest so there is no question of availability of paper targets and stands to hold them.

It turned in to dust. second stone was put and was hit it as well. Then I put 5 stones and loaded 5 bullets in a row and started to hit one by one. 4were hit out of 5and missed only one. There were some stones which puffed away like s smoke or powder but there were some stone stubborn enough just to bounce away having a scar of P.O.I only.\n\n Here is one.  \n[IMG]http://i1270.photobucket.com/albums/jj613/zainulabdeen/z41.jpg[/IMG]\n\nThe stone puffed away by bullet impacts.

So I took the rifle , loaded a 7.62x51 round in it , put the gun on the roof of my vehicle and aimed . At the very same moment, the bird I was aiming at, started to feed. It was moving randomly and was very hard to shoot . I kept waiting in that posture for nearly 6 to 8 minutes and finally the bird started to move in straight line of my fire . I aimed at his “dead centre chest “and fired. I saw , in scope the bird blowing up with the power of bullet and turned to its side.

This is not the case in Pakistan. Very few gun owners have access to NRA shooting club, if there is one. I believe there is NRA as well as Provincial RAs but they are not allowed to own and operate their clubs.

(593777, ' REDUCING SEAR DRAG AND LENGTH OF 2nd STAGE.\n\nThe basic trigger design on discovery has its problems. one is sear drag, if you squeeze the trigger slowly, final sear (2nd sear) goes down slowly, and causes drag on hammer. Leading to inconsistent velocities and reduced accuracy.\n\nThis can be corrected by shifting the axis of rotational movement of 1st sear. For this purpose you have to make a hole in first sear, 0.25 inches backward from the original hole for the pin. Similarly spaced Hole is already there in trigger housing so no need for new hole there. With original sear middle hole is used for pin, New sear uses last  (backward) hole for the pin.\n\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]29681[/ATTACH]\n\nInstead of drilling new hole in original sear, I made a new sear. I did not want to change the original sear in any way.  \nThis new sear is of same thickness ans similar shape, but has hole in new location. All was done to check the idea if it works or not.\n\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]29682[/ATTACH]\n\nAs you can understand from the pics, the rotational axis of second sear is changed. now its longer axis moves more and fast, causing final sear to drop more rapidly and this reduces the sear drag and length of 2nd stage.', ''),

(May ALLAH SWT fobid that) in this case, one needs some precautions. .. as there can be a chance of follow up..\n\nso as we don''t know exactly about this, so one should try to prepare for worst too..\n\nIn marking, there can be numerous possibilities,  dependent on various factors... your routine, recent history, social status and any change in it in near past, enemities. .  etc etc...\n\nNow what?\n\nYou know your situation better and can better figure out some possibilities... however my two cents would be to\n\n1.

(594183, ' [QUOTE=AMP11692;432026]Today outside Khattak super store at around 4pm, I was going back to my double parked car, i noticed 2 people near the hood of my car, one on bike and one standing, both in white kameez shalwar. Looking suspicious, i was already weary but since ive never been through an experience like this i was trying to dismiss it as me being paranoid. As soon as i was almost at my car door i pressed the unlock button remotely, As soon as he heard the beeping, the the standing guy lifted up his kameez, instinct somehow kicked in and i ran backwards whilst keeping my eye on the guy, i done a lot of reverse jogging so it wasnt awkward for me to do so. By the time he had the TT pulled out completely i was more than 5-6 metres away and some cars between us. He saw i was out of reach and going farther, he chambered a round or atleast pulled the slide and pointed it at me, perhaps to make me stop or come back. but i was almost inside the store and peering out. The man, having attracted a lot of attention, got back on his bike and went. A few people came inside to ask me what happened. I told them and they told me not to leave right now incase theyre waiting for me on corner. I called up a friend and waited. Took him 10 mins, during that time I was so paranoid, i was thinking every person inside the store has come to rob me. I know it sounds a bit silly but my first such experience after having lived all my life in Karachi.

(594484, 'Smart Guns As a teenager, Omer Kiyani was shot in the face with an unsecured firearm. He still struggles with the trauma. But the Detroit engineer now believes he has created a device that would have saved him and may save thousands of others.\r\n\r\nHe calls it "Identilock," and while it still needs final adjustments to the prototype and further investment, Kiyani expects to launch his smart gun technology in U.S. stores within a year, retailing for around $300.\r\n\r\nThe device attaches to the trigger of a handgun, which can then only be unlocked by biometric authentication, preventing any unauthorized user from firing the weapon. Drawing on breakthroughs in mobile technology, the trigger is released by similar fingerprint sensors to those used in Apple''s iPhone 5S. Those sensors are approved by the FBI, and widely found in security scanners.\r\n\r\n"The key is reliability," says Kiyani. "The sensor has proved itself in different sectors over the past few years and the market is aware of its capability."\r\n\r\nThe gun is enabled in under a second from first contact, and engineers are chipping away to further reduce the time. Eventually, it is hoped the lock will be integrated and the release will be instant.\r\n\r\n"The main point of firearms ownership is home defense, and home defense means quick access," says Kiyani. "But the other side of that is accidents."\r\nhe inventor believes his experience indicates an urgent and avoidable crisis and the statistics support him. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, in 2010, 62 children aged one to 14 were killed in firearm accidents in the United States, and 785 from 1999 to 2010 -- far higher death tolls than school shootings over the same period.\r\n\r\nKiyani is not interested in politics and keeps his vision simple. "I''m a gun victim, a gun owner, and I have children. I came up with something that fits my needs.\r\n\r\n"I was working as a safety engineer for airbag calibration, and it didn''t make sense that there was something so simple that had such an impact on safety, but not for guns. In essence, this is a product of that question."\r\n\r\nSurge of innovation\r\n\r\nEven if all goes to plan, Kiyani''s will not be the first smart gun system to hit the U.S. market. In February, German firm Armatix launched its iP1 pistol that uses a radio frequency identification (RFID) chip activated by the owner''s watch, and the competition is growing.\r\n\r\nDirectives from the White House to promote development of safety technology in the wake of school shootings have led to a surge of innovation. There is now an increased appetite and funding for a field that had stalled since the earlier designs in the 1970s. The boldest statement is an open challenge from The Smart Tech Foundation. It was created by Silicon Valley angel investor Ron Conway and serial entrepreneur Jim Pitkow in response to the Sandy Hook shootings and is making $1 million in prizes available for development of the best ideas.\r\nThe Foundation claims to have received over 200 entrants after the first month of the submission period, everything from concept stage to working prototype. Designs include electronic ammunition, remote controls and RFID chips buried in the owner''s skin.\r\n\r\nResearchers at the New Jersey Institute of Technology (NJIT) have been developing biometric designs since 1999. The leader of that program, Donald Sebastian, has seen many false dawns but is more confident than ever.\r\n\r\n"The difference now to a decade ago is that there are more types of technology and they are all much better. Biometric technology failed one time out of four then, now we aim for one in 10,000 failure rates", says Sebastian. "The reliability of the safety needs to exceed that of the underlying firing mechanism, so there is never a discussion that the gun wouldn''t work because of the technology."\r\n\r\n''Production ready''\r\n\r\nSebastian''s view is borne out by 2013 research into gun safety technology from the National Institute of Justice (NIJ). The report tested reliability in a range of RFID and biometric designs against existing firearms, and gave several ratings of "Advanced Prototype or Production-Ready." "It is only recently that viable product designs have reached a commercializable or production-ready level of maturity," the report stated.\r\n\r\nNJIT remains at the vanguard, working with "Dynamic Grip Recognition," perhaps the most ambitious system in development. The design uses a battery of sensors to build a "movie" of the user, learning the size and weight of their grip, and even their tics and manner with the gun to be sure of authorizing the correct user.\r\n\r\nwant to read the rest then click on this link [url]http://edition.cnn.com/2014/03/26/tech/innovation/smart-guns-know-whos-firing/index.html?hpt=hp_c5[/url]', ''),

(594529, ' So if I am getting this right? A gun that is programmed to "work" only by the "authorised" person. Biometric authentication and finger prints recognition devices installed on a handgun? Well I don''t know if this is the best measure to avoid accidents or worse. I am not willing to jump into some debate here, just giving my 2-bit opinion.\n\nNormal safety precautions is the way to go for gun owners. You can always keep guns away from kids "that''s why we have locked drawers and cabinets" and certain available gun locks. You can also have a word with the family on "why they cannot access these firearms". \n\nA safety device installed is not going to help you avoid accidents, if you are one of those gentlemen who some how mange to shoot themselves or somebody else while cleaning the firearm or something. This is not going to help.\n\nOne million is nothing, even a billion dollar idea will not prevent a massacre if the "person involved" is willing to do it at the cost of his/her life. I fail to see any connection or approach that may help in this regard. \n\nYou cannot control the flow of guns (legal/illegal) neither in USA nor in Pakistan. There will always be criminals who would die to kill others and Innocent gun handlers who will shoot themselves or others unwillingly. No body can make certain and actual hold on above two situations.\n\nWhat you actually need is responsible and sensible gun owner who understands and believes "Normal Safety Precautions" while handling a firearms. Now that gun owner is what society needs because he/she will not only be able to protect their family but others too. He/she will also teach their kids about "handling firearms the right way". \n\nCould such safety measures work? Yes why not, but would this make a significant change? Hell No. This sounds pathetic already "Smart Guns", No guns are smart, only "People" are who operate them in responsible manners.

Never (as in NEVER EVER) try using improvised explosives.\n\nSadly you won''t get factory prepared, graded explosives/propellents in pakistan (unless someone in your friends is a taliban. but in that case you would have no need for refilling spent casings as you''d have boxes full of ammo in your home).\n\nFor preparing fine grained, uniformly burning gunpowder in your home, you will need:\nproper lab equipment.\na professional chemist.\na fast vehicle (if a hospital is nearby, all the better).\nloads of first aid and life saving meds.\na bigger load of your mom''s prayers.\n\nBut if you (like me and my friend yasir aka ''choochi'' for his skinny build) decide to be a senseless fool and go on about it with market-purchased chemicals and your grandma''s mortar, first make sure that:\n\nyou don''t care about losing your eye(s), limb(s) or your life.\nyou don''t have little kids.\nyou have written your will (there are a couple lawyers on board who can help you with that)\nyou don''t love your life, your parents, your wife/girl, your neighbor''s wife/daughter, your boss''s wife/daughter, your best friend''s younger sister, your kids, dog, horse, guns or country. if you love any of these, don''t do it.\nif you actually don''t love your life, your parents, your wife your kids, dog, horse, guns and your country, then there are major chances that you are suicidal. in that case, search google for "painless suicide methods". dying in an explosive''s untimely explosion accident is neither easy nor beautiful.[/QUOTE]\n\nYour rather...humorous discription is entertaining, but i dont see it as dangerous as you make it out to be.\nIts rather common in westeren countries, as most range-hermits reload.\nthe usual process is something like\n1.)buy bullets and gunpowder and factory ammo ( lots of it)\n2.)go shoot all your factory ammo\n3.)collect empty casings\n4.)put more gunpowder in and the bullet, (based on manufacturers spec or your own formula)\n5.) fire away.\n\na single cartrage can go through about 2-3 firings in a semi auto action, and 4-5 in a bolt (because the cartrage is supported on all sides by the bolt, it does not deform as much.\n\nNow for most 9mm, .45 acp etc rounds this isent a biggie, but if you move up to rifle rounds thats where the real savings happen.', ''),

(594649, ' [QUOTE=Enigmatic Desires;432524]I gather Sand that U have had pretty unpleasant experience (to say the least) \n\nCare to share?[/QUOTE]\n\nYes sir. But it wasn''t one greatly unpleasant accident/incident. There were lots of moderately unpleasant accidents leading to injury, burns, property destruction and a bad social image.\n\nI will post the details tonight in the Off Topic section.', ''),
(594650, ' Yes Matapapa bro, you are right.\n\nRefilling of the casings might not be a very dangerous process, but you must remember that you need fine grained gunpowder for your refilling with the proper percentages of CSK (carbon, sulphur, potassium nitrate) as the ones used by the manufacturer of the bullets. And as I stated earlier, you cannot legally buy gunpowder from the market.\n\nFor preparing fine quality gunpowder at home, you would require impurity-free sulphur and saltpeter/pot nit. Carbon you can collect easily with burning wood into charcoal. But this isn''t all. You will also need to crush them (all three ingredients) very finely into powder. Ask me, I have done. And I tell you that and it is NOT easy. Not that it is dangerous (if you grind them all separately and slowly, there is no risk), but it takes a LONG time and a LOT OF POWER for grinding potassium nitrate (aka saltpeter) into powder form. Then you have to mix them thoroughly. Now this IS a dangerous process. If you mix them roughly while they are all dry, you risk a very bad explosion (or the mixture would just combust and burn away, wasting all your effort). You better dampen them all before mixing (the factories also dampen them before mixing together). After thoroughly mixing them together (for which you would require electric shakers), you would have to compress it. And I don''t mean compress it with your hand or with a brick. You would REALLY need to compress it using hydraulic presses. After that, you would get a sort of paste (called gunpowder cake). Dry it up and break it into fine pieces. And in case you have to prepare guncotton, you better be ready for some graduated/labelled beakers, concentrated nitric acid and some other stuff. Warning: nitric acid isn''t only dangerous when it touches your skin, its fumes/vapours are also deadly and corrode the lung tissues much faster than cigarettes/smoke. I won''t go into details of preparing guncotton here.\n\nNow comes the filling part. Now I am no expert (not even a regular user) of guns or ammo, but I think you will have quite a few things to fix up, here too. First, a spent bullet casing would have a firing pin mark on its base (where the firing pin hits the bullet). This part will be slightly pushed inside, depending on the strength of the firing pin spring. This means that (at least theoretically) a refilled bullet will require a stronger hit from the firing pin than a new bullet. I am not sure about this as I have never done it, but experts can tell you if it''s true.\n\nThe next part is the bullet head. Where do you expect to find the bullet head? You can''t actually shoot your rifle, then travel 2 miles and search for the bullet head. Plus, even if you find it, it will be deformed and not fit for use. You will need a *new* bullet head each time unless you have a metalwork workshop at home to modify it.\n\nThen how are you going to seal the bullet? Factory bullets are sealed properly to prevent the contents from leaking or rolling about inside. How are you going to seal a gunpowder filled case at home? You cannot expect to do it with a hammer and a prayer.\n\nAnd in the end, if you read the info on the internet, you will learn that the refilled bullets have different and unexpected rage and their accuracy is a big question mark.\n\nAll in all, you will not only require a supply of proper propellent, but also the necessary tools for the process. I agree that in the west (specially America) shooters do that commonly. That''s because you can get almost anything freely and openly in America. And then again, the people refill their bullet casings do it with all the proper tools for the process. You cannot expect to find all that stuff around here, bro.', ''),

But that would mean my previous example of simply scaling up the bullet would be correct as the ratio of the gunpowder/mass is the same for the different sizes and they travel the same distance.\n\nSo my answer is , the one that i passed over before without thinking about it....just that more gunpowder is added. \nwhat do you guys think of ^', ''),

Because mortars and artillary are cool and underrated by people, all they care about is sniper rifles and rocket launchers.\n\nwhen it comes to reloading in foreign places, its much easier than what you describe.( i was hoping it would be something similar here)\nbullets (no cartridges,just lead ) are made by manufacturers and sold by the 100s and there is also equipment to cast your own lead bullets. gunpowder can be obtained in packed form by the Kg and crimping machines are available to fix bullet to cartridge.\nBut if i have to go through the hell that you describe..im not so sure. and also, the old formula = sulfur saltpeter and charcoal is for black powder, cant use it in a modern semi or anything like that as it will destroy /clog etc the insides.

(594706, ' [QUOTE=Sand;432560]Bro preparing gunpowder at home is possible (you can even call it easy) but preparing BULLET PROPELLANT QUALITY powder is very very hard.\n\nYou can sure prepare homemade bullets but their efficiency would be in deficiency. You won''t even be sure it would fire or not. When we made gunpowder crackers, we would get a very wide range of explosions although we thought we had prepared the same way.\n\nNow when you are preparing just a fire cracker, it''s acceptable if you get a louder or a lesser crack or if it misses altogethes. But I don''t think such variations would be acceptable for bullets which are to be shot in expensive guns. It could get jammed and damage your gun. You could overfill it and it could blow up your barrel. And in the worse chances, you could get physical injury.\n\nThat''s why I said it isn''t a good idea unless you have all the equipment and you know in detail how gun firing mechanism works (I have no idea about that).[/QUOTE]\n\nWell i am making a makeshift open mortar, any mistakes in gunpowder mix will be tolerated. \nBut as i said before, after reading this i wont try and reload ammo, modren guns are designed with smokeless powders whereas black powder would clog it up and destroy it.', ''),

But I have had many adventures with gunpowder and explosives in general, so I can advise you on this.\n\nBro, the first rule of working with gunpowder (or guncotton, if they employ that for bullets, as its iv is much greater than gunpowder) is to actually NOT work with them unless it''s necessary and there is no choice, or you don''t have enough brains. In my case it was the second.\n\nSecond rule about filling spent casings is to never (as in NEVER) use anything except for factory prepared, graded explosives with proper indication of sulphur, carbon and saltpeter percentages (or in the case of guncotton, the percentage of nitro cellulose in the product). Never (as in NEVER EVER) try using improvised explosives.\n\nSadly you won''t get factory prepared, graded explosives/propellents in pakistan (unless someone in your friends is a taliban. but in that case you would have no need for refilling spent casings as you''d have boxes full of ammo in your home).\n\nFor preparing fine grained, uniformly burning gunpowder in your home, you will need:\nproper lab equipment.\na professional chemist.\na fast vehicle (if a hospital is nearby, all the better).\nloads of first aid and life saving meds.\na bigger load of your mom''s prayers.\n\nBut if you (like me and my friend yasir aka ''choochi'' for his skinny build) decide to be a senseless fool and go on about it with market-purchased chemicals and your grandma''s mortar, first make sure that:\n\nyou don''t care about losing your eye(s), limb(s) or your life.\nyou don''t have little kids.\nyou have written your will (there are a couple lawyers on board who can help you with that)\nyou don''t love your life, your parents, your wife/girl, your neighbor''s wife/daughter, your boss''s wife/daughter, your best friend''s younger sister, your kids, dog, horse, guns or country. if you love any of these, don''t do it.\nif you actually don''t love your life, your parents, your wife/girl, your neighbor''s wife/daughter, your boss''s wife/daughter, your best friend''s younger sister, your kids, dog, horse, guns and your country, then there are major chances that you are suicidal. in that case, search google for "painless suicide methods". dying in an explosive''s untimely explosion accident is neither easy nor beautiful.[/quote]', ''),

If you start asking around it will only result in confusing you more and more and more.\n\nGuns (and particularly handguns) have a strange and very personal appeal about them, what might be awesome for one person might be trash for another. If i was to answer your query, I''d suggest you go for other options for half the price or completely different looking guns like the Steyr or S&W etc. \n\nI reiterate that since you have your heart set on it, then get it and use it safely; learn the proper handling, practice and care for it and you''ll never need another replacement for years to come.\n\nAs for the price, yes it is very normal for a gun worth 500-1000 dollars to be sold here for 3-4 times the price.\n\nExactly how much this particular gun SHOULD cost in our market, quite a few people will be able to help you out with that :)\n\ngood luck!', ''),

And this is the knowledge which every caretaker of orchard possess.\n\nThe problem is that few of us behaving like experts which they are not.\n\nSo, please take it easy and relax.[/QUOTE]\n\nGuys, i started this thread to talk about RELOADING\n\nLeon here has got the right idea. Cool down, everyone.\nI also second Sand, that you cannot make a bomb with gunpowder.\nif you could make a bomb with gunpowder, we wouldent be using it in guns, as it would blow it all apart. It is classified as a "low explosive" as it deflagates or burns at subsonic speed, so a controlled ejection/displacement of the bullet can go on. if it was high then long barrels wouldent make sense as the gunpowder will go boom and stop pushing the bullet even when it is not out of the barrel.\n\nHe is talking about nothing more then a few stories of his life. \n\n@1stranger\nwhat he said is not non Islamic in any way at all. infact, i would go as far to call it Islamic as he is warning us all not to play with is so that our repos, ourselves and our families (which may be hurt directly/indirectly from gunpowder play) will not be harmed.Actually humor is one of the best ways to get humans to memorize something,ask any psychologist.If you read that piece that Sand wrote seriously, or you read it humorously the warning written in it is perfectly clear.    I understand this sounds .....offensive but i would advise you to go and read over the entire thread a few times, conduct a brief analysis of what he is saying, and come back and reply. Your opinion on what he said will probably do a 180 at that point.The reaction of armornear is what you should be experiencing.\n\n@Nisar\nYouve got the right idea. Sand, whatever your experiences may be, try to avoid sharing specific explosive info. \n\n@K203\nThis isent vulgar at all. Just a story of sands early days. if you dont like it dont read it.Its not like (i dident get the chance to read his story b/f it was removed) he is sharing specific info on how to make things go boom.\nthe simple black powder recipie is so old and weak its practically useless as a area of effect weapon. You could make something 10x powerful with a propane canister.\n\n Both ED and Leon are correct, everyone needs to take a step back and relax.\n\nAbout the stories..im always interested to hear them.\nif you could email me the story...as you promised Surg.Ray\nhere is my address. ( [EMAIL="ch2shahid@gmail.com"]ch2shahid@gmail.com[/EMAIL]) Be sure to leave out the formulas and stuff, but any mistakes in handling the material...emphasize them please. Even if i will be using Acetone peroxide as my homemade mortar propellant, i would like to...live to tell the tale.\n\n\nNow, back to reloading. the machinery one can improvise, lead bullets one can cast, but gunpowder is hard. would the pakgunners here agree that the effort is not worth the reward in pakistan?\n\nif this place turns into a house for argument, i will go and ask the mods to lock it. as long as no specific bomb making info is shared, all is well.', ''),

A .22lr is far superior in terms of 3 times more power, 45fpe for the Hatsan vs 150fpe for .22lr resulting in better range and usable on larger animals. But then you don''t need a license for an airgun and you can shoot it in your house also, pellets are cheap, you just need air to fire them so no expense in that area.\n\nbut filling a PCP with a stirrup pump is strenuous and recommended only for fit people or people with servants easily available..............\n\nI say get all three, each one has a niche....................', ''),

(595120, ' Sand bro, 50m to 100m shooting/hunting with pcp can teach you everything you need to know about shooting a rifle for 400m upwards dead accurate shots. No licence etc is a real added advantage as you''ve already stated.\n\nAs you said you are physically fit so a good pump will not be an issue in refilling. My Walther has 300+ bar cylinder so that can take a few goes (in order to not overheat the pump) to fill from 100bar to 300bar and the BSA Ultra MS takes one go to top up to 200bar. Walther gives around 80 shots from 300bar to 100bar, and BSA about 40 shots to next refill. That''s plenty to get me by at least. I don''t consider myself to be fit, per se, anymore but this is ok for me and not a back and deal breaker.\n\nI do however strongly recommend getting a factory spec regulated pcp or one that has been prepared/modified by an experienced pcp gunsmith. Hatsen seems good but fiddling with aftermarket regulators, disassembling a brand new rifle etc is why I didn''t opt for it. You may want to take it all apart and DIY and if you like that then well and good getting an unregulated pcp. I personally prefer to wait and get the package that is ready to just zero and enjoy shooting with a consistent pellet velocity to improve the shooting skills.\n\nWhatever you choose, happy and safe shooting.', ''),
(595121, ' Some answers, rest I''m sure others will happily provide ...\n\nYou don''t need to take apart the pcp for cleaning. A fishing line, lint free cloth patches (cut to size) and hoppes 9 solvent is all you''ll need to clean the barrel after 200 or so shots. Unless you plan rough use for it, there shouldn''t be a need to disassemble the rifle at all. High powered clean air should be sufficient. And store in a dry place, just as one would any gun and ammo, to avoid rusting. Get moisture absorbing silica gel sachet as added rust prevention measure. \n\nI carry my pcp on the backseat on the car with it in a cover when I need to. These look like real guns to majority so it would be common sense not to have it on open display. Just to give you an example, would you think it be wise to walk around with a pcp near Parliament or 111 Brigade? There''s no ban but common sense should prevail.', ''),

(595276, ' Got some relief from work after a hectic week and went for an outing and to village on this Sunday morning . Here are few clicks for you fellas . \nThe summer has already started. We are braced to endure the hot and harsh sun for next 7 months (April inclusive) to come .  Yes, the heat actually diminishes here, in November. \n The start of summer indicates the commencement of construction season. The long yet hot days suit the builders as they get extra sun light to get their construction finished early. The working hours are terminated and a break of couple of hours is allowed to labor in peak hot hours in extremely hot months of May , June , July and August as it is simply beyond the human ability to work in such scorching heat. The reduced working hours also contribute to economic miseries of this region.\nThe construction season needs construction material and like most of things that is too, prepared manually, by using primitive methods. In our region, mostly the bricks are used as primary or basic unit in construction perhaps due to climatic reasons .The use of bricks could be traced back to the pre-historic metropolis of Moen Jo Daro , the capital of ancient Indus Civilization . There are millions of baked bricks used in its construction .The quality of such bricks is so  superb that if any of those 5000 years old brick is hit , a ringing sound emits and certifies its quality \n\nThe earth is mixed with water to make  mud . It is done with spade manually \n\n[IMG]http://i1270.photobucket.com/albums/jj613/zainulabdeen/1-3.jpg[/IMG] \n\nThe mud is than mixed with rice /paddy husk \n\n[IMG]http://i1270.photobucket.com/albums/jj613/zainulabdeen/2-3.jpg[/IMG] \n\nAfter that the mud bricks are made by putting the mud into frame manually . And they are left to get dry under the sun \n\n[IMG]http://i1270.photobucket.com/albums/jj613/zainulabdeen/3-3.jpg[/IMG]\n\nThe sides of sun baked bricks are turned to dry them completely . those who can not afford to by baked bricks , construct their homes with these sun baked/ dried bricks \n[IMG]http://i1270.photobucket.com/albums/jj613/zainulabdeen/4-1.jpg[/IMG]', ''),

The paddy husk has a vital importance and is a \nprimary heat source for the brick clans \n\n[IMG]http://i1270.photobucket.com/albums/jj613/zainulabdeen/6-2.jpg[/IMG]\n\n The reasons  paddy husk is so important for brick clan are multiple. The husk is cheaper than wood , \nplus its ability to burn constantly even if it rains . The wood , on other hand hand , gets wet and extinguishes\nAn other ability of husk is its ability to provide a constant level of  heat /temperature .The hsk is burned and its ash \nis flown away by winds and it exposes the half baked bricks to elements . It is not goood for the remaining bricks\nso they are subsequently covered with ash again manually. This is a hot ash , some time even burns the worker critically\nSome scenes of workers covering the half baked bricks.

(595398, ' No brother I am not offended at all\n\n I just asked out of curiosity and it makes sense people who are used to encounter snakes frequently are less bothered about them but I tell you one thing our Gatekeeper an elderly person may be 65 ( who also lives in our servant quarter ) had a huge experience of killing snakes and according to him when this society was not even built there were fields and forest like situation and snakes and things like that was a matter of daily sight ( 3 decades back ). \n\nNow new societies are building fields converted to societies but still these things can be seen once a while but no frequent encounters ofcourse.\n\nPoint I want to tell is that we have the skilled man with a 50 year experience of killing these snakes and he dont even remember the number of snakes he killed. But he was just useless in this particular scenario. If you see the pictures which I have posted in the intial part of this thread it is very clear that stick was useless because snake was sitting in between and close to one partition of study/computer cupboard ( at the level where you place books / laptop etc. ). Making the free & desired swing of stick out of question.\n\nLater on we showed the scene to our gatekeeper and what he said was that I just did the right thing at right time because if I happened to give that snake a little bit of time it must have disppeared in big house making it almost impossible to trace it giving me sleepless nights.\n\nI am not making it up but I never panicked not only here but in many hard situations of life, instead my brain started working very fast to get the shotguns and finish him before he escapes. \n\nThe reason I had to use 4 shells, I am not trained well with shotguns though a member of LRC but shotguns are not allowed here. Very occasionally I do go to my friends farmhouse who is also an Oncologist and my colleague but you know TIME is becoming short and short I wish from time to time that this 24 hour day for others become a 40 hour luxury time for me and in extra 16 hours I just enjoy the life in my own way shooting, hunting, camping etc. & etc. Life has becaome so much mechanical nowadays.\n\nRegards', ''),
(595399, ' I totally agree about the sticks being useless in the said scenario. And yes it would have very easily hidden in the packed rooms (store rooms tend to be their favourite abodes) and it would not only give sleepless nights but also some tragedy could occur too. Plus, even if the scoundrel was someday killed, your peace of mind would still not return (what if this killed snake was another one and the one that hid still lives? what if it was a female and has already laid eggs somewhere in the house? such thoughts are not only very haunting, they also have the potential to turn out true)\n\nPrevious year a snake crawled in the bedroom of my brother. It was fortunate for us all that the guard dog saw it and began acting abnormally. It took us 6 men''s effort to practically empty the room (putting the furniture out of the room, removing the bedbsheets, turning over the carpet and whatnot else) to finally locate it. And when we did, it was right under the feet of my bare feet bro. Thank God it was located and killed in time.\n\nSo yes, you made THE RIGHT choice eliminating it quickly. I was just thinking maybe you should have used a handgun for it. Using shotgun indoors is very dangerous as the pellets can rebound and hit you (= not good) and you also have a much much greater chance of inflicting property damage (which you so did :p).\n\nAnd then too, one #8cartridge should have put the tale to it''s end.

(595471, 'Testing Trushot as Dr Gilani''s HD Weapon For quite some time, besides his trusted CZ 75 P-01, Dr. Gilani had been on a lookout for another sidearm, with primary purpose of being kept at home for HD. In his quest, I am sure he discussed several options with other members of the forum including myself and thus one fine morning we set off on a mission to look for handguns, particularly an SP-01. I wouldn&#8217;t bore you with the details of what happened during this venture, however on our way back he mentioned that he had had some discussions with Mr. Noor-ud-Din of DSA regarding carrying out some test on their new handgun, 9x19 Trushot. I pointed out to Dr. sb that we should check out this handgun and in my books, if it clears 300 rounds test, it&#8217;s good to go as a budget handgun for HD. The ammo suggested by me was Chinese (Red Box) for the reason that its inexpensive; trustworthy dealers have more probability of having the original Chinese and not the local reloads; they generate more residue and would be an excellent litmus test for any resultant FTF/FTE. The decision was made that Gilani sb would request the concerned at DSA to provide one of their handguns for our test and if cleared, Dr sb would go for it. Now I need to point it out here that we were not exactly planning to do a review of Trushot as such rather the intention was (and for me it still is) that we should check if Trushot can land as a budget gun for Dr Gilani with primary purpose of HD.\n \n[B][U]PG Member&#8217;s in Action:[/U][/B]\nThe day was not far, when Dr Gilani called me and stated that 300+ rounds have been procured and now the ball was in my court to reserve the range. I was utterly unsuccessful in this ONLY task assigned to me and could not do the same. Then came to our rescue Mr. Noor-ud-Din of DSA after Gilani sb presented him the possibility of carrying out this test at DSA&#8217;s facility and hurrah we were back in the game. \nColt1911, Ameer, Ka_Khan and Aquarius sir were informed at the eleventh hour, yes it was literally 11:00 pm, and to our dismay only brother Colt1911 could make it and the rest had to excuse themselves due to their other commitments; well next time, InshAllah. Interestingly, Nazim Sahib and Fraz had already scheduled their plan to come to Peshawar on the very day when we were testing Trushot. I informed them to come to DSA facility for testing the Trushot as it will be an excellent opportunity for them to Ganga-ay-ho-to-nahaty-hi-chalo. lol\n\nSome pictures at the range:\n[URL="http://s1341.photobucket.com/user/Jibz77/media/IMG-20140406-WA0003_zps0b0d2ba5.jpg.html"][IMG]http://i1341.photobucket.com/albums/o744/Jibz77/IMG-20140406-WA0003_zps0b0d2ba5.jpg[/IMG][/URL]\n \n[URL="http://s1341.photobucket.com/user/Jibz77/media/IMG-20140406-WA0004_zpsfb2c8ff5.jpg.html"][IMG]http://i1341.photobucket.com/albums/o744/Jibz77/IMG-20140406-WA0004_zpsfb2c8ff5.jpg[/IMG][/URL]\n\n[URL="http://s1341.photobucket.com/user/Jibz77/media/DSC_0700_zps0ee60ca6.jpg.html"][IMG]http://i1341.photobucket.com/albums/o744/Jibz77/DSC_0700_zps0ee60ca6.jpg[/IMG][/URL]\n\n[URL="http://s1341.photobucket.com/user/Jibz77/media/IMG_0427_zps1a505af7.jpg.html"][IMG]http://i1341.photobucket.com/albums/o744/Jibz77/IMG_0427_zps1a505af7.jpg[/IMG][/URL]\n\n[URL="http://s1341.photobucket.com/user/Jibz77/media/IMG_0426_zpsedc678da.jpg.html"][IMG]http://i1341.photobucket.com/albums/o744/Jibz77/IMG_0426_zpsedc678da.jpg[/IMG][/URL]\n\n\n[B][U]Basic FTE and FTF Test:[/U][/B]\nAt 10:15am we were at DSA and almost a dozen of their support staff was already present at their testing range to extend all possible support to us, for which we are thoroughly grateful to them. Nazim Sb and Fraz joined us somewhere around 10:30am. \nI was the first one to go and in a jiffy 3 mags of 15 rounds each had been fired without a single hiccup; No FTF/FTE. We checked the temperature of the barrel with the laser fitted temperature gauge and it was 83F/ 28C. Within next minute or so I had fired another 3 mags making a total of 90 rounds and checked the temperature yet again using the same device; it was still at 83F/ 28C. \nAfter the first 90 rounds we had a small tea break and soon after that it was Dr sb&#8217;s turn to had his way with the Trushot (I hope this didn&#8217;t come out the way I didn&#8217;t intend it to.. hahhaha). Dr Gilani also shot 3 mags 15 rounds each. Temperature of the barrel was checked and it had soared up to 93F/ 33C. I need to mention it for the record that while firing the 3rd clip, the handgun didn&#8217;t fire its last (15[SUP]th[/SUP]) round. I guess that was because the magazine was not properly tapped while insertion and thus the round didn&#8217;t chamber. The clip was not properly seated in its place and the round didn&#8217;t feed in the chamber with the forward movement of the slide. After a solid tap on the magazine, the slide was racked by Dr sb and the game was on. The temperature of the barrel was checked and was found to be 105F/ 40C. The next two magazines went flawless and interestingly in the 6[SUP]th[/SUP] clip, the 13[SUP]th[/SUP] round didn&#8217;t feed for the same reasons mentioned above. (For every magazine fed firearm, it is a must that the clip is properly seated in its place and thus requires a firm tap for insertion). Each time Dr Gilani gave the magazine a firm tap, the round chambered without any issue. At this stage we had fired 180 rounds. Despite the fact that some of our readers must be thinking that the above mentioned case was of FT-Feed; we are of the opinion that it was a simple case of improper magazine insertion which happens to most of the firearms if the clip is not firmly tapped. Here, we want to emphasize on the fact that the issues faced with the chambering were isolated events faced by only one shooter at the range, and as the rest of the gang didn&#8217;t come across this problem, the issue has nothing to do with the handgun itself.\nFraz, Colt1911 and Nazim Sb were next in line and each one of them fired a total of 2 magazines of 15 rounds each. They all went flawless without any FTF and FTE. We had fired a total of 270 rounds in almost 1.5 hour or so (including tea break and our usual chit chat during several breaks). We were constantly checking the temperatures of the barrel and it was noticed that when we were nearing our 300 rounds mark, it had went up to 121F/49C with 131F/ 55C as its last noted temperature. Dr. Gilani sir fired another 2 mags, reaching the 300 round&#8217;s mark and the gun was still going good. \n\nThe 300 rounds videos are as under:\n\n[B]Fraz: Firing two magazines of 15 rounds each\n[/B][video]http://s1341.photobucket.com/user/Jibz77/media/Trushot 9x19/Fraz-Trushot-300RoundShots-2Mags_zps7aeed21d.mp4.html[/video]\n\n[B]Nazim Sahib: Firing two magazines of 15 rounds each\n[/B][video]http://s1341.photobucket.com/user/Jibz77/media/Trushot 9x19/NazimSb-Trushot-300RoundShots-2Mags_zps186bf653.mp4.html[/video]\n\n[B]Dr Gilani: Firing two magazines of 15 rounds each[/B]\n [video]http://s1341.photobucket.com/user/Jibz77/media/Trushot 9x19/DrGilani-Trushot-300RoundShots-2Mags_zpsc64efeb5.mp4.html[/video]\n\n[B][U]Accuracy Test:[/U][/B]\nIt was decided by the gang that we will test the accuracy of Trushot from 15 meters and then 25 meters but due to shortage of time, we could only test it at 15 meters. Anyways, the primary purpose of the handgun was intended as HD by Dr sb so 15 Meters was a sufficient enough distance for our test. Now, if you ask us for our honest opinion, it produced somewhat satisfactory results, considering all factors. i.e. The target was an A4 size page, we were shooting the handgun for the first time; using Chinese ammo which are not consistent wrt propellant gramage for accuracy testing; the front and rear sights were not fixed and were made of polymer type material and had probably not been zeroed by DSA the way other international manufacturers do; I guess the grouping was pretty good. \n\nThe following video links would give you gentlemen some idea:\n[B]Colt1911: Testing the accuracy of Trushot\n[/B][video]http://s1341.photobucket.com/user/Jibz77/media/Trushot 9x19/Colt1911-Trushot-AccuracyTest_zps95b0b2c7.mp4.html[/video][B]\n\nFraz: Testing the accuracy of Trushot\n[/B][video]http://s1341.photobucket.com/user/Jibz77/media/Trushot 9x19/Fraz-Trushot-AccuracyTest_zps046fb279.mp4.html[/video]\n\n[B]Dr Gilani: Testing the accuracy of Trushot\n[/B][video]http://s1341.photobucket.com/user/Jibz77/media/Trushot 9x19/DrGilani-Trushot-AccuracyTest_zps525c3d56.mp4.html[/video]\n\n[B]Nazim Sb: Testing the accuracy of Trushot\n[/B][video]http://s1341.photobucket.com/user/Jibz77/media/Trushot 9x19/NazimSb-Trushot-AccuracyTest_zps2566b9a5.mp4.html[/video]\n\n[B]Jibz: Testing the accuracy of Trushot\n[/B][video]http://s1341.photobucket.com/user/Jibz77/media/Trushot 9x19/Jibz-Trushot-AccuracyTest_zps26c60fb7.mp4.html[/video]\n \nYou can see that most of the groups generally landed on the 7oclock position. This may mean that a general shooter has a higher probability of landing his shots on a 7oclock position with the current sights of the Trushot.\n \n[B][U]Water Dunking Test[/U][/B]\nDespite lack of our comprehension, why a water dunking test is required for a handgun which Dr sb is considering for HD, Nazim sb was adamant that it is imperative that this test should be carried out. Falling prey to the fear of Nazim Sb&#8217;s gangster looks, each one of us humbly submitted ourselves to the test!!! Oops sorry, it was the handgun actually which underwent the test. \n\nThe result is well described in the following video. \n[video]http://s1341.photobucket.com/user/Jibz77/media/Trushot 9x19/WaterDunkingTest_zps33cc5782.mp4.html[/video]\n\n[B]Part-I:[/B] A 15 round magazine was loaded and with a chambered muzzle, Nazim sb went ahead and dipped the handgun in a water drum for a reasonable duration. He then straight away fired 15 rounds without any issue of FTE or FTF.\n[B]Part-II:[/B] Nazim sb loaded another magazine; chambered a round and re-did the dunking process. Now he had fired only 7 rounds when the pistol stopped making any more bangy sounds. lol\n[B]\nComments on Water Dunking Test[/B]\nYes. The firing pin broke from it&#8217;s rear-end where the hammer strikes. Now here started another debate among ourselves in which we were trying to comprehend the reasons behind breakage of the firing pin. Some of the members were of the opinion that it was the result of rapid temperature changes which resulted in accelerating the stress reversals; and after firing 15 rounds of the first clip for Water Dunking Test, the firing pin broke on the 7[SUP]th[/SUP] round of the second clip. Now my thoughts on the subject are that there is a very insignificant temperature change in the firing pin even if one fires 100 rounds constantly. With [B]insignificant[/B], I mean the type of change which would not subject itself to becoming brittle with temperature change. For becoming brittle, the difference in temperatures (highest and lowest) needs to be quite high. For example, a sudden decline in temperature from 80C to 20C would most probably result in any metal becoming brittle and consequently breaking after being hit with a hammer. However the significantly high temperatures of a hot barrel or slide cannot transmit to the firing pin at the same levels and thus the rise or drop in temperature of a firing pin does not make sense. \nReference to my discussions with Dr. Gilani, he was in agreement with my point of view to the extent that firing pin had exhausted/fatigued due to 400+ rounds but he was also of the opinion that dipping in water and overall changes in whole pistol temperature which was carrying/holding/encasing the firing pin went under accelerated wearing/fatigue/stress. He thinks that if the pistol was not dipped in water then the firing pin would have not at least failed during the 15+7 rounds of the Water Dunking Test and would have fired even more than 550+ rounds. We would highly appreciate the feedback and comments from other members of the forum. If I have to state a reason for the breakage of the firing pin, it is because it was time for it to break. Yes you heard me right; I think the life of the firing pin was 400 rounds and it did so when it reached its threshold. The Water Dunking Test has nothing to do with firing pin breaking. \n \n[B][U]What Worked Well:[/U][/B]\n1.    The gun has controlled recoil and can be easily governed by anyone who has occasional pistol shooting experience. \n2.    No FTF/FTE during the 300+ rounds which we fired. (To be exact we shot 357 rounds with it and we were told that DSA had already tested the same handgun with 48 rounds, making a grand total of 405 rounds).\n3.    It has a comfortable grip which suited all of the shooters present at the range. \n \n \n[B][U]What Didn&#8217;t Work Well:[/U][/B]\n1.    Trushot has a very long trigger rest and if a shooter is trying triple tap or more, it takes like ages for the trigger to reset. (We are sure this issue can be easily addressed by DSA).\n2.    As I was the first one in the gang to give it a go, I felt a very minute creep in the trigger during the second stage but after firing 300+ rounds, it completely vanished and at least I didn&#8217;t feel it at all during the accuracy test. \n3.    The front and rear sights need to be made out of metal as the ones on Trushot is polymer. \n4.    There is almost no space on the sides of the front sight tip once it is aligned with the rear sights. For shooters like me, who utilize this space to align the intended target, it is a big downer. \n5.    [I]In case if the shooter is Dr Gilani sir,[/I] it is a [U]must[/U] that the clip is firmly tapped for its proper seating. DSA is seriously considering entering these instructions in their user Manual of Trushot with special reference to Dr sb; joking. lol \n6.    There was also a particular incident where the slide went forward and chambered a round when Nazim Sb firmly tapped the magazine in its place. Here it important to specify that this didn&#8217;t happen every time, however, to explain the problem to the technical staff of DSA, Nazim sb tapped the clip several times and 4 or 5 times the slide didn&#8217;t go forward without even pressing the slide release. It is something which is not safe and shouldn&#8217;t be happening. DSA needs to look in to this shortcoming which could be due to a week spring of the slide catcher.', ''),

We take our customer satisfaction and product quality extremely seriously. Having mentioned this we would like to request PG members and theirs friends to bare in mind that the DSA Trushot is after all being marketed as a budget 9mm that will perform under the normal use environment. So please be fair in your judgements even if they are critical in nature. \n\nWe are also working on color options, accessory options, grips and personalization options like engraving etc. these options will add to the customization of the Trushot as per your needs for an added cost.\n\nwe will produce videos of the standard drop test and other tests over time.\n\nThe DSA warranty also stands by the DSA TRUSHOT with 18months of after sales service and part replacement in case of a manufacturing defect. Abusive usage is not covered under warranty however there is a lifetime part availability guarantee from DSA. Unfortunately the laws within Pakistan governing firearms do not allow for them to be transported freely, which makes it impossible for our dealers to handle warranties for our customers. Customers are responsible for delivering products under warranty directly to DSA. We cannot change this unless there is a change in government policy for the transport of firearms within Pakistan. \n\nWe see this as the biggest advantage for owning a DSA firearm apart from its obvious price and performance benefit.\n\nGentlemen, once again thank you for your good efforts, we will remain in touch with you and other enthusiastic PG members. please do visit us at www,Facebook.com/daudsonspk and share your stories with your friends and families. \n\n\nSincerely,\n\nDSA', ''),

I would like to point it out that during the tests we were informed that DSA is considering to produce two grades of this handgun. According to them, there will be a first grade Trushot and a not-so-first rather a second grade Trushot. In my opinion, this strategy can be disastrous for this new handgun to establish its footing in our market. How?? Well if the dealers are selling the second grade handguns by providing misinformation to its customers and saying that its first grade, a higher probability of any misfortune with respect to FTE/FTF or God forbid a kaboom will surely tarnish the image of this handgun for sure. We, as responsible gun enthusiasts, there and then suggested to DSA that no such two-grade production should be adopted for the above stated reason. \n\n[QUOTE=DAUDSONSARMOURY;433376]Dear Mr. jibz, Dr. Gilani sb, Mr. Nazim, mr.

(595557, ' [B]1) Inspection.[/B] The  first step in snake control is to find out what kind of snake is  creating a problem if at all possible. Snakes can be identified by doing  some quick online research for photos, or calling your state extension  office. The main focus of this research should be to [B]obtain a basic understanding of the snake''s habits[/B] and *[B]determine whether it is venomous or not[/B]. If snakes are getting inside somehow, inspection should [B]also include a survey of the foundation[/B]  for gaps, cracks, unscreened crawlspace vents, too-wide clearance under  doors or improper sealing around plumbing and utility lines. \n\n[B][I]*Is it Poisonous?[/I] -  Non-poisonous snakes have round eye pupils, while poisonous snakes have  elliptical pupils with an additional pit or opening close to the  nostril.\n[/B][B]\n2) Habitat Modification. [/B]If  you are seeing snakes around your home or property on a regular basis,  it is because conditions are favorable. Any of the following  environmental modifications will aid in snake control by discouraging  them from making their home near yours.\n\n \n[LIST]\n[*]Eliminate tall stands of vegetation. \n[*]Remove piles of lumber, rocks, or other debris that may harbor smaller pests that snakes like to eat. \n[*]Cover up or fill entrances to rodent burrows that may attract snakes. \n[*]Control of rats, mice, and other rodents will result in greater snake control. \n[*]Snake proof fences constructed around a home or garden will keep  most snakes out. If made of fine mesh 24 to 46 inches high and buried  several inches in the ground. \n[/LIST]\n [B]\n3) Exclusion. [/B]When snakes are found inside the  home, there is usually a point of entry that has been overlooked. Snakes  are able to constrict themselves to pass through very small openings.  Search the foundation specifically for any gaps or crevices larger than ¼  inch and up to three feet in grade. Vents in crawlspaces should be  guarded by screens with at mesh no larger than ¼ inch.\n \n[B]4) Live-Trapping. [/B]Snakes that are loose in a  home are often hard to find. One thing that might help to ‘lure'' the  snake in is to place piles of damp towels covered with a dry towel at  different places along walls. The pile should be at least big enough  that a snake could crawl under it and hide itself. This is helpful  because of snakes'' preference for moisture. The piles can then be  checked several times a day. \n\n[B]5) Emergerncy Maneuvers. Sometimes the snake will be on a floor surface. If  so, the best thing to do is to place an object over it like a heavy  blanket. The snake should immediately calm down and will feel secure if  it can not see what is going on outside the blanket. Placing heavy  objects around the edge will prevent the snake from slipping out from  underneath it and going elsewhere. This will buy you some time to get  help.\n\n\n[/B]Or.....\n\nWe can just shoot anything that moves inside the house which could include shooting your toes off over what is probably a non poisonous snake.', ''),

We are grateful to you all for your efforts and first hand feedback. We have full faith in the DSA TRUSHOT and as promised, improvements will become visible on a continual basis. Every successful product follows an evolutionary path and we promise that ours will too! \n\nHowever, your continued support and trust in us is of paramount importance. We take our customer satisfaction and product quality extremely seriously. Having mentioned this we would like to request PG members and theirs friends to bare in mind that the DSA Trushot is after all being marketed as a budget 9mm that will perform under the normal use environment. So please be fair in your judgements even if they are critical in nature. \n\nWe are also working on color options, accessory options, grips and personalization options like engraving etc. these options will add to the customization of the Trushot as per your needs for an added cost.\n\nwe will produce videos of the standard drop test and other tests over time.\n\nThe DSA warranty also stands by the DSA TRUSHOT with 18months of after sales service and part replacement in case of a manufacturing defect. Abusive usage is not covered under warranty however there is a lifetime part availability guarantee from DSA. Unfortunately the laws within Pakistan governing firearms do not allow for them to be transported freely, which makes it impossible for our dealers to handle warranties for our customers. Customers are responsible for delivering products under warranty directly to DSA. We cannot change this unless there is a change in government policy for the transport of firearms within Pakistan. \n\nWe see this as the biggest advantage for owning a DSA firearm apart from its obvious price and performance benefit.\n\nGentlemen, once again thank you for your good efforts, we will remain in touch with you and other enthusiastic PG members. please do visit us at www,Facebook.com/daudsonspk and share your stories with your friends and families. \n\n\nSincerely,\n\nDSA[/QUOTE]\n\nThanks alot for the warm welcome at the DSA facility, most of the members on PG are very supportive for quality local guns and we understand that Daudsons has established a reputation after delivering durable weapons to the consumers. keep up the good work :) and keep the prices down, if u keep prices reasonably down (while maintaining quality) as compared to the imported guns u will find a lot of buyers.....

(595582, ' Thank you kind Sirs for your kind comments.\n\nWe are working on improving the firing pin design however, to be fair we would request Pak Gunners to please carry out similar tests on your imported or other local made weapons and share your results with us. It would really help to know whether others can perform at par with our Trushot and if the expectations are reasonable or beyond what other weapons are capable of. \n\nAnother point which is very important and should be taken into consideration is that guns which qualify NATO standards for military applications require an extreme temperature shock test and then gun should fire after the exposure. Regardless of the temperature, the gun should fire, however, there is no mention of how many rounds should be fired. The gun might fire once or twice or 10 rounds and then something might break, but the test is passed and the weapon is qualified.  The Trushot fired around a magazine and a half before the firing pin broke after the water dunk test, which is by no means a standardized test for firearm safety or qualifications. Dr. Gilani sb may also agree to this. Anyhow, NATO standards are a completely different ball game. Not all manufacturers are not willing to qualify their guns to NATO standards simply due to the irrelevance to their targeted market and firearm usage. \n\nPlease note that DSA has other weapons that comply to NATO standards and our aim will be to, ''over time'' bring our handguns up to these standards as well. \n\nWe are hoping that you gentlemen will carry out similar tests on other weapons and share your results with us soon.

If you have the means to keep antivenom, make sure you keep all of them which are used for snakebites in our country.\n\nMaking a snake trapping stick is easy.

(595618, ' Thank you Sir Dr. Gilani, Mr. jibz and other members,\n\nPlease be sure that this "1st and 2nd" grade terminology is being miscommunicated amongst readers. ''1st and 2nd grades'' mean two different models and not inferior or superior grades of quality in the same model. We would like to further clarify the following:\n\n\n1. Having two grades does not mean that the 2nd grade will be something below existing standard/grade/model of the Trushot. \n\n2. Any additional grades to the existing gun will surpass/exceed the material spec. and manufacturing quality of the existing Trushot which already performs very well. You may think of terms like ''match grade'' etc. which are improvements to standard/base models and will have a higher price tag and will be sold as a separate model. Of course prices TBA later when such grades become available for the Trushot. \n\n3. We are not interested in increasing the existing price of the Trushot by much, so any improvements in this standard/base model Trushot will reflect of this policy. \n\n4. Another clarification on the term ''grade'' is that when this was discussed with PG members the intention was that different models(grades) of the Trushot would be introduced such that Grade A might have better accessories, grips, finishes, engravings etc. along with perhaps a possibility of a higher spec. barrel, quicker trigger and better finishes overall. \n\n\nWe hope this clarifies any doubts regarding the term ''Grade'' and it''s relevance to our products.\n\nThank you,\n\nsincerely\n\nDSA\n\n[QUOTE=Dr_Gilani;433478]I agree as well to have one GRADE - however options can be created for various feature to choose from, if needed.\n\nRegards[/QUOTE]', ''),

It remains a challenge to PG members so that their concerns and judgements about the Trushot can be bench marked and justified on a comparative basis rather than the Trushot being singled out by itself. \n\nThank you for sharing the Glock report. Another very good example of no man made thing ever being 100% perfect. \n\nKind regards to all,\n\nSincerely,\n\nDSA\n[QUOTE=Dr_Gilani;433612]Dear friends I was trying to search modeling of Firing Pin in computer software, its design and issue and I came across a :) .....

Let''s see what sort of reliability others can prove on a exact comparisons and if their price tags are justified by their performance. \n\nThank you,\n\n\nSincerely,\n\nDSA\n\n\n\n[QUOTE=Dr_Gilani;433673]Thanks @COLT1911 for very well said points!!! I feel embarrassed now for the confusion that was created lets keep the things straight! Let me throw few lines and I am glad that the issue is very clear:\n\n1. In NO way any PG members when reviews a gun say CZ, Glock or others .... is representing that company, neither am I representing DSA.\n\n2. Sharing, reviewing here are ALL our personal LIMITED assessments (may be technically right or wrong) PG members assess that on their own.\n\n3. DSA did not asked to test, I wanted to go ahead to test and my other dearest members (JIBZ, COLT1911, FRAZ and NAZIM sahib) were kind enough to spend time with us, have great time and @JIBZ to be further kind to write review which I agreed to.\n\n4. 300 rounds (Rs 16k) for me might be a very big deal BUT not for DSA. Bro Colt1911 mentioned 100 rounds yes DSA did provided that BUT that is just small part. The arrangements for us to sit, tea, food, other arrangements which included presence of 10 or more DSA staff running around us to help us.  I do not know how many man hours of DSA invested in making sure that 5 PG members are very WELL taken care of on that day. I am sure diversion so many staff on that day would have costed them a huge delays in their regular production.  Trust me they are very busy people and doing many big projects. Spending so much time with us is great gesture from them.\n\nABOVE ALL the honor, respect that we got from DSA was like if we were VVIPs - [B]the respect and love that we had on that day from DSA cannot be PURCHASED!!!![/B] [I][U][B]It is priceless[/B][/U][/I].\n\n\n:) now lets please focus on technical details of TRUSHOT\n\nGod bless us all!\n\nRegards[/QUOTE]', ''),

This is a NOBEL quality and rare. Please reconsider what you have said, this was a collaborative effort and Dr. Gilani''s testing of the Trushot and his extended invitation to other PG members was purely to turn this into a educative and meaningful event. Foremost consideration, and we welcome Dr. Sb to please comment if we are wrong, is that Dr. Gilani sb was most interested in testing the Trushot and the 300 rounds for his own satisfaction and curiosity. We believe it is a great act of kindness that he has shown towards fellow PG members allowing them to also be equally involved in his personal ambitions. \n\nWe as a company are and were always fully confident that the DSA Trushot will perform the 300+ round test easily. We have tested these ourselves before we went into full production about 1.5 years ago with two prototypes. One was tested with 270+ rounds and then stopped. The other went through 300+ rounds and was cleared good for production. Both these weapons were also put through several rounds on a bench and fired remotely before being handled by our technicians. We have never put forth a firearm to our prospective customer before having full confidence in its reliability and quality. Mishaps do happen. Whether with us or some big Brand company, that is inevitable, however the aim is always to minimize the risk and maximize safety. \n\nFor a member of the public or media it is very easy to make a statement or pass a comment, but the fact is that legal and ethical firearm manufacturers like ourselves put their blood and sweat into making their products safe and reliable. I should say the same applies to manufacturers of anything that people would depend on, like cars or planes or medicines etc. etc. So these comments cannot be taken lightly and we would request other members to show respect and sensitivity with regards to it. After all, we place our forefathers name on our products and it''s reputation is our own reputation which we have earned from years of hard work. \n\n[B]We value your feedback but doubts about our professionalism and ethics is taking it a bit too far.

Sharing, reviewing here are ALL our personal LIMITED assessments (may be technically right or wrong) PG members assess that on their own.\n\n3. DSA did not asked to test, I wanted to go ahead to test and my other dearest members (JIBZ, COLT1911, FRAZ and NAZIM sahib) were kind enough to spend time with us, have great time and @JIBZ to be further kind to write review which I agreed to.\n\n4. 300 rounds (Rs 16k) for me might be a very big deal BUT not for DSA. Bro Colt1911 mentioned 100 rounds yes DSA did provided that BUT that is just small part. The arrangements for us to sit, tea, food, other arrangements which included presence of 10 or more DSA staff running around us to help us.  I do not know how many man hours of DSA invested in making sure that 5 PG members are very WELL taken care of on that day. I am sure diversion so many staff on that day would have costed them a huge delays in their regular production.  Trust me they are very busy people and doing many big projects.

All pictures posted on TGF please cut paste on Pakguns I am just a basic operator of computer and could not load on PG.\nThe Long Range Rifle is a new craze in Pakistan. In fact all over the world this is  a hot sport catching momentum. These are Known as F class matches after the name of the gentleman starting this sport, starting from 600 to 800 and 1000 yards.\nThe targets are 1/2 to 1 minute of angle; which means at 600 the 10 ring is 6 inches in diameter and the X ring is 3 inches in diameter. At 1000 yards the 10 ring is 10 inches in diameter and the X ring is 5 icnches.\nMost top positions are decided by the number of X rings. The shooters need deep pockets to buy top end rifles , Rifle Scopes, Spotting scopes and ammunition which is usually hand loaded or top end ammo like RWS Elite, Norma Diamond Line and Federal Gold Medal etc are used. \nThe Rifles used were from my Mauser 86 SR to Steyer SSG 08, Blaser Sniper, Savage Custom made, Steyr SSG 69, Steyer SSG P2,  Sako TRG, Range Master, Accuracy International and Rifles are already pouring in like the M24 and also the Lapua 338s .\nThe Rifle scopes were mostly Schmidt & Bender PM2 and Night Force ATCAR and some Meopta and Leupold.\nThe Spotting Scopes a very essential item were  from the Ziess to Leupold with the top performer being the Meopta which proved far superior to all Spotting Scopes.\nThis sport unfortunately is very expansive but we are developing 168 gr sniper rounds at POFs  which will substantially reduce costs of ammo.\nThe rifles are a one time expanse but cost as much as a new car when the rifle scope and spotting scope are added.', ''),

The firing pin issue now compels a 500 rds test minimum, whenever issue corrected by Daudsons.\nWe hope Daudsons will comply efficiently with the shortcomings mentioned and we should have the patience to let them work on it.\nI trust they''ll deliver. Their customer back up is laudable, as reported here in this thread by our prominent members.\nI observed too that the recoil is somewhat on the higher side, probably due to the thicker grip circumference.\nMay I mention, SIG P226 grip circumference is ideal for almost any hand size and it suits my smaller hands even. I think grips could be flattened out a bit on this one.\nBest Luck to DS and all aspirants.\nRegards.[/QUOTE]\nMany Thanks AK47 sir. Your well wishes are truly motivating. I am not sure if Dr Sb will put his handgun to the same test; not because he doesnt trust this handgun but for the reason that he has his eyes set on few other acquisitions as well...

Hopefully, one day as we strive toward achieving higher quality standards, our customers and supporters will be willing to pay the fair price that they would rather pay for imports.  As they say, "Taali do haath se bajti hai". We are confident that in its own humble way, the TRUSHOT will be a game changer. And we need all your support for this in every way possible. \n\nSir K203 Thank you again for your Inputs. We truly appreciate all inputs, feedback and criticism from PG members but nothing really comes free in life. There is a fair and just cost to everything whether you pay cash for it or not. I think Dr. Gilani sb''s post speaks clearly of our inputs and support towards our enthusiastic Pak Gunners. Hence we mentioned before as well, to clarify, this was a Collaborative effort and hats off to Dr. Sb for his generosity, passion and determination to get it done!! \n\nVisit is most welcome Sir.

It possibly flew outta my mind, or I got busy with other stuff. Even the pump action in question here has later been disposed off by me.\n\nLet me just state, that we all do know by now, that dealers do have a habit of mixing in a couple of fake rounds into fresh packs of ammo. This has been experienced by many of us, particularly with the 9mm Chinese red box ammo, i.e.\n\nI trust this was the case here as well, since - as I mentioned earlier in this thread - I wholly do not understand why the POF outlet would freight off from their plants, a package of 25 shells, carrying at least 2 to 3 different head stamps within the same package.\n\nAnd frankly speaking, I''ve never relied upon POF ammo, be it for handguns or long guns, wrt to personal defense. You may consider it bit unpatriotic, but I always use Federal, Rottweil or Eley for this purpose, and POF only for casual shooting or range fodder. That too, if purchased directly from the POF outlet.\n\nI still remember however to have purchased 200 POF 9mm rounds, fresh packed in green plastic wraps and taken out of the carton by myself and dispatched to SLK for Denovo bro''s CZ range review, only to find that shells from that batch had ruptured during his range session 7 days later.\n\nHence, patriotic or unpatriotic, POF is a NO NO from my side, sadly.\n\nRegards.', ''),

The decision making process starts from middle rank upwards. The lower ranked military personnel (all over the world, not just here in Pakistan) are taught and trained how to react.\n\nUnder any circumstances, you can easily predict their reaction, because all the reactions are inculcated in their training.\n\nBabaz7, yes they might treat some ethnic groups more harshly, but that is due to long term experience in the past. You aren''t a terrorist and you would always have dealt with the paramilitary with respect and common sense, but you know how some of the Baloch seniors dealt with the government and the military officials. I won''t post any names or start a political debate, I am just saying that sometimes the seniors do something and the common members of the society have to take the backlash. It''s not fair, but it happens.\n\nIn my experience, if you treat the military people politely and sensibly, they deal you likewise. Sometimes they even make little exceptions for you if you show that you aren''t some hot-headed son/nephew/brother/father of an MPA, beauraucrate, factory owner etc. Myself being a member of a feudal family, I have dealt with the local punjab police and the patrolling police several times.

So I have now firmly decided that I will no longer be buying any products that have export bans imposed by another country to Pakistan. Weapon manufacturers included in this are Glock, H&K, SIG, Walther etc. These companies will simply refuse to even send spare parts, under warranty/officially, if something breaks. They are absolutely no authorised distributors in PK for these and if any distributor tells you otherwise he is BSing out of where the sun don''t shine.\n\nCZ, Sarsilmaz, Norinco, Taurus, Zigana, Canik55 etc are all good ...... any other export banned weapons from other countries, in my humble opinion, I would be ashamed to buy and fire one from now on. Ultimately the money we spend, a big chunk of the price we pay goes to these countries, so why should we buy their products when they don''t want to sell to us with a non-existent aftermarket service.\n\nThe above is no criticism to those who love these export banned weapons and love buy them.

(596455, ' Verve as per my knowledge I have looked into the export laws of the USA and pakistan was not on the list of the countries that the US has banned exports to. From my limited knowledge what the US authorities require is an import authorisation to import a particular firearm(s) from the government of the country that the firearm is being exported to. \n\nOnce this import permit has been shown the person or business that is importing the firearm needs to send a hand written posted or typed signed scanned and emailed purchase order, that mentions the firearm commodities that are required. \n\nAfter this is done, a form called the "DSP-83" form is filled and signed by the person who is importing and all these documents are sent to the US government, it roughly takes 2 to 8 weeks to obtain an import license in the US for the firearm to be exported. \n\n All this is done through an FFL dealer in the united states, normally they will fill out the forms themselves and will require all permits and purchase orders to be in english. All the person needs to do is sign the forms and send them back to the US dealer. \n\n This is the main procedure TO MY LIMITED KNOWLEDGE that is a legal and fool proof way to import a firearm from the US. The only problem is obtaining an import permit from our own darn government which does not trust law abiding citizens enough to give them permits to obtain firearms for protection or recreational activities. Rather frowns upon and dismisses its law abiding citizens actually trying to follow the law and do everything the legal way.\n  I may be partly right in all that I have said, maybe fully correct , may be totally wrong. This is the information that I have through my research and it most certainly isn''t coming from any expert in the field. So take is as a word from a college student.', ''),

The decision making process starts from middle rank upwards. The lower ranked military personnel (all over the world, not just here in Pakistan) are taught and trained how to react.\n\nUnder any circumstances, you can easily predict their reaction, because all the reactions are inculcated in their training.\n\nBabaz7, yes they might treat some ethnic groups more harshly, but that is due to long term experience in the past. You aren''t a terrorist and you would always have dealt with the paramilitary with respect and common sense, but you know how some of the Baloch seniors dealt with the government and the military officials. I won''t post any names or start a political debate, I am just saying that sometimes the seniors do something and the common members of the society have to take the backlash. It''s not fair, but it happens.\n\nIn my experience, if you treat the military people politely and sensibly, they deal you likewise. Sometimes they even make little exceptions for you if you show that you aren''t some hot-headed son/nephew/brother/father of an MPA, beauraucrate, factory owner etc. Myself being a member of a feudal family, I have dealt with the local punjab police and the patrolling police several times.

(596540, ' Salam All,\nA good thread Verve.  Wish all of us had your strength.\nNow who said that the permits can''t be sold... the current going rate for permits is $50000/rs and yes that so called businessman (oops meant government servant... oops meant to say OverLord) will be present at time of clearing.  How else are all these Glocks arriving here lately?  I was personally at the airport to purchase such Glocks a few months back.  How else did most of the Sigs arrive here?\nAs for the DSP83 stuff - there is nothing in there to suggest a time limit or the right(s) of the importer.  Meaning I have seen the 8 weeks turn to a year - EASY and then get refused!  And you have to submit the entire amount for the order in advance.\nI remember I placed an order from Brownells for a bunch of 1911 accessories (no barrels, slides, or frames).  The total I paid was 1100usd and I waited for 9 months.  After approval I placed the SAME order again with Brownells and within three months it came back refused.  Why you ask?\nBecause your permit''s approvals are at the discretion of human beings... maybe the permit approving officer''s wife didn''t kiss him to work that day... maybe on the way he decided to hate us... or more B.S..  We don''t have any rights when applying for DSP83 - either it comes back as  a yes or most of the time its a NO.   Also most US sites have a bad image about us and hence refuse to sell to us where as they will sell internationally like Gelatini International...  I can''t remember the name of the website but they had clearly written something to the fact that '' We don''t send to specific (countries listed) or to those who consider us as enemies'' and it included our great nation''s name in the list as well!', ''),

(596649, ' [QUOTE=Verve;434322]This is a rant .. for general public and doesn''t apply to LEA (majority of whom are either are using CF98 or Sarsilmaz pistols).\n\nMany of us are well aware of the global games being played. So I have now firmly decided that I will no longer be buying any products that have export bans imposed by another country to Pakistan. Weapon manufacturers included in this are Glock, H&K, SIG, Walther etc. These companies will simply refuse to even send spare parts, under warranty/officially, if something breaks. They are absolutely no authorised distributors in PK for these and if any distributor tells you otherwise he is BSing out of where the sun don''t shine.\n\nCZ, Sarsilmaz, Norinco, Taurus, Zigana, Canik55 etc are all good ...... any other export banned weapons from other countries, in my humble opinion, I would be ashamed to buy and fire one from now on. Ultimately the money we spend, a big chunk of the price we pay goes to these countries, so why should we buy their products when they don''t want to sell to us with a non-existent aftermarket service.\n\nThe above is no criticism to those who love these export banned weapons and love buy them. This is just my personal opinion. I have a Walther P22Q and I will be getting rid of it as soon as I get a less problem infested local clone made.[/QUOTE]\n\n+1\nExactly same thinking as that of mine. In my opinion if you have many millions in your account still it is never wise to purchase a 500$ Glock for 3000$ same go for the other guns who have got big names. But what difference it makes whether you shot a Sig, Glock or cheap but standard options like CZ , Taurus etc. avaiable over here with very little extra money to pay. After all you are firing a 9mm !!!\n\nI am sure many of you have seen youtube videos of Hickok45 & according to him a very costly and expensive gun either makes no difference at all or even if it makes it is not even in millimeters and maters only to a few names who are ranked very high in international competitions. Almost same is stated by Massad Ayuoob.\n\nEven in USA CZ 75B SS costs more than Glock 17/19. Google it and glocks are said by many as cheap plastic pistols and same are my personal views ( No offence of any sort intended just sharing my personal thoughts )\n\nInstead of paying 3 lacs for a 9mm why not someone get a decent battery of weapons and licenses or get a decent semi auto .223 ( once their prices no longer remain insane in near future or atleast I hope so )\n\nRegards', ''),

Wish all of us had your strength.\nNow who said that the permits can''t be sold... the current going rate for permits is $50000/rs and yes that so called businessman (oops meant government servant... oops meant to say OverLord) will be present at time of clearing.  How else are all these Glocks arriving here lately?  I was personally at the airport to purchase such Glocks a few months back.  How else did most of the Sigs arrive here?\nAs for the DSP83 stuff - there is nothing in there to suggest a time limit or the right(s) of the importer.  Meaning I have seen the 8 weeks turn to a year - EASY and then get refused!  And you have to submit the entire amount for the order in advance.\nI remember I placed an order from Brownells for a bunch of 1911 accessories (no barrels, slides, or frames).  The total I paid was 1100usd and I waited for 9 months.  After approval I placed the SAME order again with Brownells and within three months it came back refused.  Why you ask?\nBecause your permit''s approvals are at the discretion of human beings... maybe the permit approving officer''s wife didn''t kiss him to work that day... maybe on the way he decided to hate us... or more B.S..  We don''t have any rights when applying for DSP83 - either it comes back as  a yes or most of the time its a NO.   Also most US sites have a bad image about us and hence refuse to sell to us where as they will sell internationally like Gelatini International...

(596731, ' I have a PT92, PT1911 and now plan to buy a CZ in very near future. I like SIGs but stupid money, and Glocks don''t feel right in the hand anyways.\n\nIn regards to Zia Raza bro''s comments .... weapons export bans to Pakistan are in place by USA and EU countries. \n\nYou mentioned Coke, Pepsi and others (let me add Nestle, Unilever, Haier et al) .... these are companies that have factories here and are employing Pakistani staff. Just look at Gourmet''s fizzy drinks, the knowledge and technology and people running the production of these drink manufacturing units for Gourmet are from Pepsi etc. Yes, these multinational companies repatriate profits out of PK but they also employee hundreds of thousands of us.\n\nMercedes Benz, Toyota, & Honda to name a few are also foreign companies, but they provide warranty and services. Yes Toyota and Honda are in breach of their contracts as they should''ve been manufacturing by now instead of just assembling the cars. Nonetheless, the employees are our Pakistani brothers.\n\nAs for technology transfer, I agree there should be no borders but that is not going to happen. I worked in IBM and Cisco and I know for definite that IBM''s high-end servers and some of high-end Cisco products have export bans to Pakistan and many other countries that EU and USA do not approve of.\n\nAs for those who can afford, well each to their own and I have nothing against that. I''ll buy a Merc over a BMW in PK because I know I can get service and parts for Merc, even though I prefer to drive BMW because even cheaper 330ci BMW (or 530/535 for that matter) has a much better road grip and handling that of S Class Merc (I''ve owned both 530 and CL500 in past). But if I was to buy a BMW, and something goes wrong, money aside I''ll have a real headache trying to source parts and find a not so much of cowboy mechanic to fit it. So, here in PK, I''d rather buy a Honda for a daily car (I hate Corolla anyways - it is abs run of the mill junk, very high center of gravity, stuffy cabin space and nasty to drive, 2014 model is no different than current - just a facelift).\n\nAnyways, coming back to weapons .... the rudeness by Walther staff (when they found out I was from Pakistan) is something not to be let go so I gave them tough time/language in return. And I will be reporting Walther Germany to the German Customs for selling weapons to their distributor who is exporting to Pakistan - responsibility sits with Walther where their weapons are sold by their distributor. Walther also refused to state the name of the distributor they sold my serial number pistol to. Some of you may hate me for it, but if that''s the attitude of the company of their product users then I have no issues screwing them over. I have a very minor issue with the 3.4" barrel where extractor has chipped it slightly, so I''ve fix the extractor edge. This issue was spotted very early so and fix means that pistol will continue to function without any further damage/chipping to the chamber wall. But then I thought ''what the heck, let me get the barrel replaced by Walther anyways since this shouldn''t have happened'' ... by the way, this will happen and is happening to every new P22Q (even a friend''s who just bought his a few months ago) you will buy in the market, it is a design fault by Walther!! So buy P22Q at your own risk if you don''t intend to do any smithing on the extractor as it will kill the chamber without the extractor modification. And added to that are all the little modifications one needs to do to smoothen/polish sharp trigger bar edges that chip the slide, and extractor modification to stop the shells landing at the face.\n\nThis is what they said in the first email when I sent the picture to them ''I have shown your pictures to our technical department and was told that they will check to find out why your barrel is damaged. For sure you need a new extractor and barrel. It is possible to issue a letter saying that we are prepared to exchange the barrel free of charge under warranty but that we can not do this due to the German export law and the lack of the needed German export permit."\n\nLast Walther email after I threatened to post all their emails (quite a few exchanged) on international gun forums - note specifically in bold:\n"This pistol was sold overseas and not to a German dealer. No the letter will not be amended in the requested way as this is prohibited to do. Again we can not send the barrel to you and also we can not arrange any business between you and somebody in a foreign country. [B]It''s your part or the part of your dealer to be creative but never inform us about what you have done as than we have to stop this deal[/B]. I hope this time you understand our bad situation. Be sure we understand your situation and we want to help you but we have to stay within the law and this law also prohibit to tell you whom to contact to get your parts. That''s Germany."', ''),

One of the reasons it sells for $3000 is because the dealer makes a hefty profit, but the real reason is shortage of the commodity in the market. It is very hard to import these high end firearms coming from the USA so dealers buy smuggled firearms which are obviously not in the amount that they would be if they were imported legally, they are much scarce. Due to their shortage in the market the price has sky rocketed. Its simple economics, you cannot control the market. It is not possible for all the dealers in Pakistan to sit together and say ok, we are going to sell a Glock for $3000, it doesn''t work that way. The reason it goes for $3000 is because PKR is slowly going to ruins, dealers want to make a good enough profit but the main reason is the shortage of the commodity in the market, due to it being imported through dodgy illegal means in which they can only be brought as one off pieces or in the 10s at max.', ''),

(596801, ' Here''s the proper procedure for those wanting to change weapons on MOI Card\n\n1. Meet SO Arms, Room 435, 4th Floor, S Block, Interior Ministry, Constitutional Avenue, Islamabad. Only licence holder will be ''entertained'', strictly no agents/dealers/relatives etc (this is why many of us can''t get weapon change done).\n2. SO will see your genuine MOI Card and may have a question(s) and once satisfied, he will ask you to write a hand letter requesting the change of weapon for him to sign.\n3. Hand over the signed letter to his staff in the room across the hall along with the copy of your MOI Card and CNIC (take copies before reaching the office as only photocopiers are outside the main entrance and even those are a hit or a miss with machines working).\n4. In about an hour or less (depending on staff workload), staff will issue you the SO signed letter stating your licence number and old weapon number. Letter states your file number on top. It also states that you can sell your existing weapon to a registered weapon dealer and buy a new one of the same calibre, and to produce both the sale and purchase receipts to Ministry for further processing. CHECK, CHECK AGAIN, and CHECK YET AGAIN that all details on that letter are correct (licence number, weapon number, name, address, date etc) and that the file number on the letter matches the number written on your actual card file (filing system in that office is ''interesting'' to say the least).\n5. Sell your weapon, get a sale receipt, and buy a new weapon, get a purchase receipt. Make photocopies for your records.\n6. Produce both original receipts to the same office, along with the first letter issued.\n7. Ministry will issue a new letter, signed by the SO, to you the same day (within an hour or 2 max), to give to Nadra that will entail new weapon details etc. Check everything on that letter.\n8. Take the letter to Nadra along with MOI Card, pay the relevant fees and handover old licence, and retain the coupon. You will be informed of date to pick up the licence with new weapon number on it.\n\nGet there by 10am! Office is closed from 1pm to 2pm. Earlier you get there, the quicker you will meet the SO and get the printed sale/purchase authorisation letter. Staff were very nice. Be polite and they will treat you well. SO does get called in for meetings so patience is a virtue. He is a good guy in my honest opinion, polished, polite, and soft spoken so you shouldn''t have any issues getting the authorisation.', ''),

(596969, ' very informative thread. I believe it will benefit us all.\r\n\r\nin my limited experience, I have learned that there are in fact just two ways to track a target and shoot it. there may be others and even better ways but I can only think of two. kindly allow me to clarify that I am not an expert in this particular department and currently in a process of learning myself.\r\n\r\n1. point, lead and shoot:\r\nyou point the bird with your gun''s muzzle, track it and just before shooting you pull ahead to the desired lead (forward allowance) then pull the trigger and keep the barrel moving (follow through).\r\n\r\nadvantage: determining a bird''s flight path becomes easy, estimation of correct amount of forward allowance becomes easy.\r\n\r\ndisadvantage: time consuming exercise. the sub-processes that are involved such as pointing and tracking take up too much of time and target just flies off.\r\n\r\n2. Maintained Lead:\r\n\r\nthis is rather difficult to master but is highly rewarding in skeet. you point the target with your eyes only, let your mind estimate the speed and flight path of the target. then you start your barrel ahead of the bird/clay with forward allowance and shoot.\r\n\r\nadvantage: way faster then previous method and the shooting becomes an instinctive affair as it is no more a deliberate exercise.\r\n\r\ndisadvantage: really steep learning curve. very difficult to master this technique and mostly when you miss, you have no idea what happened and how to correct it unless you have a buddy standing right behind your shoulder and tracking your gun''s movement.\r\n\r\nRegards.', ''),

I mentioned it only for weight reduction . and i think its as beautiful as a shotgun could be, sir denovo review is very solid but there is a side to it :) . 1 you and i, we wanna buy a gun, we wanna keep it and we want value for our money :) ,sir denovo can through it out if he dont like it :).. 2ndly now both guns r in exact same price range,when sir denovo made the review it was about 26000 rs less or much .. plz do check it when ever u  gonna buy a 12 guage..    and never ever in any situation ,under any circumstance(unless u have no other option left) fire a 12 guage  in side home in closed rooms caz it can cause permanent ear damage to every 1 in the room.. its never a good option for HD :)  :)', ''),

It possibly flew outta my mind, or I got busy with other stuff. Even the pump action in question here has later been disposed off by me.\n\nLet me just state, that we all do know by now, that dealers do have a habit of mixing in a couple of fake rounds into fresh packs of ammo. This has been experienced by many of us, particularly with the 9mm Chinese red box ammo, i.e.\n\nI trust this was the case here as well, since - as I mentioned earlier in this thread - I wholly do not understand why the POF outlet would freight off from their plants, a package of 25 shells, carrying at least 2 to 3 different head stamps within the same package.\n\nAnd frankly speaking, I''ve never relied upon POF ammo, be it for handguns or long guns, wrt to personal defense. You may consider it bit unpatriotic, but I always use Federal, Rottweil or Eley for this purpose, and POF only for casual shooting or range fodder. That too, if purchased directly from the POF outlet.\n\nI still remember however to have purchased 200 POF 9mm rounds, fresh packed in green plastic wraps and taken out of the carton by myself and dispatched to SLK for Denovo bro''s CZ range review, only to find that shells from that batch had ruptured during his range session 7 days later.\n\nHence, patriotic or unpatriotic, POF is a NO NO from my side, sadly.\n\nRegards.[/QUOTE]\nPOF never used the green plastic wrap.

(597239, 'My Experience with Diana P1000S I upgraded my Diana Model 35 with T05 trigger to P1000S couple of weeks back and will use this thread to share my experience and its performance with everyone. \n\nI purchased Diana P1000S from Badrrudin & Sons Rawalpindi along with Hill Pump MkIII. I was looking for a good scope such as Hawke/Leopold etc. but unfortunately none of the brands were available in rawalpindi/Islamabad so ended up buying cheap Crossman CenterPoint 4-16x40 AO mil-dot rectile.  I took good two to three weeks to get the scope mounted properly and zero the gun at 50 yards, reason for taking so long? I zeroed the scope optically and brought it to about half an inch to zero without changing windage/elevation settings.\n\nInitially the spread was not very consistent and was not really happy with the gun. However a very good friend of mine guided me to clean the grease from the barrel. Using fishing line I made a pull-through and cleaned the barrel with clean cotton cloth. Barrel cleaning really helped reduce the spread of the group the gun was making i.e. improved its consistency.\n\nI was using H&N FTT 14.xxGrn, H&N Baracude at 21.xxGrn and RWS Superdome at 14.xxGrn but on my last visit to Outdoor Adventures in Lahore I managed to buy JSB Exact Heavy 18.33 Grain pellets.   Diana P1000 just like any other PCP shines with JSB''s at 18 Grain. The spread at 50 yards suddenly became close to 1/2 inch, basically all the pellets would just make the initial hole bigger. By the way I am using Leopold RX600 range finder to set the target at exact yardage. \n\nHave been testing the gun at 40, 50, 60, 70, 80 and 90 yards and slowly fine tuning the windage. Today, me and my friends started off at 50yards and then decided to test the gun at 100 yards. Please note it was an open area with wind. First thought 100Yards is a long long long long....long distance for an Airgun. I mean it is really long! Any ways we set the target up at exact 100yards using the range finder. Used a bean-bag on the car roof as a support and fired a few shots. The drop was huge as expected more than 5mils at 16x zoom (I measured it later on and it was 14.5inch POI to be exact though chairgun software was predicting 12.5inch at rated 950FPS of P1000). This makes me wonder two things \n\n1- With 18 grain pellets the FPS of Diana P1000 should be dropping to something close to 900?\n2- Second how do people hit the target at close to 180 yards????  \n\nAny ways one of the group was really really tight! the remaining groups opened up a bit but I believe that was mostly because of the wind and I was keeping my crossair at the target. I also made all my friends sign on the target which I will most likely frame and put on one of the walls of my hobby room.\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]30110[/ATTACH][ATTACH=CONFIG]30109[/ATTACH]\n\nHere are pictures of group at 100Yards Group 1 was good but then wind picked up quite a lot but I kept firing at the target without any windage.\n\nHere is the facebook video link \n[URL="https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?v=498087676960051"]https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?v=498087676960051&l=1230412254518034409[/URL]', ''),

(597253, ' Excellent results and a detailed write up which [B]emphasizes 1 critical aspect[/B] whic frustrates a lot of users after getting a PCP, as with all airguns the PCPs need to be broken in as well, their barrel needs to be properly leaded, and the barrel needs to be cleaned 1st and foremost; the whole process takes about 300-500 pellets. \n\nAlso, by that time the shooter gets comfortable with the hold and understands better how his gun performs. Unfortunately many users get frustrated without understanding this basic phenomenon (I admit I''ve been through stage ;) ).. However, this is a percfect example for all new air gun users, you need to stick in and give it another day, another try especially with brand new airguns. The results will eventually be as delightful as you see here :)\n\nYou''ve got yourself a winning combo mate, I suggest you stick to JSB 18 grain pellets as these really shine in your airgun.

For example, .38 bullets might technically be .357 or .358, depending on whether they''re for Colt or Smith, except recent ammunition is more or less standardized on .357, except when they use .356 (like the .38 Casull), which is also 9mm, except when they might use .355.\r\n\r\n Fortunately the absolute size isn''t all that critical; some guns are noticeably more accurate with bullets .001-.003" larger than the "official" diameter.\r\n\r\n It''s best to consider "caliber" as just a name and a general guide to diameter.  Otherwise, you''ll get all snarled up on why 7.62x51 is smaller than 7.62x39, while .303 British is larger than both, or why 7.7 Ariska, 7.62x54R, 7.65x53 Mauser, and .303 British are all the *same* size.

(597535, ' Guys, I am not a fan of HM or the "JEW" channel but some of the arguments raised above do not seem right.\n* No or little blood : Well, in the above pic, there is some blood on the seat. The thing is that none of his major artery/ organ was damaged by the bullets. The thing is that if we puncture flesh, there will be very little blood and it will be just oozing a little and not bleeding. Puncture an artery and things will be changed. So this could be the reason of little blood on the seats. \n\n* I read somewhere that according to the FBI stats, 75+% of gun shot victims survive (in US i.e. where mostly the ER is really prompt and quick). We have different situation here. Mostly the victims die here because of loss of blood since they can''t reach to hospital quickly. Moreover, the so called ambulances we have here (other than Aman''s) are not really ambulances, they r just carriers. Hence casualty rate is high here of the gun shot victims. HM was lucky that his driver was quick to take him to AKU. My guess is on Sat eve, it is possible to reach AKU in 10-15 mins from the mentioned location. \n* Regarding Malala, well u can compare here face before and after the incident. \n\nMy point is that I believe the above actually happened.

For a 300 bar rated PCP the 1st fill will be at 300 bar and every fill thereon will drop in pressure both in the cylinder and the PCP.\n\nMy carbn fiber filling setup has cost me approx 20k because when dealing with such high pressure I want to be a 100% sure about the quality and life of my equipment. Any mishap will spell disaster so I honestly will NOT opt to buy a low cost cylinder. Also getting it tested is another area where I would not take any chances. \n\nOnce that whole setup is obtained i know of places in Karachi where you''ll get cylinders filled up for Rs 1000. But then again if you want to operate on a 300 bar working pressure, its not much use.\n\nMy whole PCP setup cost me 94k (74k for the BT65 elite package which included a good scope, hard case, sling and a very good flashlight) and 20k for filling setup. I bought a BSA FFP scope for 28k and sold the Optima scope for 6k and the whole package cost me 116k. If I add a Weihrauch silencer to the equation it''ll add another 8k to the package. \n\nDiana P1000 sells for 125k gun only, add filling and a decent scope and you''re talking in excess of 175k (125k for the airgun, 35k for hill pump and 15k for scope).

But anyways I found this 45 extra ordinary.\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]27369[/ATTACH][ATTACH=CONFIG]27370[/ATTACH][ATTACH=CONFIG]27374[/ATTACH][ATTACH=CONFIG]27376[/ATTACH][ATTACH=CONFIG]27378[/ATTACH]\n\nFor your convenience I went to the trouble of downloading their video from Youtube and uploading it to Vimeo, I hope that site isn''t blocked in Pakistan.\n[video=vimeo;82129705]https://vimeo.com/82129705[/video]\n\nSome info from their website\n[B]AF2011-A1 DOUBLE BARREL PISTOL[/B]\n\nThe AF2011-A1 Double Barrel Pistol comes actually as the very first industrial double barrel semiautomatic pistol of all times. The original idea came about ten years back to Swiss armourer Vivian Mueller, who at the time experienced cutting and welding together multiple parts of the famous Sig P210: the result was a long slide, double barrel 9mm, highly decorated collector piece, which indeed shot very well. Our idea took the challenge further: to commemorate the legendary Colt 1911-A1 in the Centenary by making a true industrial market-ready double barrel .45 caliber pistol. We achieved success in the brief span of 6 months, after intense and round-the-clock 3D designing, stereolithographic modeling and parts machining. The gun can be handled by any shooter able to shoot with a .45 Acp and it is not only very pleasing, but very accurate and great fun. The AF2011-A1 holds amazing and surprising target performance for the shooter: in fact, it will group all the 8 double .45 caliber rounds (16 bullets) held in the duplex, single columns magazines, in a target of the size of an orange at 15 yards and of a water melon at 25. The stopping power of the AF2011-A1 is tremendous: 2 bullets for a total of 460 Grains weight impacting at 1 to 2 inches apart (depending on the distance of the target) will knock down a bull, while the whole 18 bullets, for a payload exceeding 4000 Grains, can be delivered to the target in about 3 seconds. The AF2011-A1 obviously features a number of very special parts, such as the single slide, the single frame, the single spur double hammer, the single grip safety, the single body double mainspring housing and the single double cavity magazine floor plate, the long and double magazine latch, the special barrel bushings and the hold open lever and side lever safety with long shafts: but the most interesting feature of the new pistol which we strived to keep during the development of the project, is the interchangeability of most internal parts, which come as standard 1911 replacement parts. These include the firing pins, the firing pins plates, the sears groups, the triple springs, the inner parts of the mainspring housings, the recoil springs and recoil springs rods, the magazine bodies and inner parts, the sights (including after market adjustable sights) the grips and grips screws and bushings.[/QUOTE]\n\nGreat guns for great hands...', ''),

Meet SO Arms, Room 435, 4th Floor, S Block, Interior Ministry, Constitutional Avenue, Islamabad. Only licence holder will be ''entertained'', strictly no agents/dealers/relatives etc (this is why many of us can''t get weapon change done).\r\n2. SO will see your genuine MOI Card and may have a question(s) and once satisfied, he will ask you to write a hand letter requesting the change of weapon for him to sign.\r\n3. Hand over the signed letter to his staff in the room across the hall along with the copy of your MOI Card and CNIC (take copies before reaching the office as only photocopiers are outside the main entrance and even those are a hit or a miss with machines working).\r\n4. In about an hour or less (depending on staff workload), staff will issue you the SO signed letter stating your licence number and old weapon number. Letter states your file number on top. It also states that you can sell your existing weapon to a registered weapon dealer and buy a new one of the same calibre, and to produce both the sale and purchase receipts to Ministry for further processing. CHECK, CHECK AGAIN, and CHECK YET AGAIN that all details on that letter are correct (licence number, weapon number, name, address, date etc) and that the file number on the letter matches the number written on your actual card file (filing system in that office is ''interesting'' to say the least).\r\n5. Sell your weapon, get a sale receipt, and buy a new weapon, get a purchase receipt. Make photocopies for your records.\r\n6. Produce both original receipts to the same office, along with the first letter issued.\r\n7. Ministry will issue a new letter, signed by the SO, to you the same day (within an hour or 2 max), to give to Nadra that will entail new weapon details etc. Check everything on that letter.\r\n8. Take the letter to Nadra along with MOI Card, pay the relevant fees and handover old licence, and retain the coupon. You will be informed of date to pick up the licence with new weapon number on it.\r\n\r\nGet there by 10am! Office is closed from 1pm to 2pm. Earlier you get there, the quicker you will meet the SO and get the printed sale/purchase authorisation letter. Staff were very nice. Be polite and they will treat you well.

Thanks again for a very helpful reply.[/QUOTE]\n\nOk so this is how things went through. Updating after reaching US.\n\nI called airline and they ran message thru all transit airports and reply came, no problems, disassemble it and put it in checked baggage. That is what I did.\n\nAs I entered karachi airport, I told first scanner that I have an old airgun in pieces in my suitcase. Response was normal and they wanted to look at it. Sp I opened the suitcase and 5 ASF inspectors all of different ranks looked at it, then I showed them my FFL 01, and they were fine.\n\nGot to airline counter and checkin staff who was nice but all kids, got excited since they never saw an airgun or gun per say in pieces. So there was another show n tell. They were fine too I signed disclaimers and luggage checked in in good atmosphere. I was told to shrink wrapped this suitcase. They entered in their computer that I am traveling with a weapon. Great!\n\nNow finally when I went to hand over luggage to last scanner and told the security guy that he will see an airgun in pieces which he did. Here a new saga started, he called another Mr. ASF who asked me to open baggage again. Removed shrink wrap and open the baggage again. By now people were gathering around and it was looking like crazy. \n\nHe looked at it and you can tell he has no f'' ing clue what he is looking at. He touched the air gun spring and said &#1576;&#1681;&#1740; &#1582;&#1591;&#1585;&#1606;&#1575;&#1705; &#1670;&#1740;&#1586; &#1729;&#1746; &#1575;&#1740;&#1585; &#1580;&#1729;&#1575;&#1586; &#1662;&#1585; &#1606;&#1729;&#1740; &#1580;&#1575; &#1587;&#1705;&#1578;&#1740; .\n\nI explained this is not a real bullet using gun it is just an air gun which is now in more than 25 pieces and in a suitcase which will be somewhere in the luggage hold.  Nope, decision was made. So I started to look for those who already allowed and airline who already checked my bags. But no one will look in my eyes and talk.\n\nI asked for a chief and someone who never looked like a chief (not enough phols on shoulder) showed up and told me they have received a new set of rules most recently which treat even disassembled airguns dangerous. Talk about making things up right on the spot. Obviously he did not have access to that order when I asked to look at it.\n\nThis seemed like same game PIA crew plays at after midnight flights when bosses are away. They tell you that CAA just added another tax of Rs 5000 per ticket and passengers have no choice but pay. We don''t fly PIA anymore.\n\nAnyways with a fear of missing flight and no common sense holder available at the airport, we called the person back who came to drop us and send the disassembled airgun back home.\n\nMy father gave this gun to me I wanted to pass this on to my son and grandson but I will not be able to do that for now. Thanks to untrained, illiterate officials with authority. Not giving up, and going to involve Pakistan''s high commission and ministry of foreign affairs if needed. Any clues will be highly appreciated.\n\nSo pakguners, here is a lesson learned, the hard way. I am a big game hunter and travelled with my guns and ammo all around the world, never had an issue. But my own countrymen treated me this way, I will never forget that.\n\nI am sure later that ASF guy sat in his canteen with his fellows and bragged about how he forced a Pakistani passenger to send a disassembled airgun home which was OK by airline staff, airplane captain, mid east air line base and of course landing airport in the USA. &#1576;&#1729;&#1578; &#1657;&#1608;&#1585; &#1729;&#1746; &#1605;&#1740;&#1585;&#1740; &#1575;&#1608;&#1585; &#1580;&#1608; &#1576;&#1726;&#1740; &#1605;&#1585;&#1590;&#1740;  &#1570;&#1746; &#1705;&#1585; &#1587;&#1705;&#1578;&#1575; &#1729;&#1608;&#1722; &#1748;\n\nOne last thing, airline staff apart from being nice but still empty headed and irresponsible also did not remove comment from computer that I am traveling with a weapon knowing that it has been removed from baggage. They witnessed whole thing going down.\n\nI was separated at mideast hub and questioned, made to wait to confirm that comment is not valid anymore. From country''s top leadership to very bottom, no one is using brain. Not sure why.\n\nThanks for reading and keep shooting. Don''t get discouraged by idiots around us.', ''),

(598433, 'The Dart And The Hornet OK seniors, this is the first "hunting" picture I am uploading. Here is the kill (although it was very much alive and struggling to free itself) and the "bullet".\n\nSo ... the fellow had been buzzing around in my room for 3 days. As you can tell already, it was extremely threatening, not only annoying, as I stay in my room almost all day, trying to finish my writing work on the laptop. Anyhow, on the 3rd day I got fed up of this constant stinger literally hanging over my head and decided that enough was enough!\n\nMy trusty 4-feet blowpipe was handy. I counted the darts. I had 4 of them. Now, for a small target such as this (it was around 1.5 inches), you need to have more than 4 darts, but of course there was no time to relax and prepare extra darts first. I picked up the blowpipe (a 50 cal, 4 feet steel pipe, that is, with an improvised mouthpiece) and loaded the first dart. The scoundrel was buzzing at the ceiling then, nearly 20 feet from me.\n\nFirst dart goes swooshing past it, just missing it by 5 mm or so.\nSecond dart sweeps its wings and flies past, piercing in the cement of the ceiling. No harm done.\nThird dart just skims over it''s head and sticks it''s way into the ceiling. The scoundrel now gets alarmed. There is little time left!\nFourth dart. My hands were slightly shaking due to excitement. As you, fellow members already know, if it knew I was the cause of all this shooting, it could charge at me and plant a couple of stings in me which would have had extremely bad consequences for me. Anyhow I load the fourth dart ... put the mouthpiece to my lips ... I blow in hard ... and hit! I see the dart taking the target with it as it hits the ceiling, bounces off and falls on my computer table. Proudly and prudently, I go and pick up the dart, with the needle stuck halfway in it. It being an arthropod, I knew it had suffered no vital damage. If the needle was pulled out of it, it would immediately charge at me and sting me. I carefully take a couple of it''s snaps to share with you fellows here, and give the dart (with the scoundrel still pinned in) to a child to "neutralize it".\n\nSo, that''s the story of my glorious hunt, friends. I hope I will share more soon (prolly of snakes, rats, crows and more hornets. yee-ha!).', ''),

(598742, ' All right then, ladies! Surg asked for it and Hadii joined in. If that wasn''t enough motivation, K-203 presented the rosy prospective of winning a copper-skinned South American tribal princess with my humble skills. There is no excuse left for not posting the images anymore!\n\nHere we go ...! Notice that all pics were taken with m Qmob Z3, so don''t expect crystal clarity of a full fledge digi cam. I have severely zoomed out the images (upto 24% of original size) so they are acceptably clear and there is very little pixelation. But still ...\n\n[IMG]http://marked.hostei.com/images/intro.jpg[/IMG]\n\n1 => The pipe\n2 => The mouthpiece. This is the end where you are supposed to blow in. It is usually kept wider to allow for easy blowing and generating more pressure.\n3 => The damned evo USB. This idiot little thing acted up last night, or I would have posted the pics already.\n4 => If you are wondering, it''s my nokia phone. If you can judge the model number, it''s yours to have (NOT!)\n\nOK. Moving on. Now that you have seen the pipe, I think I should show you the mouthpiece in some detail. I used a plastic cold drink bottle cap (1 and 1.5 lits) for my mouthpiece. Basically you simply cut a clear, clean hole in the center of the cap. The hole should be the size that the pipe fits in with some friction and doesn''t easily slide. When you are done with it, you simply wind some adhesive tape at the end of the cap as an added safety against its sliding away.\n\n[img]http://marked.hostei.com/images/mouthpiece_closeup.jpg[/img]\n\nWhen holding the blowpipe, you wrap your strong hand (your trigger finger''s hand, that is) around the mouthpiece so that your lips don''t touch the mouthpiece and are connected only with your own hand. This comes convenient as one blowpipe might be used by multiple people and you never know how many spiders, wasps and God-knows-what creatures crawl over and sleep cozily in your (or you could say your blowpipe''s) mouthpiece.\n\nWith your other hand, it depends on where you hold the pipe. The practical blowgunners of South America hold the pipe right near the mouthpiece but I just can''t shoot accurately like that. I hold it farther from the mouthpiece. Nearly at the center of the pipe.\n\n[img]http://marked.hostei.com/images/holding_mouthpiece.jpg[/img]\n\nFor making the dart, you cut out a 1.5x2.5 inches of a plastic film. Then you roll it into a cone like this one. After you are done rolling it, you drop two drops of elfi or any other superglue to seal it in it''s shape. One drop goes at the tight end and the other drop goes between two outer layers of the open/wide end. After you are done, you place the cone in your blowpipe. If it is too wide, you mark the point where it gets too wide for the pipe, and cut it with a scissors. You keep doing it until the cone fits snugly in the pipe. It shouldn''t be too tight and neither should fall off when you point the pipe to the floor.\n\n[img]http://marked.hostei.com/images/dart_cone.jpg[/img]\n\nAfter the cone is made, it depends on you which type of dart you want to turn it to. You have 3 options:\n1- needle dart (posted here) is the easiest to make and has maximum accuracy and range. However it is very light and despite it''s unbelievable penetration, does little against larger targets (snakes, squirrels, doves etc). This should be your choice as a beginner and if you want to shoot for fun. These ones never disappoint you. Just take a needle (the one which is nearly 2.5 inches) and insert it tip-first into the cone. When the tip emerges from the tight end, pull it through all the way so that only the base of the needle is left inside the cone. Then seal it there with the handy superglue.\n\n2- broadhead dart. These are quite some headache to make unless you have a couple of hardware machines for flattening and sharpening. These are heavier than the needle darts and end up in a shape of spear head. These do very very nasty damage (even to a HUGE target such as a human or a deer) although can''t bring them down, obviously. These have lesser range (almost 2/3 of needle) and slightly lesser accuracy. You use them for taking down mice, snakes, crows, doves, squirrels etc. I will post some pics of them when I make them again.\n\n3- stun darts. These don''t have anything sharp and basically end up in a small steel ball. Put simply, these are used as slow-speed bullets. The steel ball is at the tight end of the cone and it is this which hits the target. Some people say these have unbelievable accuracy, but I have never made any of them, to know for sure. I am a fan of the needle tips.\n\n[img]http://marked.hostei.com/images/dart_complete.jpg[/img]\n\nAnd now that you are already watching some photos, why not show you something more warm and beautiful than darts and blowpipes?

(598747, ' Btw if you girls were wondering, here are some quick facts about the whole affair:\n\n* Preparing a blowpipe is extremely easy. Even if you try, you can''t make any mistake. (What mistake can you make in buying a 0.5" pipe of your desired length, anyway?)\n\n* Preparing a good suitable mouthpiece is a major headache. With 3 years of blowing, it still gives me headaches. There is little chance that the hole you punch/cut in the plastic cap would be in the CENTER of the damn thing. Mostly the hole gets on one side and it looks very funny, not to mention extremely hard to aim with.\n\n* Making dart cones comes with practice. Your first few will be very bad, but after you have wasted some 2 pots of superglue and 1 hour of effort, you will find the method which suits you. There isn''t one hard and fast rule about the size, the material and the weight of the cone. With practice, you will form your own method. There is no exception about the shape, though.\n\n* Even a badly formed needle dart amazes the beginners with its range and speed. While you won''t be able to shoot accurately with a bad dart, you would easily be able to blow it to distances of 60-70 feet. A properly formed needle dart, blown at 45° upwards (max projectile range angle) can be shot upto distances of 150 feet with a 4 ft pipe. With a 6 ft pipe (the standard for hunting), you can shoot it upto 200 ft if you learn how to quickly blow in with pressure.\n\n* The penetration power of the needle darts is shocking. At 40 feet, if you blow a dart at a tree, it would be impossible to pull it out with bare hands. I use a pliers (plass) to pull out darts from trees and other wooden objects. If you shoot at a biological object at 30 feet, with a 4 ft pipe, expect a penetration of half inch. If you shoot the same target at the same range with a 6 ft pipe, the penetration of a needle dart would be 1 inch.\n\n* When pulling out darts, always hold them from the needle, not the cone. If you hold it from the cone, the cone will tear apart and the needle will stay in the target.\n\n* I once shot an extremely annoying kid with a needle dart, in the leg, from 20 ft. I used only 1/4 of my lungs force and ... well ... he didn''t pester me for the next 6 months. The wound was hardly visible, but he limped for 2 weeks. You know what''s the moral of the story? It''s this: darts can never kill a person, but they definitely make his life extremely painful. NEVER shoot at ANY living thing which you don''t want to kill.\n\n* Shooting birds with darts is far far more fun than shooting with an airgun. With an airgun it is just looking through the scope and pressing a lever/trigger. With the blowpipe, you know it''s YOU who is shooting, not some mechanical device. It is nearly the same feeling as that of shooting with a slingshot (ghulail). Only the darts take more time and energy to prepare and you can''t afford to waste them.\n\n* Every properly formed dart takes around 6 minutes to make (after practice) and doesn''t cost more than 3 rs under any conditions. With one superglue bottle (15 rs), you can make about 30 darts. One thick needle (khandooi) costs around 1.5 rs where I live, but city guys should be able to get them at 1 rs.\n\n* Darts can be used over and again. The needle never fails to perform. When a dart gets useless, it only means that you need to pull out the needle and use it with a new cone. So the life of a dart is actually the life of it''s cone. My darts usually serve me 30-40 shots, but I pull them through to 60, although with a malfunctioning cone and lesser accuracy :D\n\n* Supreme tea sachets make for the best material for darts. After it comes the Surf Excel packets. Although the wrapping plastic film on cold drink bottles looks more smooth and lightweight, it is too limp for making a good, stable dart. They won''t serve accurately for more than 7-8 shots.\n\n* Blowgunning is a very addictive hobby. But it is very tiresome too. Making dart cones is the worst part of all. You can''t buy them from the market and you can''t expect anyone else to make the cones of your choice. In the long run, you will have to do it yourself. And it is extremely boring and monotonous task. Not to mention that you have to be careful from the start to the end. One failed cone = 6 minutes wasted + lots of annoyance.', ''),

I donot want to have 2 or 3 rifle for different purposes for example. 22 and 8 mm from rabbit to deer rather i prefer to have one rifle for all purposes, from rabbit to bear, in this way i will satisfied with my guns as i have all range of them. In my idea when you are walking in jungle you must have a suitable gun except shotgun to hunt everything you want it is not rational to carry with yourself one 8 mm and one. 22. So what kind of rifle is suitable in your idea to hunt from rabbit to bear as i noticed that you are very expert.[/QUOTE]\n\nWho me? No not at all.. I ABHOR loathe detest hunting.  The only things that I hunt are GCP kay Ghee kay dabbay. \n\nYou cannot get a .308 in semi auto. Reason being its classified as PB.  Since .308 is the civilian version/name of the 7.62x51 round. Or G3 round. \n\nAll AK 47 and G3 ammo firing semi autos are considered PB. (prohibited Bore)\n\nIn sindh only .22 lr rifle is allowed on npb license. However if you have a permit issued by the home department U may get a .222 or .223 semi auto rifle. (cost of permit around 30k)\n\nThe .223 USA made will be 1200k or .1.2 million  The Chinese version will be around 400k as of this week. However its ammo is cheap. Around 45 a pop for chinese and around 65 a pop for NATO Green tip. (Karachi rates) \n\nAn imported .222 will cost from around 220k up till 750k or so. However, imported ammo is around 200 a pop. \n\nAlso, these are not hunting rounds. But pure combat weapons. \n\nFor semi auto in hunting calibre  you can only avail .22lr in Sindh.', ''),

Dr Gilani''s bro trushot was very much accurate although I haven''t fired it due to shortage of time, but Verve bro and Dr Gilani shot it from the same 15 meters and the results were awesome (as you will see in pictures/Videos which he has taken). \n\nAfter the firing session Mr Noor Ud Din was kind enough to took us to their shotgun section and believe me that was the best part of our visit.. their SxS double barrel (single as well as double trigger) is really impressive (although the exported lot was out of stock), but still the standard ones are really good.. we also had the pleasure to see .410 bore SxS double barrel shotguns in different barrel lengths.\n\nLast but not the least we came across a 1911 which I thought its a Colt 1911 on my first sight but later came to know its DSA 1911.. Man O Man that 1911 was really awesome almost identical to Colt.. the finishing, the trigger were excellent.. again due to shortage of time couldn''t fired it.. they are in the making process but will be available to public in few month''s time according to Mr Noor Ud Din.\n \nI wish I had spend some more time and saw their more beauties, but due to the time factor we had to leave.. overall the trip was excellent.', ''),

Dr Gilani''s bro trushot was very much accurate although I haven''t fired it due to shortage of time, but Verve bro and Dr Gilani shot it from the same 15 meters and the results were awesome (as you will see in pictures/Videos which he has taken). \n\nAfter the firing session Mr Noor Ud Din was kind enough to took us to their shotgun section and believe me that was the best part of our visit.. their SxS double barrel (single as well as double trigger) is really impressive (although the exported lot was out of stock), but still the standard ones are really good.. we also had the pleasure to see .410 bore SxS double barrel shotguns in different barrel lengths.\n\nLast but not the least we came across a 1911 which I thought its a Colt 1911 on my first sight but later came to know its DSA 1911.. Man O Man that 1911 was really awesome almost identical to Colt.. the finishing, the trigger were excellent.. again due to shortage of time couldn''t fired it.. they are in the making process but will be available to public in few month''s time according to Mr Noor Ud Din.\n \nI wish I had spend some more time and saw their more beauties, but due to the time factor we had to leave.. overall the trip was excellent.[/QUOTE]\n\nOh man, DSA 1911!

(598870, ' [QUOTE=Enigmatic Desires;436626]And what is the range of the 3 different projectiles?\n\nAnd Hanh.. Thanks for taking the time to give us a detailed tutorial.. May you have dozens of youngsters from your tribal princess.[/QUOTE]\n\nThe range of your shot actually depends more on your PIPE LENGTH, than your dart, although both play their part. With every one foot of length added to the length of your pipe, you may add an extra 16-22 ft range for your pin darts and 13-17 ft for your broadhead ones. I have no idea about the stun darts range as I have never made any.\n\nNotice that this is the EFFECTIVE range of the shots which I am posting, not the length of distance added to the dart''s trajectory. This said, let me explain the few things which have their impact on a dart''s range and which effect they have:\n\n1- The power of your lungs. This is obviously the biggest factor. The harder you can blow, the faster and longer your shot goes.\n\n2- The weight of the dart. This is the next most important factor. Although you cannot shoot an empty cone accurately for more than 10 feet (it will go like a bullet for the first 10 feet and then suddenly turn randomly in the air and immediately drop to nearly zero speed). There is a minimum weight which a dart must have, to travel smoothly. I think it is around 700 mg or so, but I have never weighed them with a fine scale to know for sure. The more weight you add to this optimal value, the more powerful will your shot become (more shock generated to the target) but they will have lesser range and accuracy.\n\n3- The length of your pipe. For myself I think a 6 feet pipe gives optimal range versus lung force. This means, that for any pipe lesser than 6 feet, you cannot use all of your lung shot for blowing as the dart would already be out of the pipe before you finish blowing. For any length more than 6 feet, your lungs would already be empty before the dart gets out of the pipe. For europeans, americans and asians with tall, strong stature, this optimal pipe length is around 8 feet.\n\n4- The length of the dart. Yes, this also has its part in determining the range. Generally, the longer a dart is, the longer it''s range is, until you reach the optimal length, after which the range actually starts decreasing. The optimal dart length (from cone''s wide end to broadhead''s/needle''s sharp end) for a 4 feet pipe, for me, is between 5 and 6 inches. For a 6 feet pipe, I guess it would be between 6 and 7.5 feet.\n\n5- The shape of the dart and the quality of it''s material. The more solid is a dart''s cone (i.e. does not bend inside due to air drag), the longer and more predictable/accurate is the flight of the dart. The shape of the dart also has a large impact on the range and accuracy. Sometimes the cones of my darts are not in line with the needles. That is, there is slight angle between the cone and the needle. Those darts, besides having a spiraling flight, also have a much lesser range. For optimal range, your darts must be STRAIGHT.\n\nHaving said all this, here is what is my darts range. Notice that I have a 4 feet pipe.\n\nMy pin darts are usually between 5 and 6 inches of length and are generally straight. I can easily shoot my darts to distances of 120 feet. The EFFECTIVE RANGE of these darts (for which the penetration is at least 0.3 inch in flesh) is around 60 feet. This doesn''t look like damaging enough to bring down a crow, but trust me, I once hit a crow with nearly 0.2 inch (based on lung power used) penetration and it took 3 somersaults in the air before finally balancing itself. Sadly, it managed to escape, albeit with a very erratic flight. The dart was still stuck in it''s chest. For incapacitating a mouse or a snake (around 3 feet in length), you would need some 4-5 well places darts (around the head region). It won''t kill them, but they won''t be able to escape, either. However, at a distance of 30 feet or so, one good hit is enough to severely damage them and assuring their death, even if they manage to drag themselves out of reach.\n\nMy broadheads are around 3.5 to 4 inches in length. These have an effective range (0.3 inch penetration or more) of 40-45 feet. You can easily incapacitate a snake or a mouse with one hit of these. It won''t kill them, but it would definitely render them unable to escape. Same for a crow or a dove in this range. I use bicycle spokes (the ''wheel-wires'' for bicycle wheels) for making my broadheads. Although they come in free, these are too heavy and demand much effort in blowing. I am desperately looking for some wire or cord which is slightly lesser in thickness. I hope with them I would be able to increase the effective range and accuracy to nearly the same range as the pin tipped ones.\n\nI have no idea about the stun darts. While they would be great fun to break people''s light-bulbs (oh yeah baby!) and killing mice and other pests at a short range, I can''t think of any other useful exploitation for them. Never made them. My rough idea (based on their would-be weight) would be that their effective range (enough for incapacitating a mouse) would be around 30 feet.\n\nAnd yes, blowing is crazily fun thing to do. Just stay prepared for hours and hours of making dart cones. Once you start shooting a pipe, you would forget the airguns (for fun shooting, that is. if you kill birds as a need, not as a sport, you would have to stick to your airgun/shotgun).', ''),

B-)[/QUOTE]\n\nKeep nagging me and sometime I will post a few videos about preparing the darts.\n\nYou can get the pipes from any nearby hardware store. Remember to keep your pipe''s material to steel or aluminum. The diameter shouldn''t be less than 0.4 inches and not more than 0.5 inches. Although you CAN shoot easily with 0.6 inches too, but the pipe''s length would have to be limited to 4 feet in that case, meaning more power in your shots, but lesser range.', ''),

Pictures of SP01 curved grips were also taken. \n\nIt is great that they are taking everything in very positive manner from experienced gentlemen such as Dr Gilani, Jibs, Aquarius and others, and putting those in action. And plastic FO insert sites are being replaced with steel FO insert sites as well, as per recommendation given earlier by the honoured members.\n\nMy only recommendation, for what little it is worth as a novice shooter, would be a change in the shape of the trigger guard.

From what I''ve gathered, Diana P1000 looks like a much better choice, although at twice the price of the BT65, but worth it. PCP''s are all about accuracy, power and low sound report. You get all three in the Diana.   You can put the money you spend on the pump in the Diana. I can tell you the way around the pump. Just get a steel cylinder rated to 300 bar with a DIN connector and the Diana fill adapter will fit right on. You can then have it filled at a SCUBA diving facility if you''re in Karachi or call me if you''re in Rawalpindi / Islamabad. This setup is nice, easy and very convenient.  A used steel cylinder goes for around Rs. 5000 and carbon fibre for about twice as much. You may get them cheaper if you look around.   I''m surprised this information has never been given here before, even though I''ve seen a couple of posts asking for this kind of info. I asked once but there was not much help, so I looked around and found all the info and all the equipment I would ever need, even a compressor. It''s enough to run a PCP club.  Before you go this route, please take all the relevant safety precautions about what kind of cylinder to get, how to use, hydro testing dates etc.  If you''re interested, I''ll be glad to help.[/QUOTE]  Dear 76m I have a PCP but still couldn''t manage to find the fill apparatus.

(598968, 'Hatsan MOD 99 Review [FONT=arial][COLOR=#323D4F]Asalam o Alaikum,[/COLOR]\n\n[COLOR=#323D4F]I just received my Hatsan Mod 99 yesterday. It was purchased from Hira Arms Lahore and has been shipped to Karachi. Posting first snaps of the beauty. A full detailed review of the Airgun will be shared soon.[/COLOR]\n\n[B]Background:[/B]\n[COLOR=#323D4F]My passion for Airguns is little over a year old. My first Airgun was a Chinese Airgun and a clone of Diana Magnum. I was initially quoted 9k for it but later due to shortage of stock, I had to buy it from a different shop for 11k. I never got to measure the force of it on a Chrony but it was very power with decent accuracy even though the trigger was a little hard but not too much of a bother. The sights were fiber optic but the plastic used was of fairly low quality. I shot on it almost every day for two months and then the breach seal got damaged. THe FPS of the Airgun dropped drastically and I had absolutely no idea about technicalities of an Airgun so I thought something had gone wrong with the spring. I panicked and sold it back and bought a Kral Instead (asking price was Kral was 14k and in exchange I had to pay 9k over). If I would have just replaced the seal the problem would have been solved.[/COLOR]\n\n[COLOR=#323D4F]Anyhow, the Kral was much lighter and the trigger was very nice. It was very crisp as compared to the Chinese. The gun was accurate as well. After shooting around 1000 pellets with it I checked it on Chrony and It was giving 560-570 fps. A decent Airgun for random plinking at 10-15 yards but now I was looking for something a bit more powerful. Also in-between my Kral developed some problems. The gun refused to load. Felt as if the Sear kept slipping, anyhow got it fixed from a gun smith and the problem never happened again. The breach seal got damaged as well so replaced it with a Teflon made custom seal.[/COLOR]\n\n[COLOR=#323D4F]I got rid of my Kral, sold it to a dear friend and got myself a Gamo Shadow (which I purchased from txshooter). The Gamo felt very nice had I fixed a 3x9-44E scope on it. The setup turned out to be pretty good for the price and I loved everything about the Shadow except its trigger. I shot around 2000 pellets with the Airgun and even after breaking in I just hated the trigger. The Gamo was giving 670-690 FPS and just to give a rough idea of its penetration power, I had shot at a green coconut from about 30 plus yards and the Pellet crossed the coconut and the one behind it. I shot several pellets and all of them went through.[/COLOR]\n\n[COLOR=#323D4F]Anyhow a very dear friend of mine was very interested in buying my Shadow so I sold it to him. From over a month I had been looking out and researching for my next Airgun and after doing much research (and the amount of budget I could have spared) I got myself a Hatsan Mod 99 for 21.5k including delivery charges from Hira Arms at a very special price (courtesy of a dear friend) else the normal asking rate is 24k. [/COLOR]\n\n[COLOR=#323D4F]Now that I have the airgun in my hand, lets see what Hatsan Mod 99 has to offer. \n\n[/COLOR][/FONT][URL="http://postimg.org/image/rvxbqmfth/"][IMG]http://s26.postimg.org/rvxbqmfth/IMG_20140430_091036.jpg[/IMG][/URL]\n[FONT=arial][COLOR=#323D4F]\n[/COLOR][/FONT][URL="http://postimg.org/image/5zasq92mt/"][IMG]http://s26.postimg.org/5zasq92mt/IMG_20140430_091113.jpg[/IMG][/URL]\n[FONT=arial][COLOR=#323D4F]\n[/COLOR][/FONT][URL="http://postimg.org/image/s9ynq7zx1/"][IMG]http://s26.postimg.org/s9ynq7zx1/IMG_20140430_091509.jpg[/IMG][/URL][FONT=arial][COLOR=#323D4F]\n[/COLOR][/FONT]', ''),

(599049, ' [QUOTE=Jibz;436840]Yesterday evening, I got this video from Dr Gillani sir. 90 rounds were fired with 6 Mags. During the 4th magazine you can see that I had to dodge several empty casings coming towards my forehead. I guess earlier we missed to point out to DSA that the placement of the [B]Ejector [/B]needs to be slightly altered so that empty casings are directed away from the shooter. This can simply be done by bringing the contact point of the ejector near the base of the casing from where extractor is pulling it back.[URL="http://s1341.photobucket.com/user/Jibz77/media/Trushot 9x19/20140405_103814_zps898b8b83.jpg.html"][IMG]http://i1341.photobucket.com/albums/o744/Jibz77/Trushot 9x19/20140405_103814_zps898b8b83.jpg[/IMG][/URL]/QUOTE]\n\nYou''ll find that its the extractor at fault here instead of ejector. The ? shell contacting tip of the extractor may have deformed or chipped or even machined as such hence it is not sitting flush with shell and this results in shells flying at shooter''s face. Had same issue with the Walther (due to poor extractor finishing by Walther) and after some extractor filing it ejects low and 4 o clock consistently now. You can swap extractors, modiify 1-2 to sit flush with shell and that should confirm.', ''),
