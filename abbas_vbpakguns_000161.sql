On his way his car got heat up badly and he called me. So I went there with my car and we exchanged. 2-3 friends also showed up in another car. Anyway, we slowly drove back to the city stopping frequently to water the radiator. \nJust before sohrab gotth intersection, we had to do another refilling. As we were about to leave, a Rangers mobile arrived and stopped us. Apparently they were there to investigate some gun shots and their incharge was asking us whether we fired. He ordered both cars to be searched and I told him that I have a weapon. [COLOR=#ff0000][U][I][B]They got the weapon from center console and I told him it is chambered.[/B][/I][/U][/COLOR] He was like why have u kept it chambered and I replied because it is a defensive weapon and needs to be chambered otherwise it is of little use in emergency. Anyway, I handed over the license and the 144 permit. They thoroughly checked everything. I even told him about the car situation and that it is not mine but he asked us again if we fired the shots. I told him to smell the barrel for gun powder and check the bullets. He counted bullets from both magazine. I had total 31 bullets. 15+1 and 15 so he was now convinced that we were not the culprits. The license was recently computerized and had no PS entry but they did not take notice of it. \n\nSo we shook hands and went on our ways.[/QUOTE]\n\nRangers usually ask the person to remove the mag and empty the gun before handing it over, they DO NOT reach for or take the gun by themselves, it simply isn''t allowed.\n\nAlso it is the holder''s responsibility to first unload and empty the gun and then hand it over, they do not and cannot object to a simple safety and lawful act.\n\nI have been stopped by rangers and the first question they asked was "weapon hai aap k paas?" i said yes and they said to show it.\nI categorically announced that "the gun is in it''s holster against the door sleeve and that I am now reaching for it, will empty it and hand it over" the reason being was to clearly communicate what i was about to do. they did not object and seemed slightly pleased with me removing the mag, emptying the chamber and handing it over with the slide locked back.\n\nthen i gave them the 144 [I]first [/I]and the license second. reason being they are more interested in the permit and don''t give two hoots about license authenticity etc. He proceeded to call up HQ to verify the 144. took a little over half an hour in the whole process.\n\nDuring the time we were waiting for HQ verification, the rangers asked if i belonged to any armed forces or had military background? LOL, felt really good though :)\n\nI said no, i''m just a poor civilian looking out for my life and property, they smiled and said "the way you handle the gun plus your appearance is very officer-like."\n\nAhem, I felt pretty good after that incident ;)', ''),

Thanks[/QUOTE]\n\n\nFor a full wrap around grip. U will have to go for a PT 92 I am afraid. PT 92 grips are available here in Karachi starting from 3 to 4.5k or so. \n\nHowever with the NP 42 the grip is integral to the frame. its all one piece. (unlike the NP 34 that has a full grip in the thread I shared above) Soo U can not get a separate grip for it. You will have to use a wrap around sleeve for it.  Thats the one I used. \n\nAs regards bothering me. Oh no not at all sir. On the contrary I take your concerns very highly since they are both valid and genuine. And  I am extremely grateful to you for giving me the privilege of your trust.  :)\n\nAnd lastly u dont have to worry about CQC (close quaters combat) ranges. Even a local TT can do that much.. If the shooter has the experience to do it well. And experience comes with time and ammo. Which is why the money that U save U can use to buy lots of ammo and become a really good crack shot with it. Once U have learnt the ropes You can then get something that will allow you to make full use of your new found skill. \n\n\nThe NP 42 is the ultimate weapon for practice in terms of price and value for money.

(557858, ' Some people keep saying if you spend a little more you will get a "better" gun. But what more are you getting when you spend the extra money... besides more room in your pocket.  My vote goes to the the CF. For me it is the best gun upto and including 75k. Because... it fits my hand the best, followed by a CZ. I have Glocks just for the sake of having them, since they are very cheap here. But IMHO, I don''t like them... they don''t fit my hand (feels like grabbing a block compared to a CZ) and they have a horrible trigger. If you bench rest any modern gun, the difference in accuracy is going to be so negligible, most shooters will not be able to extract any inherent advantage one particular gun may have over another. However, what will affect accuracy for most people is how they interact with the gun. If it feels good to you, and you are comfortable with its grip, weight, grip angle, and trigger, you will shoot that gun better than a much more expensive gun which is not comfortable to you. Same thing with reliability. Now I''m not talking about going to war and crawling through trenches, having to expose your weapon to mud and sand, but for civillian use in society, I''ve never come across a well maintained modern gun that isn''t reliable, or can not be made reliable with very simple adjustment. One common knock against the CF is its stiff safety, which is accurate... sort of. The CF is not an "art work" gun for looking at, it is a "tool" gun you buy to use, and if you use it, the safety will smooth out (or just use it as a decocker only). Another one is that it can not fire HP''s, which is again accurate... sort of. Remember the CF is designed for the military, so it was intended for FMJs. If you want to shoot HP, simple adjustment... just polish the feed ramp and/or give the magazine lips a slight adjustment. The way I see it, in the world of modern guns (unless you''re in competition) when you spend more, you''re not getting a "better" gun per se, but you get branding, exotic materials, and fancy finishes. Function wise, the best designs have already been established, such as the Browning tilting barrel, AK''s gas driven piston, AR''s direct impingement... theres nothing thats [I]really[/I] new, everything is just a tweak or evolution of those, and other existing platforms. Anyways, once again that is just my opinion, which is totally irrelevant like everyone else''s, if the gun in question doesn''t feel right to you.', ''),

Please note tht with the ''inadvertent'' double tap I was not aiming but merely pointing the weapon. \n\nIts natural pointibility is higher then any pistol I have shot and that includes the venerable glock as well.[/QUOTE]\n\nI do however disagree with the description of it''s trigger. I''ve tried 3 different Cats and did not find the triggers to be that soft, in fact quite decent. In fact I compared and the trigger pull seemed only slightly softer than my TP-9, which is why i didnt have any problems, nor did other friends who shot it for the first time (ofcourse we can''t compare with hammer-fired dambooks)\n\nI guess it all boils down to "from one itchy finger to another" situation, maybe your trigger finger itches more than mine...?? ;)', ''),

(557882, ' [QUOTE=Fudgepacker;395811]Some people keep saying if you spend a little more you will get a "better" gun. But what more are you getting when you spend the extra money... besides more room in your pocket.  My vote goes to the the CF. For me it is the best gun upto and including 75k. Because... it fits my hand the best, followed by a CZ. I have Glocks just for the sake of having them, since they are very cheap here. But IMHO, I don''t like them... they don''t fit my hand (feels like grabbing a block compared to a CZ) and they have a horrible trigger. If you bench rest any modern gun, the difference in accuracy is going to be so negligible, most shooters will not be able to extract any inherent advantage one particular gun may have over another. However, what will affect accuracy for most people is how they interact with the gun. If it feels good to you, and you are comfortable with its grip, weight, grip angle, and trigger, you will shoot that gun better than a much more expensive gun which is not comfortable to you. Same thing with reliability. Now I''m not talking about going to war and crawling through trenches, having to expose your weapon to mud and sand, but for civillian use in society, I''ve never come across a well maintained modern gun that isn''t reliable, or can not be made reliable with very simple adjustment. One common knock against the CF is its stiff safety, which is accurate... sort of. The CF is not an "art work" gun for looking at, it is a "tool" gun you buy to use, and if you use it, the safety will smooth out (or just use it as a decocker only). Another one is that it can not fire HP''s, which is again accurate... sort of. Remember the CF is designed for the military, so it was intended for FMJs. If you want to shoot HP, simple adjustment... just polish the feed ramp and/or give the magazine lips a slight adjustment. The way I see it, in the world of modern guns (unless you''re in competition) when you spend more, you''re not getting a "better" gun per se, but you get branding, exotic materials, and fancy finishes. Function wise, the best designs have already been established, such as the Browning tilting barrel, AK''s gas driven piston, AR''s direct impingement... theres nothing thats [I]really[/I] new, everything is just a tweak or evolution of those, and other existing platforms. Anyways, once again that is just my opinion, which is totally irrelevant like everyone else''s, if the gun in question doesn''t feel right to you.[/QUOTE]\n\nExcellent comments....', ''),

If the importers/dealers take it out what do they do with em?[/QUOTE]\n\nImporters order without these items as they get the price down that way, and then blame the customs most of the times for taking them off to justify the high price - ''wo luteray nikal letay hain aur humara kharcha to utna hi hai'' blah blah blah. For example it is not uncommon for Cougar in USA to come with 4 mags, but importers here only order 2 mag stock. Same applies to all these rubber covered chain locks .... if customs were taking them off and selling them onwards later, then they would be found in the market but they are not in the market. It is the importers who do all this to reduce their costs and keep the prices high in the market.\n\nCougar mag in Turkey retails for US£25 (export is cheaper), and in PK it ranges between PKR8k-PKR10K and not easy to find either. No doubt, some stock is as per USA specifications (with chain lock and 3rd mag) for Sigs but dealers ''thuk lagatay hain'' at that time by removing the 3rd mag etc. And others just hike up the price for these ''extras'' if selling the original package as a whole.', ''),

No right?[/QUOTE]\n\nlet me try to explain what this means...\non the surface it means that legally owned licenses and weapons are safe and only illegal firearms will be targetted to curb crime, however criminals do NOT suddenly realize the error of their ways and walk into a police station to surrender their illegal weapon! Since it''s an announced activity, criminals will take their stuff into hiding....\n\nNow the other thing i learnt from my friends in the LEAs, is that police also are given targets just like corporate sales people or bankers etc... they assess last year''s crime and give targets that this year crime rate should be xyz% lower than last year in your area, for example. That is one reason it is such a hassle to get a FIR registered and usually a "kachi parchi" is given... Police discourage citizens from getting FIRs lodged coz it will show negatively on their performance.\n\nLikewise, traffic police are given targets for number of penalties and fines issued which is why you must have noticed that at certain times they become extremely vigilant in order to achieve that target.\n\nIn this case they will be given targets and there will be competition amongst various areas'' cop shops as to who confiscates the most illegal weapons. \n\nNow since the actual criminals would have conveniently gone underground temporarily (after all it is an announced activity) that would leave you and I...\n\nnow when you and I drive around with a clean weapon and proper legal documents and are stopped for checking or some neighbourhood is targetted for a house-to-house search and clean weapons are found, that would be frustrating, right?\n\nSo how difficult would it be for a LEO out to achieve his target, to just dispose of the license or tear it up and throw it away and proclaim your or my legal weapon as illegal..?????', ''),

So you are saying that that grip on np34 cann''t be used on NP42? right? :(\n\nI looked on the net and found that a "Hogue handall" may be used, its a wrap around grip, and just covers part of the grip instead of complete grip area...is that you are talking about???\n\nI am asking because on Hogue''s website they are asking pistols name for which you need the grip... I am thinking to get it from states through a relative, so that he bring it here... So which pistol''s grip is same like np42 so that it s grip I can order...as I am unable to find np42 in their list ... :(\n\nAlso Kia Hogue k ilawa bhe koi good quality grips hoti han...? may be kisi our brand ke full size grip fit ho jaen... Ya koi chance nai ???[/QUOTE]\n\nThank you for your kind prayers dear sir. \n\nOnce again I would like to reiterate that the grip is not separate in the case of the NP 42 unlike other weapons but an integral part of the frame itself. I.e its not that u take out a couple of screws and put in fresh grips. For that U will need a weapon different from the NP 42 platform. \n\nSo no wonder the hogue people did not have it in their catalogue. What U need is  a ''universal'' sleeve for it. Something that u just slip over the frame. not screw it. Its a grip sleeve and it can be in full size of medium size depending on your preference. Yes the chinse do make grips as well. But I cannot say if they last longer then the hogue ones or not.', ''),

(558254, ' The unique thing about the firearms world is there are no "unsung heroes", it is the epitome of industrial evolution, rather than revolution. Unlike electronics, or even automobiles, Glock 17''s don''t become unrecognizably different every several years. If Henry Ford were to come back today, he would not know a thing about the modern automobile, but I bet John Browning could come back and be able to immediately pick up any modern gun and be able to work on it. Since the beginning, the best designs carry on to this day. With the 1911 and TT33 both being perfect examples, as they are more popular now than they ever were. Along with Mauser actions, pump actions, AK''s, AR''s, even the Glock is getting on 30 years old now. Another one is the gattling gun, it has evolved, but the same basic principle is still being mounted on the most cutting edge fighter aircraft in the world. Just like the timeless war machine M2 BMG from 1918. I believe if a particular gun isn''t around anymore, it usually failed for a reason. As I mentioned in another thread, there really isn''t anything "new" in all the cool new guns, maybe different materials, but just basic old principles re-interpretated.', ''),

War vets, professional shooters, and old hunters, will all say the same thing. Your hearing can only get worse, why deliberately damage it, especially when it''s so easy to prolong it. Even when hunting, a situation where you need to hear and need protection at the same time, we use electronic muffs that block out gunshots and amplify ambient sounds. At the range, people commonly double up with foam ear plugs and just crank up the volume on the muffs to have a conversation or to hear instructions.[/QUOTE]\n\nCompletly agree.I use hearing protection almost religiously when training.I have suffered damage to to my hearing over the years when i was young and foolish but about 12 year ago i started using hearing protection regularly I rarely hunt antha too is limited to wild boar hunting 85% of the time but my shooting sessions can be up-to 1000 rounds on occasions so n those circumstances,protection is  must.\nI was questioning shahjee''s asertion that in a life or death situation we don''t get to wear hearing protection before the event.Protection of my hearing is gonna be the least of my concerns in those times', ''),

Since i dual citizenship Pakistani+Canadian, NICOP allow me a visa free entry into Pakistan. I''d rather not travel back to Canada without it. \n\nAlso when i travel to Pakistan how do i start this process. Any farms i need to fill before i go to Nadra office?

Should i change the weapon before i go for the Nadra office?[/QUOTE]\n\nBro, First of all, they won''t keep your NICOP. It is needed just for you identity and they will take a copy of it.\n\nSecondly, first check what your license says. If it says One NPB weapon, you can easily change .30 bore to 9mm pistol. If not; you will have to take permission from MOI first. Anyway, apply for card after change of weapon as it is cumbersome process.\n\nApplying for conversion to NADRA Card is very easy. You need original MOI Book, a duly filled, signed application form (it can be downloaded from MOI''s website), two photographs (size 1 inch X 1 inch) and copy of CNIC / NICOP. Go to nearest NADRA Centre having ALP counter (it can be checked from any NADRA Office, usually it is situated in District or Divisional Headquarter City like  Rawalpindi, Abbotabad etc).

Have a look at shape of cartidge and bullet, bullet is hard you can easily put even 30 bullets in a pistol magazine without any fear of bottom bullet being compressed but same is not true for shotguns particularly when you are talking about 10 round magazine.\n\nYes sir you are right and have a plus point in it having multiple 5 shot mags is definitely a good idea\n\nBut what if the cartridge gets jammed (and it is not very infrequent in this particular shotgun) rendering it useless then what to do with even a dozen spare loaded mags ?

A pump shotgun has to be manually cycled for each shot. Yes this  is easy on a flat range, but waking up at 3am, confronting an armed  intruder, you are likely going to be under more stress than you have  ever experienced, and will quickly find your motor skills out the  window. Short stroking happens to even the most experienced shooters  just on the range, the chances of it happening in a scenario like this  are not only high, but potentially deadly for the user. Another issue is  reloading. Shotguns are already limited capacity-wise, and rather than  changing a magazine on a carbine or handgun, typically must be loaded  one shell at a time, which is not only much slower, but also requires  more training to do well. When you are in a panic state, no matter how  much training you have, it''s not going to be easy to remove shell by  shell from a saddle or wherever else you store extra ammo and feed it  one at a time into the tube.

You can imagine the awe an 8 year old will have for something which actually shoots projectiles, albeit plastic ones. I lived and slept with it, and practiced on my collection of plastic farm animals.\r\n\r\nTHE GUN\r\nIt is a Japanese airsoft gun, and as it is almost 30 years old, the model and brand are moot, but you can see the details in the pictures. It fires 7mm plastic pellets so slow that if you shoot at more than 20ft distance, you can actually see the pellet trajectory………. The gun came with 50 pellets, but as I couldn’t find replacement pellets, I carefully collected them whenever I used it, but over the years around half have been lost.\r\nIt loads thru a push-up port fore of the trigger, which also works as a rear sight, cocks with a side cocking handle on the right side, and the effort needed is pretty low. It has a manual safety, with S and F marks just behind the trigger. The box has a built-in target sheet. I loved the gun, and still have the original manual and warranty card. Everything is in Japanese so don’t know what it says.\r\n\r\nThe pictures below are in following order, sorry for the crappy quality and bedroom settings:\r\n1,2,3. the box with built-in target sheet (the plane stickers are mine)\r\n4,5,6. the gun, cocking handle and loading port, grips (in my now adult hands)\r\n7,8. the pellets, compared to a .177 diabolo pellet, pellet box\r\n9. manual and warranty card\r\n10.manual safety.\r\n\r\nMy next airgun came almost 21 years later, details in next post inshaAllah.\r\n\r\nThis is nostalgia, so please take it in good humor.', ''),

If you are in a situation where you feel threatened, or anticipate having to use your firearm in self defense, shoot from double action. Once the adrenaline flows, it is much easier to operate, in fact you won''t even notice the heavier trigger, versus having to manipulate a safety. Unless you are trained and highly practiced, in situations of high stress it is not uncommon for people to start shaking, and the fine motor skills it takes to work tiny switches or flip small levers all go out the window.[/QUOTE]\n\nCocked and unlocked is a sure fire recipe for disaster.

(559311, 'Fast Forward 23 years THE GAMO P-800\r\n\r\nIn 2005, I went with a friend to Al-Mustafa Enterprises at Lucky Star where he was buying local made TTs for his guards. I happened to check out a Gamo Shadow 1000, but at Rs.8,500 it was way beyond my pocket (at that time). So instead I settled for a Gamo P-800.\r\n\r\nThe Gun\r\n\r\nThe P-800 is a break-barrel .177 caliber air pistol with an advertised velocity of 328fps. It is single shot, spring powered, with manual safety and windage adjustable rear sights. At Rs.1800 at that time it was a good deal, and after 8 years and countless number of pellets with zero maintenance, it is still a very good deal.\r\n\r\nInitially I even put two local Nishan pellets in the gun (one behind the other) and they would hit the target at 4-5 yards with two distinct thwacks. The local pellets are pretty loose fitting, and will fall out the barrel if you tilt the gun enough downwards, so I figured double-shooting will do no harm. It sustained my use and abuse, and over the years took its fair share of lizards and a few pigeons. It will pierce a cold drink can from both sides at 5 yards using Irani pellets. It is accurate enough for a novice like me, enough for casual plinking and hunting small game to a max 10 yards IMHO.\r\n\r\nLizard killing is a bit difficult, as the distance is generally less than 3 yards, the kill zone for large ones is 0.25inch wide x 1.25inch high at max, and I shoot at an oblique angle to avoid ricochets which can come at an alarming speed off a brick wall. I generally use back of a chair as a rest in such situations.\r\n\r\nSome pics, sorry again for poor quality. The size comparison is with a Stoeger Cougar 9mm.', ''),

(559448, ' [B]CZ 452 Tangent Sight Bullet Drop Table\n[/B]\nCZ is well known for the rear tangent sight that is available on some of their 22LR rifles. The distance markings on tangent sight are in meters. Many hunters and shooters like me are used to distance measurements in yards instead of meters. Since I own a 22LR CZ 452-2E ZKM, I wanted to develop a bullet drop table for this rifle.  \n\nThe tangent sight metric markings are valid with high velocity ammunition. The sight is set at the factory at 50 meters. The calibration of the Tangent sight can be corrected by moving the ramp-mounted front sight. For reference, small hash marks are on the barrel where the sight ramp is attached. I recommend aligning the tangent sight at 75 or 100 meters as small error in point of impact at shorter range results in magnified error at longer distances.\n\nI used Winchester Wildcat [WW22LR] 40-grain ammunition to generate the following bullet drop table. The Wildcat has muzzle velocity of 1255 feet per second. Velocity at 100 yards is of 1016 feet per second. The ballistic coefficient is calculated from this velocity change between the two distances. \n\nFor each metric marking on the tangent sight I derived bullet drop data from distance of 10 yards to 220 yards in 10-yard intervals.

With the full-size I get 2 extra rounds, a longer barrel, and... At first glance, the gun seems well-made and solid, but was lighter than expected. Personally, I think the fit and finish on it is better than my friend''s black Taurus PT-92, the ergonomics seem better too, but that is subjective. \n I remember a senior member stating that he preferred the "rail-less" look of the CZ999. Although this is a matter of opinion, I personally find the addition of the rail quite aesthetically pleasing.[/QUOTE]\nCongrats on the new gun! Ive never seen an EZ9 in either size, but if it is like the Sig 226 and 229, the barrel length is only about a half inch longer, and grip barely a quarter inch, so I think the full size is the best choice. If the EZ is aluminum framed as well, that would be why it feels light. Ergonomicswise, the Sig layout is described as the perfect placement of controls, so you would be justified in thinking it feels better than a PT, and as a lefty I love how it has an ambi decocker... unlike the Sig.

That was built in 1909.  It is proofed for nitro loads, has an octagonal/round barrel, 3 selectable express leaf sights at the rear, two selectable front sights.  The action is tuned and has double set triggers. The front trigger alone is 2 lbs.  The rear set trigger pulls at 6, and sets the front trigger to 2 oz.  The previous owner maintained it well and glass bedded the stock.\n\nThat is their Grade 2 of 4 ascending grades.  The action screws align with the action and are engraved as flowers.  The stock has that checkering and grain.  They sell for about US$1500.  I got a deal from a forum member on the Gew 88 forum.\n\nThe military rifles fed from en bloc clips.

I shot 2x14 pellet clips and the pressure dropped to 140 bar from a max 200 bar. perhaps it will get better with use, but seems like 30-35 shots per fill. There is a slight recoil, perhaps because of the barrel shroud which covers the whole barrel and has holes near the receiver end from where the air escapes.\nRight now i get home 10ish at night and busy thru the weekend so will take it to khilji bhai next weekend for a chrony test inshaAllah.

(560179, 'Glock overview... are you missing out? Seeing the local prices of CZs, HKs, and Sigs, they seem expensive but within reason, or at least within comprehension, considering the market conditions. However, the position of Glock in the Pakistani market has always intrigued me. Selling at up to 7 times the MSRP (manufacturers suggested retail price), yet people still knowingly and happily buy them up. How did it become such an object of lust and status? \n\nI am fortunate to have owned at some point, or had access to, almost all the popular brands and models of hand guns currently for sale here, and with that experience, and if you will bear with me, I''d like to give an honest and unbiased opinion about a brand surrounded by the most mystique, and among the most desirable in Pakistan; the Glock. \n\nFirst, we must look through the hype. Because when it comes to marketing, most of it is either fictional or exaggeration (ie. product placement - Glock has a lot of screen time in movies), and within the firearms industry, no one will argue the fact that Glock is head and shoulders above everyone else in that regard. Just as HK had always made a quality product, but their rise to fame came from the 1980 incident at the Iranian embassy in London. After SAS agents were broadcast on international TV armed with MP5''s in full tactical gear, gas masks, and taking down terrorists while rescuing hostages, just like a real life action movie... every gun enthusiast had to have one, while other enthusiasts were created as people became enamoured with the bright red HK logo, like a badge for kick a$$. But in popular culture, action movies, hip-hop music, the Glock rules. In any industry, a mediocre product with great marketing, will always be more successful than a great product with mediocre marketing.\n\nSecondly, and probably the main reason for Glock''s popularity here (among civilians and LEA''s), is their affordability. $550 to no more than $800 (about 30% less for LE), but most often less than MSRP. It also helps that their pricing structure makes sense. That is, they''re all about the same price! Understandably, rarer, more specialized, better equipped models (eg G34) are a bit pricier than the more common mainstream models (G17). I can''t stand companies that have a "stategy" of: the larger the caliber, the higher the price. It''s insulting since most consumers today are sophisticated enough to know, any difference in cost to produce a 9mm vs a 45, is insignificant. Another point that lends to Glock''s economy is the efficiency of their design. Not only are the parts cheap, but if you buy another mag for your G17, you also have an extra one for your 19, and 26. \n\nThirdly, reliability and durability. Yes, Glock has a rock solid reputation in this regard, but are they indeed more reliable and/or durable than other pistols? Yes, they absolutely [B]were...[/B] [I]in the ''80''s[/I]. But what about now? Compared against modern competitors such as Springfield XD, S&W M&P, CZ 75, Sig 226, Kahr PM9, Walther PPQ, Beretta 92, and HK USP... maybe they are, maybe they aren''t. What about accuracy you ask. In my experience with those guns, I can say with confidence, Glocks aren''t more or less accurate. Keep in mind this not a category of [I]target[/I] guns. The accuracy standard for most American police departments is 4-5" at 25m, and any one of the above guns is capable of that. Furthermore, that type of combat accuracy is all a good shooter needs to be competitive in IPSC, IDPA, or any of the other shooting games.\n\nFourthly comes subjective opinion. IMHO they are just plastic guns, have uncomfortable grips, and horrible triggers. What do I mean? Well, let''s see. You can call it polymer, or you could call it super-duper-extra-special-high-tech-space-age resin, the bottom line is, it''s still plastic. Now, Glock is widely known as the first polymer framed gun. When it came on the market here, it was all over the news and huge contoversy over how it would slip by airport security and blah, blah, blah. I cant even go through a metal detector with change in my pocket, but just disregard the pound of steel that is the slide. That was all just ignorant anti gun propaganda, but what''s interesting though, is that the G17 was [B]not[/B] the first plastic gun. HK''s VP70 predated Glock by over a decade! The difference was, the VP70 never had a role starring alongside Bruce Willis in Die Hard... see what I mean about marketing :)  To be fair, polymer does have its advantages, such as light weight, won''t rust, flexible yet strong, resists the elements (doesn''t expand and contract with changes in moisture and temperature), so theres nothing wrong with it, thats why everybody makes a plastic model now, but I wouldn''t pay extra for it. \n\nWhat''s up with the grip? You can argue that is a subjective issue since everybody''s hand is different. But let me ask you this: how many people have held a CZ Shadow with the factory rubber grips and found it uncomfortable? Or how many have picked up a 1911 and thought it didn''t feel right? Sure, comfort can be subjective, but there are designs which are generally accepted as being universally comfortable. Accordingly, I think of  the Glock as being on the opposite end of that spectrum for three reasons: One, the grip angle is too shallow. If I close my eyes, grip the gun and naturally point straight, when I open my eyes the gun is invariably aimed too high. Two, the texturing is either too slick (gen 1-3), or too rough (RTF and gen 4). Three, the hump on the back. There''s a reason 1911''s went from arched mainspring housings to flat ones. \n\nWhats wrong with the "safe action trigger"? How about everything. Ok maybe that''s an exaggeration. It is crisp, with no first to second shot transition iris consistent, and the reset is nice and short, but overall, I still don''t like it. On the topic of caliber, the philosophy of one of my tactical trainers was: either have big bullets (45ACP) or a lot of bulets (9mm). He was against 40S&W because, not being one or the other, it is a compromise. Mind you, he is a huge proponent of Glock, as I am of the 40. But how he views the caliber, is how I see Glock triggers. Not being single action nor double action, it is a compromise, and therefore compromised. It is not light enough to enhance accuracy as a single action, and it is not heavy enough to have the security of a double action. In my opinion, the "safe action trigger" is anything but safe. The sales line is: the gun won''t discharge unless deliberate pressure is applied to the trigger (or something like that), but what happens if [B]accidental[/B] pressure is applied to the trigger? Should something accidentally get in the trigger guard, that little blade is not going prevent an ND. I personally know of three instances of NDs, all happened while getting into or out of a vehicle, and all with a holstered Glock. Another issue with the blade is that it does not retract flush with the the trigger face. I sand them down on all of my Glocks, otherwise it only takes a magazine or two before pressing that narrow edge  really gets annoying.\n \nSo there you have it. Sure it''s been around for a while, but Glock wasn''t the first at anything (not even the first high capacity 9mm, the Hi Power rightfully claims that title), it definitely isn''t the last, nor is it the only polymer framed striker fired pistol. Take away the intangibles and compared to the current crop of "plastic fantastics" it''s a pretty average gun. I admit, I fell victim to the hype, and bought my first Glock 17 without even holding it. To tell you the truth, after I played with it for a while, I thought to myself, "it isn''t that special". In fact I was kind of disappointed. Partly because of the crappy trigger and the uncomfortable grip, but mainly because it didn''t live up to the hype. Yet I don''t think [I]any[/I] gun could have lived up to that kind of hype. I don''t remember exactly how much I paid back then, but it was around $600. I can''t even begin to imagine how I''d feel if I had paid over 300,000PKR for it. Maybe I would have convinced myself that it was perfect. Afterall, their slogan is "Glock perfection", they wouldn''t call it that if it weren''t true... would they? Regardless, despite all my criticisms, I got another, and another, and another. I guess the MSRP works. The manufacturer knows, at that particular price point, there is value in the product, and I knew it too. However, if a drastic change is made to one side of the equation, without balancing it out(ie. charging more without giving more), the formula no longer makes sense. If I had to pay Pak prices, I''d just as soon not have one; but rather two, three, four, or five, of [I]something else[/I]. For those of you who can afford it, why not. For those of you who are still wishing, relax, you''re really not missing out on much at all.\n\nWell, that''s it for my perspective as an outsider. Id be interested in hearing thoughts from local Glock owners, aspiring Glock owners, and anti Glock owners...', ''),

(560189, ' Custom parts is indeed a common theme when discussing Glocks. But after some thought, I came to the conclusion that it''s a non issue for a couple reasons. First, aside from minor things such as slide plates, grip plugs, and sights, most people run their Glocks stock. Because they work the best when left that way, and also because using a modified weapon for self defense is suicide in court. Secondly, Glock indeed enjoys a vast and comprehensive aftermarket, but it''s advantage in that regard has again been whittled away over time by the competition. It may not have been a decade ago, but now, when drop in trigger kits, aftermarket magazines, barrels, springs, sights, carbine attachments, grip surfaces, lights, and lasers, become available for one, they are usually available for all.', ''),

I.e S/W MP series is for Rs. 200000-250000, Steyr M9 at +200000 also, just to mention some of the available plastic counterparts to the Glock. Hence, it''s not a Glock only syndrome over here!\n[/SIZE]\nThis in no way is meant as justification to the plunder. The point is that it''s related to all European/American imports due to the complex traffic of these items en-route to our market. With this respect, I''d like to say that even SIGS and HK''s should be priced much lower.\n[/COLOR]\n2) The Glock, as Mian Jee mentioned quite rightly, usually preserves it value at resale point, contrary to all other brands which even if sold the very next day of purchase would depreciate over here by some 10-20%, even more in case of heavier usage.\n\n3) People love the availability of add on items, customization, etc.[/B]\n\nHence, to sum it all up, people who can afford going this range of purchase in Pakistan basically pay the bit extra edge vs other options of it''s kind available, to get a better, more stable footing wrt to resale, if required. \n\nThose who keep it, enjoy the status attached and the versatility of customizations, which are not quite available with other brand handguns, else than with the Cz''s, but then we are into metal affair.\n\nBelow the Glock (or any other European/American brand), we''re left with options like Taurus in polymer, etc, of which you could have 3-5 of @ same amount expended. I think 1 plastic Taurus is just 1 too much.\n\n+1 to a great overview Fudgepacker bro. \n\nRegards.', ''),

I must be missing something. The only two ways I can see that happening is, if the cost of new cars increase significantly year over year, which they don''t. Or, if there are more cars that end their service life on a regular basis, than there are new cars being sold, which is possible. That is definitely surprising and in huge contrast to the car market I''m used to, but that''s a good thing! The problem with our car market is, depreciation occurs too rapidly. If I bought a brand new car of any major brand, and even if I sold it the next day, I would lose 20%.

(560336, ' [QUOTE=Ahnab;398180]@Fudgepacker\nPardon for side tracking a bit. I see that your location is the Canadian west coast, and in the AD incidents you mentioned, the victims (or perpetrators, depending on your definition) were carrying their Glocks on their person. I wanted to if that''s legal in Canada because I was under the impression that conceal carrying a firearm isn''t allowed by the law.[/QUOTE]\n\nActually, I''m glad you brought that up, because the issue of self defense is another interesting, yet complex topic. For those of you interested, I''d like to give you an idea of how things work over here... \n\nFirst off, I have a lot of friends and family in California, Florida, Tennessee, and Michigan, and all the incidents I mentioned happened across the border. In Canada, concealed carry is technically not denied, you can apply for a license if you have reason to, but it''s not a right like down south. Yet even there, it''s not all encompassing. Some states have open carry with no license, some concealed carry. Most places do not allow open carry, and if you wish to do so concealed, a CCW license is required, which involves attending a course on safety, and is only valid at a state level, not across the country. It''s even different from place to place regarding having a loaded weapon in your vehicle, which is often an issue long haul truckers have to be wary of. Some states even require a license to carry pepper spray, and there are also gun free zones throughout the country, such as gov''t buildings, most schools, some businesses and office buildings, etc. Moreover, there are extreme differences in self defense laws from state to state. A situation where you are justified in the use of deadly force, may get you charged for murder if it happened a couple miles away, across state lines. Other times, even after being acquitted of criminal charges, the victim, or their family, can still win a civil suit against you for monetary compensation. Bottom line is, defending yourself is not straight forward. The only thing for certain is, once you discharge your gun in public (and sometimes even in private), you''ll be talking to some LEOs, and if you actually shoot at somebody (regardless of whether you kill or injure them), you are guaranteed a meeting in front of a judge. \n\nIm very interested in how it works in Pakistan, since it seems quite liberal with regards to shooting in self defense, at least from the accounts depicted by members here.', ''),
(560241, ' [QUOTE=BreakNeck;398164]Very informative writeup. The part where ADs happened while getting in and out of car are a surprise though...[/QUOTE]\nThanks bro! Let me clarify about the ADs, they each happened with a different person I know. Once was with an old leather holster, as the corners got soft, one of them somehow folded into the trigger guard, when he pressed down to put on his seat belt... bang! The second one happened with the whole family around. Tony had just parked the van and everyone was getting out. The youngest child wanted to go to daddy and came up from the backseat. Tony was still in the drivers seat. As the child was crawling around, somehow the gun came out of the holster just enough to expose the trigger, something got caught inside the guard, and when he stepped down to climb over his father''s lap... bang! \n\nI forget the exact circumstances of the third one, but it again happened around a vehicle, and again involved a Glock. I''ve read of many more instances with other guns, but those are the ones I know personally. Take it for what you will, it''s "only" three times, maybe it means something, maybe it doesn''t. Now I''m in no way condemning Glocks, however, I am of the opinion that it does not account for inadvertent pressure accidentally applied to the trigger, at least not as well as other designs. I do not subscribe to the theory that safety is all in your trigger finger either, because a finger is not the only thing that can make a gun go bang. You can not control the things and people around you, especially when you carry in public, anything can happen, otherwise firing pin blocks and transfer bars would never have been invented.', ''),

(560352, ' Salam All,\n@Fudgepacker & Denovo87 - ++++1  good advice.\nFirstly, I hope you have an all original glock meaning NOT the lone Wolf slide glock as some HAVE had feeding issues.  And that you are NOT using any aftermarket guide rod or springs or magazines.  Whenever I get a FTF I use the logical method of deduction by taking the gun back to stock form a piece at a time with firing sessions in between.  Normally I can sometimes figure out the problem without even the steps mentioned above.\nSecondly, AMMO, I have said it long enough that I do not consider the chinese round to be a good round.  Armscor is ok, i too have had issues with it.  The Chinese is gummy-residual round and the armscor sometimes seems to be a weak round (I dunno my experience).  Having said all this and assuming that your Glock EVERYTHING is OEM you should take  a toothbrush, HoppesNo9 solvent, clean then lube.  The area you are being asked to open is soooo simple to take apart that a child can do it.  BUT see the disassembly first on Youtube.  As far as stating HK or any other gun firing flawlessly... have you seen how light the HK slide is?  Its got huge open cavities to hide/store all the carbon.  Lastly remember limp wristing a Glock is also a BIG problem - I have seen this on the range... even happens to me when I don''t shoot my Glock for over 4 months...  I limp wrist and every now and then my gun ends up jamming.  Then I concentrate on NOT limp wristing and thats when my glock rock & rolls.\nSo do what is told by Fudgepacker and Denove87 - it is solid advice and THEN if the problem exists we will have to do a phone chat to figure out whats wrong...\nGood Luck, I have to run to the Gclub now as Skeeter60 is waiting for me....', ''),

I know they''re not as "open" as those in the US (handguns are limited to 10 rounds, etc.), but was wondering if the self defense laws (and gun laws specifically) are as oppressive as those in UK and Australia. \n\nPakistan is VERY open about CC-ing. Technically, all you need is a license for both owning and carrying. So long as the weapon is not visible in any way, you can carry it. We do have a few gun free zones (airports, banks, govt. buildings, etc.) but, in general, you can CC practically anywhere. The city of Karachi, however, is an exception; they have a law constantly in place which requires you to have a separate carry permit.', ''),

Today was the day ;)\n   \n  Got this gun from Budr ud Din Rawalpindi, basic specs are:\n   \n  12 Gauge semi auto, 28" back-bored barrel, 3" chamber, 4+1 capacity, Invector plus chokes, Gloss finished  walnut furniture, weight 7 lbs.\n   \n  [B]Why I bought something else than a Beretta?[/B]\n\n\n    1) Speed Lock fore Arm; first of its kind. Fore end on Maxus look sooo sleek and is breeze to remove/instal.\n   \n  2) Speed load; loading a shell into mag tube (while bolt is locked back) will chamber it without pressing any button. \n   \n  3) Removing/installing magazine plug is easiest of all semi''s made before Maxus.\n   \n  4,5,6,7.......1001) Its beauuuuuuuuuuutiful; let me say it in Punjabi " Ruj kay Sohni" ;)\n   \n  Total 94 rounds fired today on skeet:\n   \n  1) 3 Eley Alphamax #4 to pattern test.\n  2) 50 Shaheen #8.\n  3) 16 Shaheen #9 Skeet.\n  4) 25 Shaheen Super #6.\n   \n  There was no issue at all; lighter skeet ones cycled perfectly.\n   \n  Lets start from pattern; used stock IC choke & Eley Alphamax #4 from 20, 25 & 30 yard to see how it spreads with 5 meters graduation. below are the photos.

(560408, ' [B]First Impression:[/B]\n   \n  Beside being "Ruj Kay Sohni" Maxus is a sweet sweet shotgun in all aspects from weight to recoil to cycling.  Its well balanced, mounts naturally, doesn''t kick much (after 94 shots my right shoulder is as comfortable as left one). \n   \n  Well researched n designed gas piston keeps action almost clean (photos to follow), cycled everything reliably and smoothly. \n   \n  Very innovative n uniquely designed fore end is pleasure to hold. It dissembles same way an O/U or SxS fore end does. Although with this design its not possible to extend magazine capacity but 4+1 is more than enough for a sporting/hunting shotgun.\n   \n  Speed load is another feature that makes a shooter happy ;) feeding 1st round in magazine tube and seeing bolt working on its own is treat to watch. Bolt working this way produces a typical sound we only hear in movies ;)\n   \n  Trigger is very responsive, crisp, without any sort of creep/wobble, smooth and above all its "GOLDEN".\n   \n  Magazine cut-off switch is made and located in very practical way.\n   \n  Safety switch again is located best way it could be on a semi auto.\n   \n  Didn''t like the white sight bead; it can be only me but wasn''t comfortable with it at all.\n   \n   \n  Now some porn as usual ;)\n   \n   \n  [URL=http://s577.photobucket.com/user/denovo87/media/Maxus Hunter/forendtop_zpscc961711.jpg.html][IMG]http://i577.photobucket.com/albums/ss220/denovo87/Maxus Hunter/forendtop_zpscc961711.jpg[/IMG][/URL]\n   \n  [URL=http://s577.photobucket.com/user/denovo87/media/Maxus Hunter/forendbarreltop1_zps50b32c31.jpg.html][IMG]http://i577.photobucket.com/albums/ss220/denovo87/Maxus Hunter/forendbarreltop1_zps50b32c31.jpg[/IMG][/URL]\n   \n  [URL=http://s577.photobucket.com/user/denovo87/media/Maxus Hunter/receiverright_zps439a831c.jpg.html][IMG]http://i577.photobucket.com/albums/ss220/denovo87/Maxus Hunter/receiverright_zps439a831c.jpg[/IMG][/URL]\n   \n  [URL=http://s577.photobucket.com/user/denovo87/media/Maxus Hunter/receiverbottom_zpsf3869d3a.jpg.html][IMG]http://i577.photobucket.com/albums/ss220/denovo87/Maxus Hunter/receiverbottom_zpsf3869d3a.jpg[/IMG][/URL]\n   \n  [URL=http://s577.photobucket.com/user/denovo87/media/Maxus Hunter/forendnbarrel_zpsc206b6cd.jpg.html][IMG]http://i577.photobucket.com/albums/ss220/denovo87/Maxus Hunter/forendnbarrel_zpsc206b6cd.jpg[/IMG][/URL]\n   \n   \n  [URL=http://s577.photobucket.com/user/denovo87/media/Maxus Hunter/bolthandle1_zps15e01593.jpg.html][IMG]http://i577.photobucket.com/albums/ss220/denovo87/Maxus Hunter/bolthandle1_zps15e01593.jpg[/IMG][/URL]', ''),

(560472, ' [QUOTE=Ahnab;398308]@Fudgepacker\n....what the law in Canada says about carrying. I know they''re not as "open" as those in the US (handguns are limited to 10 rounds, etc.), but was wondering if the self defense laws (and gun laws specifically) are as oppressive as those in UK and Australia. [/QUOTE]\n\nActually carrying for self defense is not a common thing at all, but on the other hand, it is not entirely banned. You can apply for a license if your life is in danger from a legitimate threat. Yet the law and order situation here is such that there really is no need to be armed, no matter where you are. We don''t have a "castle doctrine"(where you can pretty much do anything to protect your home) per se, you cant shoot someone because you see them trying to steal your car, but should the situation arise where you are forced to defend yourself, we have the full support of the NRA and the NFA on a case by case basis.\n\nFurthermore, Canada is not oppressive about anything really. I think that largely has to do with the fact that anything you want to do, there is a place and time to do it, and everybody respects that. For example, there are different areas where different religions like to congregate, different neighborhoods and even whole cities where various cultures are celebrated, different venues for different activities, there are even government sponsored sights where people can use drugs in safety. It seems crazy to a lot of people, but it was started as a harm reduction program which is actually successful in reducing crime and saving the health care system money. Just as for those who like to shoot, there is a place to do it, at the range. It''s really a country where the philosophy of "do to others as you wish them to do to you" plays a significant role. \n\nWith regards to gun''s, they are a privilege, not a right. Just like driving a car is a privilege, to obtain a gun, a license is required, and to obtain a license, a course must be taken and an exam in gun safety must be passed. Then you can apply for a nationally recognized license. The application process ismainly concerned with your state of mind and any criminal you be involved with, and if your immediate family does not oppose, chances are you will be issued one. It seems like a complicated process, but contrary to popular belief, it is not just a money grab by the government, but for society''s well being, and it is a system that works. Canada is a gun loving nation, with per capita ownership comparable to the states; but what isn''t comparable, is our crime rate. Our crime stats are famously low in the developed world.\n\nWe mostly have the same guns, and accessories available in the states and you can have as many as you can afford. We also have access to training ie. fighting pistol, tactical rifle, and long range precision courses. They are classified as either restricted, non restricted, or prohibited. Restricted is for use at the range, and requires registration and a waiting period to purchase. Non restricted can be used outside of city limits for huntng or plinking and can be purchased regularly like anything else. Prohibited guns (such as full auto) requires a special license to own, but not all ranges are certified for their use. Anyways, hope that clarifies things, let me know if you have any questions!', ''),

(560476, ' First off, [B]any shotgun can shoot slugs[/B], and any choke can be used. That''s why chokes are made from steel, in order to swage down the softer lead. Besides, most slugs are sized one guage down ie. 12 guage slug has diameter of 13 guage bore. The only a couple exceptions, first are some really old guns which are marked right on the barrel to not shoot slugs/solid projectiles due to thin walls, and second are extra full chokes which reduce the diameter of the muzzle to the point where it becomes too tight for the slug to pass through. With regard to the slugs, Brennekes are solid (better penetration) and Fosters have a hollow base (better accuracy). They both have "rifling" but its purpose is for reducing drag against the barrel, not for spinning the projectile.', ''),

Too much slap, too much disengaging travel, too much over travel. It would be the same as testing a mehran car on a f1 track. What would you get out of testing such a car?? all the results will only show that it is working perfectly for a normal person.\r\n\r\nIPSC is the F1 racing (best car with best driver and tactics) with multiple calibers and highly tuned normal guns available for carry as well; and target shooting Olympics style is like Drag race (dedicated weapons such as Hammerli 208s) where the gun matters a lot and only small calibers are used.\r\n\r\nNP22 is a regular military gun design, and we use it to learn high end things; kam kharch bala nashin.. at 1000 rounds the gun has removed all the creep in the trigger and works smoothly, though it needs cleaning at every 300 rounds or so, so that the buildup of carbon doesnt start to create crud and act as emery IF you want your gun to reach 15000 rounds and LOOK as if IN top condition and resale isn''t diminished to such an event that the guns is worthless piece of junk.\r\n\r\nIF the factory itself admits that the gun life is 10000 rounds then they are implicitly saying that it is NOT intended for heavy use and is for occassional use. Whereas NP22 as i have seen is well worth the amount of money you put in.\r\nTHERE is NO comparision between CF 98 and NP22; absolutely NO comparision and doing it would make one wonder am i doing something that is within the lines of sanity.[/QUOTE]\r\n\r\n\r\nThumbs up for such a convencing and simple explaination ....', ''),

Actually It is what I dream of. If the industry of Pakistan will grow our economy will grow which will make everything cheap. people do not understand that. PAF does have international standard Iso certification and so doest other small factories who are exporting firearms but they are very few. West does not let a gun enter their market if they are not satisfied with the design, safety and metallurgy  of the firearm. so some of the companies are producing fire arms which in america are used for fun at range and truck gun. \nthe Idea here is to educate the public about the Local produced goods.

Besides, most slugs are sized one guage down ie. 12 guage slug has diameter of 13 guage bore. The only a couple exceptions, first are some really old guns which are marked right on the barrel to not shoot slugs/solid projectiles due to thin walls, and second are extra full chokes which reduce the diameter of the muzzle to the point where it becomes too tight for the slug to pass through. With regard to the slugs, Brennekes are solid (better penetration) and Fosters have a hollow base (better accuracy).

The only choice with the stock frame is to fill it with epoxy (making sure not to get any into vital areas) and then grind it down to shape. Even after all that, it ends up looking like crap, so it has to be stippled to look halfway decent , or wrapped with grip tape to hide the mess... :frusty: I cant even imagine what these guys would do for something that was ready made, in the perfect shape, in the color of their choice!!', ''),

The NP 42 is an all rounder light, medium sized etc etc. \n\nHowever the NP 22 does have the advantage that it can feed even armscor hollow points wihtout any polishing of the feed ramp. \n\nNP 34 is exactly the same as the NP 22 but slightly smaller and lesser mag capacity. \n\nFellow Member Muhammad M had the NP 34 as his carry weapon and indeed had juxtaposed the 2 together in the thread I posed above.

Those who wait for action, and those who rely on impulse... they are the people who should not buy a gun. There are many things that must happen physically, and must be considered mentally, before pulling and squeezing, especially for civillians drawing from concealment. The last thing you can be when you''re walking around society with a firearm, is impulsive and act on instinct. For those who think that way, my sincerest advice would be to get some tactical training for self defense. It may save a life, that life could be yours.\n\nWho would not agree that in a life or death situation, an individual who is trained to handle the situation is more likely to survive than the everyday guy. Animals act on instinct, but training conditions people to resist what they would do impulsively, and instead, execute a solution in the most effective and efficient manner. Just a few simple examples; when shooting a gun, instinct closes our eyes, but training keeps them open. When an explosion goes off in your hands, our impulse is to flinch, but training keeps them steady. In a dangerous situation, instinct narrows our attention and vision, but training maintains a wide perspective. When a gun is pointed in your face, people impulsively turn away, but training makes you block and draw your weapon. Yet the benefit of instinctive reactions is the speed at which they occur, because our body is naturally programmed to react a certain way in response to certain stimuli. The benefit of training is that it can overcome anything, such as  taking off a safety before shooting, shooting accurately without sights, or operating a gun with your weak hand. In effect, training is rewriting the natural program. But the only way to do that is to build muscle memory, and the only way to build muscle memory is through practice.', ''),

Let me say if you do not like CZ, say for many reason whatsoever that you may have, including the current point that CZ does not work well with many local ammo, then it is your 100% right to hold your opinion and no one has the right to say wrong to your personal likes and dislikes BUT engineering facts are facts and may not be confused with personal choices! The current discussion gives me the impression that tight chamber of CZ is a disadvantage &#8211; so I feel like to throw light on one angle that should not be missed, otherwise many will be mistaken.\n \nReliability of any piece of equipment lies in its (1) design (2) manufacturing\n\nThe manufacturing is key in success of any machine. Best industry has very strict rules of their machining. Thus very strict quality control.  And one of the strict requirements is tolerance! Low standard industry will have big value for tolerance in their geometric measurements. CZ is among the top and have this strict quality measure in place. For example CZ 75 P01 is NATO approved pistol and had to qualify MANY requirements before it was accepted by NTAO and one of the requirement was:\n\n"[B][I][U]100% interchangability, any number of pistols randomly selected, disassembled, parts mixed and reassembled with no failures of any kind including loss of accuracy[/U][/I][/B] " Reference: [URL]http://cz-usa.com/press-releases/102/[/URL]\n\nThe above criteria will only be achieved IF the production quality is the BEST! Else you cannot meet this criterion!\n\nNow question is that should we select the shoe first and then fit the horse or the other way?\nIf many honorable PG members do not like CZ because CZ guns are so perfect that any issue with ammo it will not work &#8211; please go ahead this is your choice, this is what you want and we respect your choice!\n \nI always use S&B for my 9mm and have decided NEVER to use local or even Chinese ammo! For me this is the requirement to own CZ and I respect that and I will make sure that I will never violate this! If someone dislikes this constraint &#8211; please go ahead and hate this requirement and do not own a CZ! Free world and freedom to like or dislike!\n\nBut please also keep in mind I myself WANT (and have the right) to have perfection. I need to own a pistol that is built to BEST and STRICTEST quality control including VERY TIGHT Tolerances! As I know (and think I am right) that such gun will be extremely reliable under WIDE variety of environmental conditions, where others may fail. I want to PAY for great EFFORTS of the person who will make my gun in which tolerance is BIG important factor for them and for me as well!\n \nPS: I have not intentionally touched on any other design and/or manufacturing issue to avoid too wide and unfocused discussion!\n\nDear Honorable PG members &#8211; the above discussion is purely technical and if you are unhappy to read my strong opinion(s) &#8211; please forgive me, apologies sought in advance! :)', ''),

Those who wait for action, and those who rely on impulse... they are the people who should not buy a gun. There are many things that must happen physically, and must be considered mentally, before pulling and squeezing, especially for civillians drawing from concealment. The last thing you can be when you''re walking around society with a firearm, is impulsive and act on instinct. For those who think that way, my sincerest advice would be to get some tactical training for self defense. It may save a life, that life could be yours.\n\nWho would not agree that in a life or death situation, an individual who is trained to handle the situation is more likely to survive than the everyday guy. Animals act on instinct, but training conditions people to resist what they would do impulsively, and instead, execute a solution in the most effective and efficient manner. Just a few simple examples; when shooting a gun, instinct closes our eyes, but training keeps them open. When an explosion goes off in your hands, our impulse is to flinch, but training keeps them steady. In a dangerous situation, instinct narrows our attention and vision, but training maintains a wide perspective. When a gun is pointed in your face, people impulsively turn away, but training makes you block and draw your weapon. Yet the benefit of instinctive reactions is the speed at which they occur, because our body is naturally programmed to react a certain way in response to certain stimuli. The benefit of training is that it can overcome anything, such as taking off a safety before shooting, shooting accurately without sights, or operating a gun with your weak hand. In effect, training is rewriting the natural program. But the only way to do that is to build muscle memory, and the only way to build muscle memory is through practice.[/QUOTE]\n\nVery interesting discussion BUT I will request for few things. Both PG members are right BUT in their own given perspective and conditions. I recall a storey of by our Hon. PG member (forgetting the name of PG member) whose father advised him NOT to pull out his gun and if he does then use it ..... this was a very powerful storey means one need to be VERY VERY serious and thoughtful to own and carry a gun - NO doubts.\n\nWell in the other hand the security situation in Pak in general and few parts of Pak such as Karachi and parts of KP in particular, the situation is not good at all. Every one who carries a gun must try best to get training as much as one can ... the gun is the last resort in life threatening situation! It should not be used at ALL to resolve DAY to DAY issues such as traffic jam fight, some one hitting your car (God for bid), etc etc.  Situation is such that one has to carry LIVE round with gun in hand when you are traveling especially at night! Seconds are important! Having firing ranges open to public who can bring in thier lawful weapons for target practice is one great way to be ready, trained and responsible.  Please read the thread and help us have a formal range for competitions etc. in KP.

(561684, 'Review: Suzuki GS150 &quot;Tour-King&quot; [B]AoA Everybody.[/B]\r\n\r\nIts often the simplest of things that bring the most happiness in life. I never truly understood that sentiment until I got an opportunity to get my hands on a motorcycle.\r\n\r\nBoy! How have I been living all these years? is this for real? can one get from [B]A[/B] to [B]B[/B] and have fun at the same time? these were some of the questions that immediately crossed my mind.\r\n\r\nThen there is the feeling of some serious horsepower between one''s legs. more than one horsepower if you get what I am saying ;) .\r\n\r\nI was hooked. boots in the breeze, wind in my face, with the sweet sound of a high revving engine. AND THEN IT HIT ME "I WAS BORN TO RIDE A MOTORCYCLE".\r\n\r\nThe current crop of street-bikes just didn''t tickle my fancy. the heavier ones were a little too heavy as I still have a steep learning curve to climb before graduating to a multi-piston machine. Anyways, after an exhaustive search, I found the one that fit the bill.

The bike''s suspension is really superb. Its quiet comfortable even for longer than usual rides.\r\n\r\n2. The bike''s rake and trail are really designed for long and easy riding. the higher rake/trail stabilizes the bike even at really slow speeds.\r\n\r\n3. Front disk brakes make stopping this monster a breeze. rear drums are only "so,so" at it.\r\n\r\n4. 12 volt-power outlet on handlebar allow usage of GPS navigation equipment (or a cell-phone or MP3 player). yes! one can also use it to recharge stuff.\r\n\r\n5. Wide seat offers plenty of room for a comfortable seating experience for the buns.\r\n\r\n6. wide and high angle handlebars truly help in eliminating the fatigue from arms and shoulders\r\n\r\n7. Self start is a real plus cause kick-starting is just exhausting and grows really old really fast. plus my knees don''t feel as young as they did 15 years back.\r\n\r\n8. back-rest for the pillion rider also makes it quiet a pleasurable experience for the one sitting behind you. in turn, it makes the whole ride even more pleasurable for you as you hear less complains.\r\n\r\n9. the internal 12-volt power outlet (housed inside the rear trunk) makes it possible to use it as a power source for the camping lights and recharge your laptop and stuff like that.\r\n\r\n10. the handle bar pouch is a just a dream accessory. it makes it very convenient to place the most/often needed stuff such as cell-phone, hands-free, cigarettes and lighters within reach. the best part is that you can take it off, wash and put it back on if it gets dirty.....by the way, I''m not suggesting that you make/attend phone calls and smoke while driving a motorcycle. :)\r\n\r\n11. the bike is quiet soundless for its engine size. even while revving the engine, it hardly makes any sound. unlike Hondas that make your brain explode inside your head when somebody crosses you by.\r\n\r\n12. the bike''s engine is also very smooth. hardly any vibration at any RPM level. unlike the current crop of street-bikes that even shake your teeth loose.\r\n\r\n[URL=http://s1272.photobucket.com/user/12gauge-pg/media/Suzuki%20GS150%20Tour-King/Pic7_zps48248c98.jpg.html][IMG]http://i1272.photobucket.com/albums/y384/12gauge-pg/Suzuki%20GS150%20Tour-King/Pic7_zps48248c98.jpg[/IMG][/URL]\r\n\r\n[B]Things that I don''t like:[/B] (most of the stuff that I am about to mention are probably linked to poor quality control)\r\n\r\n1. the frame of the bike is already starting to rust. rust spots are growing everywhere. even some of the nuts and bolts have decided to join in.\r\n\r\n2. the rear drums make a strange sound when applying brake pressure. the authorized Suzuki mechanic told me that it happens with most of them. nothing to worry about. his advice: learn to live with it. this world isn''t prefect. wow! thats deep.\r\n\r\n3. the texture on the handlebar grips kinda bits into my hands. don''t like it one bit.\r\n\r\n4. some of the markings here and there (specially on the controls) are pretty much vanishing all by themselves. poor quality ink/stamping I guess.\r\n\r\n5. poor quality of paint. almost everywhere you can see signs of paint saying "good bye buddy, its been a short but fun ride".\r\n\r\n6. the trip-meter isn''t working anymore. I''m not even sure that it worked from the beginning. I am just assuming that it worked.\r\n\r\n7. the bike''s got a habit of breaking rpm and clutch cables like its some sort of a national responsibility.\r\n\r\n8. you''ll surely be surprised to learn how fast it eats rear brake shoes. the authorized mechanic told me that it happens because of the heavy weight of this bike and takes some serious braking power to stop it in its tracks.\r\n\r\n9. the slim tyres look fugly. as per my discussions with my mechanic, if I install fatter tyres, the bike will become sluggish. I do plan to install fatter tyres cause these one are just destroying the look of this otherwise handsome monster.\r\n\r\n10. the muffler which does an amazing job of reducing the exhaust sound gets really hot to touch (learned it the hard way on several occasions). the company should have provided the muffler with a heat shield.\r\n\r\n11. the 12-volt power outlet which are otherwise very useful are limited in their capacity. they only allow 110-watts of electricity which is only useful for electronics and not enough for cooking/heating equipment. it would have really neat if I could power a small electric stove or a heater.\r\n\r\n12. the side covers aka tapas have no locking mechanism. imagine the level of trust held by company in our society.\r\n\r\n13. chain makes a funny griding sound at low speeds. the mechanic says that its pretty normal with chain driven bikes and I must oil this chain and its sprockets regularly but still, if I oil it too much then I get drips and runs from sides of the chain cover which is just nasty.\r\n\r\n14. there is no beeper installed with the turn signals. at times one forgets that the left/right turn signal is on. a beeper would have been nice.\r\n\r\n15. the brake light in the rear trunk was really weak/dim. I had the OEM (factory installed) replaced with an aftermarket bulb and now it shines like it should.\r\n\r\n16. the locking mechanism on the rear trunk and panniers should have their own keys. a single key for the ignition, side lock, fuel tank, rear trunk and pannier is just asking for trouble. too many locks with one key will wear the key out sooner than it should.\r\n\r\n17. the fuel selector is all wrong. turning it up means moving the reserve arrow down, who can remember all that? I still have to ask the mechanic to turn it to "ON" position. is there any way to permanently disable this contraption?\r\n\r\n18. the turn signal and neutral indicators are really dim and hard to see in normal day light.\r\n\r\n19. I just fail to understand the thought behind the "Engine-On" switch in the handlebar. why turning the key ignition switch to "ON" isn''t enough? why over complicate a pretty simple process?\r\n\r\n20. the rear trunk does not have a parking light. only brake lights. why?\r\n\r\n21. bike is super heavy. putting it on center/double stand requires one hell of an effort. in full load, it requires two people to lift and pull to put it on double stand. in fact, the double stand has already been welded once. just imagine seeing it break into two pieces by the sheer weight of the bike.\r\n\r\n22. the cheap quality horn works at times and at times it totally refuses to do anything.\r\n\r\n23. the cheap quality headlight is useful for nothing. the beam is no way near safe enough to drive even in absolute darkness and on top of that it scatters too a degree (360 degrees to be precise) that even a huge pot hole in the middle of the road is impossible to spot.\r\n\r\n[URL=http://s1272.photobucket.com/user/12gauge-pg/media/Suzuki%20GS150%20Tour-King/Pic6_zps0c8a6737.jpg.html][IMG]http://i1272.photobucket.com/albums/y384/12gauge-pg/Suzuki%20GS150%20Tour-King/Pic6_zps0c8a6737.jpg[/IMG][/URL]\r\n\r\n[B]Final Thought:[/B]\r\n\r\nWith all its faults, the bike is super fun. due to its heavy weight, it runs smoother, quieter and without any road/ground and engine vibrations. literally, driving it at 80-90km/h feels like you are cruising at a comfortable 40km/h.\r\n\r\nthe company is offering a superb product here. they just need to improve upon the quality of stuff that are putting in this bike. the engine is powerful enough that it can easily take two riders and loads of other stuff to any height a motorcycle can/should. however the cheap quality of accessories such as cables, brake shoes, tyres and stuff are a major turn off.\r\n\r\nThe bike has the potential to become the best locally manufactured touring bike however the company should invest in quality instead of relying on poor quality parts to lower its price in a bid to attract more customers.\r\n\r\nRegards.', ''),

(561720, 'Scam or bargain? Hi guys, I live in New Zealand and have been following your forums with interest for a while now but have only just joined.  I''m about to import a load of Pakistani shotgun ammo and have been offered a deal which seems too good to turn down.  Boxes of Shaheen (POF) shells (400 to a 13 kg box) for USD$16 each FOB Karachi, minimum of 50,000 shells.  Looking at other retail prices for ammo in Pakistan that looks to be a pretty sharp price.  I''ve been importing from mostly Asia for 15 years now (this is my first ammo order) and so far the only conmen and rip-off merchants I have encountered have all been American.  Maybe my order for export is exempt from various local taxes, or maybe it''s been liberated from a military ammo dump?  What do you guys think?  I would be especially interested to hear from any brokers or anyone familiar with your local export controls and taxes.  Maybe he works in the factory and staff might get amazing discounts?  The seller is not a licensed ammo dealer and says he can only obtain shotgun cartridges at this point, not the rifle ammo I was originally after (opportunity for someone else?).  He is saying all the things I want to hear, but as I am also a Western Union agent I often see and sometimes prevent scams involving gullible Kiwis who think they are getting a bargain.    -    Steve', ''),

[B]Let me say if you do not like CZ, say for many reason whatsoever that you may have, including the current point that CZ does not work well with many local ammo, then it is your 100% right to hold your opinion and no one has the right to say wrong to your personal likes and dislikes[/B] BUT engineering facts are facts and may not be confused with personal choices! The current discussion gives me the impression that tight chamber of CZ is a disadvantage &#8211; so I feel like to throw light on one angle that should not be missed, otherwise many will be mistaken.\n\nReliability of any piece of equipment lies in its (1) design (2) manufacturing\n\nThe manufacturing is key in success of any machine. Best industry has very strict rules of their machining. Thus very strict quality control. And one of the strict requirements is tolerance! Low standard industry will have big value for tolerance in their geometric measurements. CZ is among the top and have this strict quality measure in place. For example CZ 75 P01 is NATO approved pistol and had to qualify MANY requirements before it was accepted by NTAO and one of the requirement was:\n\n"[B][I][U]100% interchangability, any number of pistols randomly selected, disassembled, parts mixed and reassembled with no failures of any kind including loss of accuracy[/U][/I][/B] " Reference: [URL]http://cz-usa.com/press-releases/102/[/URL]\n\nThe above criteria will only be achieved IF the production quality is the BEST! Else you cannot meet this criterion!\n\nNow question is that should we select the shoe first and then fit the horse or the other way?\n[B]If many honorable PG members do not like CZ because CZ guns are so perfect that any issue with ammo it will not work &#8211; please go ahead this is your choice, this is what you want and we respect your choice![/B]\n\nI always use S&B for my 9mm and have decided NEVER to use local or even Chinese ammo! For me this is the requirement to own CZ and I respect that and I will make sure that I will never violate this! If someone dislikes this constraint &#8211; please go ahead and hate this requirement and do not own a CZ! Free world and freedom to like or dislike!\n\nBut please also keep in mind I myself WANT (and have the right) to have perfection. I need to own a pistol that is built to BEST and STRICTEST quality control including VERY TIGHT Tolerances! As I know (and think I am right) that such gun will be extremely reliable under WIDE variety of environmental conditions, where others may fail. I want to PAY for great EFFORTS of the person who will make my gun in which tolerance is BIG important factor for them and for me as well!\n\nPS: I have not intentionally touched on any other design and/or manufacturing issue to avoid too wide and unfocused discussion!\n\n[B]Dear Honorable PG members &#8211; the above discussion is purely technical and if you are unhappy to read my strong opinion(s) &#8211; please forgive me, apologies sought in advance[/B]! :)[/QUOTE]', ''),

(561836, ' Researchers for the Massachusetts Turnpike Authority found over 200 dead  crows near greater Boston recently, and there was concern that they may  have died from Avian Flu. A bird pathologist examined the remains of  all the crows, and, to everyone''s relief, confirmed the problem was  definitely NOT Avian Flu. The cause of death appeared to be vehicular  impacts.\n \nHowever, during the detailed analysis it was noted that varying colors  of paints appeared on the bird''s beaks and claws. By analyzing these  paint residues it was determined that 98% of the crows had been killed  by impact with trucks, while only 2% were killed by an impact with a  car.\n \nMTA then hired an ornithological behaviorist to determine if there was a  cause for the disproportionate percentages of truck kills versus car  kills. The Ornithological Behaviorist very quickly concluded the cause:  when crows eat road kill, they always have a look-out crow in a nearby  tree to warn of impending danger.

They are offering two versions. Standard and "Tour-King". The "Tour-King" is an upgrade that costs 15K additional. I can talk to them if you like.\r\n\r\nI''ve confirmed again and again from them if its some sort of alternation or modification. they insist that all parts are OEM/Factory original and brand new and are installed without doing any modification to the Standard bike itself.\r\n\r\n[QUOTE=AK47;399691][B]@12G[/B]..................Great looking!

Couple of modifications/upgradations they have done like Front disk brake, luggage capability, external 12v power source.\r\n\r\nNo doubt this is a great bike and you feel very comfortable while taking ride of it but, i would like to add 2 more disadvantages (though i don''t own it. just sharing my friend''s experience with it''s 2009 model).\r\n\r\n1- since it is electric bike, there is a lot of complexities in it. i can''t remember things in detail but i''ve seen my friend going to electrician again n again (after 1 year of use) for continued technical faults.\r\n2- Parts are quite expensive.. i was surprise to see the air filter (just a small piece of foam) costs 800 Rs :O..... you can imagine very well, how much other routine parts would cost.\r\n\r\nbeside all issues, bikes looks and run really Awesome..\r\n\r\nCongratulations for your Purchase..[/QUOTE]\r\n\r\nYou are right bro, parts are expensive but finding them is quiet easy if you have an authorized workshop near.

Nobody stocks Shaheen''s here but I think they would be popular, especially as I could easily undercut everybody based on the quoted price.

So its all gonna stay in one thread. \n\nTactical Sports is a beautiful gun. Infact all Cz''s are. But as beautiful as they are, i never liked the finish of the barrel. It''s got this dull greyish finish which never looks clean. I like shinny barrels, and i''ve already polished the Baikal O/U receiver before so i thought why not polish the barrel of TS too.

But its ok nothing to worry. This process actually makes polishing easy. I mean you can skip this entire process and go straight to scrubbing the barrel with Braso or any other Chrome polish. But its gonna take much more time and effort.

My G17 because I have grown attached to my firearm, I carry it every day to work. There has been some criminal activity in my village, where transgressors are going into houses of the people at night and raping women, and other types of malicious and immoral activities. I want to protect my loved ones with the tools that I use to protect my own life and the life of my clients as an armed guard.  \n\nAlthough, I would be more interested in taking my kevlar vest, because I fear being hassled at the airports and what not over a pistol. I am using Emirates via Dubai.

Its seems you''ve developed a liking for shiny objects. :)\r\n\r\n@sadatpk\r\n\r\nBro, most manufacturers would like to skip on polishing (specially superficial polishing) of precision parts. reasons:\r\n\r\n1. polishing by hand is very costly\r\n2. polishing by machine has much higher tendency of destroying dimensional integrity of a precision part\r\n3. polishing by hand is very time consuming\r\n\r\ntherefore most manufacturers (specially budget oriented manufacturers) skip this step. good thing is that anybody with a solid heart, keen sense and a bit of dexterity can easily do it.\r\n\r\nRegards.', ''),

(562097, 'Scoping the Weihrauch with Umair Bhai Assalamo alaikum all\r\n\r\nThis Saturday morning, I went to Umair bhais place to get his expert help in scoping the HW-100 as it is "sight-less", no open sights at all. He has several open plots all around and had a 35yds target already set up. The airgun is a Weihrauch HW-100 .22 FSB which I got couple weeks back from Hira Arms, Lahore.\r\n\r\nI used a Leapers UTG 6-24x50 scope which i got from Peshawar last month. Scope and 2-piece mounts cost Rs.8,000. Initial test-fire confirmed a slight barrel droop, and we had to use shims made out of a pepsi can to compensate.\r\n\r\nMax fill pressure is 200 bar, and 2 magazines of 14 pellets each drops the pressure to 120 bar which is marked with yellow on the gun''s pressure gauge, meaning you should fill again. Filling with the Hill pump is slightly strenuous, you have to use full weight of your body once the pressure hits 150 bar. 120 to 200 bar needs approx 50 pumps, and with a 3-4 minute break to let the pump cool, it takes less than 10 minutes to fill it. Cylinder capacity is small, only 175cc. \r\n\r\nThe magazine is idiot-simple to use, just fill and push in. It is loaded and cocked by a small side lever. The safety is manual and can only be engaged when the gun is cocked. Gun with scope weighted 4.3 kilos. The numbers say it is a heavy gun, but the feel is that of a much lighter gun.\r\n\r\nIt is a hugely enjoyable airgun, and although we used only Gamo pellets, it seems very accurate. After sight-in, Umar bhai managed very tight 3-4 pellet groups, and says that the barrel needs 4-500 pellets for break-in and should become more consistent. I am happy that it seems satisfied with Gamo pellets, as PCPs can be very picky and generally are accurate and consistent with more expensive pellets.\r\n\r\nEye candy below.

Let me say if you do not like CZ, say for many reason whatsoever that you may have, including the current point that CZ does not work well with many local ammo, then it is your 100% right to hold your opinion and no one has the right to say wrong to your personal likes and dislikes BUT engineering facts are facts and may not be confused with personal choices! The current discussion gives me the impression that tight chamber of CZ is a disadvantage – so I feel like to throw light on one angle that should not be missed, otherwise many will be mistaken.\n \nReliability of any piece of equipment lies in its (1) design (2) manufacturing\n\nThe manufacturing is key in success of any machine. Best industry has very strict rules of their machining. Thus very strict quality control.  And one of the strict requirements is tolerance! Low standard industry will have big value for tolerance in their geometric measurements. CZ is among the top and have this strict quality measure in place. For example CZ 75 P01 is NATO approved pistol and had to qualify MANY requirements before it was accepted by NTAO and one of the requirement was:\n\n"[B][I][U]100% interchangability, any number of pistols randomly selected, disassembled, parts mixed and reassembled with no failures of any kind including loss of accuracy[/U][/I][/B] " Reference: [URL]http://cz-usa.com/press-releases/102/[/URL]\n\nThe above criteria will only be achieved IF the production quality is the BEST! Else you cannot meet this criterion!\n\nNow question is that should we select the shoe first and then fit the horse or the other way?\nIf many honorable PG members do not like CZ because CZ guns are so perfect that any issue with ammo it will not work – please go ahead this is your choice, this is what you want and we respect your choice!\n \nI always use S&B for my 9mm and have decided NEVER to use local or even Chinese ammo! For me this is the requirement to own CZ and I respect that and I will make sure that I will never violate this! If someone dislikes this constraint – please go ahead and hate this requirement and do not own a CZ! Free world and freedom to like or dislike!\n\nBut please also keep in mind I myself WANT (and have the right) to have perfection. I need to own a pistol that is built to BEST and STRICTEST quality control including VERY TIGHT Tolerances! As I know (and think I am right) that such gun will be extremely reliable under WIDE variety of environmental conditions, where others may fail. I want to PAY for great EFFORTS of the person who will make my gun in which tolerance is BIG important factor for them and for me as well!\n \nPS: I have not intentionally touched on any other design and/or manufacturing issue to avoid too wide and unfocused discussion!\n\nDear Honorable PG members – the above discussion is purely technical and if you are unhappy to read my strong opinion(s) – please forgive me, apologies sought in advance! :)[/QUOTE]\n\nDr Gillani\nI second you whole heartedly.

The earth was needed in some construction work . It was young female cobra. I was happy as I got a toy to play with for some time. I pick/ catch the snake with bare hands. I learned that method from my deceased grandfather who served in British-Indian colonial (Pre-partition) police as S.P. He was an avid hunter ,a very courageous man and a gun enthusiast .As I was the eldest issue of his only child (my father) he used to  keep me with himself as I got strong enough to accompany him in hunt and such like activities. I caught that snake and gave it to my son to play with as he also does not get afraid from snakes and is learning to shoot shotgun. He can load and shoot my BRNO .22Lr model 2 quite well.\n   \n  Well what I do is not advisable to be followed by any other. \n  Some weeks ago an other snake ventured to enter my home. This guy was large enough and well above 5 feet. I greeted him same hospitality and caught him and handed it over to my son to play who afterwards eliminated it \n\n\n  Following are some pictures of the scene. I shall repeat that no body should follow me and if some body does it, he shall be responsible for the consequences himself .I shall also not like to be criticized as well as I do this with complete pre-cautions. \n  \nThe first picture when game began \n\n[IMG]http://imageshack.us/a/img16/5442/gqsm.jpg[/IMG]\n\nThe circles / coils would make you feel about an idea of its length \n[IMG]http://imageshack.us/a/img833/43/b4ei.jpg[/IMG]\n\nIt is safe to hold the snake by it', ''),

Some one at PG very well said - Love the Gun that you own and own it from your heart - no matter which ever it is. \n\nBut a gentle reminder that your gun should be Engineered :) not designed by chance and I am sure the names that you mentioned are WELL DESIGNED! Can one say which car is better? Benz OR BMW OR ACCURA? I think the answer from every one will be different and every one will have its own experience! In Engineering there is NOTHING as PERFECT - please note that in real world ALL is Probability based!\n\n[B]A quick analogy to understand:[/B] Space agencies such as NASA have 0% (tehoratically) acceptance for ERROR (altough there will be in reality errors :)). Their Projects are the MOST costly and very well engineered! Questions is DO their ALL space missions remained successful with NO failure? Answer is big NO! We saw live blowing up of their shuttle Columbia in 2003 and few in the past as well. Reference: [URL]http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Shuttle_Columbia_disaster[/URL]\n\nSo ANY gun can stop any time and that is the reason we measure "Mean Rounds Between Failures" called MRBF and EVERY gun will have this value established in the LAB!!!!! No gun will have its value as INFINITY! :)\n\nBut we need to understand that every gun is designed for CERTAIN parameters and whenever those parameters violated - one will have great CHANCE of encountering an issue!', ''),

I would like to share my thoughts on this very important point that you wrote and I fully endorse your thoughts and knowledge here.\n\nFor making comparisons it is very important that two or more test objects (here in this case guns or ammo or both) MUST very strictly be compared in &#8220;COMPARABLE&#8221; environment otherwise we will end up having wrong comparisons which will indeed be misleading. Let me summarize few points here:\n \n1. Preferably ONLY one variable at one time be compared. Say we want to test and compare recoil of two or more guns then we must focus primarily on recoil not on other issues; otherwise we will start mixing two or more parameters thus leading to results that might be drifting from true results.\n \n2. The condition under which one test is done; ALL other test SHALL be done under strictly same conditions else wrong results and thus wrong conclusions.  For example if recoil of a gun is under study then if we are using one gun holding with two hands then same should be done for second gun and then for third gun too &#8211; else results will not be true.\n \n3. Although very difficult, but if possible then instruments should be used to measure the quantity of interest.  Assume we are interested to measure recoil of various guns; say we want to measure jerk for recoil. Now let me go through an important fact which might seem amazing and is as follows:\n \n* I am the only person who will judge two guns for recoil (required that only one observer otherwise two person will report same result differently and results will be misleading)\n \n* I stand in same position to test fire all the three guns with my best effort to hold all the three guns in similar angle, height, eccentricity from center of gravity of my body; almost with same frame of mind (if I fire very late or if I get tired then I will report wrong). @Salman_hunter very correctly pointed out using a test bench.\nReference: [URL]http://www.gun-tests.com/performance/dec97rests.html[/URL]\n \n* I use same ammo in all the three guns (otherwise incorrect comparisons will be made)\n \n* I take three or more measurements for each gun to report an average response. I should then find the mean/average value for each gun.\n \n* I scale all the results of all the guns on scale of say 1-10\n \nNow under above strict conditions it is expected that the results will be unbiased and very good and reliable!!\n \nThe possible Answer can be NO! The Result still CAN be biased (may be not completely BUT still will be biased and two people may disagree to each other)! The main reason for such a difference would be that ALL the testing and comparisons were QUALITATIVE and not QUANTITATIVE!\n \n[B][U]Question is HOW and WHY?[/U][/B]\n \nLet me try to answer:\n1. Let us assume hands of my palms have 16 square inch of area.\n2. Let us assume that Gun No.1 under my grip has area of 10 square inch that comes in contact with my hand.\n3. Let&#8217;s assume that center of gravity of my hand for Gun No.1 is 0.5 inch. Assume that the force exerted by gun is say 10 kg.\n4. Due to above parameters the pinching that I will feel will be dependent on the contact area with my hand say in this case it is 10 square inch. Due to some eccentricity I will also feel some sideway force (called unbalancing moment) which I have to fight to keep my hand stable. At least (for simplicity here) these two parameters will give me some value of comfort or shock or force; in simple words recoil that I FEEL in certain way.\n5. Now if second gun has grip area of 12 square inch with my hand and eccentricity was say 0.25 inch and assume same force of 10 kg from Gun 2 as well. Now what will I feel? Most likely (on these factors) I will feel less pinch and very small moment that will try to bend my hands away thus I will report that this gun has less recoil ALTHOUGH the force is same 10 kg!!\n \nNow if the same guns are used by me by varying contact areas of my grip and varying eccentricity (that is now I hold differently) then I will have different results. Now if the guns are used by someone else with different hand, different feel, different comfort level etc. then report will be different. This is the reason many PG members suggest to new buyers that hold the gun in your hand and buy the one that suits your hand! J\n \n[B][U]How to Make Un-biased Comparisons?[/U][/B]\n1. Use test bench as pointed out by @Salman_hunter.\n2. Use instruments to measure various parameters thus to QUANTIFY rather than QUALITATIVE observations (the first one is not really possible for many PG members).\n3. Ensure comparisons under (theoretically) SIMILAR conditions which requires lab like environment. Which many will not have access to!\n \n[B][U]Conclusion:[/U][/B]\nIf above parameters cannot be achieved practically by many PG members THEN should we stop making comparisons? Answer is NO! Please do make comparisons BUT keep in mind that comparisons will ONLY be truly TRUE (comparable) IF above conditions are met; else [B]APPLES WILL BE COMPARED TO ORANGES[/B]! Whereas we will be thinking one is better over the other which will not be the case J\n \n[B][U]My Offer to do some Practical QUANTIFIABLE RECOIL tests:[/U][/B]\n \nI can request friends to use some sensors such as Accelerometers! Accelerometers measure acceleration (a measure of force or jerk) independent of grip, independent of force but a relatively reasonably good parameter for recoil. We need to fabricate a test bench to make grips for various guns in similar fashion/conditions. We can thus record acceleration of each gun and QUANTIFY the recoil jerk from each gun for similar ammo. Further comparisons can be made if we use different ammo in same guns and see the recoil also. Graphs can be plotted. \n \n \n[B]Disclaimer:[/B] All the above discussion is generally written for ease to understand rather than given reasonable detailed quantifiable comparisons.  The purpose is that many people with varied background should be able understand the underlying principles.\n \nAll this above is cooked very quickly without referring to any STANDARD of gun testing; however based on extensive experience of author in field of engineering testing.  Errors, misconceptions etc. if any are openly accepted provided argument is made with some technical basis.', ''),

(562229, ' [QUOTE=Kamran80;399768]Researchers for the Massachusetts Turnpike Authority found over 200 dead  crows near greater Boston recently, and there was concern that they may  have died from Avian Flu. A bird pathologist examined the remains of  all the crows, and, to everyone''s relief, confirmed the problem was  definitely NOT Avian Flu. The cause of death appeared to be vehicular  impacts.\n \nHowever, during the detailed analysis it was noted that varying colors  of paints appeared on the bird''s beaks and claws. By analyzing these  paint residues it was determined that 98% of the crows had been killed  by impact with trucks, while only 2% were killed by an impact with a  car.\n \nMTA then hired an ornithological behaviorist to determine if there was a  cause for the disproportionate percentages of truck kills versus car  kills. The Ornithological Behaviorist very quickly concluded the cause:  when crows eat road kill, they always have a look-out crow in a nearby  tree to warn of impending danger.

Got a rear tail light from gsx 750 used ( it has 02 bulbs ) and a real shinny lens ( also koito ) . Bought a pair of aluminum wheels  with provision for spoke from a local scrap yard .The rims havent been installed  as yet but thery were grinded and polished to a mirror finish and are awaiting a clear coat .Next on the list  is a thailand made exhaust ( it has a heat shield ) the inner construction if that exhaust is different and makes the engine free reving it costs rs 4500.We are deperately in search of a good quality headlamp ( koito or stanley brand). The things that you should do is wet sand the tank and side covers and spray it with a generous clear coat from dupont  .And if you  like to ride it on highways a lot get 2 to 3 teeths off the rear sprocket .

There is a reason why some products get a premium over others. Taurus firearms do not sell like Glocks because they do not offer the same level of reliability even though they offer lifetime warranty.\nComplaining about consumer product is a sure way to make improvements/remedial action over the previous iterations and also make a producer liable for any defects/short cuts they might be employing. If consumers didn''t complain about Toyota brake failures(and just train for them) there will be no massive recall. Many would get hurt and the producer would keep churning out dangerous cars.\ni am hundred percent certain if pakguns did not raise a whole lota stink about caracal failures, many would be left gravely injured and even permanently handicapped.\nif someone has a serious failure please report it, talk about and make your fellow buyers aware. The companies might not care for you, but if you hit them where it hurts(their pockets), they will make sure to be more careful next time and turn out a better product.', ''),

As are all of the mass-market ankle holsters, it''s thick woven nylon with Velcro, bulkier than it has to be.   The thickness of the two sides of the holster and the Velcro''d straps on each side is more than the pistol itself.\n\n This holster is one of the kind with the support strap that goes below the knee; I couldn''t see any point in grinding a strapless holster against the top of my shoe.\n\n Anyway, I wasn''t sure I''d like the ankle holster, but I was willing to give it a try.  After the first day, I barely noticed its presence; after the second day I didn''t notice it at all.  The LCP is very small and light, and the holster doesn''t chafe or bind.\n\n The holster is machine-washable, so I just throw it in the laundry once a week to get the sweat, dirt, grass clippings, etc. out.  \n\n I still think the holster could be less bulky, but all of the ones on the market seem to be pretty much the same, no matter who makes them.

The license is real, valid, has two weapons (shotgun and revolver). I am aware that old books have to be computerized by the end of this year. I am stating the things I want to get done, can somebody suggest the best way to go about this. What steps to do first. Thanks in advance.\n\n1) I Need to become the primary holder of this license. I have my father''s death certificate, Legal heir-ship certificate, Authority letter from my siblings and mother on stamp paper to transfer the license and weapons to me, all CNIC photocopies. This license was issued and registered in DC East. I live in South. What should I do?\n\n2) I want to replace the revolver with a pistol.\n\n3) I would like to increase the qty. of rounds from 100 to more (as much as possible these days) \n\n4) If push comes to shove, I would like to apply for the computerized book(s). My understanding is that if you have more than one weapon on the old book you will have to apply for separate books in the future. Correct me if I am wrong. \n\n5) Would the existing validity (2015) apply to the new book(s)?[/quote]', ''),

Hand Engraved ( though very little engraving)\n2. Lighter by about 6 0zs\n3. Better balanced as has conventional barrel with fixed chokes. The Silver Hawk has Mobil chokes so the barrels are thicker at the muzzle to take on threads. This makes it muzzle heavy good for duck but slow on partridge and quail.\n4.

(562639, ' [QUOTE=Gilani;96877][B]INTRODUCTION[/B]\n\nWhile going through posts about different handgun, I always thought that in many cases, our opinions are biased about the handguns that we own or we have used. There is nothing wrong about it; it is but natural. However, at times the whole exercise of knowing about a weapon goes for a fix when someone doesn''t like a comment or view on one of his favourite handgun. This ignites a futile discussion and the [B]biggest sufferers are less experienced members who log on to this site for knowing authentic facts about the handguns they want to buy or use[/B]. The main reason for this is that most of us do not follow an objective method of reviewing a handgun and do not quantify our opinion. Comparative data is mostly not available and in the absence of objective facts and comparative data, the review mostly takes the shape of a personal opinion.  \n\nNow how to judge a weapon objectively. I have always believed that the final test of a weapon is its firing accuracy and reliability. If a weapon cant put the bullets at intended place and is prone to stoppages or is not rugged enough to bear the field conditions, its no good a weapon no matter what the brand or price. I AM SURE ALL WOULD APPRECIATE THAT ONE SHOULD NEVER COMPROMISE ON RELIABILITY. ON ACCURACY, ONE SHOULD AGAIN NEVER COMPROMISE UNLESS IT IS INTENDED TO KEEP A CONCEAL CARRY GUN. Even while buying a CC gun, one should keep in mind that it must meet 100% reliability and bare minimum accuracy requirements. Hence this thread. \n\nIn this thread, I would request everyone to post firing results of different handguns that we own or use. However, unless there are standard parameters to quantify the results, there is no use of such an exercise. I would therefore suggest a standard method which I have been following myself to check the accuracy of various handguns. [B]This, by no means is a comprehensive method but a quick and economical one.[/B]. Any suggestions to improve this method (while still keeping it economical) would be most welcome. MOST IMPORTANT THING TO REMEMBER IS THAT THIS IS THE TEST OF THE GUN AND NOT OF THE FIRER. \n\n[B]THE METHOD[/B]:\n\n1.  In order to minimise firer''s error, [B]handgun should preferably be fired from a bench.[/B] If a proper firing bench is not available, firer may rest his elbows on a table while himself sitting on a chair. \n\n2.  [B]A standard target[/B] with 1 inch radius bull (10 points) 2 inch radius 9 ring, 3 inch radius 8 ring, 4 inch radius 7 ring and so on, be used for firing. \n\n3.  One round of test fire should consist of [B]15 bullets, 5 fired from 10 M, another 5 from 20 M and another five from 30 M.[/B] The procedure should preferably be repeated twice, ie, total of 30 bullets. Two warmer rounds should be fired from the gun before starting test fire. This will make a total of 32 bullets for one handgun. \n\n4.  [B]Ammo should not be changed[/B] during the test. Moreover, magazine should be filled to max capacity, in order to check the performance of magazine and chances of failure to feed. \n\n5.  [B]Aiming point should be the center of the bull and must not be changed[/B] throughout the test even if a firer can clearly note bias of bullets on a particular side. ie, no adjustments should be done throughout the test. If guns has adjustable sights, they should be zeroed before the test but during the test, sights should not be adjusted. \n\n6.  Photos be taken after each test. \n\n7.  As the number of bullets fired in one go is 15, the test will have 150 points. Add 150 points of the second test and take and average / percentage. I suggest following grading;\n\n    -  [B]Exceptionally Accurate....................95% and above \n     -  Extremely Accurate........................90% - 94.9% \n     -  Very Accurate.................................85% to 89.9% \n     -  Accurate.........................................80% to 84.9% \n     -  Fairly Accurate................................75% to 79.9% \n     -  Moderately Accurate........................ 70% to 74.9%\n     -  Average..........................................60% to 69.9% \n     -  Just acceptable...............................50% to 59.9% \n     -  Inaccurate, should preferably not be bought.......45% to 49.9% \n     -  Junk, Dont buy it.............................44.9% and below[/B]\n\nI always thought that the scoring system of this accuracy test should not be just based on points scored on precision shooting target. The groups formed by the pistol should also be taken into account and should be added to overall score. I have therefore tried to give values to groups formed from 10, 20 and 30 M tests. I am going to amend all the previous results and add the points scored through the groups. It was pointed out by few senior members as well that group formed by a particular handgun should also have some waitage. For standardisation sake, I will be using following values:\n\n[U][B]Group from 10 M[/B][/U]\n-  1.5 inches or less............50 points\n-  1.6 to 2 inches...............45 \n-  2.1 to 2.5 inches............40\n-  2.6 to 3 inches..............35\n-  3.1 to 3.5 inches............30\n-  3.6 to 4 inches...............25\n-  4.1 to 4.5 inches............20\n-  4.6 to 5 inches...............15\n-  5.1 to 5.5 inches............10\n-  5.6 to 6 inces................5\n-  Over 6 inches................0\n\n[U][B]Group from 20 M[/B][/U]\n-  2 inches or less............50 points\n-  2.1 to 3 inches.............45 \n-  3.1 to 4 inches.............40\n-  4.1 to 5 inches.............35\n-  5.1 to 6 inches.............30\n-  6.1 to 7 inches.............25\n-  7.1 to 8 inches.............20\n-  8.1 to 9 inches.............15\n-  9.1 to 10 inches...........10\n-  10.1 to 11 inces............5\n-  Over 11 inches..............0\n\n[U][B]Group from 30 M[/B][/U]\n-  3 inches or less............50 points\n-  3.1 to 4 inches.............45 \n-  4.1 to 5 inches.............40\n-  5.1 to 6 inches.............35\n-  6.1 to 7 inches.............30\n-  7.1 to 8 inches.............25\n-  8.1 to 9 inches.............20\n-  9.1 to 10 inches...........15\n-  10.1 to 11 inches..........10\n-  11.1 to 12 inces............5\n-  Over 12 inches..............0\n\n8.  [B]MOST IMPORTANT THING TO REMEMBER IS THAT THIS IS THE TEST OF THE GUN AND NOT OF THE FIRER.[/B] So please don''t try to improve the result by making adjustmet. Just fire the gun as it is, adhering to standard parameters mentioned above. \n\n9.  Post the pics in the thread and wait for the comments :D\n\nI will start the thread by posting the test fire results of a few handguns. I am sure others would also add their pics following the standard procedure. After some time, we will have a good number of pics concerning different guns and a new user will be able to compare the results and at least have some objective input about one of the very important aspects of any handgun. \n\nThanks and regards\n\n=============================================================================================\n=============================================================================================\n\n\n\n=============================================================================================\n=============================================================================================[/QUOTE]\n\nVERY WELL Written!

I just fail to understand the thought behind the "Engine-On" switch in the handlebar. why turning the key ignition switch to "ON" isn''t enough? why over complicate a pretty simple process?[/quote]\r\n\r\n You can blame the United States Department of Transportation, National Highway Traffic Safety Administration for that.  Back in 1973(?) they mandated an "engine kill switch" for motorcycles, with the insane idea that if the motorcycle fell over and you were trapped underneath it, you could use the switch to shut the engine off.  Why that was so important, and why you could presumably reach the handlebar but not the ignition switch, was never explained.  "It''s politics, not engineering..."\r\n\r\n The switchgear is probably in common with some American model.  "Sorry about that, Chief."\r\n\r\n I like your bike a lot, though.  You mentioned oil dripping from the chain - is that an enclosed chain drive, or only a chain guard?  Most enclosed chains went away in the early 1970s.  The manufacturers saved a little money, and the buyer spent a lot replacing chains.  <sigh>', ''),

But if you want to have a gun which serves the purpose as SD and also to be used at range and could also be used as CG then I will suggest to go for G17. The price for Gen4 varies from City to City. In Lahore & Peshawar Gen4 G17/19 is in between 260-280K. In Karachi around 300-320K.\n\nAnd you know the good thing about Glock accessories, that''s where Glock''s versatility comes handy, most of the parts are interchangeable and mostly all the accessories could be put on any Glock.

Now if @fezan fire in a very short time say 1.5 seconds then from the very fast rate of fire we get 320 RPM but if he fires slightly slow say 2.5 secs then same 8 rounds now when fired in 2.5 secs give you the rate of 192 RPM and so on!

In Lahore & Peshawar Gen4 G17/19 is in between 260-280K. In Karachi around 300-320K.\n\nAnd you know the good thing about Glock accessories, that''s where Glock''s versatility comes handy, most of the parts are interchangeable and mostly all the accessories could be put on any Glock.

Normally standard light load is 115 grain , intermediate is 124 grain and heavier side is 147 . Hydra shock comes in 135 grain . Grain is basically the weight of the bullet . Light fast bullets are going to expand more violently and cause them to slow down faster with less penetration . Heavy slow jhp bullets will expand less resulting in more penetration .

I scrimped on the mounts and the result is some heart burn. The Diana has significant barrel droop, which is supposed to be good when shooting with open sights. But when I scoped it with normal 2-piece mounts which do not compensate for droop, I had to use shims.\r\n\r\nUmair bhai made some shims for me from a Pepsi can, but perhaps i wrongly tightened the mount and slightly dented the scope tube. So i replaced the shims with insulating tape, but after a few shots, the recoil caused the layers of tape to move and lose alignment, causing a shift in POI. \r\n\r\nSo now I am back to aluminium shims with a slight difference. I cut the shims so that the lowest one is smallest in width, gradually increasing so that the topmost shim is widest. This way I hope to sort of retain the curvature of the mount and not put extra pressure on the scope tube. Haven''t tested on paper target yet so can''t comment on whether it works.\r\n\r\nBUT, a proper one-piece drooper mount would have solved this problem.....................BUT...............this is how we learn when we ignore seniors'' advice.\r\n\r\nThe gun with scope weights 5kgs and is difficult to shoot without a rest, and considering i am now middle aged, weight training is out.\r\n\r\nSome pics attached, extra marks for guessing the animal to which the skin belongs.........', ''),

What was your speed?\n\n4. Any abnormal incident that might have happened in past days? Such as passing over rough road, striking of a metal etc?\n\n5. What size is the size of tyre that you are using right now?\n\n6. What is the recommended size of your car tyre by your car manufacturer?\n\n7. What was the pressure that you last checked? and from where? My personal study suggests that only few per cent of air guges are of correct calibration and many are wrong my as high as 50%.\n\n8. Which tyre on which side (rare or front and left or right tyre) burst?\n\n9. What exactly happened at the time of burst? Do you recall any unusual behavior of car or trey or sound before burst?\n\n10. Was whole rubber blown off the rim? Or only part or none?\n\n11. What is the rim type? Normal steel or ALLOY? How old?\n\n12. I hope no one left a tool in side the tyre while balancing etc? Like some time doctors foget in patients they operate? :) No offense :)\n\n13. How much was the mileage on these tyres?\n\n14. Any work done by mechanic recently?\n\n15. Any other details that come to your mind?\n\nPlease share above details one-on-one, then we try to figure out the root cause. It is VERY important to know the cause as it is very dangerous.

I know it might sound a bit more than the worth due to the 16ga thing, but the way I am weighing the relative worth of the gun is as following:\n\n1) Obviously is Midland Gun co is not at par with any guns made in London premises, but its still Made in England and Birmingham.\n\n2) For me 16ga has obviously more advantages.\n\n3) The other factor is comparing it with the other guns that might be available here in the same price bracket (by this comparison I mean no disrespect to any other brands and their respective guns, Baikals especially) for that price I would get a baikal or any turkish. Turkish just don''t suit my taste and Baikals are a bit heavy.\n\n4) I am 100% sure of the fact that the gun by no means has been altered.\n\n\nBest Regards\n\nP.S: The proof marks would be confirmed before striking the deal.', ''),

(563196, ' Bro,\n\nWelcome to Pakguns.\n\nFirst of all, please understand one thing very clearly that owning a gun won''t make you defensible. You will lot of training and mental preparation for using it. Otherwise, having a gun may harm you or innocent people around you or you will end up lossing the gun itself.\n\nAnyway, the answers to your questions are:\n\n1) You will need NPB (Non-Prohibited Bore) license. It could either provincial (issued by DCO of District mentioned on your CNIC) or federal (MOI).\n2) 9mm is sufficient caliber for self defense. It is up to you to decide if you want to kill or injure the assailant because every real gun can kill.\n3) It is quite possible to get a lisence without any refernce. If you are a tax payer and submit income tax return (if you don''t file income tax return, do file it this year till 30-10-2013), you can apply for provincial license. Go to DCO of your area and ask him to issue you a license. Keep in mind, it will take lot of your time and efforts but in the end you will get an authentic license. Bad news is that licenses are not being issued these days and they may open soon.\n4) There are many options but first get the license. Till that time, read different threads on this forum and you will have very good idea that what do you want.\n\nIn the end, I will insist that you will need lot of training to make a gun your defensive tool.', ''),

As I mentioned in thread, that I knockedout one of them and then all of them (they were three) started to beat me and I tried my best to defend myself to some extent and I did some damage to them.

Other factors that you might want to consider is the price and the availability of the bullets. Get a Caliber that is easily available and affordable. I mean one of us can only dream of using a 357 as a regular practice / range weapon.\n\n\nAmongst the few available and affordable calibers are:\n\n.22lr\n30 bore\n9mm (the most common caliber used world wide)\n\nThen  again another thing you got to consider again is what are the weapon options available for your preferred Caliber. Till the time you apply for the license and get your hands on one, you can do all the research and develop a good enough knowledge base because you see.... Guns are not something you buy every day, and there is no one perfect gun.\n\nLearn about different types of pistols available (i.e. Single Action, Double Action, Single Action / Double Action, Striker Fired ,Hammer fired etc) their functions (Manual Safety, Trigger Safety Grip Safety, De-cocker, loaded chamber indicator etc)....choose the functions you want in your weapon...read about different sizes of frames available (Full frame, Compact and Sub Compact).....read about the advantages and disadvantages of each size type.\n\nIf there are any confusions, we are here buddy. You may ask questions.\n\nAnd concerning what happened to you, I know it must have really hurt your ego and feelings but brother, its not the end of the world. It could have been much worse.

If you get to have MICHELIN now in replacement due to any reason then do not bother too much except that the tyers should be fresh!

(563431, ' Salam All,\nIn all my years (since ''83) of driving I have yet to have a run-flat or a burst tire.  Here in Pak my normal motorway speed is average about 150/kmh to Peshawar and about the same to Lahore.  \nI don''t keep 30psi air in my car... for some reason in Pakistan it doesn''t matter if you drive a rikshaw, 125, lamborghini, Porsche, Honda, Hino... the tire pressure is always that stupid silly 30psi.  I wonder what idiot came up with that 30psi ratta system.  In my Honda for example I drive with 205 60 15 size tire and the tires upfront have no more than 28psi and the rears are at 26psi.  Most tires can go up to 44psi pressure before blowing up.  \nKey to tires is: what tread wear rating is it?  And so forth.  A soft tire will give you amazing grip but will wear out quickly where as a hard compound tire will last longer but will give more sound less grip.\nThe DB series is a good tire.  I always used TOYO or Falken or Dunlop or Michelen - Pirellis, Continnentals, I don''t recommend as they are on top hence command almost twice the money.  If not then they are knockoffs or fakes. \nLastly most tires sold here are smuggled and/or knockoffs.  If one intends to drive fast like I do over long distances then I recommend getting something with an H rating as they are rated for 130mph speeds, V rating are up to 150mph and then there is the Z rating which is 150+mph.  Most tires here are R rated which is the lowest in speed up to 100mph or 167kmh.\nLastly tires do burst due to terrain, improper wear, over inflation or anything as such.  Regular checking of Air pressure (once a week) and bi monthly alignments ensures longer even wear of tires not to mention saves fuel costs.', ''),

(563540, ' and another...\r\n\r\n I''m rebuilding a house, so I spend a fair amount of time climbing around floor joists and underneath things.  I managed to snag the holster a few times until I got in the habit of avoiding obstacles.\r\n\r\n Here, I''ve just come in from mowing the yard, and you can see dirt on the back of the Ruger.  It''s time to clean it.  Though it would slow a the draw down and make the holster bulkier, a flap over the gun might be nice.\r\n\r\n The ankle holster probably exposes the gun to more trash than even open carry.  So far, I''ve managed to get dirt, grass clippings, mud, and lots of sweat on the gun; in a couple of months, it will have to deal with snow as well.  Unless you clean the gun every day or so, an ankle holster would be hard on a gun that wasn''t mostly plastic or stainless steel.  I don''t know what the Ruger''s slide is made of, but it hasn''t developed rust spots yet.\r\n\r\n The ankle band part is wide and not ventilated.  On very hot days, it is noticeably warm.  An open weave or perforations might help.  The holster doesn''t move or chafe during normal walking, climbing, crawling, going up ladders, etc.  I don''t know about running; my running days are over until after I have knee surgery again.\r\n\r\n There are ankle holsters to carry a full-size 1911 or Glock.  I imagine if you were wearing 1970s bell-bottom pants and didn''t mind lurching around like an extra in a cheap horror movie, that might work.  Well, I''m exaggerating, but I wouldn''t want to carry a full-size pistol in an ankle holster unless I had to.\r\n\r\n This is a "left hand" holster, meaning it is intended that you reach across and down with your left hand, pinch the butt of the gun on your right leg, pull it out, and adjust your hand to get a proper grip while drawing.  Frankly, I think it is much easier to pull the gun with my right hand; just reach down, hook a couple of fingers around the butt, and pull it up.  I don''t have to twist my wrist halfway around like I so with my left hand.  Try reaching for an imaginary gun on your ankle and see where your fingers are when you reach for the grip.  If you''re right handed, you might want a "left hand" holster.\r\n\r\n We drive on the right, and my car has a manual transmission.  Even though I''m left-handed, my primary reason for buying the left-hand holster was that my right leg mostly rests against the transmission hump as I drive, while the left works the clutch.  I''ve had a lot of surgery on my left leg, and sometimes things touching it feel really strange due to nerve damage.  Also, I was worried the holster might interfere with my ankle motion or ride down while working the clutch.  I''m glad to say I don''t think there would be any problems with the holster interfering with my clutch foot, but a "right hand" holster would ride over one of the spots on my leg that really doesn''t like to be touched.\r\n\r\n And, hey, the shoes had proper arch supports, were comfortable, and on sale.  But the only color they had in stock was white...', ''),

(563614, ' The top strap has elastic, and the weight of the pistol will drag it down at a slight angle over the course of a day, but the holster won''t drop my more than a finger''s width or so.  And since the bottom of your leg is tapered, motion of the calf muscle tends to pull the holster down against the top strap a bit.\n\n Many of the newer-design holsters don''t have a top strap; the holster rides down and sits on top of your shoe.  I think that would be very annoying, not to mention making it harder to conceal.\n\n\n My ideal ankle holster would have D-ring adjustable straps and quick-buckles instead of elastic and Velcro, and something much thinner than the thick woven nylon all the holsters on the market seem to be made of nowadays.  I picked up some quick-buckles at an outdoor outfitter shop, and some nylon webbing, but it will be a while before I get around to making the holster part.\n\n The Velcro and elastic make the holster adjustable, but my holster doesn''t need to fit anyone else, just me.  I should be able to adjust it to fit and leave it that way.  The Velcro wears out over time, and eventually the (probably otherwise perfectly useable) holster will have to be repaired or replaced.', ''),

(563635, ' [QUOTE=Moeen;401362]Salam All,\nIn all my years (since ''83) of driving I have yet to have a run-flat or a burst tire.  Here in Pak my normal motorway speed is average about 150/kmh to Peshawar and about the same to Lahore.  \nI don''t keep 30psi air in my car... for some reason in Pakistan it doesn''t matter if you drive a rikshaw, 125, lamborghini, Porsche, Honda, Hino... the tire pressure is always that stupid silly 30psi.  I wonder what idiot came up with that 30psi ratta system.  In my Honda for example I drive with 205 60 15 size tire and the tires upfront have no more than 28psi and the rears are at 26psi.  Most tires can go up to 44psi pressure before blowing up.  \nKey to tires is: what tread wear rating is it?  And so forth.  A soft tire will give you amazing grip but will wear out quickly where as a hard compound tire will last longer but will give more sound less grip.\nThe DB series is a good tire.  I always used TOYO or Falken or Dunlop or Michelen - Pirellis, Continnentals, I don''t recommend as they are on top hence command almost twice the money.  If not then they are knockoffs or fakes. \nLastly most tires sold here are smuggled and/or knockoffs.  If one intends to drive fast like I do over long distances then I recommend getting something with an H rating as they are rated for 130mph speeds, V rating are up to 150mph and then there is the Z rating which is 150+mph.  Most tires here are R rated which is the lowest in speed up to 100mph or 167kmh.\nLastly tires do burst due to terrain, improper wear, over inflation or anything as such.  Regular checking of Air pressure (once a week) and bi monthly alignments ensures longer even wear of tires not to mention saves fuel costs.[/QUOTE]\n\nWith all due respect to Moeen Bahi, I would take the liberty to add few points to supplement your points. You are right 30 PSI is not a magic number, everyone should check the pressure as per recommendation of the car manufacturer.  Usually the required pressure is given in door frame of many vehicles or in user manual.\nThe tyres can burst due to over pressure BUT can also burst due to too low pressure. When too much pressure then on long drives (like Moeen Bahi at 150KM/Hr :)) the tyre will have an increase in pressure due heat produced at high speeds and can thus burst. On the other hand too low pressure may also result in burst as the contact surface becomes too much and frictional forces will increase significantly and due to which overheating will increase the pressure as well AND lot of WEAR will happen very, very quickly and you end up having a tyre burst!', ''),

PLEASE note that usually the pressure recommended for your car is[B] COLD TYRE PRESSURE[/B] means that when car is parked for several hours say at night then in morning before you move it, you check the pressure. If you drive your car and go to shop and check; then the pressure reading (assuming correct gauge) will be reported higher.\n\nThis means say your car''s recommended pressure is 28 PSI. Assume that your car tyre pressure at morning (cold tyre pressure) is exactly 28 PSI. When you drive few kilometers and go to tyre shop and check it will be reported higher say around 30 PSI.  Correcting the pressure will require deflating (taking out some air) to make it 28 PSI. When you come home park and re-check when tyre is cold; you would actually get low pressure say around 25 PSI.\n\nWhat I do to overcome this issue is that when I go to tyre shop and if I need to have 28 PSI then I tell the shop to have my car''s pressure set to 30 PSI. What I do is that I have estimated for my car tyre the correct pressure when tyre is hot; since I have a car pump and pressure gauges which I have used to estimate correct value (so please do not blindly follow my above example unless you make sure). I have two values one for summer and one for winter!', ''),

Its true revolvers do not have safeties because of their long heavy pull. But if it concerns you, the surest way of preventing an ND is to let the hammer rest on a live round (100% safe if your gun has transfer bar) and skip the following chamber. That way you have to pull the trigger twice to fire a live round. When LEOs are asked how many shots they fired in a high stress situation, they answer 2 when 7-8 rounds were discharged.

To answer your \n[B]1st question:[/B] "[B]What do you prefer for range shooting?[/B]" Well I prefer mostly all my guns for range use which has got more than 4" barrel length regardless of the brand. But to have fun at range I also use some times the compacts and sub-compacts as well. :)\n\n[B]2nd Question[/B]: "[B]What''s more accurate?[/B]" This is a very lengthy subject and the answer won''t be simple as the question is. :) There are many factors involved in the accuracy. But to cut the long story short, my formula for &#8220;What&#8217;s more accurate&#8221; is: \n\n\nI will recommend STOCK gun to begin with. Brand doesn&#8217;t matter but given the following 3 things, any gun full filling these will be good contender as an accurate range gun.\n\nI) Grip feels natural when you grip on the gun,\nII) Trigger is smooth and there is not much of pre-travel pull\nIII) Easy to sight Target Sights\n\nThen it comes to a shooter to play his/her role in the following:\n\nI) comfortable breath-in breath-out\nII) Shooting stance\nIII) Trigger Pull (No Jerk :) )\n\nAfter going through this process, one can then look for the upgrades. Glock and CZ custom parts & accessories are available at some of the gun stores and you can also import. But as I suggested start with stock gun, get yourself comfortable with the gun. See how you are going/improving at the range and then go for upgrades as you feel. For me most of my stock guns are accurate as I feel comfortable while using them at range. :)', ''),

To answer your \n[B]1st question:[/B] "[B]What do you prefer for range shooting?[/B]" Well I prefer mostly all my guns for range use which has got more than 4" barrel length regardless of the brand. But to have fun at range I also use some times the compacts and sub-compacts as well. :)\n\n[B]2nd Question[/B]: "[B]What''s more accurate?[/B]" This is a very lengthy subject and the answer won''t be simple as the question is. :) There are many factors involved in the accuracy. But to cut the long story short, my formula for &#8220;What&#8217;s more accurate&#8221; is: \n\n\nI will recommend STOCK gun to begin with. Brand doesn&#8217;t matter but given the following 3 things, any gun full filling these will be good contender as an accurate range gun.\n\nI) Grip feels natural when you grip on the gun,\nII) Trigger is smooth and there is not much of pre-travel pull\nIII) Easy to sight Target Sights\n\nThen it comes to a shooter to play his/her role in the following:\n\nI) comfortable breath-in breath-out\nII) Shooting stance\nIII) Trigger Pull (No Jerk :) )\n\nAfter going through this process, one can then look for the upgrades. Glock and CZ custom parts & accessories are available at some of the gun stores and you can also import. But as I suggested start with stock gun, get yourself comfortable with the gun. See how you are going/improving at the range and then go for upgrades as you feel. For me most of my stock guns are accurate as I feel comfortable while using them at range. :)[/QUOTE]\n\nReally appreciate your answer, true shooter style rather than straight forward suggesting me pistol you explained. Starting with stock then moving on to customization even I had this in my mind , tell me sir to start from stock which of the option would you advise me , cz shadow or cz 85 combat or cz 75b ? keeping in mind im a left handed shooter and have small hands .

(564779, 'shoulder holster musings Earlier this year I inherited my Dad''s Taurus .38 revolver.  It''s basically an aluminum copy of the old Smith & Wesson "J frame."  During the summer months I wear a T-shirt and pants; the only practical way to carry a pistol that way is in an ankle holster, and the Taurus is awkwardly shaped for that.  I know they make holsters for that purpose, but they make ankle holsters for Glock 17s and full-size 1911s, too.  And someone probably makes one for a 10" Contender and the Desert Eagle, but that doesn''t mean I''m going to clank around with something like that strapped to my lower leg.\r\n\r\nAnyway, given the practicalities of the situation, I started carrying a Ruger LCP in an ankle holster.  Which has worked just fine.  \r\n\r\nAs the weather drops down to freezing here, it would be convenient to carry the Taurus in a shoulder holster. So I go online to shop for one.\r\n\r\nOh my. Shoulder holster prices are high compared to belt holsters. Yes, I understand they''re much more complicated, I just wasn''t expecting the price difference. I''ll pay it, but ouch...\r\n\r\nSelection of left hand shoulder holsters is very sparse. Unfortunately, I insist on a left-handed holster. \r\n\r\nMost of the ones I''ve found were leather. Mongo like leather, but in the case of a shoulder holster, I think I''d prefer something synthetic, machine-washable, and non-staining. But I''ll take leather if I have to.\r\n\r\nSome holsters loop around both armpits and your back, in what I think of as the "classic" style. Hunting holsters sometimes have an additional strap across the front to keep the holster from flopping about during various activities; a fine idea, but the strap isn''t desirable for concealed carry.\r\n\r\nAnother type of holster has shoulder loops, but instead of taking the weight against the opposite armpit, a strap goes down to your belt (loop types) or pants (spring clips). Some have a second belt strap under the holster itself, offering extra stability to the holster. Nice idea. I''m guessing you have to hunt for the "neutral axis" position for the straps so your pants don''t hitch up when you sit down.\r\n\r\nThere seem to be two basic gun positions - alongside the rib cage, mostly vertical, or lower or under the rib cage, completely horizontal, butt sticking straight forward.\r\n\r\nSince I''m built more like Orson Welles than Slim Pickens, I was looking for a holster that would position the gun up near my shoulder, instead of down closer to my equator. Though I''m sure I''ve seen pictures of such holster somewhere, I haven''t been able to locate any "high ride" shoulder holsters so far.\r\n\r\nI''d also like one of those pushbutton "retention" devices like some of the belt holsters have, but I haven''t found a shoulder rig with that, either.\r\n\r\n\r\nI expect I''ll eventually find something I can live with, but it''s interesting that google, amazon, midway, and ebay keep throwing up the same three or four holsters; I guess there''s just not a lot out there in a left hand J frame shoulder rig nowadays.', ''),

In pistols and semi autos rifles the cartridge has potential of cycling issues\n\n2) For Self Defense you need something that you can carry with you, secondly why do you need a .22 rifle when you can shoot the came bullet in a handgun? The only good enough reason to get a .22 rifle is to use it for either Hunting or Competitive Shooting as the rifle will give you the range. For Self Deference purposes you don''t need a weapon with alot of range. Over 90% of Self defence incidents involve shooting within 5 meters of range and most of the self defense conceal carry weapons are designed in a way to give accuracy at short distances only.\n\n3) If you need something to protect your Home (Home Defence), Please let us know. If you need something you want to Carry (Self Defence), then please let us know. We shall then guide you accordingly Insha Allah', ''),

Until the corruption in police and the whole British created penal code is replaced with something robust and fair. We had to forgive the armed robbers in the court not to creste life long enemies but before that they were "treated very well" by not police but another agency.\n\nEven UK police don''t do jack if your wallet, watch &/or mobile gets snatched .. unless it is covered by CCTV. One bears the loss and moves on. Knife robbery crime is not uncommon in UK and unless you can identify the assailants then only action is taken ... otherwise it''s just another incident for statistics. But if you get badly hurt/stabbed then only they put in serious effort to catch the criminals.\n\nIt''s not only PK, in Australia a house theif slipped on the kitchen floor due to a water leakage, after his breaking in, and successfully sued the house owners for damages in court as he broke his arm!!! Stupid laws exist everywhere.\n\nI like Malaysia though.

(564404, ' I have a little experience to share here too...some of which might not be directly related to the query but may be helpful otherwise. \n\nI was lucky enough to acompany & witness (the referred) Mr. Ali while he tested the three Daystate PCP rifles @ LRC before deciding on which one to buy! Those were a 60ft-lbs with sound moderator, a 50ft-lbs with shrouded barrel & a Huntsman. \n\nThough the scope was not zeroed properly but from his vast experience, Mr. Ali shot quite a lot of pellets to see the consistency of the guns. What I recall from that session, the 60ft-lbs gun was spreading around 4-6" @ the range. I don''t know the exact distance of LRC rifle range, sorry. \n\nThe shrouded barrel one had some loose fixtures so it was not shot to that extent. \n\nHuntsman proved to be much more accurate at that distance and by the same shooter. Unfortunately the spotting scope was worse than my own eyesight so had to rely on shooter''s own feedback thru rifle''s scope. Later came to know thru Mr. Ali that one reason of such inaccuracy could be that barrel was not de-greased before shooting... \n\nThough I went to pick that rrifle up without testing considering it was NIB & a Daystate, Mr. Ali''s testing session saved me from making a decision that I would have regretted even before the first shoot! Yes. \n\nWhat I learnt & was not comforting for my use was:\n\n (In the 60ft-lbs model)\n\n1. The 500cc buddy bottle took two LRC staff Jawaans to take turns to fill up to 200 bar (about 75%) who eventually refused to do so after third fill saying, they had warts on their palms. They were usuing NIB Hill pump.\n\n2. With almost thrice the effort to fill it up as I can now compare it with P1000, being a twice as powerful, Daystate gives half the shots (around 35) as compared to P1000.\n\n3. Due to fixed bottle, it needs to laid down on ground as pump hoses are usually half a meter. And that is a potential threat of bruises & dust unless exceptional care is taken.\n\nIn general, its a gun to go with a scuba tank rather than a hand pump. Too powerful for small birds under 50 meters and inacurate for the same beyond that. \n\nBeing as loud as a standard velocity 22lr, if considered too powerful as an airgun, its far inferior in ballistics & power to a 22lr round being the next ascending level in hunting options and being about four times as expensive including charging equipment, rifle, scope & other necessary accessories. And probably a good option for those regions where firearms laws are strict & hunting certain species with certain types of guns are restricted.\n\n\nComing back to 30ft-lbs PCPs, all three options are great and in a logical order of preference. Anyone would go with that. A simple logic of pay more get more. Though the accuracy of all the guns is comparable. \n\nHowever there might are certain things to be consider in comparison. \n\nHuntsman gives around half (35) the shots as compared to P1000 per fill and that is a big difference when there is a 20 minutes workout is due after 30-35 shots! And PCPs just love to spit lead like an AR15.\n\nWood is good on all three with fit and finish in a sequence of HW100> P1000> Huntsman.\n\nP1000 has a two piece furniture whereas the other two have full length stock.\n\nBolt and loading mechanism of HW100 & P1000 is almost identical.\n\nP1000 is a new entrant that has yet to establish itself and stand upto its legendary inheritance whereas the other two models have proven their reliability & performance for a reasonably longer period than P1000 now.', ''),

(564439, ' Air Arms s510 is a GREAT gun BUT its availability is an issue here. As far as I know, no one in Pakistan owns one. Its performance and reliability are at par with HW100 and I like the wood work better on the AirArms gun.\n\nAs previously mentioned Diana is a newer gun and has had its share of issues. \n\nA 60ft/lb gun I agree will require significant efforts to fill so a scuba tank or other carbon fiber HPA tank is recommended. As for the accuracy, I believe in a high powered airgun that depends on the kind of pellet used. Theoretically it shall be spitting normal 14-16 or even 18 grain pellets well above 1200 fps to get to 55+ fpe. These high velocities result in two things, the pellet breaks sound barrier (hence the loud crack) and pellet gets destabilized more often than not due to such high velocities (therefore the inaccuracy). \n\nSo the choice of pellets in assessing gun''s accuracy becomes VERY critical when dealing with high powered air guns. You need 25 or 30 grain pellets to keep velocities close to 1000 fps where the pellets will be much more stable and the gun''s true potential will be revealed. As far as I know VERY few people have those heavy pellets at hand (I luckily have 25 grain pellets :D) \n\nI believe HW100s are no more available for sale at any shop (but Im not sure yet) so your choice is limited to Diana P1000, or the Marauder (if Murtaza at Outdoor imports it). IF the price difference between the Marauder and P1000 is even slightly significant, I''d recommend you go for Marauder. You''ll find TONNES of reviews speaking nothing but good about that gun and in .22 cal it is capable of doing 28-32 fpe.

People who said it is bad idea are RELATIVELY MORE WRONG than the idea; that it is not a wrong/bad idea to have it :)\n\nWell truth is our body sitting on the bike also has surface area to face the head wind and offer deceleration (reduction in acceleration)!!!! MAY be less or may be more!!!! Lets not debate that for now!!!! ([B]May be more - due to cloths surface friction etc. etc.[/B]). BUT lets take for a moment that there might be more area of the windshield than our body; so theoretically more force and resistance at high speed by the windshield! BUT this can be defied by intelligent design!!! and may be reduced substantially. Can you recall the BIG 22-wheeler trucks plying on PAK roads (in other countries as well) they have installed a small AERO-SHEET on top of driver cabin!!!!! WHY? Only to modify the dynamics of air flowing! This increases the performance of AERO-DYNAMIC flow and reduced force! \n\nNow coming to your pics. It apparently seems to be wonderful design - congratulations!!!! After looking into pics - Can you review yourself the vertical inclination of the shield? May be a slight backward tilt helps further improve aerodynamic response!!! It is just a reminder to RE-CHECK yourself - if you think it is okay then okay else little rotation about axes of handle might be helpful!\n\nPS: Without any other merits or ODDS one thing is for sure - when your body is NOT resisting the force of wind directly due to shield YOU will NOT be tired after long fast drive!! [B]You have to spend a lot of energy to resist the load of wind[/B].  The load-path is: Force from chest, arms and other areas partly goes to your arms and gets transferred to handle etc and part goes to your lower body and gets transferred to seat and foot rests etc. In other case i.e. with windshield case ALL force (or most of the force) gets transferred to windshield and then to attachment points of the bike and NOT YOU) so less physical effort and you feel un-tired and relaxed after drive!\nRegards \n;)\nYOU ARE NOT STUBBORN in my humble opinion - at least!', ''),

(564901, ' @GUNFREAK, bro  AR-15s come in all types of barrel sizes ranging from 7.5 inch barrels with pistol length gas tubes to 20inch barrels with rifle length gas tubes. The reason we mostly see 16inch barrelled AR-15s on american websites and youtube reviews is because you need specific paper work in america a special permission and a tax stamp to own a rifle with a barrel shorter than 16inches, Although 14.5 inch AR-15s with a permanently attached muzzle break or flash hider also class as 16inch barrels and can be seen in youtube reviews as well. The only difference between AR-15s and the M4 is that AR-15s are semi automatic in action where as the M4 is select fire, AR-15 is the name of a rifle type which is produced by dozens of manufacturers. Some manufacturers produce a better quality AR as compared to colt (such as BCM rifles) while others produce poorer quality stuff (such as rock river). While the M4 is the name of a specific rifle that is basically a select fire AR-15 produced by colt for the US army. Barrel length does not differentiate between an AR and an M4.

I told him Sir, pls unlock it first.. \r\n\r\nAftr that he asks me, what type of a bullet is this?? Told em its a Hollow point (he should have known this!)\r\n\r\nThen he takes it to another senior. That senior looked very arrogant and was in civilian clothes (with extra civilian guards)\r\nHe checks my license thoroughly,  asking me for NIC as well.. than gave It to three star guy saying weapon was loaded. Keep it. We will return it to him after verification! \r\n\r\nI''m like, Sir its a computerised license!  He''s like It was loaded..\r\n\r\nKhair other guy says dont worry, we will just verify it. You can come and take it back from us NEXT WEEK. I''m like WTH!! I can''t come this far again.. give me a receipt etc.. Khair I  went to big senior again\r\n\r\nBig senior tells me we r keeping the weapon, we can also keep you!! The @^$*@*$*$. Really pissed me off. Threating honest law abiding citizens!

(its the one without any date!)\r\n\r\nHe looks at it and exclaims,  why do you have a permit of 200 bullets. What will you do with 200 bullets?  I''m like Target practice.  I go to different ranges.  I have also gone to the Rangers range and took part in competition.  Besides now ALL licenses have 200 limit minimum.

If you are planning to ride on rough road (as pictures), I would strongly recommend a new set of wheels and tyres as road tyres won''t give you that much grip on such surface.\n\nIn regards to the rusting parts, there are very good hard chromers in RWP and Lahore too. There''s a very famous bikes specialist mechanic in ISB who builds bikes to one''s specification too. If you need any work done etc, I''ll get his name and number for you from my biker friends here.\n\nBelow is my baby in UK ... couldn''t bring her to PK due to stupid customs rules ... it''s a true cult bike and a rider''s dream bike as it is so well balanced and actually teaches the rider too. 1989 NC30 VFR400. It can keep up with modern 600CBRs to up to 100mph (160kmh) quite comfortably ... miss it dearly as it is so much fun riding it on bendy and clean B roads out there.\n\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]26011[/ATTACH]', ''),

NO Electricity. Ok lets go for pistols(No need of electricity).\r\n              2.   You can only FIRE at LOW HOUSE BIRDS,BECAUSE MACHINE AT HIGH HOUSE IS OUT\r\n                    OF ORDER.\r\n\r\n             Two Skeet throwers from NILA GUMBAD Arms dealers or Buksh Elahi Lahore cost 16-18000 Rs.\r\n             plus Clay Box of 150-birds @ 3000-Rs.\r\n\r\n             Spend the rest of the amount on building workable "PISTOL TARGETS" to be set against a proper\r\n             BACKSTOP. River beds and the adjoining FLOOD DIVERTING (Bunds) are ideal places for CLAYS &\r\n             PISTOL shooting.\r\n\r\n\r\n             On Top you set your CLAY THROWERS with the shooters at lower ground to receive (crossers, cornering\r\n             away going) or overhead shots. Later you all can move down to the base of that BUND to use the HIGH\r\n             wall as BACKSTOP for your pistol targets.', ''),

(565712, ' I wrote in the start of this thread , few months ago about  the financial conditions of  \n  farmers/ tenants and   their  survival on savings they earned from the previous / last year’s paddy crop, has long been exhausted and mostly,  in these months, they   subsist on either loans the take from their landlords or the merchants they know usually from decades and in some cases, from generations.. But such life line is also dried up for these poor farmers. \n    The harvest season is approaching and the soft spoken but tough to deal with land lord,  the  fatty cloth merchant, the lean  grocery shop owner, the  suited booted owner of medical facility , the greedy eyed fertizer dealer,  all want their bills to be  paid back immediately and have softly refused to extend further loans. What to do now.?  …….. So the farmers exactly do the same as one starving person would do if he sees a delicious food being cooked in front of him. That person, naturally would not be patient enough to wait the food to be properly cooked and served before him in plates with spoons and forks, rather he would start to eat right from frying pan as his urge is so great.\n  The harvest season is few weeks late. The paddy is still green and wet but rice is formed inside it .the patience of the hari (Sindhi word means grower, peasant, farmer) has already worn thin , the need of money is  so compelling that they start to “thrash” the unripe  crop .in a way that has been followed in this region since centuries. That method is called “Kutt” . The still green and wet crop is harvested and brought to some dry place on donkey carts, bullock carts or manually. Usually such dry place is a road side near the fields (The road sides are full with haris doing “Kutt”.  It causes the hindrances in traffic but every body knows the tradition so no body objects) and it is thrashed manually on a log ( mostly the date palm tree log) manually. The manual thrashing results is separation of wet and not fully ripe paddy from the plant . Each bundle of crop is thrashed against the log for few times and that bundle is than sold as green grass. The separated / thrashed crop is gathered at one place and is subsequently transported from road side to safe open place where it is dried for couple of days before being transported to market to be sold to repay the debts and to meet the urgent expanses.\n  This way of thrashing is neither a normal nor recommended way. The output crop of “Kutt”is sold on less price for two main reasons   (1) The rice breaks inside the paddy, and (2) the paddy is still considered wet by the merchants/ dealers and some specific percentage of weight is deducted while assessing the price. \n  The farmers try to avoid “Kutt” as much as possible, but you know, urge and hunger don’t   know logic. \n   \n    The greenish, wet and unripe crop is harvested and brought to road side for "Kutt" \n   \n  [IMG]http://imageshack.us/a/img837/6221/q4s5.jpg[/IMG]\n   \n  some scenes of "Kutt"\n   \n  [IMG]http://imageshack.us/a/img824/7430/xwhx.jpg[/IMG]\n   \n  [IMG]http://imageshack.us/a/img404/6497/zvr8.jpg[/IMG]\n   \n  [IMG]http://imageshack.us/a/img513/7120/57d1.jpg[/IMG]\n   \n  [IMG]http://imageshack.us/a/img856/8131/gqjm.jpg[/IMG]\n   \n  The crop got in result of Kutt\n   \n  [IMG]http://imageshack.us/a/img580/3342/r416.jpg[/IMG]\n   \n  The remaining plant to be sold as green grass\n   \n  [IMG]http://imageshack.us/a/img194/4821/c9ib.jpg[/IMG]', ''),

The land is "semi abad" and the guy was producing Tomatoes and "Loki" from this peace of land , but from around 5 years its free. \r\nThere is "nehar" beside the land and irrigation is not an issue. The land around are affected of SAIM but have seen another 50 acre having coconut farm , 120 acre having suger can and anohter 8 acre having rice. \r\n\r\nHope members familiar with the location or know about farming will have better idea .I need advise on following.\r\n1. What could be the price per acre ? demand is 6.5 lac per acre. \r\n2. How will I know its MOROSI and not 30years or 99 years ?\r\n3. How much time and money will it need to make it fertile or get it ready for cultivation again ?\r\n\r\nAwaiting your replies.[/QUOTE]\r\n\r\nSalam bhai. I can''t tell you anything regarding the problem with perspective of a property expert. But I can share following things hope they are of some help:\r\n\r\n1) The Thatta and adjoining areas have great deal of issues, i.e. of course influential people.\r\n2) Secondly the same area is also not free from the negative elements of the society, in fact if I must say it''s a bit more affected.\r\n3) You have mentioned that irrigation is no issue due to a canal running on the side of the said land, but of course you also being from an agrarian background must know how many twists and turns (literally and metaphorically) lie between the lines of just having a neher besides your land and it being of any use to you.\r\n4) If the neher is really near the land, and the land isn''t being cultivated for sometime now, then I am sure of the damage that neher might have caused to the land in this period of time through seepage and ultimately resulting maybe say water-logging. \r\n5) If you want to buy the land for agricultural purposes than I think you have asked the most difficult question.(Referring to your last question). As mostly the lands of Sindh have following properties:\r\n\r\na) Alkaline in nature have high Ph.\r\nb) We have Saline lands here, unlike Sodiac soils they cannot be chemically amended. Meaning you will have to take the natural course of flushing the salts on the surface of the land to leach away below the root levels. And ofcourse this method is most efficient with soils that have a good drainage. But unfortunately water-logged soils don''t have a good drainage. So in that case our best bet would be to go for artificial drainage (Tile,pipe or surface). Again to make these drains maybe you might end up spending more than the per acre cost of the land itself.\r\n\r\nc) Water-logging issues can be addressed to by bringing the water table down to safe level. Now to that either you will have install I don''t know how many tube wells in the area that keep pumping the water forever until the water table reaches a safer level. However the other option that might be handy would be to plant a high density plantation of trees that are salt tolerant, and can withstand the water-logging i.e. babool for example. And that plantation would cost you 2 to 5 years until you can do something with the land. \r\n\r\nd) But lets say if we are lucky enough to have a negligible water logging issue but still our land is sodiac then it can be chemically amended by applying gypsum. Gypsum works wonders on such lands. \r\n\r\nSo there are many issues and variations in your one line question. An agrarian might be able to draw a win-win plan only once he gets correct facts and figures regarding the land conditions and its fertility. Its not rocket science its just about doing things efficiently in terms of time, money and HR.\r\n\r\nBest Regards', ''),

(566271, ' The first shoulder holster didn''t work out.  The off-side strap insisted on riding horizontally under my armpit, rubbing my arm and chest.  Also, the way the straps attached to the holster, both were to the muzzle end of the gun''s center of gravity, so the butt tilted down all the time instead of riding horizontal.  The two back straps crossed over each other through a plastic slider, and the slider would shift from side to side as I moved about.  Then it did that, the holster would sag down toward my belt.  After spending some time fiddling with the adjustments, I decided the holster was never going to work the way I wanted.  The vendor accepted a return, so I sent it back.\n\n I''ve ordered a holster from Nevada Gun Leather.  This one:  [url]http://nevadagunleather.com/Upside-Down-Shoulder-Holster-155.htm[/url]  This one carries the gun "upside down".  I think a horizontal holster would be less obtrusive, but I bought the holster because the straps are completely different from any of the others I''ve found so far.  The offside strap doesn''t cross over itself, and it lies flat along your ribcage.  It cost twice as much as the first one, though.\n\n In the first message I mentioned that shoulder holsters are expensive.  I''ve now found several that cost more than many guns I bought new...

It clearly depicts how thorough gentlemen DSA people are. however the problem is the lack of customer support network. as experienced by another fellow member of the forum who had a problem with dsa autoloader the local arms dealers refused to support him. its convenient for people living in pindi to approach peshawar but not for those in lahore and karachi.\n\nBeing a local arms manufacturer it is the right of DSA to be given priority over other guns by customers in support of our local industry, however it is also the right of the consumer to be given good aftersales support which is possible only if one is able to reach peshawar.\n\nhence living in lahore or karachi it is almost the same as buying a turkish shotgun.\n\nOn this occasion I would humbly request our seniors especially Mr. 12G who happens to know the owners of DSA personally, to bring the issue of establishing some way of consumer support network across the country. Or if nothing then atleast establish some form of it in Lahore and Karachi so customers there can also have their problems addressed.[/QUOTE]\n\nDear DSA Owners, \n\nWe are sorry for any inconveniences caused to your. We stand behind our products and are always willing to provide after sales service. You are correct, for customers in Karachi and Lahore it does become slightly difficult to handle after sales services. Dealers are after all dealers and have limitations. They do not always have facilities for repairing or spare parts replacements. The Pakistani Laws do not allow you to transport a firearm across provinces that easily. For this reason the logistics become very difficult. We welcome you to bring your weapon to us and we will service it for you immediately, this is our guarantee. But unfortunately, we cannot change the laws.\n\nOur after sales support is in good standing and we give customer satisfaction the top most priority. If you have local gunsmiths available we can assist you with replacement spare parts as well. As you know DSA Shooter is a fully interchangeable Military grade Shotgun. \n\nThis year DSA has introduced a few accessories from our export line to USA. You are welcome to inquire about these starting December 2013. We will try to get some out to our dealers as well.  You can see them in installed on the DSA shooter 7+1 below: \n\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]26122[/ATTACH] \n\nWe will also be celebrating the end of 2012 by launching our Aluminum Frame 9mm pistol in Late December this year.

The sollder steped back, asked them both to unload and but the firearm on the roof of the vehicle and stand aside.

(566567, ' [QUOTE=Abbas;223922]I agree with and appreciate the suggestions both by Mehdi and KamranWali. Excellent points.\r\n\r\nI personally owned a couple of Pakistan made firearms and had a few built on order as well but low quality control is a big issue. You never know if your firearm is going to last 50 years or have it explode in your hand on the first day. \r\n\r\nI completely agree with Skeeter60 assessment that we need a proof house but the problem is that in Pakistan that is just another stamp for cottage gun makers to add to the firearm to make it look genuine. \r\n\r\n@Marker It is one of my dreams to have Pakistani manufacturer developing quality weapons here in Pakistan. Unfortunately the red tape, government interference and corruption is not worth it. Everyone can be making guns left right and center and no one will be asked a question, only the largest and properly setup, tax paying factory will get frequent visits from all kinds of ground level bureaucrats/officials like law enforcement, taxation, health and safety etc etc whose sole concern in life is just to make life miserable for the person doing business in a legal way.\r\n\r\nOn the same topic, I was seriously considering setting up a large, mechanized ammunition factory in Pakistan targeting the domestic market solving our problems of quality decently priced ammunition in all commercial calibers. But as I started to work on my project I found out that I had to go through about 20 + Government bodies and the ''costs'' for making them all work were just not economically viable. It would be cheaper to import ammo from China, Europe or Russia than to setup a unit for domestic production.[/QUOTE]\r\n\r\nDear Mr.  ABBAS and respected memebers of the forum,\r\n\r\nWe would like to invite you to come and visit us at Daudsons in December.

This weekend i had a chance to shoot both Cz999 and Viking. I forgot what a amazing guns they are for the price. I was shooting Viking better than Cz999. But that doesn''t mean that Viking is a better gun than Cz999. It just mean that Viking would be a better choice for me then Cz999. Ed bro you never liked Caracal, but you admitted yourself that its the most accurate gun you''ve shot or you shoot it better than other handguns.

(567051, ' As far as load shedding goes, E and F sectors have the least (up to the end of Margalla Rd that being E-11 and F-11), then G and it degrades further in H and I. Most 12 onwards sectors are like H and I in regards to load shedding with no big roads as up to 11 sectors.\n\nYou can get a 2 bed upper house unfurnished portion (new built) for around 25K per month in E-11 but in-house parking may be an issue. F-11 is more expensive 30-35k unfurnished portion.\n\nAs for the apartments, 2 beds range from 32K unfurnished in ''decent'' to 70-80K per month (3 beds) unfurnished on the high-end side. Margalla Heights (that collapsed during earthquake), the neighbouring Apartment blocks, avoid them ... filthy! Opposite McDonald''s, the apartments (can''t recall the name) are quite lush. In F-11, Dubai towers are awful and smelly, and some apartments are just party places. Whereas management of good ones prefer to keep families only instead of singles so you don''t get much if any ''shore sharaba'' in those. There are new apartments on and around main road on E-11 (above shop floors), 2 bedrooms usually and going rate is around 18K unfurnished for 2 small''ish bedroom (double bed is fine, queen etc are no go in those leaving no space for cupboard space) with small attached baths in each room. Lounge is small though and so is the kitchen, but gas is available in many now.\n\nThere are a lot of house landlords who prefer quiet families living in upper or basement portions so if they like you, you can get below the market rate for such portions in F-11, F-10, and E-11. Good tenants are hard to come by, and bad ones are difficult to get throw out .... just to give you an example, 4th year is starting in the fully furnished place we are living in and rent has remained unchanged (normal increase is 10% per year) as the landlord knows the place is kept cleaner and in better condition than when he was living in it and we even got him to repaint the whole place too without any increase in rent. Next doors the rents are more for unfurnished 3 beds.\n\nParking outside is not that much of an issue in E and F sectors as each road has security guards on a few houses at least, also have car insurance, a decent car alarm system, preferably one with GSM with GPS system to cut off the car from your mobile and spot the location - this may be an over-kill but these are my precautionary preferences (insurance is a must for us irrespective of whichever city) if I have to park outside. Many cars are parked outside in ISB unlike other cities, and with E and F sectors there are not that many exits so very few cars get stolen in E and F sectors. G sectors are pretty decent in regards to car theft wise too. On the other side of Kashmir Highway, H and I sectors are not that safe to park outside - too many exits for getaway.\n\nOther than that, a 2 bedroom apartment with all modcons and fully furnished to a high spec etc in Bharia ranges from 60K plus. There are good shopping complexes there and lots more are coming up. No load shedding, or rare.\n\nPersonally, I like E-11, F-11 and F-10 sectors (Bharia is too far out for us plus it is a PITA every time they close ISB Highway due to some delegation arriving at/leaving from the airport, we like ISB and have a nice view of Margalla Hills from our rooms and balcony). F-9 Park, F-10 Markaz, F-11 Markaz, most good and high-end schools are not far at all and you get pretty much everything in these 2 sectors. Going from F-11/E-11 to G sectors is very easy too, so G-9, G-10, and G-11 Markazs'' are close too along with all the hospitals in G sector alongside Jinnah Avenue. From one end of Margalla Rd (F-11 side) to the other end (111 Brigade in F-5), it is appx 15 kms or so and takes about 20 minutes (due to police check points) so everything is close by. \n\nBani Galla is another very nice place ... but safety is still a concern there if you travel late night as there have been houses and car robberies there. It is developing fast with very nice houses and rent is very reasonable. If you are looking to buy land and build a house, average is 45lacs for a Kanal and price increases if you have a hill top place. Roads are not so good though. Beaconhouse school is there.\n\nProperty wise, in E-11 an 8 marlas land is around 90 lacs to 100 lacs. D-12 is also upcoming and very nice (Margalla Rd will go to D-12 soon), and 8 marlas can be had for around 80 lacs onwards. If buying, be cautious in E-11 and D-12 sectors as there are some spots that have water issues - these spot/roads have absolutely no water table underneath to bore. Construction cost for Ground and 1st floors to a very good spec is appx 60-70 lacs (without basement). On the other scale, E-7 is probably the most expensive area in ISB where a Kanal is a good few carores.\n\nGet someone local to give you a full tour of ISB. Depends what you want really ... and what you are used to. For Desi toilets, you will find them common in G sector onwards to H and I and many G sector apartments don''t have gas supply yet. F and E sectors are primarily seat toilet bathrooms.\n\nHope this was of some help ...', ''),

(567163, ' Here are some details about the shoots and shikars that were auctioned by the Safari and Outdoor Club of Pakistan on 1st Nov 2013.  \n\nDuck Shoot at Moradhani Lake in Mir Pur Sakro, Sindh.  This is a famous lake that years ago hosted many great duck shoots.  With the passage of time, it lost its glory as lack of water did not produce a conducive environment for good duck habitat.  The process of restoration has been initiated for the past several years, and now it hosts a reasonable opportunity to shoot the bigger ducks such as pintails.  In this lake you can get an opportunity to bag approximately 15 birds per blind, provided you are shooting well.  Maximum Number of Guns 8.  \n     \n\nDuck Shoot at one of the famous morning flighting ponds.  Located in Badin District, about 30 minutes drive from Badin City, the morning flighting ponds are managed extremely well and controlled hunting coupled with intensive feeding assures that a lot of duck arrives for feeding.  Last season, scores of over 200 ducks spread over 6 - 8 guns was a routine.  You will have to arrive before sunrise, or better, there are great arrangements to spend the night, in a secluded hunting camp that has tents as well as concrete rooms, amazing food and great bonfires.  Maximum Number of Guns 8.  \n\n\nPartridge Shoot offered near Thatta.  A driven Partridge shoot that will have primarily Grey Partridges.  The hunting area is located near Thatta.  Grey Partridges will be offered in a terrain that will provide extremely challenging shooting opportunities.  It will be a day shoot, with an early morning start, followed by a evening session.  Expected number of birds to be flushed will be around 80-100.  Maximum Number of guns 4.  \n\nPartridge Shoot offered by Indus Delta Safari.  This great shoot is driven partridge in the Katcha Area of the Indus River near Matiari.  It offers some great drives in cotton fields that are adjacent to patches of thick forest.  Mostly Black Partridges with big fat males and the occasional Grey Covey now and then make up the shoot.  Expected number of birds to be flushed will be around 100-150.  Maximum Number of Guns 6.  \n\nHog Deer in the Katch area of the Indus River.  Moro Game Reserve will offer you an opportunity to shoot in one of the most historical and prisitine wildlife Reserves in Sindh bursting with a variety of game such as Hog Deers, Wild Boars, Black Buck, Cheetal and Nil Gai.  The entire area is free range and a teeming population of wildlife coupled with dense thickets of forest provide for exteremly challenging shots.  One Hog Deer with minimum horn length of 15 inches.  included is one wild boar irrespective of size and sex.  \n\nBlack Buck in the Riverine Area.....isn''t that a dream come true and that also FREE RANGE...running wild in the thickets and sandy dunes cresting the river........Moro Game Reserve has brought the Black Buck back and is now taking you back in history hundreds of years.  Included is one wild boar irrespective of size and sex.  \n\nChinkara Hunt in a Fenced Game farm, Kohistan Safaris offers the ideal opportunity for youngster to begin their hunting in an area that is easily accessible, houses some great trophies and provides a opportunity for the young ones to get attuned to the hunting environment without having to worry about injuring an animal and losing it, and they can also use smaller caliber Rifles.\n\nKohistan Safaris also offer One Black Buck Trophy sized male in the same fenced area.', ''),

The trees were filled with the crop but the harvest/ plucking the fruit was on hold because as the cold intensifies , the guava gets tastier . it shall take few days more to get the guava to its real taste as today is merely the third of the cold which is required by the crop to get its bloom. it was a pleasant cold cloudy day with cold wind blowing .  in the garden, I spotted nearly a dozen of Haryals sitting high on wires. Since i alredy knew that that this bird is neither endangered nor protected species thus i could not resist the temptation to using my BRNO model 2 to take one . This bird was taken at nearly 40 yards height and is a fully grown male . the pics of the bird and guava trees[/QUOTE]\n\nNice Shoot Brother', ''),

Infact ED Bro advised that too...

So... in this preview, I am inclined towards NP22 or HP77B...but one thing constantly alarms me and that is famous quote:     Mehnga Roey aik baar & sasta roey bar bar :p\r\n\r\n\r\nP.S. you both suggested NP22, is there any particular reason of omitting HP77B (apart from weight)?', ''),

I think basically for having safety features... and I almost made up my mind... but then from studying posts here at PG I came to know that it has hard safeties and also touch pad like trigger, also ED bro on other threads mentioned that now new models are not coming with glow in dark sights...\n\nSo, if safeties are hard and need break in period, and trigger is like touch pad.. so it mean that if I have to carry it, I will have to carry it safety off... and then come the touch pad trigger.... and then God Forbid,\n\nany thing can happen !!!:noidea:\n\n\nSo that is why, I am now shortlisting among these 3 (EZ9, NP22, or HP77B)...\n\nAlso\nED bro (or someone else) once advised that one should not spend all the budget on gun, one should keep some for ammo and holster, cleaning equipment, hogue grips, mags etc etc...\n\nSo, if I go for EZ9, then I may not get all in one go...
