(464899, ' [QUOTE=Ahnab;302486]\nA couple of weeks ago I was on the receiving end of a very passionate lecture about the horrors and pitfalls of carrying a gun chambered. The "lecturer" was a very senior and experienced firearms enthusiast who even cited a few unfortunate examples of why a chambered gun is a liability with potentially fatal consequences. According to the gentleman, people who carry chambered are [B]"highly irresponsible, pumped up yahoos and wanna-be Rambo''s who have absolutely no regard for the consequences of their actions!"[/B] Strong words indeed! So strong, in fact, that I was completely stunned into silence by the tone and "logic" that was being used to vilify carrying a chambered firearm.[/QUOTE]\n\nI plead [B]guilty[/B] to being the lecture delivering senior member in question ;) and I''m happy my words were that strongly received by you brother to make you think about them and start this thread so we can all have a positive and constructive discussion on the topic.\n\nI would like to start off by saying that [B]PakGuns was made to promote SAFE & EDUCATED[/B] gun use. This is the entire theme of our forum. Firearm collecting, firearms maintenance, firearm discussion, shooting, hunting and even our most prized asset of community is ALL [B]secondary [/B]to the core concept on this forum which is [B]SAFE & EDUCATED[/B] use of firearms. \n\nWhat I was trying to explain to friends at the range the other day was in short the following:\n\n1). [B]No matter how experienced, you are human. Accidents will happen[/B]. You can be the # 1 shooter, firearms expert in the world but the day will come more than once when you are physically tired or unwell or your mind is preoccupied and that is the day the mistake will be made. You just have to ''forget'' [U][I][B]once[/B][/I][/U] and that once might well be the last mistake you make.\n\n2). [B]Owning a firearm does not give you a licence to kill[/B]. A lot of brothers tell me stories that this guy came to snatch my cell or wallet and I reached for my gun. I give them a "are you insane look?". There is NEVER NEVER any reason to EVER kill another human being. [B]Period[/B]. The only reason to threaten someone''s life is when they are putting your and your family''s life in immediate danger and even in that situation the [B]PRIMARY[/B] purpose of your firearm is to get you and your loved ones to safety. \n\n3). [B]The "I''m proficient enough to ''pop a cap in the B.G''s a$$'' mentality". [/B]I have time and again stressed that breaking bricks or target shooting at the range does [B]NOT[/B] make a person a professional self defence expert. The bricks or the targets don''t shoot back nor are they providing you with the emotions required to train yourself for self defence shooting. When fear of death and adrenaline are doing a Ussain Bolt in your veins then all your shooting experiance goes out the window. The same hands that shoot X''s at 25m won''t be able to hit a human sized target at 10m. Point being the odds are higher that you will miss (and unintentionally shoot something else) than hit in a SD setting. Please look stats from any shooting incident or skirmish or even wars and try to compare the number of bullets fired with the number of injuries or fatalities, it will give you your odds of success. \n\n4). [B]A Chambered round is not dangerous and you can become experts by reading. [/B]\n\n;)\n\nI really don''t have much to say about the above, my usage of the words "Arm Chair Experts" does make some brothers wince but rest assured it is not directed at anyone personally. My definition of an ArmChair Expert is someone who instead of going out and getting some real life experience sits on the internet, reads a dozen forums and websites and forms an opinion based on what other people are saying. I once received a lengthy talk on self defence shooting and I was impressed enough to ask the brother how many rounds had he shot perfecting his skill and the reply was zero, he had never shot a gun in his life. This is your stereotypical ArmChair expert, all talk and no experience and no substance. It''s the same as having read a book on driving or playing a flight simulator and thinking they are fit to drive or fly. \n\n5). [B]Racking the Slide takes too long. [/B]If you cannot spare a quarter of a second to rack the slide then you should''t be shooting at something in the first place. Where do you think your bullet is going to land if you plan to dedicate 1/4 of a second to target acquisition ? Please try something practical, draw your gun to shoot from your conceal carry position a couple of times, time yourself when you''re racking the slide to first shot vs putting the safety on fire to first shot. Done right and without bias, it will be the same. \n\n6). [B]I have the Safety on, so it''s safe[/B] Any manufactured item comes with a warranty which after a certain time runs out. The warranty itself means if this product fails to perform in the desired manner within x time frame we will repair/replace it. Everything ''can'' fail, (which is why warranty''s exist) I would just rather not trust my life to a piece of metal. If your firearm malfunctions that means your warranty has run out. ;)\n\nThere are quite a few friends who like to carry ''one in the pipe''. It''s fine by me, my job is to recommend something which minimizes the risk a firearm poses to them, their loved ones & the unfortunate passer-by. [B]Please don''t let Paranoia overshadow responsibility[/B]. \n\nI would like to repeat for the record that the [B]SAFE AND EDUCATED[/B] firearms ownership that [B]PakGuns [/B]promotes [B]DEMANDS [/B]that a weapon must [B]only[/B] be carried chambered when the threat is immediate. To repeat your words brother [COLOR=#333333]"[/COLOR][B]Do it right, or don''t do it at all!"[/B]', ''),

(464936, ' [QUOTE=Mian-50;302149]Bugti brother,\n\n When you say best quality,than you have to be specific about TYPE of Clay Thrower ,There are choices like:\n\n 1.Manual throwers(without stacking columns). Max throwing distance of 50-60 mtrs.(30-60 USDs).Outers,Hoppe''s,Atlas,Lincoln)\n 2.12-V battery operated single column throwers with FOOT RELEASE Switch.(600-1800 USDs).(Laporte,Atlas,Aerial assault)\n 3.Professional Clay Traps,normally used on Clay Ranges.(Between 2000 and 3000 USDs).(Laporte,Mattarelli,Promatics,Spieth\n                                                                                                                                   Nasta).\n\n Buksh Elahi(Lahore) had a battery operated one with single stack column,and he was asking(PKR-80000)E-bay price was(400-USDs)for it.Although the manual one''s are much cheaper in price,but you have to have a  companion  every time to manually charge and release the throwing ARM.Secondly its (BASE) seldom works,because after couple of THROWS,it starts RATTLING and gets loose at base, so altogether it becomes a big HASSLE for the operator, so as how to keep it secured onto the ground during CHARGING AND RELEASING of  the ARM.\n\nRattling of thrower itself breaks the CLAYS at the time of release,so you possibly can experience lots of "NO BIRDS" just because of having an"IMPROPER BASE" unless you find an alternative method of installing/bolting it over a strongly grounded BASE.[/QUOTE]\nthanks for sharing such important information', ''),

I hv a Model 31-1 Smith and Wesson Snubby and its Double action pull is a steady light , I am not sure how many pounds but its lighter than the Double action pull of the CZ 999 by quite a bit, and the hammer isn''t that hard either. Are you sure there is nothing wrong with the springs or something. \nAlso if its that hard, won''t you end up squeezing the trigger pretty hard and putting shots off target ?\n\n[u]Back on topic : [/u]  \nHere is what I still don''t understand (Atleast in my case, can''t say about ED bro''s revolver ) My S&W revolver is more than 40 years old design and does not hv a Hammer block safety i.e it isn''t drop safe, has no manual safety and/or decoker , with a steady pull of the trigger , its ready to go at all times, This is the way historically people hv carried revolvers [b]Far more Often and regularly[/b] than people carry semi auto''s now-a-days and people somehow even now people are of the opinion that a double action pull is Safer than all the mechanical safeties a modern semi auto comes with\n( the Glock has 3 Safeties ) .\nQuestion to ED bro, what if She had dropped it, while touching it ? \nThat to me is a society that is now obsessed with safety( from aggressive pat downs''s at international airports to simple things as excessive administration of antibiotics for all and everything) , it is a good thing, as long as it does not limit effectiveness and efficiency ( and some other stuff which will take this debate in an entirely political- social side )\n[QUOTE=Abbas;303101] \nWhat I was trying to explain to friends at the range the other day was in short the following:\n\n1). [B]No matter how experienced, you are human. Accidents will happen[/B]. You can be the # 1 shooter, firearms expert in the world but the day will come more than once when you are physically tired or unwell or your mind is preoccupied and that is the day the mistake will be made. You just have to ''forget'' [U][I][B]once[/B][/I][/U] and that once might well be the last mistake you make. [/quote]\n\nYes and No, in my opinion, accidents generally are associated with\n1. Lack of discipline( ignoring the 4 laws, because you are too cool to obey laws, keeping your finger on the trigger etc etc ) ,\n2. Lack of consistency (carrying and storing the fire-arm in variable states , and not hving a disciplined approach to unloading and loading a firearm etc etc    \n3.Lack of training.( pretty self explanatory)\n4. Lack of practice after Training. ( Anything that is an Acquired Skill , you will lose proficiency in it with out practice.)\n\nA new (shooter/driver/engineer/doctor/lawyer) is more likely to make mistakes than Older experienced counterpart.(statistically, this does not mean all new people will make mistakes, they Are more likely to make basic mistakes)\n\nFor experienced people : Its when they become Complacent or proud things start to Fall apart.\n \nSimply Jumbling all those into one Statement and rolling it out as  matter of Fact is a little harsh in my opinion.\n\nSince I Fancy car''s here comes another car example, No matter how tiered/ pre-occupied you are, you always end up pulling the keys out of the ignition switch and locking the Doors or your car, this is mostly a subconscious act ( muscle memory if you will )\nIf you Have , trained and practised sufficiently,hv some discipline in your life and you not afflicted by a god complex, you can go through your whole life without any  incident, that is entirely my belief.        \n  \n[Quote]2). [B]Owning a firearm does not give you a licence to kill[/B]. A lot of brothers tell me stories that this guy came to snatch my cell or wallet and I reached for my gun. I give them a "are you insane look?". There is NEVER NEVER any reason to EVER kill another human being. [B]Period[/B]. The only reason to threaten someone''s life is when they are putting your and your family''s life in immediate danger and even in that situation the [B]PRIMARY[/B] purpose of your firearm is to get you and your loved ones to safety. \n\n3). [B]The "I''m proficient enough to ''pop a cap in the B.G''s a$$'' mentality". [/B]I have time and again stressed that breaking bricks or target shooting at the range does [B]NOT[/B] make a person a professional self defence expert. The bricks or the targets don''t shoot back nor are they providing you with the emotions required to train yourself for self defence shooting. When fear of death and adrenaline are doing a Hussain Bolt in your veins then all your shooting experiance goes out the window. The same hands that shoot X''s at 25m won''t be able to hit a human sized target at 10m. Point being the odds are higher that you will miss (and unintentionally shoot something else) than hit in a SD setting. Please look stats from any shooting incident or skirmish or even wars and try to compare the number of bullets fired with the number of injuries or fatalities, it will give you your odds of success. [/quote]\n\nI agree to some extent with that, I can understand people making tall claims about how proficient they are or will be in blah blah situation. Those are simple ego boosters to deflect the anxiety people feel when they think of such situations. I personally doubt any1 is cold blooded.\n[u]However: as Abbas bhai quoted:" even in that situation the [B]PRIMARY[/B] purpose of your firearm is to get you and your loved ones to safety."\nOne of those ways is ''Neutralizing the threat'', only the person wearing those shoes can make that judgement on the best course of action.[/u]\n\n[b]Concluding my thoughts[/b]on Points (of Abbas bro''s post) 1 , 2 and 3 ,they have no bearing on the Chambered round or an empty chambered handgun, they are simply matter''s of training and mindset of the individual. \nPlease get some training, Buy a training video if you can''t afford to take classes outside of Pakistan, and then practice what you hv seen/learnt.', ''),

[B]A Chambered round is not dangerous and you can become experts by reading. [/B]\n\n;)\n\nI really don''t have much to say about the above, my usage of the words "Arm Chair Experts" does make some brothers wince but rest assured it is not directed at anyone personally. My definition of an ArmChair Expert is someone who instead of going out and getting some real life experience sits on the internet, reads a dozen forums and websites and forms an opinion based on what other people are saying. I once received a lengthy talk on self defence shooting and I was impressed enough to ask the brother how many rounds had he shot perfecting his skill and the reply was zero, he had never shot a gun in his life. This is your stereotypical ArmChair expert, all talk and no experience and no substance. It''s the same as having read a book on driving or playing a flight simulator and thinking they are fit to drive or fly.[/quote] \n\nLet me just state something that was written in Oxford handbook of clinical medicine  and I''m paraphrasing : If your nurse , OTA ( operation theatre assistant) has some opinion about something, Always Listen to what they hv to say, Assess the new information, and they  proceed accordingly. \nThe point is simple, New information is knowledge, and it can''t hurt to get it where ever and how ever it comes to you.\nArmchair experts are driven by '' the best information'' gather it from around the interweb, and present it , I can appreciate that, and trolls are just trolls , sometimes the armchair experts can become a little rigid and appear trollish , but that is a separate thing.\n\nHowever the next logical step of this armchair debate vis-a-vis self defence will be (what I encountered with a cousin of mine)[b] who made you the expert , have you ever been in a gun battle?[/b] so this Armchair thing doesn''t stop.\nInformation is pertinent to everything.Defensive firearm training is Different from firing thousands of rounds down range trying to hit bulls eye at 25 meters.You said that yourself. Simply dismissing people because they lack credentials in your opinion is again a bit harsh, you hv a brain , what seems logical to you , use it and apply it in your life, if it works , adopt it, otherwise dump it like a bad habit.\n \nRegarding the chambered Firearm : I have not been in a gun fight, and IA I hope I never will have to , But I was lucky enough to take an introductory Firearm training class in the US. [b] People that Train people in defensive Firearms and have experience, Insist that carrying Chambered is EFFICIENT [/b] [u]A modern Chambered handgun is Functionally Inert. Know the Four rules , practice and follow them religiously, and carry in a  ready state.[/u]\nI know of no Popular or unpopular Commercial firearm instructor that tells students to keep their Carry weapons empty chambered.( these people don''t count as armchair experts)       \n\n[quote]5). [B]Racking the Slide takes too long. [/B]If you cannot spare a quarter of a second to rack the slide then you should''t be shooting at something in the first place. Where do you think your bullet is going to land if you plan to dedicate 1/4 of a second to target acquisition ? Please try something practical, draw your gun to shoot from your conceal carry position a couple of times, time yourself when you''re racking the slide to first shot vs putting the safety on fire to first shot. Done right and without bias, it will be the same. [/quote]\n\n[b]Since you brought up the body alarm reaction in a previous post : the sympathetic system ( Fright, flight , fight system ) That same system also causes sweating, what if your injured ( one handed racking) or bloody with all those variable things that could happen, do you really want to add racking a slide to the equation? With slippery hands( atleast), bloody hands or just one hand in worst case scenario?[/b] \nThe point simply for carrying chambered is to simplify things( while still being effectively as safe as modern un-chambered firearm) for when shit hits the fan. That''s the same reason why I hate leather /nylon holsters with clips/buttons, whole Covers and Valcro for retention. The more complex things get the less likely it gets to repeat them under stress.\nAlso the action of racking probably doesn''t take that much more time ( it takes time, it simple isn''t the same), but add getting to the slide, racking, reacquiring the grip after that excessive movement and punching out to target , that whole process adds up. It takes time. \nIf you hv an apple isomething , get "shot timer" its free, and test yourself , whatever way you practice, get things down to 2 sec''s or less from draw to presentation to Click ( dry fire only at first ) . I''m pretty sure android has one too.  \n\n[quote] 6). [B]I have the Safety on, so it''s safe[/B] Any manufactured item comes with a warranty which after a certain time runs out. The warranty itself means if this product fails to perform in the desired manner within x time frame we will repair/replace it. Everything ''can'' fail, (which is why warranty''s exist) I would just rather not trust my life to a piece of metal. If your firearm malfunctions that means your warranty has run out. ;)\n\nThere are quite a few friends who like to carry ''one in the pipe''. It''s fine by me, my job is to recommend something which minimizes the risk a firearm poses to them, their loved ones & the unfortunate passer-by. [B]Please don''t let Paranoia overshadow responsibility[/B]. \n[/QUOTE]\n\nhere comes another car analogy : On reversible lanes ( traffic goin both ways ) how concerned are people of the incoming vehicle having an incapacitated driver, brakes failing, axle breaking etc etc. Statistically we are all much much much more likely to get into a road accident then ever get shot. So how come Most Pakistanis insist on not wearing seat-belts or helmets ?\nHow come some people that carry guns smoke, You are insanely more likely to die of the cigarette than a bullet, and mind you it wont be quick and easy either. \nMy point is simple : Mechanical failures on Well maintained Modern equipment Are Freak event''s, they simply don''t happen to warrant overly cautious approach.\nIn my Opinion : A Broken Firearm is Dangerous. Period.  it has nothing to do with a Chambered Round , or an un-chambered round \nmost polymer and metal of the Firearm with out live the user twice over.\n\nRegarding the " I hv a safety, its safe " Again Sir thats where the Four laws come in.\n[b] Safe handling, and learning to safely handle a Firearm is not mutually exclusive to ''making'' firearms Safe [/b]\nbad habits are born out of this callous approach of I am carrying un-chambered so , I can fiddle with  the trigger all I want, in fact I can play with it, point it at my friends nut''s, Check the barrel from the muzzle end ( I''ve seem or heard of these things )[/quote]', ''),

Please update us too further. Xplor Unico has some really good improvements technologically like RECOIL SPRING CHANGED POSITION, STEELIUM MATERIAL BARREL, ROTATING LOCKING BOLT, BETTER MAGAZINE CAP, BETTER WEIGHT (1/4 LBS LESS), KickOff3 RECOIL & MECHANICAL STRESS DAMPER.\n\nI especially like the new feature (i.e. relocation of recoil spring) which doesn''t let dirt etc accummulate in the stock-receiver junction like previous models in which you have to take the gun after every 500-1000 rounds or so to gunsmith and get the recoil spring out from stock and get it cleaned to avoid jamming and to maintain a fluid, crisp, low recoil ejection. Secondly the KO3 recoil damper is a v good feature in Xplor. I think there are advantages with this new innovation rather than downside. What do you think?[/QUOTE]\n\nBro whats the Mag Cap of the Xplor, Unico? Yeah i do like the sound of rotating bolt, does it make any difference? I didn''t have any problems with my Urika2.

These differences (even if there are to some extent) don''t matter much in field when firing ... main thing being how immaculately the firearm has been maintained (cleaned and lubricated) as per their respective manuals. Majority of hunters and clay shooters here do not clean the recoil spring timely (after every 500-1000 rounds),  neither do they clean the gas ports (two) alongwith gas assembly attached with the barrel. Thirdly, trigger assembly: this is also ignored by most. Hence the cycling and crispness of action is affected at end...and in the long run, the life of these gr8 hunting semi-autos.[/QUOTE]\n\nBro i don''t have any experience with the Browning Maxus. Just shot few rounds from my friends gun. But believe me i liked it better then my Beretta. Our respected member Engineer sahib has both of these guns.

(465239, ' These guns SX3 and Maxus would cycle 24 grams loads, but they are NOT made for them. Manuals and statistics state that clearly. After repetitive usage with mouse loads (such as 24g), they would malfunction & get damaged. The gun has to be RATED for certain loads you use. Both these have a SELF ADJUSTING gas mechanism though, 1oz loads and up for Maxus, and 1-1/8 oz loads and up for SX3.\r\n\r\nIf you ask me, I would rate A303 as the best Beretta semi auto for hunting, better than any Browning or Benelli or Beretta, even though it does not have a self adjusting mech (it is made for only 1 oz to 1-1/8 oz loads) & neither 3" magnum capability. The Beretta AL390 is the most preferred gas semiauto in Argentina high volume shooting, not even AL391 or Xplor, due to lesser plastics in that model like A303. ''Lesser plastics'' means lesser technopolymers. \r\n\r\nThese are personal choices when it comes down to choosing Maxus or Urika etc etc. But, technologically, Xplor UNICO does have certain technological innovations. Shooting comfort, ease of swing and handling in field ... is another issue ... and a very subjective one.\r\n\r\nXPLOR UNICO TECH ADVANTAGES WHICH CAN''T BE IGNORED:\r\n\r\n- Rotating bolt (locking type) does NOT let gases escape and hence all gas pressure is used inside mechanism to move bolt etc, hence higher bolt speed which is then helpful to drive mouse loads i.e. all load cycling ability. This is also the reason for BLINK system i.e. fastest cycling and bolt speed in any Beretta semiauto.\r\n- The KickOff is a pretty expensive accessory...installing it on any other Beretta would make it infeasible product Vs price pt of view. Besides how will you achieve the ideal 14.25" stock length when installing KO in Urika 2 for example?KO does tame MUZZLE FLIP when firing repeatedly at covies (upland) or flocks (waterfowl)...is helpful when firing 36 grams Shaheen Super or other high velocity loads. Even normal 31 gms loads by Shaheen seem like firing an airgun. KickOff mitigates recoil by 60% as claimed by Beretta and KickOff3 lessens recoil by a further 10%  \r\nbesides absorbing mechanical stress (KO3). That point about KO3 is very important for me .... mitigating and absorbing mech stress on bolt and internal parts as well as receiver .... saves the receiver from peening. Thus LONGTERM LIFE of the firearm is enhanced.\r\n- Lastly and v importantly, the RECOIL SPRING has been relocated which does NOT let dirt etc accumulate in the stock  recoil spring like previous models (AL391,A303,A304 etc) and the gun becomes lesser prone to jamming.\r\n- Another important feature is use of material STEELIUM in barrel. Steelium is also being used now in some army high  firing weapons by experts here in pakistan. Reason: it is a much tougher, much durable and better material for firearm  metallurgy and also expensive.\r\n- Mag cap is jam proof in Xplor whereas I have had my Teknys mag cap jam after hunting few times. You have to oil it  repeatedly to avoid jamming issues.\r\n\r\nDespite all these technical advantages or innovations, still one cannot say that Xplor Unico would be the most preferred hunting firearm by certain individual because as said, hunting firearms are very INDIVIDUAL choices. My top choice is A303, yours Maxus Hunter. But still, tons of Xplor Unicos are rolling successfully in market here in Pakistan with very good field results. A close friend who has been using Teknys Optima for years just bought Xplor Unico with KO and is  \r\nimmensely happy with the results in the few quail openers.\r\n\r\nI dont think Maxus beats Xplor BLINK technology in speed of cycling. I have not had great reviews about Maxus from guys who have used it in field. But as I said, these hunting firearms are individual choices. A Beretta never fails you in  \r\nfield ... & the patterns are just SUPERB ... thats what I have experienced since many years.', ''),

Anyways, nothing to worry about here as skeeter60 sb rightly pointed out that its probably the firing pin that lightly kisses/touches (sounds naughty, lols!) the primer.\r\n\r\ntwo things that must be kept in mind here:\r\n\r\n1. the primer and brass on all POF cartridges are not made of brass actually. its all copper plated steel. any light kiss/touch/drag will easily take the copper plating off and reveal the light/white soft steel underneath which may look like a small dent. quick test: take a fired/spent cartridge and rub it against something. you''ll immediately see what I am talking about.\r\n\r\n2. the firing fin can move forward and touch the primer when you slam the bolt shut on a chambered cartridge. first of all this really isn''t an issue. however if you still insist on resolving this thing then you should take the bolt assembly out, remove the firing pin and: 1. either install a slightly stronger firing pin return spring or 2. simply clean the firing pin hole and slightly stretch the existing firing pin return spring. \r\n\r\nwhat happens when you manually release the bolt extremely slowly and carefully? are you still getting these marks or these marks only occur when you slam the bolt? can you clearly see the bolt face? are you sure there is nothing there (other than firing pin hole) that can make these marks?\r\n\r\nRegards.', ''),

Review this thread thoroughly and you will come up with at least two reputable dealers names who do this for their customers. Costs are also discussed in detail.  please review the thread thoroughly, as it has very vital information regarding the carry law.\n\nAs 144 remains imposed almost throughout the year in Karachi, you never know when you need the carry permit.  This is very much established that if 144 is imposed in an area, you cannot carry a weapon (Concealed or Open) without a carry permit. if there is no 144 imposition, you do not need the carry permit, but a valid license should always be there while you carry the weapon outside. however during 144 imposition, the carry permit only allows you to carry concealed and not open at all.  no Brandishing too.\n\nwithin your immovable property you are allowed to keep the weapon with a valid license and without a carry permit. \n\nIf your license is All Pakistan MOI even then you need the carry permit issued by HD should you need to carry it outside during 144 imposition.[/QUOTE]\n\nDear Huntsman,\n\nthanks alot for the detailed information, it really helped me to understand the right and wrong.\n\nummmm ... i am thinking to get a 144 permit at my own from HD now :-D ???

CF98 has a trigger system that is intended for plain shooting if the need be for defense and NOT for Practical shooting let alone when you are practicing calling shots.

What would you get out of testing such a car?? all the results will only show that it is working perfectly for a normal person.\n\nIPSC is the F1 racing (best car with best driver and tactics) with multiple calibers and highly tuned normal guns available for carry as well; and target shooting Olympics style is like Drag race (dedicated weapons such as Hammerli 208s) where the gun matters a lot and only small calibers are used.\n\nNP22 is a regular military gun design, and we use it to learn high end things; kam kharch bala nashin.. at 1000 rounds the gun has removed all the creep in the trigger and works smoothly, though it needs cleaning at every 300 rounds or so, so that the buildup of carbon doesnt start to create crud and act as emery IF you want your gun to reach 15000 rounds and LOOK as if IN top condition and resale isn''t diminished to such an event that the guns is worthless piece of junk.\n\nIF the factory itself admits that the gun life is 10000 rounds then they are implicitly saying that it is NOT intended for heavy use and is for occassional use.

I  admit it''s easy to get quite passionate when putting forth our  respective views during a heated debate, but as I had mentioned in the  disclaimer of my first post, feel free to express your points of view  but kindly do so in a civil manner. Thanks! :)\n\n@Abbas\nI do agree completely with the [B]intention[/B]  behind all the points you put forward, however I feel as if your  arguments based less on the inherent "flaws" of human beings and more to  do with a general lack of respect for a firearm. Although I completely  agree that an unfortunate majority of gun owners here in Pakistan are  uneducated to the discipline of gun safety, I think it''s in general unfair  to categorize [B]all[/B] gun owners as irresponsible. For example, just because somebody carries a chambered firearm for self-defense does [B]NOT [/B]mean  that he/she is a hothead prone to shooting at a whim, nor does it fill  the the operator''s head with grandiose visions of being the next version  of Chuck Norris! But I guess the one area we will totally (and politely  :p ) disagree on would be whether racking the slide is indeed as fast  as simply pulling the trigger.\n\nStill, to each his own, and so far it''s been quite refreshing to read all the comments & opinions.[/QUOTE]\n\nI could not agree with you more. Gun folks always say "Guns dont kill people, its people who kill people". That sentence could not have been more correct. I would consider myself as people, and human error is 99% of gun related deaths. I would never feel comfortable vouching for another human being''s mental state or the equipment he carries, and not vouching means immediate family members who carry weapons as well. There was another gentleman on this forum who posted his unforeseen firearm discharge within his house. I do not think I would have the courage to face my children as their primary threat even in an accident. What I would do is condition myself to be better in a state on diminished preparedness. Practice makes perfect. \n\nWell I also have to be honest with you, I dont roam around the whole city unnecessarily but I also do not live within my walls either. I do travel to a lot of shady areas like Katti Pahari and Mangho Peer (marble shopping), but I stay within safe limits with my weapon unchambered or chambered according to the threat level I can ascertain. The rest is practically out of my hands, I have drawn successfully before and God willing I will do it again. But on a personal level we need to find out the cause of such paranoia by some members. If you are not in the armed services or at war with someone, then I find this heightened sense of people coming to steal your money is to be more like flies getting a whiff of the honey. If you would rather have an ego problem to roam around in super flashy cars and make a banner out of your iphone, rolex and your armani glasses, no amount of weapons and guards will save you from the inevitable. You shooting down a BG will only make the rest or others prepare better next time. Killing a BG is practically like signing your death warrant in this country. This should be explained to people who live in two sides of the world. All in all, no one can argue that guns are extremely safer than what they used to be and hope one day it can be foolproof and childproof. But as of right now they are not to the extremely high standards of safety that I require.', ''),

I know retaliation from BGs is a real and genuine concern but if I get so paranoid about it then I should not be even carrying an empty gun let alone a chambered one.[/QUOTE]\n\nAn unchambered gun is not empty. Only those who think they cannot react within an appropriate time would consider it a paper weight. First priority is self preservation and when I faced a situation similar to what people think theoretically happens when a BG draws, my first instinct was find cover and then return fire. Every situation is different and in my situation that was the best I could do. With no loss of life and minimum damage to surrounding property. Either way you are correct that why carry if you dont plan to shoot. Shooting to kill and shooting to save yourself are two different things. i will get into it after I send some emails.', ''),

(465547, ' The beauty of healthy debate is that varied views on the subject matter come....which we are seeing here.\r\n\r\nI believe that it is specifically upto the respective gun''s specs (in manuals etc & gun tech depts) which determine mouse loads cycling ability.\r\n\r\nFor example.....\r\n\r\n* Beretta A302, A303, A304 (all 2-3/4" chambered) = Cycle 1 oz to 1-1/8 oz loads (28g-32g)\r\n* Beretta AL390 & A390ST (3" chambered) = Cycles 7/8 oz to 1-1/4 oz (24g-36g) & probably bigger loads (this is the most rugged of the Berettas & most popular in Argentina as well)\r\n* Beretta AL391 (Urika, Urika2, Teknys) (3" chambered) = Cylces 24g-56g loads\r\n* Beretta Xplor Unico (3.5" chambered) = Cycles 24g-64g loads\r\n* Browning Maxus and Winchester = already stated\r\n* Benellis (mostly) (3" and 3.5" chambered) = Cycles 32g and up loads with exactly 70mm (2-3/4") length shells\r\n\r\nThe inertia guns... unless the manuals or their detailed specs by company state so, they won''t cycle all loads. If you see Benelli site, semi autos clearly state 70mm shell and 32grams loads as minimum requirement. 32g up to 56g or super magnum cartrgs like 64g are no problem for most high end semis by Benelli. But on the lower end, there is certainly a cap on which grams cartrg the gun will reliably cycle. The shaheen regular is neither actually 31g as claimed nor exactly 70mm in length (if I am not wrong). At least the earlier loads had that problem. Even last year a friend tested the grams in regular 31g Shaheen #8 and #6 - it was around 28g-29g on scale. Therefore we see problems with regular Shaheen cartrg in almost all Benellis. THIS IS EXACTLY THE BEAUTY OF A BERETTA SEMI AUTO (that I was talking about - never fails in field - whatever the load or cartrg length or grams - grams ALL-LOAD flexibilty with only model 390 and later ones).\r\n\r\nIf on the other hand, certain good inertia guns, like Franchi Raptor, state they can reliably cycle 24g-56g loads, then they will. We just have to confirm from manuals and gun tech dept of that company via phone/email. Franchi Raptor is also made in gas action and is a gr8 semi auto (Franchi Raptor 712 - 12ga model).', ''),

Such permits were banned I guess since last year. \r\n\r\nOther thing is ..the modus operandi of these netters in earlier years even has been: covert coordination with the dept guys without paying the official netting permit fee. So dirty work had been going on from both sides if one looks at it from this pt of view. Neverthless these were fresh new recruits & human lives lost and few other severely injured in the brawl is serious business. Lets see what action higher authorities take now.

Its an Italian made [B]Marocchi First-E "Deluxe" O/U Shotgun[/B]. This particular model in the lesser known Marocchi lineup is built for upland hunting where a each pound of weight saved matters. This shotgun follows a basic format that can be seen in several other makers from the same Italian gunmaking heartland as Marocchi.\r\n\r\n[B]Some specs:[/B]\r\n\r\n1. Barrel Length = 28 inches, chrome lined\r\n2. Weight = 2.8kg or 6.16lbs\r\n3. Interchange Chokes  = 5\r\n5. Trigger = Single selective mechanical trigger\r\n6. Rib = 6mm straight\r\n7. Receiver = 7075/T6 Aluminum\r\n8. Price = around 150K (thats what I have been told)\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i998.photobucket.com/albums/af103/12gauge-pakguns/Marocchi%20First%20E%20Deluxe/Pic02.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\none of the two first things (wait! what am I saying?) that you''ll notice about this particular shotgun is the built quality and super quick responsiveness. the built quality may not be at par with other production shotguns such as Beretta but it comfortably competes with various shotguns from other big names around the world.\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i998.photobucket.com/albums/af103/12gauge-pakguns/Marocchi%20First%20E%20Deluxe/Pic03.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\nas I mentioned earlier that the built quality is superb. what else can you expect from Italian Engineering. The country that makes Ferraris and Ducatis.\r\n\r\nThe wood to metal finish is great. comparable to any quality Italian shotgun. the aluminum receiver is also nicely finished. one is amazed at the quality that this shotgun is offering in its price range.\r\n\r\nas far as engraving is concerned. It represents a minimalist approach with gilded birds.\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i998.photobucket.com/albums/af103/12gauge-pakguns/Marocchi%20First%20E%20Deluxe/Pic04.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\nThats a safety/barrel selector switch. the safety is non automatic. that means breaking the gun open (or closing it) will not engage it and the user would not be bothered by constantly toggling the safety switch after each shot. the safety and control lever work as expected. nice smooth movement. the control lever did felt a little hard to open but closing the gun back up was absolute pleasure.\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i998.photobucket.com/albums/af103/12gauge-pakguns/Marocchi%20First%20E%20Deluxe/Pic05.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\nis this me or everything on this gun just lines up absolutely straight? don''t you love it when that happens?\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i998.photobucket.com/albums/af103/12gauge-pakguns/Marocchi%20First%20E%20Deluxe/Pic06.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\nOur member hunter468 (after going a few rounds) inspecting primer strikes.\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i998.photobucket.com/albums/af103/12gauge-pakguns/Marocchi%20First%20E%20Deluxe/Pic07.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\nbeautiful and clean checkering. looks like laser work. quiet many shotgun manufacturers are resorting to laser checkering these days as it produces clean and high definition checkering while reducing production costs and time. the forend is also shaped pretty nice. offering a firm grip without stretching the hand in an awkward position.\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i998.photobucket.com/albums/af103/12gauge-pakguns/Marocchi%20First%20E%20Deluxe/Pic08.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\njust look at that checkering. :) I was a little skeptical at first about the black trigger guard but it totally goes along with the black accented control levers on this shotgun.\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i998.photobucket.com/albums/af103/12gauge-pakguns/Marocchi%20First%20E%20Deluxe/Pic09.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\nhmm.... somebody is having fun at the trap range. ;)\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i998.photobucket.com/albums/af103/12gauge-pakguns/Marocchi%20First%20E%20Deluxe/Pic10.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\nstrong and authoritative ejection. the hulls are thrown quiet a distance away. the ejectors cannot be turned into manual extractors.\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i998.photobucket.com/albums/af103/12gauge-pakguns/Marocchi%20First%20E%20Deluxe/Pic11.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\nI loved the mechanical trigger on this one as I couldn''t tell any difference in the trigger pull between the first and second barrel.

I again kept quiet out of respect for Skeeter shahib but we seriously need to discourage this kind of behaviour on our forums. This is foolishness !

(466013, ' one in the chamber. Why?\r\n\r\n1. I would rather chamber the round in a controlled environment so that I can double check that the round has chambered properly rather than trust myself and my gun in a shtf moment. What if a malfunction were to happen while you were, under the stress of about to lose your life, trying to get a round chambered within the time frame of a couple of seconds? \r\n2. Most firearm malfunctions occur during the process of cycling of the gun ( from failure to seed to double feeds) adding the manual racking May increase the chances of the gun failing to work when your life depended upon it.\r\n3. What if one of your hands/arms was restrained in some way and you have to draw/rack/fire with one hand? You might be carrying/holding your child, your arm might be injured. Have you trained racking a slide while wearing shalwar Kameez.   Since the premise here in previous posts has been most firearm owners are not proficient enough, racking a slide is un-necessary complexity.   \r\n4. In a modern handgun, keep your dang booger picker out of the trigger guard (and everything else out of the trigger guard) and the gun will not go off ( that is how they are designed), unless it is broke , then you need to get it fixed anyway.\r\n5. You may not have enough time or stealth to be able to rack a semi-auto in the event you need to use it. Adrenaline( in a stressful condition) as pointed out by Abbas bro in a previous post Makes your hands sweaty and slippery, add to that the warm weather in Pakistan in general. \r\nIf a certain method is more likely to cause failure ( both mechanical and human) Under stress and in a wide variety of scenario''s, then there might be need to change it or modify it.\r\nMaybe these points seem like childish rants to some or arguments for the sake of arguments. However Most of these are reasons for carrying chambered as advised by All modern firearm instructors ( you are free to follow or ignore their opinion) , most LEA agencies and Military units including the Israeli''s, and sadly by most bad guys too.\r\nThey Key to everything is Train and Practice, practice, practice ( dry firing does not cost extra ).', ''),

(466102, ' @Salman Salams Brother, first let me say that you took my suggestion in a positive manner and I appreciate that. Welcome back. \n\nI''m going to say a few things beyond Ahnab''s initial carry a round in the chamber debate. I deem all PakGuns members like brothers hence advise them to the best of my ability.\n\nThe point I was simply trying to make is, experience or skill has nothing to do with bad luck. No one can be alert or ''on duty'' 24/7, it can happen to anyone. I am just suggesting to give the bad luck a 5 % chance to happen rather than 100%. I myself carry chambered but only when I think I might require my firearm. \n\nWith due respect to the brothers above, I certainly don''t agree with pulling a firearm out in the middle of a road and pointing it at a kids face for a traffic accident nor trying to out shoot a chambered / pointed gun. In my opinion both brothers were by the Grace of God [B]insanely lucky[/B] (may Allah (swt) always keep them and their families safe). \n\nIn the first case Omkhan almost died, in the second scenario Ahnab might have had to pull the trigger and spend the rest of his life in jail for manslaughter. Point I am making is, there is a time to pull out your firearm, a traffic accident in my humble opinion is not one of them. If Ahnab God forbid had to pull the trigger he would have prayed for the time when he had the opportunity to sell everything he owned to have paid for repairs for the other guy''s car instead even though it was completely the other guys fault. The ensuing problems he and his family would have faced would not have been worth anything he owned. \n\nA firearm enthusiast needs to be a more humble and forgiving human being than his peers. The power to kill should also be accompanied by an increased sense of humanity and ''when'' to act otherwise one is thinking like a criminal.\n\nWe are not from LEA''s, we''re civilians. My approach towards firearms and when to pull out a gun surprises many people as they expect that I should be the flag bearer for machismo which comes with firearms but unfortunately even at my relatively young age I''ve had more experiences and incidents than most people have in a life time. I just prefer not to share them and put it behind me. What I prefer to do however is to recommend to others what I have learnt after going though a couple of scenarios. \n\nSuffice it to say I did not drive a B6 level Mercedes for 12 years of my life without need ;)', ''),

That tent was like AWESOME. It was literally out of this world. It rained all night and we slept without a worry in our lives. lol. In the morning (Sunday Sept 9, 2012) we had to leave for our second session of hunt but to our misfortune, due to the rain the conditions were not feasible for finding batair in that area because as you know that on a rainy day, this bird doesn’t show its face or any other part of its body. lol. The decision was made by all to call it a day and to leave back for DG Khan.\n \nWe all started our journey back in four vehicles. When we reached Khar after crossing Rakni and Fort Monroe at about 12:30 pm, we were told by the locals that due to land slide the whole road at Fort Monroe has been washed away. I was of the opinion that we should proceed to the washed away road and cross it by foot; our vehicles can be left at Khar and we will hire other transportation means on the other side of the land slide. However, the rest of the party decided that we should adopt the road back to Baikar and then onwards to Marri and Rajanpur and then further to DG Khan. Now the challenges at hand were (1) no cell reception, (2) roads may have been washed away (3) threats of attacks by outlaws in that area (4) Not enough food or water. We left Khar at about 1:00 pm and reached Baikar at 6:30pm. It was a perfidious journey and I won’t be able to do justice to its treacherousness by just explaining it in simple words. lol. We got stuck at several places where the muddy road was as narrow as 15 feet wide with sliding rocks on one side and a steep drop of almost 300 feet on the other side. Our vehicles were slipping and skidding all over the place. The Jeep Cherokee was a blessing in disguise as we used it as a Tractor to retrieve the other three stuck vehicles from the mud. (The pictures would give you some idea:))\n [ATTACH=CONFIG]13129[/ATTACH][ATTACH=CONFIG]13130[/ATTACH] \n\nWe spent the Sunday night at Baikar at our Bugti friend’s place and in the meanwhile it kept on raining all this time. In the morning (Monday Sept 10, 2012) the discussion erupted again as to which route to adopt to get out of that area. The option of Marri-Rajanpur-DG Khan was out of the question as the latest intel stated that the flash floods were flowing through a ravine which was very deep and our vehicles could not cross it. Now the other three options were as following:\n1.       Baikar – Rakni – Loralai – Zhob – DI Khan – Kohat- Peshawar/Islamabad\n2.       Baikar – Rakni – Zhob -- Danasar – DI Khan – Kohat- Peshawar/Islamabad\n3.       Baikar – Rakni – Kashmor – DG Khan\nNow the question remained which route to adopt as all three of them were very long and we could not afford to lose any more time and there were possibilities of road blocks and flash flooded ravines on all these routes. We were without cell reception so we left Baikar at 10:30am and in about one hour we reached an elevated spot where Warid-The-Great got us through with our families and other sources who could let us know the status of the vehicular commute on these routes.\n \nFrom our sources (which included my father’s old pals in Zhob & also the PA of IGFC Balochistan) we received very mixed information about these routes as some said that the roads were blocked and others stated that only 4x4 vehicles could pass through and that too very difficultly. Once we reached Khar after crossing Rakni, I again presented my idea of crossing the land slide portion on foot. In a very reluctant manner, my idea was accepted and we proceeded towards the spot where the mountain had collapsed at Fort Monroe road. I have to say that the scene at the land slide was truly horrifying. There was a 500 meters portion of the road which was completely swept down 400 feet from the spot where we were standing. There were 3 fully loaded cargo trucks which had also been swept down to the bottom of the ravine and interestingly they were on their fours J and were completely intact. We were told that the land slide started very slowly, the crew jumped out of the vehicles saving their lives, however, the trucks slid-down with the earth and reached the bottom, intact J. (That would have been something interesting to see).\n \nNow at this stage all of us had our backpacks and other stuff including the shotguns, pistols and the ammunition. J. The fun part was that we were supposed to take along all this stuff; however we left behind the shotgun rounds in the vehicles. The plan was that the vehicles would reach DG Khan if the road is repaired soon (which I doubted because in my opinion the repair would take at least two weeks) and the other option was to adopt any of the above mentioned routes if they are cleared earlier. We started our descent down the ravine with our backpacks and weapons and were able to cross that portion in almost an hour. (If I were able to share the videos, you would have noticed that a man was taking his motorbike down the rocky cliff, which was truly a marvelous feat J.) We walked through the slippery rocks, muddy tracks, thorny bushes, a stream and then in the end, a gradual ascent. Well, it was tough but one heck of fun-time. lol\n \nOn the other end of the land slide, we boarded a van and started off for DG Khan. When we neared DG Khan, we were told that the floods have entered the city and the only way in to the city is through the Airport road- Chotti and onwards to Rajanpur road. So the journey which was supposed to take 15 minutes from that point onwards, took almost 1.5 hours. By the grace of almighty Allah, we reached DG Khan at 11:30pm. In the morning, Tuesday Sept 11, 2012, we saw the flood water in the city area. Interestingly it was only a canal which had over flooded and the water had entered DG Khan city; God forbid if it had been the river, the history would have repeated itself for DG Khan, the way it did in the 19[SUP]th[/SUP]century (For details, Google It :).)\n \nI know the story is long but I felt it worthwhile to narrate it as best as I could.', 'When the Hunter became the Escapee'),

We are civilians, the consequences and thoughts behind our actions are different than his. \n\nIn your situation  the best possible suggestion was 12G''s, agree with the idiot till help comes along (you yourself said 3 wardens came over as soon as he left) or if none was coming than calm the other guy and speed away to the nearest police squad/station. Under no instance should you have pulled out your gun. You yourself said you realized he was walking towards his car with ill intent hence you had the gun pointed at his face before he even picked up his or even inserted a magazine inside. Please tell me if you had that kind of time, could you not have got in your car and sped away instead of risking shooting a testosterone filled teenage idiot ?  Guns are for [U]GETTING AWAY[/U] from trouble not causing more. \n\nI do understand our society and law and order situation is far from perfect but this is not an excuse for us to take the law into our own hands. If everyone started thinking so aggressively would this country be worth living in ? Would we still be called educated ?? People that pull out guns when an ''Accident'' (which means mistake) happens? No, we are not like that. \n\nAnd to answer your question on how I feel if it was a fortunate decision for you to carry a chambered gun ? Let me just ask you brother how many times could you have racked your slide before he was ready to shoot ? ;)', ''),

I guess the manufacturer blindly pursued power in this air rifle instead of accuracy. the rifle is heavy, ill balanced and poorly finished. metal work looked more like Darra made than Turkey made. bluing on the barrel was less than satisfactory as well. The trigger was good for a budget oriented airgun. the first thing that ones notices is the recoil on this thing. it practically jumps all over the place once the trigger is pressed. I would say, I wasn''t a bit impressed by this air gun. what looks like a nicely grained wooden furniture is in fact, plastic.\r\n\r\n[B]Gamo Shadow-1000:[/B] way better finished than its Turkish counterpart. each and every control/action was way more refined (from cocking effort to the trigger and safety). power was adequate and it easily competed with a gun that probably costs twice as much. infact, the airgun was equipped with a cheap Gamo (clone) scope. Raja Sb was of the view that this gun''s performance will significantly improve using a quality scope with much clearer view/reticle. I guess in its price range, there is just no comparison between Gamo and Hatsan. Gamo is a much better airgun any day of the week and twice on Sundays.\r\n\r\n[B]Diana 45:[/B] way better gun. a quick look easily reveals what makes a diana a diana. higher finish, refined controls/actions, sweet trigger.\r\n\r\n[B]Final Thoughts:[/B]\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i998.photobucket.com/albums/af103/12gauge-pakguns/Airguns/30092012884.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\nif you are on a tight budget and want a decent airgun with adequate power and accuracy then go for Gamo Shadow 1000. in its price range, its pretty hard to beat. more power than Diana 45, weighs less and offers comparable accuracy.\r\n\r\nif sheer power is your thing and you are willing to miss even the broad side of a barn for that then by all means get your self a Hatsan. in power department atleast it will not disappoint.\r\n\r\nif you want an airgun that you can probably pass on to your next generation then get a Diana. in simple words, buy a diana and expect nothing but the best.\r\n\r\n[B]Winner: (in terms of Best Bang for Buck)[/B]\r\n\r\nall three of us agreed that Gamo Shadow 1000 represents the best bang for buck in its price range.\r\n\r\nRegards.\r\n\r\np.s. I would now request Raja Yasir sb. and Rockstar bro to kindly share their opinions/views.', ''),

(466162, ' Very well done both of you :) a detailed review of both power and accuracy and some really nice pictures :D\n\nIf I were to choose between these 3 airguns I''d go with the Gamo for its price and relative performance. Diana 45 isn''t available NIB i guess and Diana 31 and 34 are a better bet compared to the 45 in reckon. \n\nI had been dicey about how Hatsan 125 Thumb Hole version would perform as it has similar power plant as the Mod 125 sniper but mostly fails to deliver the same level of performance based on what I''ve read. This review again proves that it is an inferior gun than the Mod 125 sniper. It jumps around, it is hold sensitive and quite possibly pellet picky.', ''),

(466417, ' Thank you Denovo. Makes the argument a little bit easier than usual. People continue to repeat that Guns are safe, while guns being mechanical are teamed with another variable named "Human". This combo is deadly and precautions need to be taken accordingly. I posted another link about how a soldier shot another guy in the face because he had hiccups. A Soldier. Who supposedly lives, eats and breathes the gun rules professionally. Not as a Hobby, but as a Job. His life depends on those rules and he knows it. Even then accidents happen, and that particular accident happened not but a week ago. I wouldn''t even bother goggling what some other incidents might look like especially where children are involved. Its just a request to be prepared in a responsible fashion. I could live with (or not live) being shot by a BG, but I dont think I would ever forgive myself if I ever hurt an individual or a child because I was too proud to admit that I was not human enough to make a mistake or that everyone around me is perfectly mechanical just like my weapon. To end my continueing repeat argument. Guns, even though they are mechanical can malfunction and I completely agree that they are 1000% better than they used to be in safety issues and that keeping a gun chambered dosnt mean it will go off or even if it does the chances of that happening are miniscule.', ''),

(466552, ' @Forcetrip bro!! I am very selective about carrying chambered and do so only when I think it is needed. In principle I agree with what you and Abbas are saying but the stance that you are taking is a bit of a double edged sword;\nIn the case of the private that shot his colleague in the face, the level of stupidity was so high that he would have chambered the round and still shot his friend. He was trying to scare the hiccups away and thought the gun was loaded with blanks. The empty chamber in his skull overrode all known gun rules in existence.\nThe brother of ours whose M57 discharged in his room; now I''m no expert but, IMHO, the TT is the absolutely last gun I would carry chambered. So that, I would say is selecting the wrong tool for job.\n\nAll such incidents are avoidable by using proper judgment and care. The fact that these incidents happened doesn''t mean a chambered weapon is to blame. Given the proper attention (or lack thereof) I''m certain that man would find a way to hurt himself or those around him with a rubberband...actually a classmate of mine scratched his cornea playing with one :). But we can''t go around outlawing rubberbands coz of that.\n\nThe one thing that I learned from Omkhans experience is that BG don''t have scruples in this matter ... I''d rather have one in the pipe when needed if there is [B]even an iota[/B] of threat to my loved ones or me.\n\nAgain, it''s a matter of personal preference and how comfortable one is with the gun. If you choose a gun with a decocker, coupled with a heavy DA, that should suffice to give some comfort if and when you need to carry chambered.', ''),

Also I might add no one here can keep on running SHTF scenario''s in their mind while going around their routine life like you. I also can''t imagine which one of us has such fantastic muscle memory to automaticly remove the strap and put the safety off coming and going.

All I gathered from your report was that your cousin told you he maybe saw some blood on the road some distance from your house ?

Would you have gone on living after receiving a medal from the Citizens Watch Committee and had your picture in the newspaper titled "Local Hero guns down Criminal" ?

I also said very clearly that "if you don''t have the time to rack the slide then that situation is not one where you should be using your gun at". \n\nI''m very thankful to God that you and your family are safe however one cannot sink their head in the sand and say this is where I stand and I don''t care about the later consequences of my actions. Let me run an alternate scenario  what if you had actually shot or killed one of those criminals ? What then ? Would you have gone on living after receiving a medal from the Citizens Watch Committee and had your picture in the newspaper titled "Local Hero guns down Criminal" ? No.. the reality of the situation is that those very bastards would have come to your place next week with automatic weapons and carried out a massacre. You would have probably survived since you would be in central jail sharing a cell for 14 years with the buddies of the guy you shot and killed. \n\nThere is a reason all law enforcement bodies have negotiators. They give in a little when they think the situation is critical or hopeless and try to minimize their losses. They just don''t go "Ooo Criminal ! bang bang bang".. That does not mean they can''t do anything about it, the LEA''s outside have 1000 times the fire power of the criminals inside but they don''t use it for fear of causalities. \n\nWith all the negative turns your incident could have taken I would think if you were not carrying a gun that day that would have been perhaps better for you. I just thank God it all turned out well. \n\nBrother if I have offended you in any way let me apologize in advance but as thousands of people read this forum everyday I can''t in good conscience condone something which I think is a completely unsafe practise for 99 % of the gun owners.\n\nRegards,\n\nP.s I think I''ve said what I''ve wanted to say and more. Usually I keep out of discussions here at PakGuns to let the brothers talk it out but I had to voice my opnion for this one.

(466593, ' [QUOTE=rmishaq;304749]@Forcetrip bro!! I am very selective about carrying chambered and do so only when I think it is needed. In principle I agree with what you and Abbas are saying but the stance that you are taking is a bit of a double edged sword;\nIn the case of the private that shot his colleague in the face, the level of stupidity was so high that he would have chambered the round and still shot his friend. He was trying to scare the hiccups away and thought the gun was loaded with blanks. The empty chamber in his skull overrode all known gun rules in existence.\nThe brother of ours whose M57 discharged in his room; now I''m no expert but, IMHO, the TT is the absolutely last gun I would carry chambered. So that, I would say is selecting the wrong tool for job.\n\nAll such incidents are avoidable by using proper judgment and care. The fact that these incidents happened doesn''t mean a chambered weapon is to blame. Given the proper attention (or lack thereof) I''m certain that man would find a way to hurt himself or those around him with a rubberband...actually a classmate of mine scratched his cornea playing with one :). But we can''t go around outlawing rubberbands coz of that.\n\nThe one thing that I learned from Omkhans experience is that BG don''t have scruples in this matter ... I''d rather have one in the pipe when needed if there is [B]even an iota[/B] of threat to my loved ones or me.\n\nAgain, it''s a matter of personal preference and how comfortable one is with the gun. If you choose a gun with a decocker, coupled with a heavy DA, that should suffice to give some comfort if and when you need to carry chambered.[/QUOTE]\n\nI will give you another personal example of a very close relative of mine who is on medication. I am not sure what they call that illness. You know the one where you start spasming uncontrollably. He is not allowed to drive, but due to some reasons to his personal safety he carries a weapon. The first thing I do when he is supposed to come over is I ask him politely to unchamber his weapon before he comes to dinner or some other function. Did you know how I found out that he has this illness? He actually went into a convulsion in front of me during a meeting and when we were helping him his cz was visible. I have known this man for atleast 25 years of my life in 3 different countries and the first time I knew of this was around 2 years ago. How many of my friends or relatives could have other medications or have some drug or alcohol problem is not in my knowledge. How many of your family or friends carry a supposedly wrong tool for the job when they are around your family. Do you actually check these weapons? I cut those problems by asking people to unchamber before any such occasion. At least there is one measly line of defense. How everyone carries is basically not my problem, nor will I ever tell anyone how to react to their perceived dangers. Around me we follow this simple rule when family is around. It is a different story when they are not. It has nothing to do with the gun or the guns safety. I am extremely comfortable with my sidearm. I personally do not chamber my weapon if or when I do carry. I am thankful for the blessed and safe life I lead and hope everyone one day has the same too.', ''),

(466642, ' [QUOTE=Gilani;132737]Welcome to the world of Angling brother   It''s said, ONCE AN ANGLER, ALWAYS AN ANGLER.  :) \nAngling is one of the most popular hobbies of the world. More so in USA, Europe and SE Asia. I have been to many countries for angling and people are crazy about this hobby for sure. However, like hunting, angling also has its own rules and ethics which are more or less the same. It may not be out of place to mention them here since you are new to this sport. Like:\n\n-  Always differentiate between sport and meat collection. ie, follow the limits. \n\n-  Use such techniques in which fish must have full chance to avoid the bait if she wills so. ie, use of such techniques that make the fish helpless are not allowed. eg, use of nets, explosives, poison or foul hooking (the technique mentioned by Ilyas sahib) are considered beyond the ethics of angling. \n\n-  No fishing during breeding season. \n\n-  If someday one get a bounty catch (lucky enough to catch too many fish) than its not necessary that one would take a truck load home. After one has completed his bag limit, remaining fish should be released. Similarly, undersized fish should also be released. \n\n-  Use of such eatables that make the fish sick should not be done. (this method is very common in Rawalpindi).   \n\n\nBrother, Mahseer is the King of freshwaters. No freshwater fish gives such a ferocious fight as mahseer hence its a prized catch for any angler. The scientific name of the two common types is Tor putitora (golden mahseer) and Tor tor (red fin mahseer). Due to overfishing and illegal fishing, the king of freshwater is getting extinct with every passing day. Sad.........\n\nThe one that you mentioned is Common Carp (Cyprinus carpio carpio) which is one of the most common fish in the world. In urdu, its called Gulfaam. This fish is found everywhere and is considered a pest. Due to this fish, many Pakistani local fish are getting extinct. Somehow, people from Rawalpindi call it a mahseer (China mahseer). IMHO, it''s just like nicknaming a donkey as Lion.   \n\n\n\nThe type of bait depends on the fish that one is targeting. For carps like Rohu, Mohri (Narain), Thela, Gulfaam, Grass Carp, Kalbanse, Torki etc , (which are mostly vegetarian) grain oriented baits and worms work the best. For meat eaters like Sowl (snake head), Singhara, Malhi and Khagga, live baits (small fish, frogs, leeches etc) work the best. Earthworms can also be used. This method is called BAIT FISHING. In bait fishing for carps, ground baiting the area before fishing is important. This is done by throwing some good smell eatables in the areas where one intends fishing, in order to attract the fish in that area. A mixture of rice, pulses and different herbs is made for this purpose and is locally called Charai. Please make sure no harmful ingredients that spoil a fish''s stomach are used.  \n \nMeat eater can also be caught with artificial lures (jiggs, spinners, spoons, plugs, soft plastics etc). This method is called LURE FISHING. \n\nMeat eaters and some vegetarians can also be caught with Fly Fishing technique which is the most difficult of all the techniques and is used by expert anglers only. \n\nBest fishing timings during summers are early morning and evening. For predators (specially mahli), night fishing with live baits is the best. \n\nAll  the best in this wonderful sport.  :)[/QUOTE]\nSir Gillani I am green horn but last sunday i caught narine and raho at tarbella lake haripur with hand reels "lam dor", Sir i want to buy rod and other stuff can you tell me the address of Abdullah shop in rawalpindi', ''),

Pretty expensive.  \n\nGetting one from abroad, out of question for a few reasons!\nMaking one locally on CNC / machine tooling, doable but a hectic job with sacrifice of the original bolt knob.\n\nSo....\n\nAbout three hours of workbench exercise and I got this small piece made that makes shooting a bit easier & a pleasure. \n\nMy objective was as in most of my DIYs:\n* Cost effective\n* Quick\n* Practically Effective\n* 100% reversible (or as much) without damaging original components\n\nP.S.

There are many ways to skin a cat and this how I did it!\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]13191[/ATTACH]\n\nBoth pieces filled & layered with epoxy sandwich the bolt. Pressed just enough to let access epoxy seam out that should be scraped clean while its still softer.  \n[ATTACH=CONFIG]13192[/ATTACH]\n\nThe most time consuming & rewarding part. The quality of shape & finish totally depends on the individual''s skill, time & patience.

(466677, ' Very nice review of the popular & available bunch of rifles. \n\nMy very limited understanding of this affair is that accuracy of a break-barrel airgun [B]specially when mounted with a scope[/B] is usually no where near fixed-barrel due to a simple fact that barrel may not lock back every time at the same position with that micron precision. Thus line of sight i.e. from scope mounted on receiver has slightly different angle than the barrel itself that eventually reflects in inches when shooting beyond 25 yds.\n\nTo cover that imperfection in closing or locking back, there is a flexible seal/ring. And for the same reason, both sites of a break-barrel rifle are on the barrel itself so no matter where its locks back, its line of fire & line of site remain aligned always. \n\nKnowing the shooter being a seasoned gunner, let the variables be constant. What I can make out of this target is that Hatsan is apparently showing the imperfection in barrel locking with reference to scope that shows a vertical stretch that is probably narrower than Diana. Gamo is showing a very inconsistent pattern. Diana shot most consistently obviously for much better designed & manufactured components with precision mechanism.\n \n[ATTACH=CONFIG]13196[/ATTACH]\n\nTo have a full & precise knowledge on the accuracy front, he same Guns may be tested without scopes with their original sites may be on a slightly shorter distance. \n\nHatsan is targeted probably for a domain where small animals (being a bigger target) can be hunted at a slightly longer distance (where scope is needed) as it has the needed punch and compromising accuracy that could land the pellet on the animal in the main meat. And secondly it may require a lot more practice for a new person to get used to & master its vigorous jerks!', ''),

(466685, 'Review of my 24 years old diana mod 36 [FONT=Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif][COLOR=#111111]The Model 36 epitomizes sleek elegance. This powerful breakbarrel airgun can easily break the 1000fps mark in .177 caliber, yet its appearance charms the discriminating airgunner with its fluid, graceful beauty. The select European beech stock is a Monte Carlo design with a cheekpiece, checkering, and rubber buttpad, enhanced with a deep stain and satin finish. Standard features include a scope rail, an automatic safety, an adjustable rear sight, a front sight with interchangeable inserts, a two stage adjustable trigger with custom trigger guard, and a finely rifled barrel. The Model 36 is also available in a carbine version with a 4 inch shorter barrel for the shooter seeking a more compact magnum airgun without sacrificing accuracy. This gun is equipped with a two stage trigger. Weight 8.0 lbs. Length 45.0". Cocking effort 33.0 lbs.This is description of diana mod 36 on parymid air us its velocity in .22 is shown 800 fps and its the only place where a NIB 36 is sold.\n Now about my 36 its been with me since 1988 had a lot of great hunts with it at its time it was the magnum  springer from diana .After years of use it did not require spring or seal change yet.Its doing 640 fps with gamo magnum,660 fps with diana magnum ,690 fps with defient pellets and 720 fps with umarex pellets.these velocities were a bit less before tune.\nThe gun is very accurate even with gamo pellets.\nIN all these years it has only one problem its barrel is a bit bent upwards and have to adjust scope according to it but still its accurate. \nFor this review i Tested the gun at 30 yard with gamo magnum ,diana magnum and premier pellets .After a general zero tested 5 pellets each for grouping and then shot 10 shots with the best pellets from them after proper zeroing that pellet.[/COLOR][/FONT]', ''),

I don''t know of any Pakistani law that could have been used against me in this particular situation. Even if I had killed all 3 of them ([B]in the defense process, NOT in Cold Blood Of-course[/B]), I assure you, not the most corrupt of the police officer could have twisted this case against me. \n\nNow you asked what I achieved. Its true that I got shot, but I do not consider it a failure. Failure for me would be to let them to my family irrespective of getting shot or not. Lets assume that if I did not draw and surrendered to them what would they do? They did not enter in the house to collect my mobile or wallet. Getting into a home is a risky business for BGs but they do it because it yields higher returns.  I can''t imagine them holding my kids at gun point and asking for more and more  valuables. I can''t imagine them assaulting the female members of the family. I could not have faced myself in the mirror if I had let any such thing happened to them let alone living like nothing happened or "mitti pao". \n\nWhy would u think that I carry to kill? My intentions were not to kill them. It was and will always be to stop the threat, to make the threat go away. Now tell me where I failed in it? \n\nNow comes the retaliation part from BG. God knows I was very much scared of the thought that they might come back. I hoped and pray that they did not belong to any political party specially the one "ruling" Karachi.  But can we let some 1 hurt our family on the basis that if we stop them today, they might come for revenge tomorrow? \n\n\nOn a lighter note, I also achieved that now my wify does not raise an eyebrow when I bring in more and more ammo. ;) She does not say a word even when I increased my range going frequency ;)', ''),

(466749, ' Very informative post for the newbies Tareen bro! Elaborates well why break barrels may be more inaccurate compared to fixed barrel springers. \n\nI still believe the mod 125 sniper is a better package overall compared to the TH version and this is also what many other reviews and user opinions suggest worldwide on different forums. \n\nI do like to note one point here, if we are to test true accuracy of a gun then we should first see which pellets it shoot best and then move on to accuracy testing. These magnum springers have a huge tendency to love specific pellets therefore, a particular pellet that shoots well in one gun may not shoot well in another. Often it happens that two guns of [B]similar make and model[/B] behave differently with the same pellet.\n\nThis test in my humble opinion does not speak of the true accuracy of any airgun, rather it suggests how these air guns perform with the most widely available imported pellet in Pakistan i.e. Gamo Promagnum. Irrespective of what air gun us Pakistani people have, we will most likely have this one pellet in our bag any given day due to unavailability of good imported pellets. So not by choice, rather by force we HAVE to buy the pro magnums till one manages to import some pellets or ask some1 to bring better pellets from US UK or whatever.', ''),

However since a lot of new friends read what you and other brothers are posting I believe I have to add my own [B]opinion [/B]of your whole incident. To start with I''m just going to quote one of your posts that you wrote above:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJust from the post above let me differentiate you from the 99% of the other gun owners on this forum and otherwise. None of us carries with such regularity as you do, I mean I can''t picture myself or most of the brothers I know here sitting on my dining table at home or enjoying a nice cup of tea with my family and children with my gun holstered and a round chambered. I could understand the paranoia after you got shot but as you clearly pointed out this was your regular practise even before. Also I might add no one here can keep on running SHTF scenario''s in their mind while going around their routine life like you. I also can''t imagine which one of us has such fantastic muscle memory to automaticly remove the strap and put the safety off coming and going. In short brother you are nothing like the typical gun owner, rather I would think you would be more at home being a Special Forces Commando or at the SSG headquarters. \r\n\r\nNow as for your incident, allow me to be frank (please keep in mind I have the deepest respect for you) I''m just voicing my opinion so that the rest of the brothers who think we live in the Wild Wild West by telling you "Wah Shera WAH" can have an alternate view. \r\n\r\nIf all a trained and mentally alert scenario running experienced gun carry expert like you could do was to get shot what hope do the rest of us have ?? I mean I would think the whole point of carrying your gun chambered was so that you could save time to actually point your gun at the target and in the process hit something ? All I gathered from your report was that your cousin told you he maybe saw some blood on the road some distance from your house ? What did you achieve from having your gun chambered 24/7 for years on end ? Absolutely nothing. Infact you got yourself shot and nearly died had the bullet (God Forbid) hit a few inches to the right or left. \r\n\r\nI find it amusing that friends don''t read my entire posts and instead choose to select one or two lines from them to make a point. If I said racking the slide takes no time and I only carry chambered 5 % when I think I''m in a high risk situation what is there to be confused about ? I also said very clearly that "if you don''t have the time to rack the slide then that situation is not one where you should be using your gun at". \r\n\r\nI''m very thankful to God that you and your family are safe however one cannot sink their head in the sand and say this is where I stand and I don''t care about the later consequences of my actions. Let me run an alternate scenario  what if you had actually shot or killed one of those criminals ? What then ? Would you have gone on living after receiving a medal from the Citizens Watch Committee and had your picture in the newspaper titled "Local Hero guns down Criminal" ? No.. the reality of the situation is that those very bastards would have come to your place next week with automatic weapons and carried out a massacre. You would have probably survived since you would be in central jail sharing a cell for 14 years with the buddies of the guy you shot and killed. \r\n\r\nThere is a reason all law enforcement bodies have negotiators. They give in a little when they think the situation is critical or hopeless and try to minimize their losses. They just don''t go "Ooo Criminal ! bang bang bang".. That does not mean they can''t do anything about it, the LEA''s outside have 1000 times the fire power of the criminals inside but they don''t use it for fear of causalities. \r\n\r\nWith all the negative turns your incident could have taken I would think if you were not carrying a gun that day that would have been perhaps better for you. I just thank God it all turned out well. \r\n\r\nBrother if I have offended you in any way let me apologize in advance but as thousands of people read this forum everyday I can''t in good conscience condone something which I think is a completely unsafe practise for 99 % of the gun owners.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\n\r\nP.s I think I''ve said what I''ve wanted to say and more. Usually I keep out of discussions here at PakGuns to let the brothers talk it out but I had to voice my opnion for this one.  Enjoy ! :)[/QUOTE]\r\n\r\nSalam Abbas,\r\nI had read your entire post several times.I`m afraid i will have to disagree with you.I also carry a chambered weapon in my house. A persons home is a very vunerable spot since no one expects somebody to walk in and rob the place which is quite common in Karachi.\r\nYour making it sound like all home invaders are the cream of the Mafia and are an\r\nunchallanged authority.\r\nWhat if its a bunch of drug addicts trying to get into your home?\r\nWhat if its a gang trying to abduct a woman?\r\nWhat if its your OWN relatives trying to abduct you?\r\nIt takes no courage to follow orders of an officer,but it takes courage to fire your \r\nweapon to protect your own.\r\nIf,Allah forbid,A gang tries to enter my home and one of them is killed\r\nby me in the process and in retaliation his gang wants to visit my home \r\nagain i wouldnt ever hesitate in giving them the same courtesy.\r\nThe crimes commited in my area is usually by local people who also have families.\r\nCriminals are out for a quick buck they arent looking for a prolonged war with common \r\npeople.\r\nI hope no one is offended by my comments.', ''),

I wondered if there were two different movies out there with the same name; the most common review was something like "old racist guy committed suicide" or "movie made no sense."\n\n America is not a monoculture, and virtually all of the popular media are controlled by a single group.  So it''s not unusual to see reviewers and comment threads with considerably different opinions than mine, but the sheer quantity and consistency of their lack of understanding of what they watched was surprising.\n\n There seemed to be two problems.  First, most of the viewers had the impression they were going to see a considerably different movie than what they got.  I don''t know if it was because it was an "Eastwood" movie or they had seen misleading trailers.  I''ve been gypped by misleading trailers too, but it''s like they never even watched the movie; just waited for what they expected and then got mad when they didn''t get it.  Second, particularly among younger Americans, anything with the least implication of racism is a hot button that turns people''s brains off.  Once they latch onto the "R word" there''s no reasoning with them.\n\n Still, it''s one of those movies that I wound up thinking about a lot after we watched it.  That''s a good thing; how many movies have you seen where you still thought about it a week later?  I gradually came to realize something that I had completely missed while watching the movie.  It is an intensely *religious* movie.  It''s not just religious, it''s a *Catholic* movie.  And in modern America, many consider religion to be a dirty word and faith to be something to be ridiculed.\n\n Eastwood''s character was "Walt Kowalski."  We learn from the movie that he was born and raised in Detroit, Michigan.  During the 1930s and 1940s when he was a boy, Detroit was home to many immigrant groups that stayed together and retained their ethnic identity.  In this case, Kowalski''s people were Polish Catholics.  Even today, you can find neighborhoods in Detroit with signs in Polish.  Kowalski served in the Korean War in the 1950s.  We see one of his old uniforms; the patch is for the 10th Cavalry.   10Cav got *slaughtered* at Inchon.  Their replacements got slaughtered.  Many of the ones who made it back lived the rest of their lives in Army hospitals.\n\n Walt Kowalski made it back, but his faith in God and his church did not.  He had already been to Hell.  He talked about climbing over piles of dead bodies.   He dreamed about it every night for the rest of his life.  He married, he had children, he was a productive member of society, but he had left something important behind in Korea.\n\n As the movie begins he has once again rejected God.  This priest, younger than his son, what does he know about life?  About horror?  Walter can confess his sins to him, and the priest can absolve him of the stain on his soul, but he has done it before.  The church can forgive him for what he has done, but Walter finds no forgiveness in himself.\n\n  Walter is an old man now.  His wife is dead.  His children have no time for him.  His friends are dead.  His place; the neighborhood he has lived in all his life, all the people have died or moved away, and it is overrun by gooks, to him identical to the gooks the Army paid him to kill in Korea.  All that horror, all those nights... and what was it for?  \n\n Walter goes to the doctor.  He sits on the porch, coughing, spitting up blood. Sipping whisky.  Waiting to die.\n\n The movie develops.  Walter gets to know his neighbors.  The gooks are Cambodian immigrants, American allies relocated to Detroit after the Vietnam war.  Walter takes an interest in this new community, but gangs are moving in and causing trouble.\n\n Most of the Christian faiths offer forgiveness for sins.  Forgiveness comes from God via the church. The Catholic faith also offers the idea of redemption.  Redemption, as in most Catholic things, is complex, but you can view it as the opportunity to balance a sin by doing a good work.  But unlike forgiveness, redemption is something you have to do for yourself.\n\n The gangs have moved in, but they have managed to keep their level of crime and violence below the level that will make them a target for the police.  Detroit is a bad place nowadays; a gang can get away with a lot before they become a big enough problem for the police to do something about it.\n\n Walter Kowalski is 84 years old and coughing up blood.  He''s not going to go all Clint Eastwood into a nest of gangbangers with machine guns blazing.  So he goads the gangbangers into killing him in public, where their crime can''t be ignored.  And the police finally have to move in and do something about cleaning them out.\n\n The Catholic faith forbids suicide, but it specifically allows trading your life for the lives of others.  Several of their saints got elevated for doing just that.\n\n The movie ends, as it began, in the church.\n\n\n But all a great many people took away from the movie was "racist" and "suicide."\n\n Well, I guess that as with most things, you see what you are looking for.', ''),

Often it happens that two guns of [B]similar make and model[/B] behave differently with the same pellet.[/QUOTE]\r\n\r\n\r\nyou are absolutely correct bro. thats why we shot close to a dozen different pellets from all three guns......... and...................

Irrespective of what air gun us Pakistani people have, we will most likely have this one pellet in our bag any given day due to unavailability of good imported pellets. So not by choice, rather by force we HAVE to buy the pro magnums till one manages to import some pellets or ask some1 to bring better pellets from US UK or whatever.[/QUOTE]\r\n\r\nThat is exactly the reason why I only posted targets shot by Gamo Pro Magnum pellets.

(467004, 'My self-made portable Solar Power System I was planning to work on solar projects since a long time but never got time and will to start. I will be working on them in large scale inshallah after some time. But I decided to make a small and portable one at first to run essential electronic and lightening equipments and gadgets when we are on the move. And especially for hunters when its night out in the camp. \n\n[b][u]Some Technical Jargons:[/b][/u]\n\nApart from circuitry the major parts I have used to make it in my limited budget and keep in the mind the size and weight to be portable. I used \n\n25-watt Solar Panel and 12V-12Ah Sealed Lead Acid battery. \n\nMy charging circuitry is capable to dealing up to 8-9 Amperes of current but our usual applications are far less than this. One possible solution could be that I should run DC-only applications, get myself DC LED lights and DC chargers for all electronic gadgets. That would be more efficient for use but hectic practically. So I decided to make my system capable for both DC and AC applications. \n\n12v x 12Ah = 144 watt-hour\n\nMeans when my battery is fully charged it can give me 144watt for 1 hour power. My applications can be \n\n1 energy saver of 15 watt == 144/15 = 9.6 hours.  I can run 1 AC 15watt energy saver for 9.6 hours\n\n1 LED Light of 5 watt == 144/5 = 28.8 hours. (DC Mode)\n\n1 energy saver of 15 watt + 2 mobile chargers of around 20Watt or less = 144/35 = 4.11 hours\n\nI think it&#8217;s enough for normal on the move applications and a better solution.\n\n[b][u]Result:[/b][/u]\n\nAfter making the electronic circuitry, I was thinking what method should I use for a casing and portable box. At that time with my limited budget I chose normal chip board which will be tough to protect the entire system with also keeping the Solar panel inside it Lock and Load :) And also to carry the weight of battery ( I am sure the battery itself is about 5kg) balance and safe no matter the box become upside down or roll over and over. So simply, this is the output \n\n[IMG]http://i914.photobucket.com/albums/ac350/mig_gunner/IMAG0102_zps3a7b0f15.jpg[/IMG]\n\nThe Solar panel got 4 meter long wires attached so it can be placed anywhere feasible. The entire circuitry and battery is packed under the top layer of switch boards. It can be opened by unscrewing the screws attached easily but it is partially fixed because there is no need to peek the circuitry again and again for no use. The right side of board is for AC appliances with a main switch on top of it. The left side board is for DC appliances again with a main switch on top of it. I recommend switching off both when not in use to save battery charge specially for AC one because switching on the AC supply will turn on the inverter circuitry inside. \n\n[IMG]http://i914.photobucket.com/albums/ac350/mig_gunner/IMAG0106_zps742e57de.jpg[/IMG]\n\nThis is how it looks when the Solar panel is put inside. One piece of wood is designed such that it will lock the panel and won&#8217;t let it move in any case and keep it safe inside.   \n\n[IMG]http://i914.photobucket.com/albums/ac350/mig_gunner/IMAG0110_zps45bbf305.jpg[/IMG]\n\nThis is how it looks packed and ready for camping. \n\n[b][u]End Results:[/u][/b]\n\nThe only thing I do not like in this is its weight. The chip board is quite bulky and on rough I think the entire system is more than 10kg. But it&#8217;s Ok because I do not need to hang it with my neck and move all time but just to keep it where I camp and use it for charging my mobile phones and use it for lightening anywhere where I get sun. I will surely be making some other pieces similar to it as few cousins are insisting to make it for them. So if budget allows, the weight problem is simple to solve by using Plastic or glass fibers (Acrylic Sheet) casing. \n\nAny advice making a better and more comfortable design will be appreciated.', ''),

I don''t know of any Pakistani law that could have been used against me in this particular situation. Even if I had killed all 3 of them ([B]in the defense process, NOT in Cold Blood Of-course[/B]), I assure you, not the most corrupt of the police officer could have twisted this case against me. \n\nNow you asked what I achieved. Its true that I got shot, but I do not consider it a failure. Failure for me would be to let them to my family irrespective of getting shot or not. Lets assume that if I did not draw and surrendered to them what would they do? They did not enter in the house to collect my mobile or wallet. Getting into a home is a risky business for BGs but they do it because it yields higher returns. I can''t imagine them holding my kids at gun point and asking for more and more valuables. I can''t imagine them assaulting the female members of the family. I could not have faced myself in the mirror if I had let any such thing happened to them let alone living like nothing happened or "mitti pao". \n\nWhy would u think that I carry to kill? My intentions were not to kill them. It was and will always be to stop the threat, to make the threat go away. Now tell me where I failed in it? \n\nNow comes the retaliation part from BG. God knows I was very much scared of the thought that they might come back. I hoped and pray that they did not belong to any political party specially the one "ruling" Karachi. But can we let some 1 hurt our family on the basis that if we stop them today, they might come for revenge tomorrow? \n\n\nOn a lighter note, I also achieved that now my wify does not raise an eyebrow when I bring in more and more ammo. ;) She does not say a word even when I increased my range going frequency ;)[/QUOTE]\n\n[COLOR=#222222][FONT=Verdana]Salam Sir Abbas bhai wins a vote from me in saying that a good man can go to jail for supposedly doing the right thing....the first thing you learn about the law is that you should forget the literal translation of the law as it is in the books[even in America take the stand your ground case the Latin gentleman is now on trial or being processed (don&#8217;t now as I haven&#8217;t been following that case) for supposedly shooting that kid for the right thing]....there are many variables which can upset your case or get you off the hook and these prejudiced interpretations [regarding gun owners and shooting to kill and gun ownership in general] are there at times for good reason.....I completely trust brother Ahnab for I know him personally and as far as my humble reading of people goes he is an exceptionally diligent man who can to a great extent be trusted with handling and maintaining a firearm[in any state what so ever] but I probably wouldnt feel very uncomfortable in the company of a very dear and idiotic friend of mine from college who I wouldn&#8217;t trust with a slingshot as he is in the habit of waving his various AK&#8217;s and extensive handgun collection like a deranged ape.....I think that is the basic danger that Abbas bhai wants us to be aware of, not all of us are cut out for this kind of 24/7 duty[ I rarely CC and I admit it is tiring especially when I have to drive in Multan&#8217;s baboon land traffic] and as PG is a forum for discussing and inculcating fool proof safety and gun rules so that we can eventually move on to encourage more lenient and pliant guns laws in this country, thus Abbas bhais Sinicism regarding a hot weapon[ at least that is what I assume maybe I&#8217;m wrong]....The above objectives can only be achieved when we finally prove to the government and the generally love bug of an intelligentsia of this country that &#8220;Yes we are responsible and reasonable human beings, even more responsible and rational then those criticizing us for our leanings and beliefs&#8221;.....[/FONT][/COLOR]\n\n\n[COLOR=#222222][FONT=Verdana]In short equilibrium in ones actions and state of mind is the key to whether one should carry cocked and locked or carries cold turkey....[/FONT][/COLOR]\n[COLOR=#222222][FONT=Verdana]And I mirror Abbas bhai&#8217;s Dua....\nAnd Omkhan sir sadly the decoits who looted my grandfather did return to take revenge....they beat my old grandfather to a pulp for having a webley scott revolver under his pillow and for helping the police to identify the 12 accomplices that took part in the original looting operation...thank god that the police was very cooperative and really saved everyones guts that day.[/FONT][/COLOR]', ''),

(467017, ' @Abbas bhai\nSir after reading all the posts and specifically yours, if I were to solely agree with you that would mean, in essence that One Should Not Carry or even Possess a firearm, since that is the core concept of your statements, if carrying a firearm BUT NEVER taking it out EVEN when your LIFE is in immediate danger?? even in your HOME??; lets face it when you are in a standoff situation looking down a guns barrel you will have to use yours to protect yourself and that can mean possibly shooting a bullet into a BG which can lead to his death. What is the purpose of self defence? you cannot simply defend yourself with a gun sitting in your holster or just run away when the BG can shoot you and if you would never pre-empt a deadly situation or react to it there would be no point of having a gun for ''''Self defence.'''' \n\nI am in no way saying that one should take out their firearm over every petty matter that comes along, but pre empting a deadly situation is everyones right, that is the essence of self defence, IF YOU ARE SLOWER THAN THE BG (unchambered round or not pulling out your weapon on time) you have no chance unless you are wearing kevlar armor, and there are times you cant simply run away, BGs have bikes too they can chase and hunt you down also. Omkhan and Ahnabs situations are just the tip of the ice berg, there are much worse incidents happening in cities. Situations develop fast and in an unpredictable manner, if you have a means of repelling it then its natural for one to try and save his life with it. Nobody can wait for the other person to point a gun threaten to shoot and almost pull the trigger (as this only would imply ''''Immediate threat'''') at them first and then have the reflexes of Jason Bourne to evade, disarm and takedown the BG first in 1/8th of a second. You have to act before the Inevitable arises if you are a normal civilian.\n\nI hope you are not offended by my statements abbas bhai, but your posts (I have read them completely dont worry) reflect that you do not agree with the whole concept of Self Defence shooting. Recreational and sports shooting can be accomplished with BB guns and air guns, no point in buying live ammo (9mm or .45 does it even matter then?) firearms then, why have them at all? leave them to LEAs and Military only, if we are to be worried about post shooting consequences and we dont stand a chance against any criminal, rather not have something controversial shouldn''t we ??\n\nPeople should not be encouraged to buy, keep or carry firearms then if 99% of the gun population are incapable of handling them. Let fate decide what the BGs do to us then, if it cant help protect us or our loved ones.\n\nThen why is it that firearms are available to the public in almost every country? because everyone knows that the LEAs cannot protect and serve everyone 24/7, they know this and they know that guns can be used to shoot a criminal by civilians, otherwise guns would be banned completely. Plus If someone were to end up in jail for shooting a BG trying to kill him why did the law allow him to acquire a lawful weapon for ''''Self Defence'''', let him be at the mercy of criminals which show no mercy anyway.....Since sports shooting can be accomplished with any airgun, the law is actually for self defence.\n\nJust my opinion, I respect everyone elses, I do not claim to be an expert but I had to voice my thoughts on this matter as it is a complex issue.', ''),

(467019, ' [B]@Semperfi[/B] Brother the point of this thread was to encourage discussion for both the negative and positive points of carrying a chambered handgun. My criticism of Ahnab and Omkhan situations was directed at them to highlight the weaknesses in their responses (which I felt no one was telling them) so that God forbid if it happens again to them or any of the brothers at the forum they already have an example in front of them and a well thought out process.\n\nAs far as self defence needs, anyone entering your home premises with aggressive/ill intent or threatening your family [U]needs to be shot[/U]. [B]Period[/B]. (Kill shot is never the intention, a shot which allows you to get away or scare them away is always the aim) The reason I said it would be better if OmKhan was not carrying a gun was because he reacted without concern for his [B]own[/B] safety. In my humble opinion if he had the reaction time he should have found cover first and then started shooting, if he did not have it or could not defend his own life first then his taking out the gun would be useless. They would have walked over his body if kidnapping was the intent or Omkhan would have died for a petty robbery at his place. Even if he scared off the miscreants but died in the process who would look after their safety after (God Forbid) he was not there anymore ??  My point is, [B]think [/B]about the [B]consequences[/B], [B]analyse [/B]your situation : \n\na). If you can get away without pulling out your gun, try your best to do so. (Ahnab''s Situation)\nb). If your can''t get away without pulling out your gun, find cover/vantage point first. (OmKhan''s Situation)\nc). If you have cover and the offenders still persist in wanting to harm you then shoot by all means but try your best to maim or scare away.\n\nThe reason I''m repeating "[B]if you don''t have time to rack your slide then you shouldn''t be shooting in the first place[/B]" is simply because if you have enough reaction time to rack your slide then you would also have found adequate cover and also aimed your gun properly.\n\nRegards,', ''),

It was very reasonably priced at just Rs 40k and I didn''t hesitate in getting this beauty.\n\nThe gun is very balanced, and although it''s weight is 8lbs as compared to the normal rws350 magnum''s weight of 8.20lbs, it feels very much lighter than the latter. The gun is very well balanced and feels like half the weight of the normal 350magnum.M.A I got a good piece and the recoil is almost half than that of the 350 magnum I had and it''s much more accurate due to this fact. Although I have just shot 3 pellets through it, really amused by this slim and fun-to-use airgun. It''s stock does not have a raised cheek-piece and that is what I like the most about it. With the other 350mag, I couldn''t aim properly as the stock would hit my jaws due to raised cheeck-piece and high recoil. It''s very comfortable to use and what I liked the MOST are the well-made fiber optic''s which simply outshine the normal 350 mag''s useless, cheap iron sights, and not to miss the TO-6 trigger.\nAt that shop, they had Gamo Shadow 1000 for Rs 21k, Gamo Whisper for 22.5k, rws 34 classic for 32k, rws 34 premium for 37, rws 34 professional for 35k, got mine the 350 Feuerkraft for 40k and they had the 460 magnum for 45k.....ALL NIB.\nHere are the pics:\n[IMG]http://i1203.photobucket.com/albums/bb399/B77W/rws350classic016.jpg[/IMG]\n[IMG]http://i1203.photobucket.com/albums/bb399/B77W/rws350classic017.jpg[/IMG]\n[IMG]http://i1203.photobucket.com/albums/bb399/B77W/rws350classic019.jpg[/IMG]\n[IMG]http://i1203.photobucket.com/albums/bb399/B77W/rws350classic018.jpg[/IMG]\n[IMG]http://i1203.photobucket.com/albums/bb399/B77W/rws350classic020.jpg[/IMG]\n[IMG]http://i1203.photobucket.com/albums/bb399/B77W/rws350classic021.jpg[/IMG]\n[IMG]http://i1203.photobucket.com/albums/bb399/B77W/rws350classic023.jpg[/IMG]\n[IMG]http://i1203.photobucket.com/albums/bb399/B77W/rws350classic022.jpg[/IMG]\n[IMG]http://i1203.photobucket.com/albums/bb399/B77W/rws350classic025.jpg[/IMG]\nthis pattern is just oiling\n[IMG]http://i1203.photobucket.com/albums/bb399/B77W/rws350classic024.jpg[/IMG][/quote]', ''),

As I approached it flew away trying hard to fly and perched itself some 27-30 yards away, panting hard and shoulders dropped.

(467089, ' [QUOTE=Abbas;305215]\n\n[B]a). If you can get away without pulling out your gun, try your best to do so. (Ahnab''s Situation)\nb). If your can''t get away without pulling out your gun, find cover/vantage point first. (OmKhan''s Situation)\nc). If you have cover and the offenders still persist in wanting to harm you then shoot by all means but try your best to maim or scare away.[/B]\n\nRegards,[/QUOTE]\n\nI am not sure how old everyone is or what their backgrouds are, but these should be the SOP for all gun owners. Racking the slide is not a handicap,it is a blessing. The best course of action is one that comes to you naturally, that is to duck and cover. The situations everyone is describing where you will be shot will happen even if you have a chambered weapon. Its easier for a person to run for his life behind cover (survival instinct) and return fire. Once you open fire the BG''s survival instinct will kick in as well. The playing field should be even for you to develop your next move, which in my case would be to get further protection rather than aim to maim. Unless you are in the middle of the desert and dont think that digging a trench is possible in the miniscule amount of time, then before getting into an open hostile environment chamber your weapon. That is what "according to the situation" means. For women and children racking a slide is harder than turning the safety off or cocking /decocking.. And in the end those are the people I aim to protect. When the probability of someone shooting themselves accidentally is higher than encountering a BG the SOP should be followed. Or so it is in my case. If your case is different that your family is more at threat by BG''s 24/7 than a hot weapon at the dinner table or watching TV then I guess you follow the SOP laid down by you. But the only way our families will ever attend a small social function will be if you have an unchambered weapon.', ''),

So the 9mm ammunation being manufactured there was for mp-5, and although this ammunation is interchangable due to the calibers being exactly the same, this ammunation, manufactured for m p5 and other sub machine guns has more grains in it, which causes more pressure in the barrel while shooting and causes more wear and tear of the gun.

(467325, ' [QUOTE=Abbas;305215][B]@Semperfi[/B] Brother the point of this thread was to encourage discussion for both the negative and positive points of carrying a chambered handgun. My criticism of Ahnab and Omkhan situations was directed at them to highlight the weaknesses in their responses (which I felt no one was telling them) so that God forbid if it happens again to them or any of the brothers at the forum they already have an example in front of them and a well thought out process.\n\nAs far as self defence needs, anyone entering your home premises with aggressive/ill intent or threatening your family [U]needs to be shot[/U]. [B]Period[/B]. (Kill shot is never the intention, a shot which allows you to get away or scare them away is always the aim) The reason I said it would be better if OmKhan was not carrying a gun was because he reacted without concern for his [B]own[/B] safety. In my humble opinion if he had the reaction time he should have found cover first and then started shooting, if he did not have it or could not defend his own life first then his taking out the gun would be useless. They would have walked over his body if kidnapping was the intent or [COLOR="#FF0000"]Omkhan would have died for a petty robbery at his place[/COLOR]. Even if he scared off the miscreants but died in the process who would look after their safety after (God Forbid) he was not there anymore ??  My point is, [B]think [/B]about the [B]consequences[/B], [B]analyse [/B]your situation : \n\na). If you can get away without pulling out your gun, try your best to do so. (Ahnab''s Situation)\nb). If your can''t get away without pulling out your gun, find cover/vantage point first. (OmKhan''s Situation)\nc). If you have cover and the offenders still persist in wanting to harm you then shoot by all means but try your best to maim or scare away.\n\nThe reason I''m repeating "[B]if you don''t have time to rack your slide then you shouldn''t be shooting in the first place[/B]" is simply because if you have enough reaction time to rack your slide then you would also have found adequate cover and also aimed your gun properly.\n\nRegards,[/QUOTE]\n\nbro how would you know that the BGs are at your place just for a petty robbery and nothing else? they dont let you know about their plans before entering your house.', ''),

Well who would not know that its better not to get into a gun fight? You think we don''t know the consequences. I perfectly agree that IF we have a chance we should retreat to safety but in Ahnab''s situation he did best what he could have done at that time. He showed utmost restraint not to shoot. Had he been a hot head he might have unloaded some bullets in him. What if Ahnab''s decided to retreat and Murphy''s law had come into action? What if his car would not start in 1st self? I don''t know about the transmission of his car but if it were a manual what if taking a sudden pick up the car would have halted? [COLOR=#b22222][SIZE=5][B]and most important of all, what if the guy had a loaded, chambered handgun within easy reach? [/B][/SIZE][/COLOR]Given all the circumstances I think he did best to stand his ground and did not turn his back to the threat which would have been a great tactical mistake in its own.\n\nNow for my situation, I agree again that a cover is a must but what if it was not available? Movement was my best friend and I did that but trust me, I was sandwiched between my 2 cars  and the distance is no more than 6 ft in between. And diving to distract 1st and then pulling my firearm? Well I had to be Frank Martin of Transporter to do that and that too on the hard marble floor. Yes I did not consider about my safety because I had a bigger goal to achieve.  I moved to my left while drawing and still got shot. Now this happened because the BG did a good tactical maneuver, instead of just retreating or shooting from where he was standing, he actually closed the already thin distance by leaning in and shot me by fully stretching his arm. \n\nAnd as for dying for a petty robbery, Well I would not bet on any type of home invasion as being a petty robbery. \n\nOn the other note, I don''t know if I mentioned it but a friend of mine who is acquainted  with the sector incharge of a political of my area (who also came to investigate on that night when I was in hospital), told me that he had a discussion with him regarding this incident. The sector incharge told him that he was aware of it and that actually 2 guys were non fatally shot, in arms and hips and that they all 3 were shit scared. They belonged to an ethnic minority here and lived near the infamous "Katti Paharri".

I would prefer to go to Rawalpindi than going to that shop. I have formed this opinion due to the following\n\n1 Rude and unwelcoming behavior of the shopkeepers, when i went there, there were 3 or 4 people sitting there I guess it was the owner and his friends as non of them were buying any guns I wasn''t even offered to sit down, they were very reticent in providing any kind of Information, when I asked them to show me some 9mm guns they said "aap nay kaunsi laini hay? sirf wahi dekhain gay", I told them to show me some variety and they said "nahin aap sirf wahi gun bolain jo aap nay laini hain" what kind of dealer wouldn''t show his customer the product he has. Despite having a valid license this was the treatment he gave me. He failed in the category of customer service the first thing any potential buyer looks for\n\n2. There prices were too unrealistic even though I am not an expert I could tell he was asking for way to much for standard items almost trying to scare me off and discourage me\n\nSo in my Humble opinion all Gun enthusiasts should avoid such dealers who don''t give us the due respect we deserve and give our business to the dealers who are professional courteous and Fair, I assure you there are plenty of them I live in Islamabad But I go all the way to dealers in rawalpindi for arms and ammunition whom I find much better.', ''),

(467415, ' As far as I can tell The two main arguments as far as chambered rounds go seem to be pretty similar.\r\nbrothers Forcetrip and Abbas seem to suggest practising "Situational awareness" nd chambering a round if you are in a bad part of town, or you feel some bad stuff might go down. Other viz keep it un chambered. \r\nThe other opinion is to Carry chambered If your carrying. \r\n12G''s Advice however is pretty valid, Since we don''t hv a baseline for the level of training, type of firearm and mindset of people that buy and own firearms, its generally just good advice to ask people to carry an empty chamber for their own safety and for the good of people around them (especially if they are new ) .\r\n\r\nIn my opinion though as much as I agree with siding on caution I still think the following two things will keep me from carrying a firearm with out a round in the chamber\r\n\r\n1.Most firearm malfunctions occur during the process of cycling of the gun ( from failure to seed to double feeds) adding the manual racking May increase the chances of the gun failing to work when your life depended upon it. Also keep in mind from personal experience I''ve seen people riding home the slide while racking.\r\n \r\n2. What if one of your hands/arms was restrained in some way and you have to draw/rack/fire with one hand? You might be carrying/holding your child, your arm might be injured. Have you trained racking a slide while wearing shalwar Kameez. Since the premise here in previous posts has been most firearm owners are not proficient enough, racking a slide is un-necessary complexity.   \r\n\r\n[quote]a). If you can get away without pulling out your gun, try your best to do so. (Ahnab''s Situation)\r\nb). If your can''t get away without pulling out your gun, find cover/vantage point first. (OmKhan''s Situation)\r\nc). If you have cover and the offenders still persist in wanting to harm you then shoot by all means but try your best to maim or scare away.[/quote]\r\nThere is another problem with that SOP, people react to different situations of Stress Differently, some Freeze completely, other just runs, having a cool head in such a SHTF moment is insanely rare if you haven''t had exposure to it beforehand ( in training, or real life experience).\r\nAlso Wouldn''t it be better to do Points ''b'' and ''c'' simultaneously  move to cover while ''returning fire'' ( will probably make the bad guys look for cover or run away too).\r\nIn all honesty though "Situational Awareness" is easier said than done and its pretty stressful and tiring as well. \r\nBottom line : Getting A SD situation shoved at you, is like a Damned of you do , damned if you don''t type scenario, so I might as well just do .\r\nas pointed out that\r\n[quote]the reality of the situation is that those very bastards would have come to your place next week with automatic weapons and carried out a massacre.[/quote]\r\nSadly there is nothing to Stop them from doing that, but as far as I have been told, BG''s look for people that are vulnerable and exposed, and Strong defence is a good deterrence( legally though, im pretty sure you will be looking at years of litigation). If there are 6 houses in a Street and one has armed guards that house will most likely not get hit.', ''),

(467481, ' @Omkhan\nThank you so much for the kind words & wishes! Greatly appreciate them! :)\n\n@Enigmatic Desires\nI agree, this is hands down [B]THE[/B] most interesting debate yet! And I''m really happy to see so many varied responses and opinions. Please do elaborate on your CC methodology of your revolver (holster, moon clips, extra rounds, etc.)\n\n@Abbas\nReally appreciate you participating in this particular discussion. I admit it''s quite common to see such topics quickly degenerate into shouting matches, but I''m glad to see that the views being expressed here are being done so in a passionate (yet calm) and logical manner. \n\nIn the incident I went through, the distance between the BG & I was not more than 7 feet; he was standing at his next to his car''s open driver door, I was next to my car''s rear right wheel. Now, I''m a fairly [B]BIG [/B]guy and can''t move with the agility of a puma. So trying to stuff myself back into my car, turning the ignition key, and then driving off would have taken me [B]atleast[/B] 7-8 seconds; that''s [B]PLENTY[/B] of time for anyone to load up a gun, rack the slide and take a shot (and with the target, i.e. [B]me[/B], being at no more than 10 feet from him, even a blind man would''ve scored a decent hit). As [B]Salman_Ahmed[/B] said, everybody has a different & unique reaction to a SHTF situation; mine, apparently, was to come to the conclusion that I just did not have the time window to get away. I was in a classical "fight or flight" situation, and since flight just wasn''t an option for me, I decided to stand my ground. Do keep in mind that I drew my gun [B]AFTER[/B] he pulled his gun out of his car.\n\nHowever, judging from your comments on my course of action, you suggest that I should have gotten into my car and driven off as soon as I sensed that something bad was about to go down, and [B]in hindsight I completely concur with your assessment.[/B] This, however, demonstrates relatively poor judgement on my part, and is in [B]no way demonstrative of how a chambered round is dangerous.[/B] Quite the opposite, a chambered round actually helped me salvage a bad situation; if anything else, [B]a chambered round stopped a bad situation from getting worse![/B]\n\nIn [B]Omkhan''s[/B] scenario, first off I think it''s next to impossible for anyone to imagine what must''ve gone through our brother''s mind as soon as he saw the BG drawing his gun. His actions were purely instinctive and reveal (compared to our general standards) quite a high level of SD training. That he drew [B]AND[/B] moved to cover shows that his constant vigilance and SD drills pretty much paid off. Yes, it''s unfortunate that he was shot in the process (although alhumdulillah he''s fine and hearty now). However, if I were in his shoes, I''d feel that''s a small price to pay for the safety of my family; as the man of the house I have only one God-given responsibility, [B]the absolute protection of my family.[/B] I personally feel, given the "move & shoot" course of action under extreme [B]stress & duress[/B] taken by [B]Omkhan[/B], racking the slide in order to chamber a round would have not only delayed his response, but could also possibly have impeded him in his primary course of action! In the situation our brother found himself in, the only route open to him was a swift, effective response and the extra step of racking the slide might have proven detrimental.', ''),

It was late last night and i was tired and my keyboard is sticky...Anyway, my location is shahzad town, Khilji. treble, i have something like 400 pof rounds but i dont want to use them in a pistol. U see, until recently, pof was not manufacturing ammunation for pistols. So the 9mm ammunation being manufactured there was for mp-5, and although this ammunation is interchangable due to the calibers being exactly the same, this ammunation, manufactured for m p5 and other sub machine guns has more grains in it, which causes more pressure in the barrel while shooting and causes more wear and tear of the gun. This decreases the life of the gun. This is what i have gathred through my research,  but i could be wrong. \n\nCan anyone tell me how much a box of Barnaul 9mm ammo costs?[/QUOTE]\n\nbro POF has been manufacturing 9mm pistol rounds for quite some time... n ure right that mp5 rounds are not to be used in pistols.', ''),

There is a reason why it is cheaper even though technically it should be more expensive (all the going back and forth b/w sindh and Baluchistan) \n\nSomebody correct me if I am wrong but a all Pak lic is for Pakistanis only. While the provincial licenses are for also for their respective provinces. If u are a sindh resident or have a sindh domicile then u are eligible for a Sindh lic. But if you don''t have a Baluchistan domicile or residency or even a birth certificate then what legal authority does the DC have in issuing that lic?\n\n After all u are completely outside his jurisdiction. \n\n Ever noticed that Punjab residents are not issued Sind lics or vice versa. \n\nIts only Baluchistan by and large and cheap as well. \n\nWhy?\n\nThis is why the S.O in the HD tries not to issue 144 permits on these lics. And as regards the Rangers.. well I have known them to confiscate weapons on  non-Sindh lics specially if the local PS has not registered them or for that matter if  no 144 permit is there.\n\nincidentally I was offered a baluchistan lic as well. I refused on the grounds that I am not a Baluch resident. \n\nremember even theoretically, before a license is issued there has to be verification of antecedents of the prospective licensee. Police verification and all that from the DIG level all the way to the ASI of the local Thana. \n\nfor my Sindh  H. D lics i was asked to furnish proof of my residence in Sindh province i.e my home utilities bills\n\n\nHow can this process be followed if the person has not even been to Baluchistan :O\n\n\nThe correct term for such lics is ''joogaar" and dealers do this cause they want to make a quick buck. short circuit the verification process from  a place that has loose controls and sell guns and make money.  \n\nIt would make sense (sort of) if sindh lics were closed.

(467675, ' Well, I thought I have had used enough arguments here but thanks to the opponent party, it gave me little bit more fuel to add here ;)\n\nIn Ahnab''s situation, although he has already mentioned the details and his reasons, let me give my POV anyway. Well who would not know that its better not to get into a gun fight? You think we don''t know the consequences. I perfectly agree that IF we have a chance we should retreat to safety but in Ahnab''s situation he did best what he could have done at that time. He showed utmost restraint not to shoot. Had he been a hot head he might have unloaded some bullets in him. What if Ahnab''s decided to retreat and Murphy''s law had come into action? What if his car would not start in 1st self? I don''t know about the transmission of his car but if it were a manual what if taking a sudden pick up the car would have halted? and most important of all, what if the guy had a loaded, chambered handgun within easy reach? Given all the circumstances I think he did best to stand his ground and did not turn his back to the threat which would have been a great tactical mistake in its own.\n\nNow for my situation, I agree again that a cover is a must but what if it was not available? Movement was my best friend and I did that but trust me, I was sandwiched between my 2 cars  and the distance is no more than 6 ft in between. And diving to distract 1st and then pulling my firearm? Well I had to be Frank Martin of Transporter to do that and that too on the hard marble floor. Yes I did not consider about my safety because I had a bigger goal to achieve.  I moved to my left while drawing and still got shot. Now this happened because the BG did a good tactical maneuver, instead of just retreating or shooting from where he was standing, he actually closed the already thin distance by leaning in and shot me by fully stretching his arm. \n\nAnd as for dying for a petty robbery, Well I would not bet on any type of home invasion as being a petty robbery. \n\nOn the other note, I don''t know if I mentioned it but a friend of mine who is acquainted  with the sector incharge of a political of my area (who also came to investigate on that night when I was in hospital), told me that he had a discussion with him regarding this incident. The sector incharge told him that he was aware of it and that actually 2 guys were non fatally shot, in arms and hips and that they all 3 were shit scared.

I have heard (aso read here some reviews) that Leapers, Centerpoint, Diana, Hawke, BSA to be the best for springers. I particularly liked one LEapers model 12x AO illum reticle. Will it do fine .. .and with which mounts? Have heard and read Weavers or Diana one piece lock down mounts are best. We just removed a Chinese scope and mounts which were giving zeroing problems and have shifted the gun back to original sights.\n\n2) What maximum range in yards is Diana model 35 capable of for hunting generally?\n\n3) Zeroing range - what range shd the scope or the sight be zeroed at, for shooting (hunting) within 40-50 yards distance?\n\n4) Lastly, is there any website to list Ballistic Coeff of pellets with Muzzle Velocity. We are using Gamo Magnum at moment dome type 15.43 gr pellets 0.22". I have entered 0.012 BC and MV 640 fps in Chairgun s/w to print ballistic chart. Are these entries OK for these pellets.[/QUOTE]\n\nThank you Francolino bro.\n\n1.Any of the these mentioned scopes will work fine if they are not copies.If you get a one piece lock down mount thats good but it can also work well with good quality 2 piece lockdown mounts.\n\n2.The general max range for hunting for this gun is 55 yard but with head shot it can take down doves till 90 yard but thats very difficult for this gun.\n\n3.This gun should be Zeroed at 30 to 33 yards.\n\n4. yes there is a website with bc of different pellets bc of gamo pro magnum in .22 should be around 0.021.', ''),

If you standing/waiting in a public place, stand as far away from the road as possible, its simply harder for a mugger to reach you , and then get away. If you are standing close to the road, a bike can easily stop next to you, ask you for a donation,and then move on before people around you even realize what happened. \r\n\r\n2.Mobilize your community, if you cannot indiviually hire security, get your whole street/neighbours to Chip in and hire decent security.\r\nMake sure the guards are active in engaging unfamiliar faces and vehicles.\r\n3.Know your neighbours, get to know people living on your street. That way you will recognize unfamiliar faces strolling in your street easier.\r\n4.Camera''s are a good investment.\r\n5.Before you leave home, take a stroll on the terrace and check your surroundings for suspicious individuals/vehicles. \r\n6. When you return , keep an eye on your surroundings as well. ( the driver of a car while returning home notices some new faces standing on an plot of land close to his house. The driver parks his car in front of his house and honks the horn. The gatekeeper opens the door,and the driver proceeds to pull into the porch.

Here you will meet the dig faceto face before he grants you a certificate.\n\nAfter getting my character verified I proceeded back to the dig office at artillery maidan i got got another letter addressed to the ssp special branch.\n\nMr rizwan there got a lill cheeky n suggested that we give him some money before we pickup out signed documents but i went to the office armed with a letter on my company''s letterhead demanding to know the reason for delay so that puthim right n he proceeded to give me my verification letter.\n\nNext step the home dept. went there and submitted the letter to the mr mehtab dogar the person sitting in the room where our picture was originally taken. He scans my documents and proceeds to give me a token to come after a day to collect my book. Would have gotten it done the same day but the acs was missing and hence no one to sign it.\n\nfinally returned today to find that everything was approved but the book was not printed. Went sat on the persons head and got it printed in half an hour.\n\nMission accomplished \n\nSome notes before u undertake this \n1 always take ur original n valid nic or no entry to the home dept\n2 try not to go on a friday as visitor are not allowed. \n3 if having a problem the head of security at the gate is Mr Bhutto talk to him.\n4 the dig cia WILL NOT SIGN your verification letter unless lied to that you are applying for a visa and need your verfication for that. Some misunderstanding between the home dept and cia hence the need to lie. I told the truth to be honest n nearly got kicked out.\n5 DONOT OFFER any money and be confident when you deal wih the police.\n6 having a ntn and INCOME TAX certificte helps.', ''),

(468138, ' [QUOTE=1mran;289266]the process is simple but requires a bit of patience.\ni downloaded the arms licence form from the Sind home department website, filled it up and attached my pictures and the relevant documents ( copies of my nic, income tax certificate, ntn certificate, utility bill)\ni went to the home department armed with a business card, a request for the grant of a arms license on a letter head. I presented my card to the P.A of the additional chief secretary (ACS) Mr sohail shah. Was granted audience almost immediately and he asked me why I needed it and I told him sd was e reason.he authorised it. \nI was then guided to another office where I was got the tokens and was lead to the room where my personal info and picture was taken ( this is where your ammo limit is set so if u request the limit is set to ur preference, I requested a 1000 and got it without paying a penny) all the info is printed on a paper along with your pictures n documents goes to the admin head of the home department who will sign it without even meeting you.\nafter this you will b asked to pay the fee at national bank situated opposite the home department building. After paying the challan you will b asked to go back to the same room where your picture was taken and he will compose a letter for the character verification certificate addressed to the ssp special branch situated behind Aram Bagh. This letter will again b signed by the head of admin n your work at the home department is over. It took me a little over 2 hours to accomplish the above.\nThe letter was then taken by me to the pa to ssp ejaz special branch who inturn devised another letter to dig office situated near artillery maidan. \n\nThis letter along with the docs went to signed at the digs office.\n\nnext step was to take the letter to my local police station where they signed it confirming my character. Here I was asked to get two cnic copies of people I know situated in the vicinity of my police station and a couple of pics. \n\nAfter this I took it to b signed by the local ssp mine being south( office is adjacent to gizri ps)\n\nI took the letter back to the dig offices where I was asked to go to dig CIA office located near tower (on the same road as the ismaili Jamat khana) here I was advised to lie as there is some tiff between the sind high court n the ig office. I was asked to tell the dig that I need my character verification certificate because I am going to china. Here you will meet the dig faceto face before he grants you a certificate.\n\nAfter getting my character verified I proceeded back to the dig office at artillery maidan i got got another letter addressed to the ssp special branch.it rests there as I write. The next step going back to the home department to get the book printed.\n\nThe verification process took me two weeks and each verification step took approx a day I.e u submit the letter n collect it the coming day.\n\nThe rest of the ordeal will b written as soon as I face it.\n\nI hope this will b helpful to the people who read it.\n\nLastly I need to add that I was plesently surprised by the was I was treated by the ACS. He is the serving home secretary & minister. He met me every time I had a problem. Greeted me with open arms and even helped me fill my form. He also granted my 144 permission and asked me to come back after I had my llicense and weapon so he could fill the details n give me the letter.

ZARS was designed to be a dedicated Zombie Survival Shotgun and not a hunting shotgun. :)\n\nand as for the possibility of getting it is concerned, kindly allow me to explain (AGAIN) that this shotgun is not a commercial venture. it was basically a prototype aimed at answering many questions for the manufacturer (DSA) and the designer (me).\n\nsecond point: why would you want a Zombie Survival Shotgun with wooden furniture? next thing you would probably require is a velvet covered storage case and some silicon treated cloth to protect it against the elements. am I correct? ;)\n\nBro, ZARS is not designed to be protected against the elements. it is designed to face them head on and to function come what may. thats why you see powder coated treatment and polymer furniture. its not made for the comfort and looks that you looking for in a shotgun, its made for the extreme environment posed by a zombie attack.\n\nlastly: bro, why would you want a 28inch barrel too? I can understand that in a zombie attack scenario, one might need to hunt for birds but then again, are you assuming that one cannot hunt for birds with an 18inch barrel?\n\n[/QUOTE]\n\nure rite about the velvet and silicon thing bro :D .... already have a single barrel winchester (inherited) just wanted to get the max from 1 gun :)', ''),

(468210, 'Different types of licenses available in Karachi A lot of people have been having problems regarding licensing issues. It seems to be a bit of a maze and the unwary can get trapped easily. I have attempted to clarify the legality of different licenses as well as the means of procuring the same so as to ensure that people new to the world of licensed firearms are not trapped by greedy and unprincipled dealers. \n\nIn Karachi there are 5 types (That I have personally seen).\n\n1). MOI all Pak. ones (Book/card)\n\n2). Home department computerised ones\n\n3). Home department back dated manual ones\n\n4). DC ones\n\n5). Baluchistan/KPK \n\nThe all [b]Pak MOI[/b] books used to be the best bet all around. I myself had one. but unfortunately after the whole book to card fiasco ended up cancelling mine. (I have subsequently reacquired it) The current card MOIs are totally unrecommended IMHO. One cannot change the weapon on them and the sindh high court has issued a judgement against them. More ever there is no set procedure for renewing them.\n\nThey might be re-converted to the books from which they were forcibly converted to cards. However if that''s what you want then the current rate is 27k and a wait of  4-6 weeks for the demand note. Once you get the demand note u purchase the weapon and get it entered at the DC office. After which it will be taken to NADRA where they will verify it and issue u a card within 30-90 days. \n\n Status: Open\n\nDealers making em: Saddar Armoury (Lucky Star)  and Guns and Ammo (Zamzama)\n\n[b]HD computerised ones:[/b]\n\nThey are issued by the Home department and the applicant has to personally visit the department where they take pictures and thumb scans and make a license exactly like the passport. (in fact a fellow member has passed off his passport as a license to the cops)\n\nThe documentary requirements include NTN number, house utility bills if house is owned by the applicant (or the CNIC of the person whose house u are living in as well as the utility bills Specifically gas and electricity)\n\nNo chance of any illegality or hanky panky whatsoever since all the data is actually submitted by the applicant himself just like NADRA CNIC.\n\nMinimum age requirements: 25 years\n\nRate 18k or so.\n\nStatus: Virtualy closed. These licenses require the signature of the Home minister and Home sec. \n\nSource: The incharge of the computerised arms license department at the Home dep.\n\n\nHowever as of now Mr. 1mran here has just informed the forum that he has made one recently. I will try and arrange another meeting with the in charge of the Computerized arms license cell to get a clear picture and inform accordingly. \n\n[b]Home department Back dated manual licenses:[/b]\n\nAround 20k or so and a highly illigal under-the-table-practice that can get the prospective licensee in trouble \n\n[b]Deputy Commisioner''s License[/b]\n\nThese are being issued by the deputy commissioners of the province. All weapons purchased on them are endorsed at the DC office.\n\nThe minimum age requirements are 18 years. However they prefer to issue em to people at least 21 years old. These do not require the person to go anywhere or submit anything beyond his CNIC copy and a couple of passport sized pics.  The dealers do the rest.\n\nCurrent rate is 14-18k depending on dealer to dealer.\n\nturn around time is around 4 to 8 weeks (Approx.)\n\nThe dealers i would work with are Ali Muhammad and sons 15-16k  Adnan)  (Used to be 15k till last week)&  Hm Traders (Abbas 14k). \n\n Guns and Ammo 18k Daad 18k, Mega armoury 17k,(Danish. I have made a couple of HD computerised ones through him)  Huffaz Corp.18k However I have not worked with any of them other then mega so cant say anything about their performance.\n\nIn this case  u just hand over your CNIC copy as well as pass port sized pics. A few thousand bucks as advance and wait for em to call. They usually promise 3 to 4 weeks and the average time is 6 weeks or so. \n\n[b]Balauchistan KPK licenses[/b]\n\n(Somebody correct me if I am wrong but a all Pak lic is for Pakistanis only. While the provincial licenses are for also for their respective provinces. If u are a sindh resident or have a sindh domicile then u are eligible for a Sindh lic. But if you don''t have a Baluchistan domicile or residency or even a birth certificate then what legal authority does the DC have in issuing that lic?\n\nAfter all u are completely outside his jurisdiction)\n\nFor provincial license there must be some kind of  relation to the district from which the lic is issued to qualify to get an arms licence from that province\n\nPermanent or Temperory address on the CNIC\nBirth certificate from concern province\nProperty ownership (In that province)\nName in voter list\n\n\nIf none of them are there. Then I see NO reason what soever that the DC will issue  such a lic. More ever 144 carry permits are not issued to such licenses (usually) since their antecedents are dubious at best.\n\nUnscrupulous dealers do make such lics though. Turn around time. A fortnight or so.\n\n[b]ALL lics (barring the MOI cards) need to be registered at the local P.S and stamped by the Muharrir[/b]', ''),

(468451, ' [QUOTE=Muhammad m;295501]i think you should go ahead and get a clone.\nbut only after proper reaserch, which i think you have done enough.\neven better if you can go to peshawar. I might be going there in dec[/QUOTE]\n\nUnfortunately Even going to Peshawar doesnt guarentee a problem free product no more bro. I am from KPK and last time I was in Pak a couple of years ago I did purchase afew local made weapons.\n 1) A .30 MP5 Clone from a local dealer in Peshawar.\n 2) A CF98 Clone from Asia Arms. \n3) 1 local made TT from Mardan (Not far from Peshawar). The MP  \n\nThe .30 MP5 in M4 design is so far so good but is very rarely used, hence that could be the reason its still ok, lol.\nThe TT, I only purchased that when I the shop keeper claimed it was a very reliable and solid item because they used very tough materials to make them. I had no intention of buying it and had only gone with afew friends who were interested in buying the Serbian M57 and 1 of the friends took to us to that shop saying he is friends with him and the shop keeper will look after us. But while showing them different guns he praised that TT so much that I ended up buying one for Rs 6,500 (asking price Rs. 8,000). It looked exactly like an original Norinco chinese .30 with the same writing etc. He even said that some people buy that from him, put english numbers on them and then sell them around as original Norinco at Original Norinco Prices. I laughed it off but Deep inside I was like thanks for mentioning that because I will make sure I never come and buy an original/ foreign handgun from you mate. Lol. Any how brought the local TT home, fired afew rounds and on 3rd round I kept pressing the trigger but the trigger would not move at all, despite the full force. It happened almost on every 2nd round after that, so it was a confirmed faulty trigger and not my imagination or anything. The next day had to take it all the way back to Mardan from where I live, took almost an hour by car, argued with the guy, because he was still trying to justify his reasons and was trying to make it look asif the gun is okay, but at teh end he gave me a replacemement, a black barrel TT with no writing on it, lol. Test Fired 3 rounds there and then, seemed fine, so took it home, and 2days later I came back to the UK. Afew months later my cousin told me over the phone that the replacemement TT he gave us has a problem with it''s trigger, and when he fully described the fault, it turned out to be the exact same problem as it was with the first one, and I said to him leave it, forget about it, we simply dont have the time and the energy anymore.\n\n Due to the busy and hectic schedule I did not even get a chance to test the CF98 Clone bought from Asia Arms. Almost a being NIB for a year I told my cousin over the phone to take it out and test it. Later on when I rang him he said it was a complete disappointment and let down. The result was continous FTF. The firing Pin seemed to be shorter than normal. The primer had a minor mark as if it had been hit a little but not enough to fire. Then the poor lad had to take it back to Peshawar on Public Transport to their factory, but luckily they looked after him. They said since it has been almost a year so we cant replace it but took it to their factory where their CF plant is, opened it, replaced afew parts inside then told him to retry the same ammo that it had FTF''d before, he tried the exact same rounds again, because he had taken them with him to show them as an evidence. But this time all went through fine, hence problem fixed. also they served him drinks, put the license number on the gun with a computerised laser and re-sprayed the gun for him while he waited all this free of charge which I think was very nice of them.\n\nLong story short when it comes to buying local clones, no matter where you go in the country, wether its Peshawar or where ever, Its always a GAMBLE. You have to be very very clicked on.   \n\nAfter all those above experiences alhumdulillah I''ve now stopped buying clones. And during the last couple of yrs have bought afew reliable pieces with the help of PGs. But I still think the solution should''nt always has to be going for a foreign made gun at a much higher cost. Having such a widely expanded local gun market and gun factories in Pakistan we should be able to get value in return for our money because fair enough we may pay a less price for local clones but that doesn''t mean we should pay 18K simply for scrap metal moulded into the shape of a gun. Their should be a Watch Dog Dept monitoring all the Trading Standards Including the Legal Gun Market and Factories......... and it''s quality and safety standards.', ''),

Factors considered for this decision are as follows (although most of them actually boil down to personal likes / dislikes):-\n-  I was somewhat put off by relitive inaccuracy of Stoeger Couger at range. It may be attributed to shorter barrel and incompatibility with my hands.\n-  Modern (may I say space age) looks and better finish of Caracal F.\n-  Simpler mechanism and fewer parts of Caracal F should make it more reliable at least in theory.\n-  Polymer frame should be more resistant to rust; hence easy to maintain.\n-  Magzine capacity.\n-  Rails included (without premium).\nAnyways, most of these factors are purely subjective and based on my personal preferences. Stoeger Couger is also a very well reputed gun and has a number of pluses which may be appriciated by more trditional school.\nI again express my gratitude to all memmber for helping me decide.\nWill post pictures soon.[/QUOTE]\nBrother ur decision is 100 % correct,nowadays  mostly cases r decreed in favour of Caracal aginst stooger cougar and duty as well,thats y their prices r gradually coming down,Nowadays Caracal price Tag is 65k and hope Caracal cmpany may relax Pakis more in few days as by the reason of its price and quality this gun is becoming the only choice for Pakistani gun lovers,if its price touches 60k,this will clean sweep its all competitors.', ''),

(468623, ' Answer to question 1\nA mil dot reticle does not refer to the military. The MIL in mil dot is a  shortening of the term "Milli-radian".If you are familiar with degrees as  measurements of angle. You also know from school geometry that  there are 360 degrees in a circle. As the circle grows larger in  circumference, the number of degrees does not change, but the distance  between each degree along the circle does increase. You may also know  that degrees are divided into smaller units called minutes. There are  seconds, too, but they are too small for this discussion. \n\nA degree is  divided into 60 minutes. At 100 yards distance, the angle of one minute  is approximately one inch. So if the centers of the two bullets farthest  apart in a 100-yard group are about one inch apart, we call that a  minute-of-angle group.\n\nAt 200 yards, a group measuring two  inches center- to-center equals a one minute-of-angle group. \n\nAt 400  yards, it''s a four-inch group. \n\n\nSo in reticle the lines are engrained so as allow you to work "holdover" without actually having to re-zero the scope for different distances.As a result less work when working different at different ranges in shoot.\n\nQuestion 2\n1/8 MOA will be I/8th of inch ar 100 meters\n1/4 MOA will be 1/4th of inch and so on\n\n\nQuestion 3\n[url]http://www.millettsights.com/resources/shooting-tips/calculating-mil-dot-reticle-holdovers/[/url]\n[url]http://cheaperthandirt.com/blog/?p=1994[/url]\n\nQuestion 4\nIt means that the cross hairs in a scope represent 30 inches at 100 meters at "x" magnification\n\nQuestion 5\nAs the adage goes it''s not the gun but the man behind the gun.MIL Dot helps but ultimately it about the man behind scope that gets the shots.So to a degree as explained above they help but they will not turn a bad shot into a marksman first class that only happens with hard work and training', ''),

Such systems are used across the world, but the science of forensics and ballistics has mostly been ignored in Pakistan where neighbourhood spy networks and police station beatings tactics are relied on instead to extract information during investigations.\r\n\r\nIn a development on Saturday, Inspector General of Police Fayyaz Ahmed Leghari and his staff decided that they would use an IBIS to make it mandatory for arms dealers with shops to share details of each transaction. Police constables will be assigned to collect spent bullets used during the trial of weapons from every arms dealer as well and the shells will be sent to the forensic division for record-keeping.\r\n\r\nForensics deputy chief Munir Ahmed Shaikh told The Express Tribune that a computerised system would help make investigations meaningful. Until an IBIS is acquired, however, the forensics division would continue to gather records – a lengthy process.\r\n\r\nForensics has a record of 6,000 bullet shells. “But to manually match a bullet shell against 6,000 records is a really lengthy process,” said AIG Shaikh. “An IBIS will be able to give us the top ten matches which would save us a lot of time and make life easier.”\r\n\r\nA record of casings collected from crime scenes, weapons and bullets seized from suspects would also be made part of the database. Investigation officers will be required to send them to the forensics division within 24 hours of opening a case.\r\n\r\n“Once we get a record, even if that weapon is used five years later, we will be able to identify it if we get the shell,” Shaikh explained.\r\n\r\nIt is estimated that there could be two million unlicensed weapons in Karachi alone and CID records indicate that there are 50,000 licensed weapons in the city. “Obviously, this is a good undertaking and should have happened long ago,” commened ASP Ali Asif. “But they will only be able to solve cases for which they have records. What are they going to do about unlicensed weapons, which are used in a majority of crimes?”\r\n\r\nThe IBIS would work for new weapons, but people who already posssess them would have to get the forensics division to stamp their licensed weapons. This will make it difficult for people to renew their licenses if they are not part of the system.\r\n\r\nwith additional input from ppi', ''),

I saw the long invisible LG shells which were assumed to many that POF stopped making them. I also took a Shaheen chart for cartridges, and 9mm and 30 bore brochures. I took one of the infantry uniform and Holsters catalog as well but he said today is the last day and its the last catalog we have left so cannot give it to you. \n\nAfter some descent questioning the young guys at the stall became friendly with me and said you can wear the camo caps and shirt and take pics inside the stall, but I thought that would make me like a joker wearing camo shirt over my formal shirt so I did not entertained this idea.\n\nI asked to show me the PK-9 pistol and the guy said bhai I would showed it to you but there are many ignorant visitors boring us so since yesterday we are not keeping it in the stall. I entered inside the stall few times and peeked here and there if I get a glimpse of PK-9 but I think the guy was telling the truth. The price he said is Rs: 42k. I said it was available in 33k when launched so he said yes it was the intro price and we have seriously sold lot of pieces in that price. Now we have increased the price to 42k. \n\nThere were ammo and artillery boxes , and other Dummy items for explosive artillery. \n \nHe said the factory rates for Shaheen cartridges is Rs: 875 in WAH. They are soon willing to open an outlet in Saddar Karachi in 2-3 months. I said we get much higher prices here in the market 1400-1500. And he replied being himself the knowledge that yes there are various transport costs, DC costs ( I don''t know what is DC cost but I agreed) and other factors so that is why they increase the cost.

You can consider 7x57 ( Ammo costs around Rs:150-200 normally depend on the market status), and Rifle such as 7mm BRNO etc are available upto 100k range.  Second option can be a .30-06 which capability of long range targets and again cheaper ammo. The cheapest you can have is a .308. You can get POF made bullets around Rs:50 but I think getting a .308 rifle is expensive.  \n\nIf you are considering just between .22-250 and .243 then take the former.  .22-250 ammo is cheaper then .243.  I personally like nothing other then 7mm Rem Mag :)\n\nI have used a SAKO made .22-250 many times and it hits nicely   \n\n[QUOTE=beretta7;306498]Dear Skeeter Sb, \ni own a savage 300 and a Brno 7x57 , both are ideal for short range hunting. Few days back i came across a Winchester model 670, in 7mm mag. though its quite an old rifle but is in very good condition.  need your reviews on this 670 model, and secondly im a bit confused if i should go for the 7mm mag, because i have heard from a friend who shot an urial with it last year , that it destroys the meat (shot from a distance of 150 yards). \ni also have an option of getting CZ 550 in 270 win and winchester model 70 in 243. \nkindly suggest me which one would be suitable for a game ranging to 400-500 yards...among the three options.[/QUOTE]\n\nFor 400+ yards do not think anything other then 7mm Rem Mag or bigger. I do not have experience with Winchester this model. But Remington Model 700 in 7mm Rem Mag is outclass and also economic. If you are having option for CZ 550 then take it in 7mm Rem Mag.

(473114, ' [B]AoA Everybody[/B]\r\n\r\nLets talk a little on the subject of available holster options for the Scorpion. I for one always prefer a kydex type holster over anything else.\r\n\r\n[B]here is my candidate: Fobus SP11B[/B]\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i998.photobucket.com/albums/af103/12gauge-pakguns/DSC00104-2.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i998.photobucket.com/albums/af103/12gauge-pakguns/Dsc00343.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\nIts a high riding Yuqui style holster for Springfield Armoury that happens to fit this handgun like a glove. it offers rapid drawing ability and it stays snug to your body. meaning that it doesn''t move when you run/walk and draws no attention to itself. the gun is locked in its place by the locking indentation in the trigger guard of the holster therefore no need for staps or other locking devices which can come in your way should you ever need to draw your gun in an emergency. infact, the lock mechanism is so effective that you may even run with the gun held upside down in the holster and it will still stay in its pace. the only way to release the lock is to use a swift and rapid motion in the right angle for the lock to let go of the trigger guard.\r\n\r\nJourney to the right kydex holster for Scorpion was pretty long and expensive cause plenty of holsters were bought online and shipped only to find out later that they do not fit. problem with kydex holsters is that they either fit perfect or do not fit at all. its not like a leather or nylon holster where you can force your handgun in making room by conforming to measurements which can be slightly off.\r\n\r\nfor a kydex holster to fit, you need it to be an absolutely perfect fit. either your handgun would simply wont go in as you cannot force and make room in them or it will go in but will not lock due the difference in the shape of the trigger guard or the gun will rattle inside the holster if the holster is over sized. secondly, kydex holsters are heavily shape formed that even a slightest difference in angle or shape would make it impossible to fit.\r\n\r\nAnyways, this one came along as a holster for a Taurus PT-145 (Denovo87 bhai bought one online for his PT-145) and by chance it fitted the Scorpion like its made for it. I mean it fitted the Scorpion just as good as it fitted PT-145.\r\n\r\nso.... [I]ever since I have gone Kydex[/I], I have never looked back. you just cannot beat a kydex with leather or nylon holster in terms of presentation speed (quick draw) and the ability to stay snug to your body. another big time plus is that they print very less under clothes. you''ll be surprise how easily one can conceal a full size handgun such a scorpion in a kydex holster such as this one.\r\n\r\nRegards.', ''),

(469044, ' I couldn''t afford what I wanted, so I''m making it.\n\nBack from 1970 to the early 1980s there was a gun called the Auto Mag.  I had always wanted one, but they were war more expensive than I could justify.  Now I am building one for myself.  I expect to spend another couple of years working on the project - I''m still working on upgrading my workshop and tools.\n\n I have a partial set of blueprints, a bunch of pictures, and a small plastic bag with the parts I don''t have the blueprints for.  I have never actually seen one of these pistols, only pictures of them.  By the time I am done I will have spent enough money to have simply bought two or even three real Auto Mags.  But spread out over a few years instead of in one chunk of money.\n\n The Auto Mag uses the short-recoil action; the upper part of the gun slides back about 8mm and a cam unlocks the rotating bolt.  The cartridge is .44 Auto Mag Pistol, or .44 AMP.  It is basically a shortened 7.62x51 rifle case with a 240 grain .44 caliber bullet, loaded about 10% hotter than a .44 Magnum.  It is hammer-fired with a single-action trigger.  The single-stack magazine holds 7 cartridges.\n\n\n If you are interested, the main build thread is on this site:\n\n[url]http://www.amtguns.info/forum_posts.asp?TID=1023&title=wecsog-auto-mag[/url]', ''),

It is doable, if there is no money then suffer for a few years and save to build something that will stand every year, rather than waste money to get quick fixes. I did not have a TV for 3 years while i was studying, I saved for 3 years to buy something that I really wanted. These are things taught by parents and society as a whole.

(468978, 'Visit to &quot;kachho&quot;. A journey through time I was invited for the first hunt of the season . But since the flood water has spread on millions of acres thus the low number of early arrived birds has been scattered on a vast area .I, hence, suggested to take a tour of the area with the guns ready to shoot lying by our side . Friends agreed and we proceeded early in the pre-dawn times of Sunday to have a trip of the arid zone of Sindh called as the &#8220;Kachho&#8221; in Sindhi. The subject area  located in upper Sindh is mainly consisting upon &#8220;Kheerthar &#8221;mountain range which starts from the western side of District Kamber-Shahdadkot (part of old District Larkano) and reaches sea shores of Sindh by crossing through old Dadu District . The word &#8220; Kachho&#8221; is derived from the Sindhi word &#8220;Kachh&#8221; means &#8220;Lap&#8221; . The reason behind this name seems to be the location of this area as this area is situated in the &#8220;Kachh&#8221; or in the &#8220;lap&#8221; of &#8220;Kheeerthar &#8220; mountain range . The word &#8220;Kheerthar&#8221; is also a fascinating word having the meaning of &#8220; Cream of the Milk&#8221;  ( that we usually see in fresh milk immediately after milking a she Camel or cow  or  after   boiling the milk ). This  name , &#8220;Kheerthar&#8221; has probably taken its origin from the shape of hills found in this particular mountain range .            \nThis visit made me sad . There I witnessed a calamity, a catastrophe in a slow progress  . The torrential rains on the mountains of Baluchistan caused damage over there too but Sindh has took most of the devastation, both in shape of loss of lives and destruction of infrastructure. The water of flood caused by rains on the Baluchistan mountains has ultimately to pass through this area. The flood water , after entering Sindh and devastating  the  districts of Kandhkot-Kashmore, JacobAbad and shikarpur , has started to play havoc with this area. The roads and tracks connecting &#8220; Kachho&#8221; to main plains have  been cut off. This is the third consecutive natural calamity hitting this area in 3 years. It means, a calamity in each and every year. The Govt is working to mitigate the sufferings but the scale of destruction seems to be  overwhelming  and beyond available resources\nThe results of shoot were encouraging. But the thing  I want to share with fellow Pakgunners is not the outcome of our gun shots but rather the images of a an old and pre-historic  yet &#8221; an effective &#8211;to-the-date&#8221; method of hunting . This is not the first time for me to observe this method, yet it may be new and interesting to some of our brethren living in cities  \nWhile on our journey to Dadu distict, driving on a narrow track surrounded by flood water , we passed by  a camp of fishermen, where I saw a large sized Heron/ great Egret tied up nearby . Heron is treated as haram so obviously it was meant for some purpose other than making a meal out of it , and I knew the purpose, so  decided to  take a halt and some pictures.         As we stopped, a boy emerged from deep water with another heron in his hands . My presumption was true , these herons were doomed to be made the decoys out of them. Those decoys are  locally called as &#8220; MODO&#8221;  The  tribal head of those fishermen appeared to knowing  me  already , he greeted us and offered to take a few sips of Sulemani Chai , alredy being prepared by them as a part of their breakfast . I  thanked and returned his favour in shape of fruits and juices .\nAfter discussing the flood and related matters , I inquired about the subject decoys .Till he answers the question,  My query was responded by another excited youth probably the first timer to use and witness the effectiveness of theses decoys . He was not a fisherman, rather a local to area those fishermen were camping in .So he was justified in being amazed. He told us &#8220; Saeen , by wearing these decoys, I am able  to catch the living and healthy birds with my bare hands and before they could feel anything, I drag them in the water by holding their legs and  break their wings . All I have to do is to follow the prescribed method of hunt .&#8221; \n\n These decoys are made of locally stuffed and hollowed birds of different species. The hollow abdominal cavity of stuffed bird  is supported by a net like structure made of locally available and flexible branches of &#8220;Lai&#8221; wood and then such decoy is worn on the head as a cap . After wearing this decoy ,The hunter hides himself in deep water and approaches the birds  slowly and if the hunter manages his approach in a natural way and at a slow pace , the target birds do not feel the approaching bird to be a decoy concealing a human till the moment the hunter drag  them inside water by holding them from their  legs and subsequently  breaking their wings.\n\nVIEW OF MUD TRACK  AND CAMP OF FISHERMEN\n[IMG]http://i1270.photobucket.com/albums/jj613/zainulabdeen/1-1.jpg[/IMG]\n\nHERON/GREAT EGRET THAT MADE ME TO STOP \n[IMG]http://i1270.photobucket.com/albums/jj613/zainulabdeen/2-1.jpg[/IMG]\n\nboy bringing an other heron doomed to be used as a decoy \n[IMG]http://i1270.photobucket.com/albums/jj613/zainulabdeen/3-1.jpg[/IMG]\n\nview of hollowed stuffed bird\n[IMG]http://i1270.photobucket.com/albums/jj613/zainulabdeen/5.jpg[/IMG]\n\nan other view\n[IMG]http://i1270.photobucket.com/albums/jj613/zainulabdeen/6.jpg[/IMG]\n\nview of decoy \n[IMG]http://i1270.photobucket.com/albums/jj613/zainulabdeen/7.jpg[/IMG]\n\nmy buddy wearing decoy\n[IMG]http://i1270.photobucket.com/albums/jj613/zainulabdeen/8.jpg[/IMG]\n\nmy friends wearing the decoys of different species \n[IMG]http://i1270.photobucket.com/albums/jj613/zainulabdeen/10.jpg[/IMG]\n[IMG]http://i1270.photobucket.com/albums/jj613/zainulabdeen/11.jpg[/IMG]', ''),

(468945, ' Personal Safety Tips from Assassin John Rain\n[url]http://www.barryeisler.com/coolstuff_tips.php[/url]\n\n This article also appears in Crimespree Issue #4\n [url]www.crimespreemag.com[/url] \n\nPart of the appeal of my series about the half-American, half-Japanese assassin John Rain seems to be Rain''s realistic tactics. It''s true that Rain, like his author, has a black belt in judo and is a veteran of certain government firearms and other defensive tactics courses, but these have relatively little to do with Rain''s continued longevity. Rather, Rain''s ultimate expertise, and the key to his survival, lies in his ability to think like the opposition.\n \nOkay, get out your notepad, because: \n\nAll effective personal protection, all effective security, all true self-defense, is based on the ability and willingness to think like the opposition.\n \nI''m writing this article on my laptop in a crowded coffee shop I like. There are a number of other people around me similarly engaged. I think to myself, If I wanted to steal a laptop, this would be a pretty good place to do it. You come in, order coffee and a muffin, sit, and wait. Eventually, one of these computer users is going to get up and make a quick trip to the bathroom. He''ll be thinking, "Hey, I''ll only be gone for a minute." He doesn''t know that a minute is all I need to get up and walk out with his $3000 PowerBook. (Note how criminals are adept at thinking like their victims. You need to treat them with the same respect.)\n \nOkay. I''ve determined where the opposition is planning on carrying out his crime (this coffee shop), and I know how he''s going to do it (snatch and dash). I now have options:\n1.avoid the coffee shop entirely (avoid where the crime will occur); \n2.secure my laptop to a chair with a twenty dollar Kensington security cable (avoid how the crime will occur - it''s hard to    employ bolt cutters unobtrusively in a coffee shop, or to carry away a laptop that has a chair hanging off it); and\n3.hope to catch the thief in the act, chase him down, engage him with violence.\nOf these three options, #2 makes the most sense for me. The first is too costly - I like this coffee shop and get a lot of work done here. The third is also too costly, and too uncertain. Why fight when you can avoid the fight in the first place? This is self-defense we''re talking about, remember, self-protection. Not fighting, not melodrama. As for the second, yes, it''s true these measures won''t render the crime impossible. But what measures ever do? The point is to make the crime difficult enough to carry out that the criminal chooses to pursue his aims elsewhere. Yes, if twenty-seven ninjas have dedicated their lives to stealing your laptop and have managed to track you to the coffee shop, they''ll probably manage to get your laptop while you''re in the bathroom even if you''ve secured it to a chair. But more likely, your opposition will be someone who is as happy stealing your laptop as someone else''s. By making yours the marginally more difficult target, you will encourage him to steal someone else''s.\n \nWhich brings us to an unpleasant, but vitally true, parable: \n\nIf you and your friend are jogging in the woods, and you get chased by a bear, you don''t have to outrun the bear. You just have to outrun your friend.\n \nExcept at the level of very high-value executive protection (presidents, high-profile businesspeople, ambassadors and other dignitaries), you are not trying to outrun the bear. You are trying only to outrun your friend.\n \nLet''s combine these two concepts - thinking like the opposition, outrunning your friend - with an example from the realm of home security. And let''s add an additional critical element: that all good security is layered.\n \nIf you wanted to burglarize a house, what would you look for? And what would you avoid?\n \nGenerally speaking, your principal objectives are to get cash and property, and to get away (home invasion is a separate subject, but is addressed, like all self-protection, by reference to the same principles). You''d start by looking at lots of houses. Remember, you''re not trying to rob a certain address; you just want to rob a house. Which ones are dark? Which are set back from the road and neighbors? Are there any cars in the driveway? Lights and noise in the house? Signs of an alarm system? A barking dog?\n \nThinking like a burglar, you are now ready to implement the outer layer of your home security. By some combination of installing motion-sensor lights, keeping bushes trimmed to avoid concealment opportunities, putting up signs advertising an alarm system, having a dog around, keeping a car or cars in the driveway, leaving on appropriate lights and the television, and making sure there are no newspapers in the driveway or mail left on the porch when you''re away, you help the burglar to decide immediately during his casing or surveillance phase that he should rob someone else''s house.\n \nIf the burglar isn''t immediately dissuaded by the outer layer, he receives further discouragement at the next layer in. He takes a closer look, and sees that you have deadbolt locks on all the doors, and that your advertisement was not a bluff - the windows are in fact alarmed. If he takes a crack at the doorjamb, he discovers that it''s reinforced. If he tries breaking a window, he realizes the glass is shatter-resistant. Whoops - time to go somewhere else, somewhere easier.\n \nOkay, the guy is stupid. He keeps trying anyway. Now the second layer of security described above, which failed to deter him, works to delay him. It''s taking him a long time to get in. He''s making noise. At some point, the time and noise might combine to persuade him to abort (back to deterrence). But if he insists on plunging ahead, the noise has alerted you, and you have bought yourself time to implement further inner layers of security: accessing a firearm; calling the police; retreating to a safe room; most of all, preparing yourself mentally and emotionally for danger and possible violence.\n \nNow another example, relating to personal protection from an overseas kidnapping attempt. Like everything else, this form of protection starts with you thinking like the bad guy. Your objective is to kidnap a foreigner. Not a particular foreigner (high-value targets are a separate problem, although again subject to the same principles), just any old foreigner. So what do you need to do to carry out your plan?\n \nFirst, you need to pick a target. This part is easy - any foreigner will do. Next, you need to assess the foreigner''s vulnerability. Where will you be able to grab him, and when? To answer these questions, you need to follow the target around. If he''s punctual, a creature of habit, if he likes to travel the same routes to and from work at the same times every day, you will start to feel encouraged.\n \nBut what if instead, during the assessment stage, you see the target go out to his car and carefully check it for improvised explosive devices. Your immediate thought will be: Hard target. Security-conscious. Too difficult - kidnap someone else.\n \nIf you''re the potential target, do you see how your display of security consciousness becomes the outermost layer of your security?\n \nBut suppose the would-be kidnapper wants to assess a bit further. Now he learns that you never travel the same route to and from work. You never come and go at the same times. He can''t get a fix on your where and when. How is he going to plan a kidnapping now?\n \nNote that, by putting yourself in the opposition''s shoes, you have identified a behavior pattern in which he must engage before carrying out his crime: surveillance. Before you are kidnapped, you will be assessed. Assessment entails surveillance. Now you know what pre-incident behavior to look for. If you were trying to follow you, how would you go about it? That''s what to look for.\n \nPerhaps the would-be kidnapper will discover choke points - a certain bridge, for example - that you have to cross every day on your way to the office. This would be a good place for him to lay an ambush. But because you know this too, you will be unusually alert as you approach potential choke points. As he watches your choke point behavior, he realizes again that you are security-conscious, and thus a poor choice for a target. Again, deterrence. If he is rash and acts at this point anyway, the inner layers of your security - locked and armored vehicle; defensive driving tactics; presence of a bodyguard; access to a firearm; again, most of all, preparing yourself mentally and emotionally for danger and possible violence - all have time to come into play.\n \nOther examples: if you needed fast cash, where would you look to rob someone? Maybe on the potential victim''s way from an ATM? If so, what kind of ATM would you pick? Where would you wait? What if you wanted to steal a car? Assuming you''re not a pro who can pick locks and hot-wire ignitions, where would you go? Maybe outside a video store, or a dry cleaner''s, a place where people leave the keys in the ignition because they''ll "only be gone for a minute"? Now, armed with a better understanding of the criminal''s goals and tactics, how should you behave to better protect yourself?\n \nOne common element you might see in all of this is the vital need for alertness, for situational awareness. Understanding where threats are likely to come from and how they are likely to materialize will help you properly tune your alertness. If you are not properly alert to a threat, you almost certainly will be unable to defend yourself against it when it materializes.\n \nNotice that so far the discussion has included no mention of martial arts. This is because martial arts, self-defense, fighting, and combat, while related subjects, are not identical. The relationship and differences among these areas is outside the scope of this article; for more information, check the suggestions for further reading below, especially [url]www.nononsenseselfdefense.com[/url]. For now, suffice it to say that martial arts can be thought of as an inner layer of self-defense. If you have to use your martial arts moves, then almost certainly some outer layer of your security has been breached and you are in a worse position than you would have been had the outer layers held fast.\n \nTo put it another way: \n\nThinking like the opposition; taking threats seriously and not being in denial about their existence; and maintaining proper situational awareness, are infinitely more cost effective for self-defense than is training in martial arts.\n \nNote that I have been doing martial arts of one kind or another since I was a teenager. I love the martial arts for many reasons. I do not dispute and am not discussing their value, but rather am emphasizing their cost-effectiveness in achieving a given objective - here, effective personal protection. No matter what her martial arts skills, the person who recognizes in advance and can therefore steer clear of an ambush has a much better chance of surviving it than does the person who wanders into the ambush and then has to fight her way out.\n \nSo practice thinking like the opposition, and you''ll have a better chance of lasting as long as John Rain.', ''),

There is also another method to shrinking the grips; however, know that Caracals are PA66 nylon with 10 to 15% GF (Glass Fiber), I don''t know what the result would be to shrink via heat.  Glock has the advantage there.\nI would try this if you have the guts and PATIENCE.  If you rush I know you will ruin the gun.  If you do this slowly then I know it can be done.  I recommend sanding down the frame till the checkering is gone - then using a pointed solder iron stippling the frame.  This type of job will take about two days if done with patience.

While, P226 comes with SA/DA trigger mechanism and for that, it also has a decocker lever so you can decock at your own will.

Alright, we have had this never-ending CURSE OF THE CHAMBERED ROUND discussion going on for a while now in this forum, however, [COLOR=#ff0000]the point of this thread is ENTIRELY DIFFERENT[/COLOR]. I am creating this thread to ask something from our senior and/or experienced about something really disappointing that I have just found out. This could be a news/rumor specific to Karachi members only so I request the members from Karachi to enlighten us over the issue mentioned below;\n\n I am a person who carried chambered TT in the past (when required) and absolutely have no problems at all in carrying my Zigana Sport daily with one in the chamber. (Please do not start the pointless RAMBO and ETHICAL discussion - I am a big guy weighing 217lbs and have no problems carrying Ziagana attached to my body and prefer to carry it ALWAYS chambered with safety on - By Choice)\n\nHowever today, I have had a sad and disappointing day. I was told by a cousin of mine that even with the 144 permit, [COLOR=#ff0000]I AM NOT ALLOWED TO KEEP MY PISTOL IN READY TO FIRE STATE I.E. CHAMBERED[/COLOR] and that is because of a law in imposed in Karachi. I laughed at him and asked how the heck that could be true. Despite of target killing and robberies on the rise, the right of self-defense of a citizen is seized by a pathetic law from the provincial govt. But the same news was later confirmed by two of my friends who told me horrible stories of noble citizens (carrying chambered) stopped by rangers and May Allah forbid it happening to anyone what was done to them.\n\nMy request to honourable members is, if there really exists a discriminatory law (whether temporary or permanent)  that forbids us to carry chambered. That''s all I need to know.\n\nI thank all members in advance for their input and contribution.\n\nMaa''Salam', ''),

No manual safety in P226 as well. \r\n\r\nThe better part of a P250 is not its trigger mechanism but its feature to change calibers by interchanging some parts which maybe are provided with it.

(And that will be annoyingly tricky to mange specially when getting off from a lifted 4x4.)\n\n* Most (read almost all) imports have their warranty period on batteries finished. And the batteries have already covered most of their 8 yrs maximum lifespan (under ideal conditions & usage).\n \n* I heard, the battery pack was Rs. 300k CNF Dubai  a while back. \n\n* As the batteries (of the car I drove) did not have that much strength in them, the vehicle tend to run on gasoline most of the time even when batteries were supposed to do the job. This phenomenon mostly goes unnoticed unless observed closely.\n\n* These vehicles are available in a good number in Pakistan not because they are in demand or suitable for our low-tech environment, but because revised duty structure allowed good margins for the dealers.\n\n[B]9th gen civic (not hybrid )[/B] and FJ 40\n\nAs for having a car out of the given choices, this seems to be the best option as far as I can see. \n\nAnd out of FJ40, RKR & 80 series LC (if thats what you referred to), They fall in totally different price segment & application. \n\nOut of FJ40 & RKR, I think RKR is a better option at a slightly more price though. With more gadgets, better handling a much comfortable driving & travelling.\n\nLC80 is a great all-rounder but pretty expensive to maintain in comparison being of its age & highly equipped. It may not go the few places where RKR & FJ will go without thinking twice though but thats very rare as well. The added advantage is lots of space for buddies & cargo on excursions & still a great urban presence.', ''),

The various shapes such as long barrels, short barrels, AK47 design etc., made this caliber very popular amongst the intended users i mentioned. In addition to this, it is difficult to convince the arms branches of provinces to enter .308 on the licenses as in Punjab they have a specific circular only for two bolt action rifles which are .22 and 7mm.

On targets beyond 25 yards the duplex reticle cross hair may impede precise target acquisition due to a limited 4x magnification. This I speak of personal experience which is why I opted and settled for variable magnification scopes.\n\nWith a small objective lense, in this case 32mm, the amount of light entering is relatively less and therefore image quality will not be as great. simple rule, larger objective, more light, better image :)\n\nBefore ordering anything I suggest you should go to a dealer, check both 4x32 and variable power, larger objective scopes (any brand or make) to get a rough idea how they perform in relativity and then decide which one suits your need better :).', ''),

I am creating this thread to ask something from our senior and/or experienced about something really disappointing that I have just found out. This could be a news/rumor specific to Karachi members only so I request the members from Karachi to enlighten us over the issue mentioned below;\n\n I am a person who carried chambered TT in the past (when required) and absolutely have no problems at all in carrying my Zigana Sport daily with one in the chamber. (Please do not start the pointless RAMBO and ETHICAL discussion - [COLOR=#800000][SIZE=4][B]I am a big guy weighing 217lbs[/B][/SIZE][/COLOR] and have no problems carrying Ziagana attached to my body and prefer to carry it ALWAYS chambered with safety on - By Choice)\n\nHowever today, I have had a sad and disappointing day. I was told by a cousin of mine that even with the 144 permit, I AM NOT ALLOWED TO KEEP MY PISTOL IN READY TO FIRE STATE I.E. CHAMBERED and that is because of a law in imposed in Karachi. I laughed at him and asked how the heck that could be true. Despite of target killing and robberies on the rise, the right of self-defense of a citizen is seized by a pathetic law from the provincial govt. But the same news was later confirmed by two of my friends who told me horrible stories of noble citizens (carrying chambered) stopped by rangers and May Allah forbid it happening to anyone what was done to them.\n\nMy request to honourable members is, if there really exists a discriminatory law (whether temporary or permanent)  that forbids us to carry chambered. That''s all I need to know.\n\nI thank all members in advance for their input and contribution.\n\nMaa''Salam[/QUOTE]\n\nWe unfortunately have all the laws relating to firearms & self defense only in books so taking a lawful plea works only in courts but never at police/rangers check points; so our laws cannot be a quick remedy at the time of need for a lawful citizen. \nSecondly law enforcing agencies have got support of a very powerful law that is section 144; exercising which can deprive us of all the rights given by constitution with a stroke of a pen; a magistrate has complete powers to make any rule/regulation/law in a minute to make citizens of a free country slaves of colonial system.

Every application has a different set of requirements & preferences. \n\nMy suggestion was based on \n*User''s original requirement\n*Diana 31 being the gun \n*with a sensible expense on optics that can perform & last a while. \n\nIn my limited understanding, this particular gun being a lighter one is usually used while being held in hands unlike the Hatsan Sniper, Diana 54 & 56 etc. A light weight scope is also a plus for this. Fixed power magnification was my suggestion and the the smaller objective lens size.\n\nAnother factor is that objective size is not the only thing to reduce the light > brightness. Higher magnification does the same. \n\nHigh magnification, while making the target / object bigger makes it more difficult at the same time to hold the gun at with precision without a steady support as sensitivity increases.

(469462, ' Cucko brother! Here are few points that might help:\n1. "Dry Practice" i.e. practicing with an empty gun... Stand with an empty gun in your hand(s), arm(s) streched out as if you were practicing on a target at the range... The gun has to be pointed in a safe direction of course... Take aim, align the sights and then "squeeze the trigger"... Make sure that while you squeeze the trigger, sights stay aligned and front sight doesn''t drop when you squeeze the trigger...\n2. Another main reason of flinching is the "bang"... Anticipation of the "bang" makes the shooter flinch.... Get good quality ear muffs and you can add ear plugs with the ear muffs which will further reduce the sound... After that, hold the pistol firmly (I don''t mean grab it tightly) and "squeeze" the trigger instead of "pulling" the trigger... Squeezing = pulling the trigger slowly and smoothly.\n3. While shooting, squeeze the trigger and imagine that you didn''t have a live round in the chamber and it will "click" instead of "boom".

The finished product is something we really like. One thing the PakGuns Management is all agreed on is that [B]anything[/B] with the PakGuns logo on it will be made to the highest possible quality.\n \nI was quite demanding that the fabric of the black cap must be ''exactly'' the same as the sample I sent. I find it the most comfortable fabric to wear in both winters and summers. The [B]Skul Kaps[/B] provide more comfort for handgun shooting specially.   \n\nThe credit for this entire project goes solely to [B]12G [/B]as Denovo and I mostly played the role of advisor''s ( although I''m sure Denovo had to provide the Chicken Malai Boti''s as well ;) ) [B]Well done brother[/B], excellently executed !\n\nI would like to announce costs for the brothers wanting to buy more than 1 cap.

(469849, ' Tula''s Toz34 has always fascinated me. before we talk about this shotgun, lets talk a little about Tula''s history and why the company didn''t turn out to be a success.\r\n\r\nIn the USSR days, every shotgun that Russia produced was exported under the brand name of Baikal. meaning, a shotgun produced either by Tulsky Oruzheiny Zavod (TULA) or IZHEVSKY MEKHANICHESKY ZAVOD (IMZ), would be sold as Baikal to the outside world. \r\n\r\nwith the end of USSR and subsequent privatization of different state owned enterprises, Baikal name was shifted to IZHEVSKY MEKHANICHESKY ZAVOD (IMZ) whereas Tulsky Oruzheiny Zavod started started using Tula for its products.\r\n\r\nquality and durability wise, both companies are the same. in Russia, Baikal''s biggest competitor is Tula however in the outside world, people are mostly familiar with the Baikal instead of Tula therefore it was only natural that Tula''s sales greatly suffer as people opt to purchase the known name instead of an unknown product.\r\n\r\nThen came clever marketing as Remington sold Baikal as one of their inexpensive budget line. this made the outside world more aware of Baikals and as a result, Tulas exports dwindled even further.\r\n\r\nsome say that Baikal''s design is more conventional in nature. that means they are simple to manufacture hence are more reliable and durable and are easily repairable whereas Tula designs are more contemporary and follow more latest theme.\r\n\r\nThen comes Tulz Toz34, it was a revolutionary design back then in the 70s. infact, keeping todays scene in view, it is still a totally space age design. the barrel hinges on a curved lock instead traditional pin. this system ensure a much longer working life as more surface area is in contact. I could be wrong but I think the shotgun features striker fire system instead of traditional hammer system.\r\n\r\nsome say that Browning Cynergy is base on Tulz Toz34. now what that tells you?\r\n\r\nRegards.', ''),

No doubt there beam goes lot farther but they are not as effective as halogens, that is my personal opinion and preference others might differ. I also have a 6 D cell maglite but its just good for backup, as maglite''s have a bad reputation with there reflectors if they are kept on for a long time, the glossy finish of the reflector doesn''t holds much against the heat created by the merciless halogen.

We are here to advice our brothers to the best of our understanding to help them choose what suits them best.\n\nKind regards[/QUOTE]\n\nDear Friends,\n\nThe scope is required for Diana 31.  Quality wise Hawke scopes are superior to Leapers. Both are made in China.  In China made scopes Hawke is one of the best.  In UK the power limit is 12ftlb.  In US there is no such limit.  \n\nIn US some of my friends are using Hawke 4x32 scope with one piece mount on magnum springers with success. Some are also using Leapers with success.\n\nIn Pakistan, we cannot claim warranties.  Leapers normally face more issues ralated to warranty claim than Hawke.  Approximately 5% of Hawke scope go for warranty claim while approximatelt 25% of Leapers scopes go for warranty claim.\n\nThe best range for springer in Hawke is their "Airmax".  \n\nBut there is always the price factor involved.  I would love to buy Hawke Airmax series if I have that much money, but if I have limited funds, I would surely go for Hawke 4x32.\n\n\n4X magnification is such a magnification on which there is no limitation of export from UK hence  one can easily import such scope from UK.\n\nA fixed maginification scope with light weight is always more stable.  If you want to purchase variable magnification scope, you are more prone to destry it.\n\nFor Diana 31, in my humble opinion, Hawke 4x32 is the best scope.

The Folders category gives all your family an all in one get to see a lot more like what all your family members have in QuickPic. The extra financial institutions relating to navigation is that an all in one real bonus and allow your family navigate to learn more about photographs easily and intuitively.?A great feature regarding the app perhaps be the inclusion of animated a video thumbnails.

Additionally all your family members can customise your get to see and either drill down folders.When opening a multi functional a special your family can a hundred percent tap to explore digital zoom in or perhaps pinch throughout the and on the town manually.

So I figured I''ll get the TacOps and the matter will be settled. \n\nBut I was thrown a curve ball today and a H&K USP was offered to me around the price of  G19 - maybe a bit less and this is making me re-think. \nSenior members please help - or should I just go and get the G23/G19 as I originally intended? \n\nTo be honest I dont need a gun and you may ask what is the purpose CC/SD/HD/Range - actually there is none. I just want to add to the collection. Already have plenty of handguns to cover all the bases. :)\n\nI''m open to suggestions if you feel that there is a better handgun this bracket. I''d really like a .40 and I dont have one of those. But I''m happy with a 9mm as well or even a .45 \n\n- Usman', ''),

As they say, he has acted many times out of limits of decency not suiting a MOD and posted rudely here without thinking twice. He has deliberately avoided deleting abusive posts from other abusive members in past, enflaming further conflicts rather than subduing heated arguments which sometimes are witness by various members here. I have witnessed some rude posting by a new member from UK GUNFUN (if you read closely what material of his was deleted in first place). I reported his posts thrice before replying to him but your mods (especially Denovo) did not delete or edit his posts nor sent him warning. When I replied finally, the Sr Mod suddenly appeared from nowhere to comment haughtily. 12Gauge conveyed me too that he (Denovo) probably is doing that deliberately and not editing rude posts by others like GunFun to let the argument role on. Reason is obvious as it appears to me: to enflame conflict to the point of boiling. Also, if you note, a very humble member HaroonNazir was banned when he said that he disapproved of the massive quails hunted by Ahmed Sultan of Sind. he did not say much. So, the Mods like him are going beyond their authority and exploiting their position, as you know writing like this at forum from a MOD is very easy, and writing arrogant and rude style, is even cowardly and commendable.[/FONT][/COLOR]\n[COLOR=#000000][FONT=Geneva] [/FONT][/COLOR]\n[COLOR=#000000][FONT=Geneva]As many members in past too, including me, and especially majority of hunters like Engineer paracha and others (there is a long list) have left this forum in disgust merely over HIS personal style of not understanding matters relating to hunting and hunters. Many times have all hunters recommended to appoint a hunting section MOD here among seasoned hunters or seniors. Examples can be many: e.g. Avais, Engr, or any senior hunter with a polite and understanding attitude. This Senior MOD is going out of his way many times (if you observe) to promote HIS group (so called HIS group) with Avais Habib Khan as the leader of the group and his nephews & Liano etc among other few. You would see many of his posts to constantly praise his group where he wants to be the best group there is here. All other hunters, if you observe have left this forum - Gunner, Sajjad Khan, Superustaji, Little Hunter, Tiger Roars, Prince, Engineer, Faisal Kiani, and a list of others. The reason is only ONE man here who wants HIS GROUP here to lead and tries to use offensive language in his posts here. Kindly allow us to respond to him in same and befitting manner like in this post # 403 here where he has used objectionable words/language without any reason against hunters including me here who have posted in the section : "Waterfowl and Upland Hunting..." by Avais Habib (his close buddy). Waterfowl and Upland hunting means anybody can post about waterfowl hunts or upland hunts....reason: we do not post here on PG regularly about our pics. We just post 1 out of 5 pictures maybe, as we (especially I) do not have passion for self projection on forums, nor to project oneself at GTGs. I just post here to share, seek and contribute knowledge about guns and hunting. Thats it. No other agenda. [/FONT][/COLOR]\n[COLOR=#000000][FONT=Geneva] [/FONT][/COLOR]\n[COLOR=#000000][FONT=Geneva]I hope you look at the post #403 closely, and discern its hidden meaning, and then allow us to respond to such irresponsible and haughty Mods here. Should you choose to act otherwise e.g. editing or clearing rules about which section or thread one needs to post (e.g. I like to post very few pictures hence did not find it necessary to open a separate thread. thus posted here in this section, just as TH78 has also done that. Avais Habib also didn''t object to that on phone as I have talked to him a humber of times).

SECTION??? I feel strange when the Mod (Denovo) with his super ego to dominate the forum here with HIS SO-CALLED GROUP writes in that fashion. Thats plain misuse of one''s authority which the admin needs to correct and address.

These two pages and the resulting argument and "SHABAASHI" several times to GUNFUN by him and then informing you about the resulting conflict in the end, and before that not deleting or editing GUNFUN''s reported (thrice) posts by me ... etc etc ... all show a certain pattern and as we are educated enough to see such undercurrents and patterns of communication ... even the language and words match the style of posting by Denovo here. For example, the words "even as a self-proclaimed hunter" on page 62 have been used by GunFun as well as Denovo at #403 of "Waterfowl and Upland  Hunting ..." thread by Avais which I reported in previous email to you.

But the worst part is that many hunters like here I mentioned will give you proofs that certain sms''s and emails were sent by the Senior Moderator Denovo himself to different parties (Prince, me, hunter1, TR) to enflame the debate and create a situation dirtier than before. In this process, he probably takes regular advice from Avais Habib too but I would not understand or believe at this point if he has any malice towards hunters. He might have the agenda of being at the top of ALL HUNTERS here on forum .. maybe maybe ... but thats a fact which I cannot vouch for certainly without proof.

More flexibility plus if you don''t like it shouldnt be that hard to resell. \n\nJust switching out the barrel will work fairly reliably but to really get absolute full Glock reliability, i.e. if you wanted to carry it for self defense, you would have to  change the ejector and the extractor spring bearing (not expensive or difficult).

(470243, ' [QUOTE=Ata;307137]Personal Safety Tips from Assassin John Rain\n[URL]http://www.barryeisler.com/coolstuff_tips.php[/URL]\n\nThis article also appears in Crimespree Issue #4\n[URL="http://www.crimespreemag.com"]www.crimespreemag.com[/URL] \n\nPart of the appeal of my series about the half-American, half-Japanese assassin John Rain seems to be Rain''s realistic tactics. It''s true that Rain, like his author, has a black belt in judo and is a veteran of certain government firearms and other defensive tactics courses, but these have relatively little to do with Rain''s continued longevity. Rather, Rain''s ultimate expertise, and the key to his survival, lies in his ability to think like the opposition.\n\nOkay, get out your notepad, because: \n\nAll effective personal protection, all effective security, all true self-defense, is based on the ability and willingness to think like the opposition.\n\nI''m writing this article on my laptop in a crowded coffee shop I like. There are a number of other people around me similarly engaged. I think to myself, If I wanted to steal a laptop, this would be a pretty good place to do it. You come in, order coffee and a muffin, sit, and wait. Eventually, one of these computer users is going to get up and make a quick trip to the bathroom. He''ll be thinking, "Hey, I''ll only be gone for a minute." He doesn''t know that a minute is all I need to get up and walk out with his $3000 PowerBook. (Note how criminals are adept at thinking like their victims. You need to treat them with the same respect.)\n\nOkay. I''ve determined where the opposition is planning on carrying out his crime (this coffee shop), and I know how he''s going to do it (snatch and dash). I now have options:\n1.avoid the coffee shop entirely (avoid where the crime will occur); \n2.secure my laptop to a chair with a twenty dollar Kensington security cable (avoid how the crime will occur - it''s hard to employ bolt cutters unobtrusively in a coffee shop, or to carry away a laptop that has a chair hanging off it); and\n3.hope to catch the thief in the act, chase him down, engage him with violence.\nOf these three options, #2 makes the most sense for me. The first is too costly - I like this coffee shop and get a lot of work done here. The third is also too costly, and too uncertain. Why fight when you can avoid the fight in the first place? This is self-defense we''re talking about, remember, self-protection. Not fighting, not melodrama. As for the second, yes, it''s true these measures won''t render the crime impossible. But what measures ever do? The point is to make the crime difficult enough to carry out that the criminal chooses to pursue his aims elsewhere. Yes, if twenty-seven ninjas have dedicated their lives to stealing your laptop and have managed to track you to the coffee shop, they''ll probably manage to get your laptop while you''re in the bathroom even if you''ve secured it to a chair. But more likely, your opposition will be someone who is as happy stealing your laptop as someone else''s. By making yours the marginally more difficult target, you will encourage him to steal someone else''s.\n\nWhich brings us to an unpleasant, but vitally true, parable: \n\nIf you and your friend are jogging in the woods, and you get chased by a bear, you don''t have to outrun the bear. You just have to outrun your friend.\n\nExcept at the level of very high-value executive protection (presidents, high-profile businesspeople, ambassadors and other dignitaries), you are not trying to outrun the bear. You are trying only to outrun your friend.\n\nLet''s combine these two concepts - thinking like the opposition, outrunning your friend - with an example from the realm of home security. And let''s add an additional critical element: that all good security is layered.\n\nIf you wanted to burglarize a house, what would you look for? And what would you avoid?\n\nGenerally speaking, your principal objectives are to get cash and property, and to get away (home invasion is a separate subject, but is addressed, like all self-protection, by reference to the same principles). You''d start by looking at lots of houses. Remember, you''re not trying to rob a certain address; you just want to rob a house. Which ones are dark? Which are set back from the road and neighbors? Are there any cars in the driveway? Lights and noise in the house? Signs of an alarm system? A barking dog?\n\nThinking like a burglar, you are now ready to implement the outer layer of your home security. By some combination of installing motion-sensor lights, keeping bushes trimmed to avoid concealment opportunities, putting up signs advertising an alarm system, having a dog around, keeping a car or cars in the driveway, leaving on appropriate lights and the television, and making sure there are no newspapers in the driveway or mail left on the porch when you''re away, you help the burglar to decide immediately during his casing or surveillance phase that he should rob someone else''s house.\n\nIf the burglar isn''t immediately dissuaded by the outer layer, he receives further discouragement at the next layer in. He takes a closer look, and sees that you have deadbolt locks on all the doors, and that your advertisement was not a bluff - the windows are in fact alarmed. If he takes a crack at the doorjamb, he discovers that it''s reinforced. If he tries breaking a window, he realizes the glass is shatter-resistant. Whoops - time to go somewhere else, somewhere easier.\n\nOkay, the guy is stupid. He keeps trying anyway. Now the second layer of security described above, which failed to deter him, works to delay him. It''s taking him a long time to get in. He''s making noise. At some point, the time and noise might combine to persuade him to abort (back to deterrence). But if he insists on plunging ahead, the noise has alerted you, and you have bought yourself time to implement further inner layers of security: accessing a firearm; calling the police; retreating to a safe room; most of all, preparing yourself mentally and emotionally for danger and possible violence.\n\nNow another example, relating to personal protection from an overseas kidnapping attempt. Like everything else, this form of protection starts with you thinking like the bad guy. Your objective is to kidnap a foreigner. Not a particular foreigner (high-value targets are a separate problem, although again subject to the same principles), just any old foreigner. So what do you need to do to carry out your plan?\n\nFirst, you need to pick a target. This part is easy - any foreigner will do. Next, you need to assess the foreigner''s vulnerability. Where will you be able to grab him, and when? To answer these questions, you need to follow the target around. If he''s punctual, a creature of habit, if he likes to travel the same routes to and from work at the same times every day, you will start to feel encouraged.\n\nBut what if instead, during the assessment stage, you see the target go out to his car and carefully check it for improvised explosive devices. Your immediate thought will be: Hard target. Security-conscious. Too difficult - kidnap someone else.\n\nIf you''re the potential target, do you see how your display of security consciousness becomes the outermost layer of your security?\n\nBut suppose the would-be kidnapper wants to assess a bit further. Now he learns that you never travel the same route to and from work. You never come and go at the same times. He can''t get a fix on your where and when. How is he going to plan a kidnapping now?\n\nNote that, by putting yourself in the opposition''s shoes, you have identified a behavior pattern in which he must engage before carrying out his crime: surveillance. Before you are kidnapped, you will be assessed. Assessment entails surveillance. Now you know what pre-incident behavior to look for. If you were trying to follow you, how would you go about it? That''s what to look for.\n\nPerhaps the would-be kidnapper will discover choke points - a certain bridge, for example - that you have to cross every day on your way to the office. This would be a good place for him to lay an ambush. But because you know this too, you will be unusually alert as you approach potential choke points. As he watches your choke point behavior, he realizes again that you are security-conscious, and thus a poor choice for a target. Again, deterrence. If he is rash and acts at this point anyway, the inner layers of your security - locked and armored vehicle; defensive driving tactics; presence of a bodyguard; access to a firearm; again, most of all, preparing yourself mentally and emotionally for danger and possible violence - all have time to come into play.\n\nOther examples: if you needed fast cash, where would you look to rob someone? Maybe on the potential victim''s way from an ATM? If so, what kind of ATM would you pick? Where would you wait? What if you wanted to steal a car? Assuming you''re not a pro who can pick locks and hot-wire ignitions, where would you go? Maybe outside a video store, or a dry cleaner''s, a place where people leave the keys in the ignition because they''ll "only be gone for a minute"? Now, armed with a better understanding of the criminal''s goals and tactics, how should you behave to better protect yourself?\n\nOne common element you might see in all of this is the vital need for alertness, for situational awareness. Understanding where threats are likely to come from and how they are likely to materialize will help you properly tune your alertness. If you are not properly alert to a threat, you almost certainly will be unable to defend yourself against it when it materializes.\n\nNotice that so far the discussion has included no mention of martial arts. This is because martial arts, self-defense, fighting, and combat, while related subjects, are not identical. The relationship and differences among these areas is outside the scope of this article; for more information, check the suggestions for further reading below, especially [URL="http://www.nononsenseselfdefense.com"]www.nononsenseselfdefense.com[/URL]. For now, suffice it to say that martial arts can be thought of as an inner layer of self-defense. If you have to use your martial arts moves, then almost certainly some outer layer of your security has been breached and you are in a worse position than you would have been had the outer layers held fast.\n\nTo put it another way: \n\nThinking like the opposition; taking threats seriously and not being in denial about their existence; and maintaining proper situational awareness, are infinitely more cost effective for self-defense than is training in martial arts.\n\nNote that I have been doing martial arts of one kind or another since I was a teenager. I love the martial arts for many reasons. I do not dispute and am not discussing their value, but rather am emphasizing their cost-effectiveness in achieving a given objective - here, effective personal protection. No matter what her martial arts skills, the person who recognizes in advance and can therefore steer clear of an ambush has a much better chance of surviving it than does the person who wanders into the ambush and then has to fight her way out.\n\nSo practice thinking like the opposition, and you''ll have a better chance of lasting as long as John Rain.[/QUOTE]\n\nA long but very informative article. very nice bro.', ''),

I own a petrol pump and bank alfalah charges me 0.87 % for bank alfalah debit/credit cards and 1.07% for other bank cards. \r\nThis percentage depends from business to business but i have learnt that it is not more than 2.5% for any business, yet people charge the customers more. \r\n\r\nIts just the practice of the market, and i second every thought that says that this percentage bothers alot. Imagine we paying lets say 300,000 for anything, we will have to pay 7500 in account of bank charges :O', ''),

(470506, ' [url]http://www.chuckhawks.com/premium_autoloading_shotguns.htm[/url]\r\n\r\nAbove article has some good insight about these premium semi guns, in which author quotes ........  \r\n\r\n"BERETTA A400 UNICO XPLOR. The A400 is a very clever design. Cheap to make compared to its predecessors, it extends the notion of the shoot-everything autoloader, whether that notion is practical. Despite the obvious economy of manufacture, the liberal use of “heavy polymer” and the avoidance of high-grade walnut, the A400 #retails for a breathtaking $1725.00. It is an impressive, cost-cutting gun, though perhaps not quite as impressive as its retail price suggests.\r\nThe bolt speed in the A400 would be considered excessive in many designs, but the KO3 backstop for the bolt appears to have addressed that potential issue competently. The fast bolt speed is what enables the use of mouse loads without problem. Why exactly you might want to use whimpy 20 gauge target loads out of a 3-1/2 inch dinosaur killing 12 gauge escapes me. However, the A400 does function as promised with 7/8 oz. loads, although many other models can do the same thing."\r\n\r\nSo, as you see, the latest gun does not necessarily use the best materials. Newest ones are coming with most plastics (technopolymers) whereas older ones like 390 and 303 are more steel, lesser aluminium or technopolymers. Economies of scale & higher costs of prod, are also driving this production strategy in the gun mnfc industry. In order for the LATEST to sell, the company HAS to invest (pump in ) a lot of funds in marketing/advertising/media to promote it worldwide. Thus in process, people generally think the LATEST is best unfortunately.', ''),

(470649, 'Made to order Knife I had to wait like, I don''t know how long for this beauty to arrive in my hands. I have always been a fan of Made in Pakistan things, as I know our beloved country is not at all behind any other developed nation when it comes to skills and craft, if not ahead. I was quite tired spending money on knives readily available in the market, though I spent quite, but was never satisfied and hence could never claim that the appetite for finding the optimum knife is over for me. Though I advocated my spending on knives before my hunting buddies, just to hide my inner feelings :). \n\nBut then........Then I just started surfing the internet for made in Pakistan knives, and I came across a few websites and got their contact numbers tried to reach all of them but only got feedback from Mr.M.Aleem of the knife craft company Sialkot. I first made a deal with him and quickly transferred him the money we settled on. And then I happened to go through the Thread of Brother Avais, and found that he had got made some gem of knives from Mr.M.Aleem''s company and reading that thread was just like adding the fuel of curiosity to the fire of my ambition. \n\nThen it all started to happen that Mr.M.Aleem got busy in some personal matters and my curiosity of having the knife grew more and more, I never the doubted the person, it''s just my bad habit of binding to the dates fast, I have asked Mr.M.Aleem that for our next deal he should give me just one fixed date of his convenience it won''t matter if he gives a date of a month later. \n\nAnd then it was due to the courtesy of our esteemed pakgnner brother Denovo that everything worked out smooth in the end and he was indeed of a lot help to me and the way he stepped in for the help and right away took then initiative to solve my problem I really felt how closely knit our community is, Masha"Allah. \n\nAnd now something about the knife- The knife''s blade is made of 440c IXL Japanese steel and has a buffalo horn grip with silver nickel bolsters. The knife has a razor edge out of the package. It at all doesn''t feels like a lousy built knife, in fact it feels very strong and very well built knife, with out class finishing from every angle and a very well polished grip. The opening and closing of the blade is spring assisted so its a pleasure to open and close it. Just tried it on a few things as I am short on time. It cut everything like butter. Tried the paper cut test never has any of my knives passed the paper cut so smoothly like this one has and in the end it just touched.....yes just touched my thumb and I got a fine little cut but nothing serious.\n\nI have a mixed feeling of happiness and sadness, that I got a great source for knives for the future and that why did I not find it before. For comparison this knife makes my victorinox knife feel ashamed of itself.', ''),

(470656, ' Dear Murtaza brother, a gas ram instead of steel spring is some thing new and not still introduced here. Once they are in, people will surely show interest due to increased accuracy.  Gas spring units are available as an upgrade for some popular models  such as the Weirauch HW80, the Crosman 766C Crossman nitro venom, Walther talon etc. Springs of most of the rifles can be replaced with gas ram by a gunsmith having experience. The advantages of the gas spring  include the facility to keep the rifle cocked and ready to fire for long  periods of time without harming the mechanism. Also, since there is no  spring (and therefore a reduction in moving mass during firing) there is  less (although some say slightly sharper) recoil. There is also an  elimination of the associated problems of long-term spring fatigue and a  faster "lock time" (the time between pulling the trigger and the pellet  being discharged). The improvement in lock time and elimination of spring vibration and torque makes for better  accuracy. Finally, gas springs are practically maintenance free and last much longer  than conventional metal springs. they are an  order of magnitude more expensive when they do need replacement. They come in different powers, and modern gas rams can be re-used (re-filled ) with only change of seals or some minor parts when they finally leak or get weak.\nAny queries are most welcome.', ''),

These levels of maintenance of inventories, i.e. a Category A license must hold 1,000,000 revolver/pistol rounds are unreasonable; not only does maintainance of such involve heavy expenditure but if a trader is in possession of such amount, he cannot sell his ammunition until such time that he has more than the specified inventory.

(470907, 'Scopes Explained,......... This guide may be helpful to newcomers to the sport of Airgunning, with  regard to the basic specification nomenclature of scopes.\n \nMany people can become confused by the vast array of numbers and letters  which accompany the manufacturers name of a scope, and which explain  what properties it has to offer the user. Hopefully this guide will help  unravel this mystery, and help you gain a better understanding of what  it all means.\n \nScope models come entitled with an arrangement of numbers, for example a 4x40, 3-9x40IR, or a 4-16x50PX, or whatever.\n \nThe first number (or numbers) before the ''X'' relate to the level of  magnification the scope will provide, so a 4x will increased the viewed  image the user sees by four times. If that number was 6x, then the  subject would look six times bigger than it actually was.\n \nIf the scope gives two numbers, it means the magnification is adjustable  anywhere between the two extremes, so a 3-9x can adjust the image as  low as three, or as high as up to nine times magnification. Likewise a  4-16 (or whatever) is variable between four to sixteen times the actual  size of the image. This property makes the scope known as a ''zoom''  scope.\n \nThe number that comes after the ''X'' is the diameter in millimetres of  the objective lens (furthest from your eye), so a x32 has a 32mm front  lens, a x40 has a 40mm front lens, a x50 a 50mm lens, and so on.\n \nIf a scope has either PA, PX or AO in it''s title (eg, 4-16x50PA), it  means that the scope is ''Parallax Adjustable'', or has an ''Adjustable  Objective'', and it has the ability for the image of the target to be  precisely focused upon, regardless of what range that might be, so it  will always provide a pin-sharp picture of what you are looking at.\n \nAdjustment is made by one of two ways, either by an adjustable front  (objective lens) collar, or by a ''sidewheel'' (sometimes prefixed SW)  mounted on the turret saddle.\n \nParallax adjustable scopes are sometimes referred to as ''Rangefinder''  scopes, as they also provide the side-effect of allowing you to read off  the range on the focusing collar/wheel, once your intended target is in  sharp focus.\n \nScopes without PA, PX or AO ability are only perfectly focused at a  given fixed distance, usually 30 or 100 yards at the factory, though it  is possible to re-adjust them yourself, to whatever fixed distance you  desire, but it will always remain focused perfectly for that range only,  unless you chose to re-adjust it again (not quickly done).\n \nMoving onto the turrets, which are used to ''zero'' the scope of the  rifle/pistol to the point of aim/impact, so the pellet actually goes to  precisely where you are aiming. These are sited on the saddle (in the  centre of the scope), one on the top, and one on the righthand side of  the scope when viewed from the rear (ocular) lens.\n \nThe top turret controls the up/down movement of the shot (elevation),  and the side turret controls the side to side placement of the shot  (windage).\nSome turrets have covers to protect the settings from the elements, and from being knocked out of position.\n \nSome turrets however, are exposed, and are generally known as BDC  (Bullet Drop Compensating), or ''target'' turrets, and again, this acronym  is sometimes added into the scope title, eg 5-20x50PA BDC. Some scopes  have lockable BDC turrets, as non-lockable ones can be very easily  inadvertently knocked, and so ruining the zero. \n \nAnother thing which is sometimes added to the specs, is what type of  ''reticle'' a scope has. A reticle is another name for the ''crosshairs'',  or the aiming marks, that are viewed through the scope, the most common  being 30/30 and Mil-Dot.\nThere are many other different types of reticle, far too many to go into here, so I might explain those in a future article.\n \nOne thing I will add now though, is some scopes have an IR prefix. This  means the reticle has the ability to be illuminated (IR = Illuminated  Reticle) to enable shooting at night, or in dark conditions, when a  normal reticle would not be visible. \n \nThe ''body tube'' of scopes come in two common sizes, 1" or 30mm.\n30mm is said to allow more light into the shooters eye, and so provide a  brighter sight picture, but this is debatable, and again, a subject for  future discussion.\n \nSo, having gone through the ''basics'' of scope specifications, I hope  that has been helpful in creating a good foundation of your  understanding of them, so when you next see a 4-16x50PA-IR-Mil-Dot, you  will know exactly what it all means.\n\n(Original article can be read here; [url]http://activeshooter.co.uk/content/scopes-explained-basic-guide-83/[/url] .)', ''),

(471136, ' Dear denovo87...many thanks for the warm welcome...I am kkhan8''s older brother. I got a skeet machine in 2010 and put it at our farm which is close to bhaipheru on multan rd. the unique feature that makes it ideal for any kind of shooting range is that there is a 25~30 foot tall dirt berm that runs along the length of one side of the land, hence it is very safe for all kinds of shooting, with the baloki link canal on the other side of the berm. While at the moment I have one skeet machine I''m planning to acquire another one and setup an Olympic standard skeet range. The idea of arranging a competition occurred to me because, there aren''t any easy to access avenues for competition in the Lahore area. If we can setup a regular competition with an opportunity for competitors to get recognition, then maybe over time we might uncover people who can shine at the international level. Because at the moment, and please correct me if I''m wrong, there don''t seem to be a lot of places or opportunities where people can display and/or test their shooting abilities. \nAs far as the cost is concerned, if a competitor reaches the 2nd round their cost of entry will be completely covered.', ''),

Can''t say whether this blade is original wostenholm or not or is it japanese or not or a cheap copy of both.\n\nBut in this case I trusted the manufacturers word, as I already had very bad experience with some knives that even had "Made in Spain" on the blades and came with fancy sheaths and there costs were also on the higher side for sure, but when it came to the real test they always failed and failed badly.\n\nBesides I am not a collector that I might be so much worried about the authenticity of the origin of the blade, a knife that looks nice, lasts long, works well is just good for me. And even if its a copy then I must say its not a lousy copy in fact a well built copy.:)\n\nAnd I also came to know from some pakguns sources and some other as well that the manufacturer actually exports knives to the European countries and by that context I believe the manufacturer must be using some fine quality metal for the blades he makes to satisfy his customers.\n\nThirdly I believe that only time can tell the value for money of this knife and if you can suggest any kind of test I am ready to volunteer my knife for that :).\n\nThe price of the knife is a mere Rs 2000.\n\nP.S: This is how I think and I am not trying to impose my opinion on anyone neither am I trying to persuade anyone to certainly get knives made from that same manufacturer its just a point of view.\n\nRegards', ''),

(471061, ' Haven''t read it yet but just got the following email from Francoliono..\n\n\nDear Mr. Abbas Malik:\n \nThanks for at least replying this time. J\n \nI did not have time therefore today saw and read this email in detail.\n \nIn your place as admin, I would not have used these words: &#8220;I''m surprised you''re still at PakGuns as I asked Denovo to ban you&#8221; & then use words &#8220;I have the deepest respect for everyone&#8221;. Both phrases by you do not somehow sync in with each other, and also, reflect a certain arrogance when you say &#8220;as far as who comes on PakGuns and leaves, frankly brother I don''t care.&#8221; You know very well I am an active member here with valid regular contributions at forum, like many other hunters here, who now have left PG because of bad policies conducted by the Senior Mod, your blue eyed boy as known all over, Denovo AND his party. Party consists of whom: we know very well (1 or 2 Mods and hunters both).\n \nFirstly, a forum is because of its ACTIVE MEMBERS and their solid regular contrinbutions/participation, not mere listed members (i.e. 7000 as said). Conflict management is always a department at every company, every forum, every association, whether formal or voluntary like this. There is always a code of conduct through which differences are settled in smooth way, rather than enflaming conflicts (like Denovo and his associates have been doing). They are not sorted out by saying (like your and Sr Mod&#8217;s replies unfortunately suggest): &#8220;How come these conflicts occurred in the first place???&#8221; In such an  informal environment, they do somehow occur due to communication error (sometimes) as well as mischief (like in earlier cases with Mian Shafiq &#8211; Prince&#8217;s friend) or rudeness (e.g. GunFun&#8217;s replies, represented by Denovo).\n \nSecondly, despite being the admin of some voluntary internet group/forum, it is your utmost duty to be fair and impartial rather than listening to one-sided conspiracy or propaganda by your Sr Mod(s), especially those who have certain personal agenda or personal grudges with members. They are not saints, they are just like any other individual, prone to errors of judgement and bias. Respecting ALL members despite being Sr Mods or admin of certain voluntary internet based group like PG, groups which are buzzing all over at internet, is of paramount importance especially in a country like ours where these matters are very sensitive.\nAn important point.. I failed to understand the reason of making a separate thread from posts in Avais&#8217;s thread (basically by Denovo) when all others &#8211; Azam Agha, Soldier, TH78, SajjadKhan, Shukaib Khan &#8211; are seen posting there pics there as well. What is bothering them that all other associates including &#8211; Hunter468, Liano, Avais, Denovo &#8211; have communicated same thing to me only. Reason: unknown, agenda: unknown. Though it makes the slightest difference to me.\n \n[B][U]For your info: [/U][/B]Three applications of guns and their enthusiasts are there &#8211; one is target (paper) shooters only who satisfy their urge for handling guns via paper target (pistol shooters basically), second is hunters who want to go out in field and outdoors and test their application skills with guns (shotguns and rifles basically), and third is combat (military and law enforcement people). Last one is virtually non-existent here at PG, understandably so. The second category of gun enthusiasts is most active at every forum on facebook and many WERE here at PG too earlier. Majority of them have left PG and joined facebook groups/forums such as you have seen everywhere too. A severe criticism also took place at some FB groups because of rude posts by Denovo here at PG about hunters, which you seem NOT to notice till now, and have chosen to blame instead the hunters. Maybe you find it more comfortable/convenient to shift the blame on hunters. Strange as usual? But, a sincere piece of advice to you: Try to be impartial and realize the undercurrents and group domination techniques by Denovo by slowly hushing up others. He is a non hunter, a paper shooter, and he will never understand the issues of hunting and hunters. At FB, the Engr paracha Group and Waterfowlers etc are leading hunters forums currently . But here at PG, people like Denovo (some Khawaja saab), the hunting section Mod,  are target shooters (1[SUP]st[/SUP]category), not hunters, thus many people have suggested earlier also to appoint moderators among hunters such as Avais (a senior a polite gentleman) or Engineer sb, or Kaiser Khan, or anyone with a polite, courteous attitude. Those people can understand more about hunting related matters and hunters, especially the senior (buzurg type) people because with age, maturity & modesty automatically comes, arrogance goes away & by then the person(s) have seen it all in life. The spoon feeding & relying on parents&#8217; money also has gone by that time. Therefore, mature people (hunters) are needed to monitor this important section. Please do not thus say that it is because of hunters&#8217; bickering or cribbing that you had decided to close down the section. Have the heart to listen to honest, straight talk, rather than listening to praises all around, by opportunist people (some Sr Mods). They are fake and an eye wash for you. That is also the feedback of many people who have left your forum, all whom were seniors and very mature. Rememeber the LABAIR incident for instance last year and how it was handled by that jerky Mod (Denovo). See what I posted regarding labairs last time when Denovo went out of his mind and acted reckelessly there, and even Engineeer sb adviced him to be rational and not be arrogant. He even wrote the words &#8220;Troll&#8221; on my page, for nothing. But you did not act then too, like ever&#8230;reason is you are being wrongly advised by the wrong people, they try to mis-quote facts to you to their advantage and brush some real issues/facts under the carpet.\n \nFor instance, please ask 12Gauge again to deny under oath (as I challenge him)&#8230; Did he not convey that fact to me on phone, that Denovo especially and (&#8220;them&#8221;) are NOT deleting the reported / objectionable posts deliberately because &#8220;they/Denovo&#8221; want them to keep them there &#8230;.and probably keep flames burning and conflicts emerging dirtier till Mr. Abbas Malik sahib is reported: Look these hunters are the people creating mess, especially with whom they have grudges already.\n \nAs I stated in previouis email, you can ask Hunter1, Prince, Tiger Roars all three about the sms&#8217;s sent to them from Denovo. His messages have always been to make the flames burn more and more. That&#8217;s what he had been telling me on phone as well against Prince. So I don&#8217;t have a doubt about that. You may still keep believing what you WANT to believe about him, however. But do try to analyse whats the inner problem rather than blaming on 30+ hunters as being fed to you by those opportunists who want to retain the Mod seat at any cost, even at the cost of the forum, all of whom I know are very mature in mind and approach, as well as humble & modest.\n \nHoping for you to understand the inner dynamics of association.\n \nThanking you.\n \nRegards.\n \nFrancolino', ''),

There would be another Form for police verification. If you can get it done by yourself, it will save your time because through official channels it took a lot of time. I believe someone in arms branch may guide you the whole procedure, just visit them and discuss everything. Retainer column probably does not apply you. And if you intends to retain your weapon with who travels with you and to whom you can trust e.g. your bodyguard or driver, fill in his details in the retainer column.

(471087, 'Need feedback to setup a Skeet Shooting competition in lahore Hey guys, first time poster here...with so many experienced and avid shooting fans, kkhan8 directed me to post my question in this forum. \n\nThe plan is to hold a skeet shooting competition, with a minimum of 64 participants. The entry fee for the competition will be Rs. 10,000. The cost will include the price of cartridges(choice of #8 or #9 shot).\n\nNow for those who are still reading and have not run away after hearing the cost...The competition will have 16 groups of 4 competitors in the first round, with one competitor moving forward from each group. In the second round there will be 8 1on1 matches. Then 4 1on1 matches in the quarters. Then 2 in the semis and then the final. \nEach round will consist of 75 skeets. If its a draw, then the first shooter to miss will lose. The configuration of the shooting range is 8 station olympic standard. The location of the range is about 40 minutes from Thokar on multan road. \n\nMy humble question is, can we get at least 64 people who would be interested in this sort of thing. If we can pull this off, we could turn it into a regular thing. Maybe also help promote the sport in this country, because if we keep on waiting for the official national relevant authority to help promote this sport then its not happening, we have to take matters in our own hands. If indians can do well in the olympics i dont think there''s any reason we cant. \nThe asian games were swept by arabs in the trap games, it was depressing. \nWhile I wish I could do this on my own, or half the entry fee. I need to cover some costs. Even then, if you calculate the cost of 75 cartridges and skeets I dont think its a bad deal. \nYour valuable feedback will be very welcome. \n\nregards\narbab', ''),

I am not advocating this specific knife manufacturer but wrote all in response to above post which gives an impression that Sialkot industry is like Darra ;) in Sialkot we have all designing, development, testing facilities for what we manufacture, we dont make copies we develop & produce our own products.[/QUOTE]\n\nyes i understand and agree with you brother that in sialkot we do indeed make some of the best sporting eqipment in the world, no doubt. for this field, we have the best materials available and craftsmen too-i have been there and visited some factories and it''s amazing what they do they there. but the knife shown has a name on it that it shouldn''t have on it-why? because no1 why use and print someone else''s name on your own item and no2 why not put your own name on it especially if you know your buyer is a pakistani! i can tell you brother that it''s a known fact that all the cheaper blades in all knife types these days are being made in china or  some in taiwan and NOT pakistan. sports stuff is one thing as materials involved are here in pakistan, firearms we are behind more than anything as we don''t have the same quality barrels and other parts due to less quality metal, and, knives here can be made very sharp but that doesn''t shoe the quality is good brother-for example, the shaving blades in pakistan are very sharp but they don''t last very long at all! surgical instrument area is a different story all together in my opinion.', ''),

If above mentioned are not sufficient then kindly give me an idea as to how many would be?\n\n2) Does it requires a lot of practice to make the calling effective? or one becomes a duck out of the box?:)\n\n3) Qaiser Sahab mentioned about rabbit calls, and before reading his post I was wondering if Black Partridge calls are available?\n\n4) Do calls also work for coots or coots are bad listeners?\n\n5) What brand and make of calls would be a good value for money?

You do care for replying sometimes. Great action by you this time. But, I would advice you to open your eyes and look around too, this time thinking with your mind....who and which people are working on which agenda here. For example a few months back, I sent an sms to 12 Gauge about the bashing by Denovo and Avais in which Prince was called "a child with inferiority complex". The two were as usual colluding and posting here against a person. My objective in conveying that to 12Gauge was to info him about fighting with Mod and Avais by Prince as at that time, Prince was at loggerheads with all here including me. Later on, Prince and I mended our differences over miscommunication at forum(s) at Eid ul Fitr, which has not been received well by the so called Senior Mod (Denovo) and his team as of currently ;), and that has been irching them even more. Then a moment after I had sent above message to 12Gauge, after a moment suddenly Avais called me to post someting against Prince. When I was about to post something, a post had already been put there by Denovo saying anyone who posts against someone will be banned. The scheme was obvious to me :) hahaha. Petty minded individuals some people are and they in this case have just one single agenda - to attain seat of the hunting section mod - irrespective of fact that majority of members relating to hunting have left or do not post here. After that I called Avais and excused myself to post as against his discreet instructions. Anyways they know fully well that you have turned a blind eye to such deeper issues, and on the surface, what they portray to you, you are going to believe them. Thats the exact point (rather weakness of the admin) they are using in their favor. But, keep it going man till it ruins your forum, and then your eyes will be opened. Currently, the environment around you is hazy in your vision, with a lot of buttering that you seem to prefer and enjoy. After all, the Mughals were also fond of such shallow praises till the dynasty met its end through bad advisers and opportunists.[/FONT][/COLOR]\n[COLOR=#000000][FONT=Tahoma] [/FONT][/COLOR]\n[COLOR=#000000][FONT=Tahoma]Their agenda - to attain sort of a hegemony here and invite members to their kabootar (pigeon) shoots :) and ask for favors in return. So, the objective of your home-like atmosphere is very clear to us brother. Do not bother to remind us that its a home. In a home, everybody is EQUALLY respected, and there is no politics of power or seat or hegemony. And a good home thrives on a fair and rational minded head of household, not a head who is slave to his Moderators'' whims and conspiracies. As I requested you humbly, please bear with me an honest and straight forward talk. You are much younger than we are and I do not think your exposure is as much as our associates and us. It will take time for you to realize. [/FONT][/COLOR]\n[COLOR=#000000][FONT=Tahoma] [/FONT][/COLOR]\n[COLOR=#000000][FONT=Tahoma]Regarding two other members, Jillanik and HaroonNazir (both hunters), pls see your database and ask yourself what did they do that they were banned. Former just advertised unknowingly a pair of shoes here and was banned and latter objected to Ahmed Sultan''s quail shoots naiively. Instead of addressing such small issues maturely, you or immature hunting Mod team, tried to sort such issues by swinging the axe. As I said, maturity will come with age, and after facing tough realities and spikes of life. Humility and maturity does not set in by surviving on parents spoon feeding or their money. Secondly, there are tons of others who did not do anything here like Gunner, Sajjad Khan, Superustaji etc. Latter three are humble people from Hazara where Labair is abundant and open since decades. Your team banned them just because of a silly misunderstood labair issue. Reason was those hunting Mods are paper shooters, not hunters, so they could not grasp the hunting circle people, their minds, their passion and the laws/legalities. Whatever Avais Habib Khan advices that Senior Mod, he does it. Isn''t everything obvious? We are no fools brother. But the Senior Mod (Denovo) has communicated to hunters including me, through Avais, that it is you who does all that moderation and that they are just pawns in the hands of Mr. Abbas Malik Saab. Another advice bro - CLEAN UP YOUR OWN HOUSE which you claim artificially is "A House".

The plan is Olympic skeet at the moment...as so far it is a figment of imagination we could come up with any number of variations on it. The main idea is to get people to compete and not really turn a profit.\n2. Target speed i''m not really sure of...but the original idea was to replicate whatever the olympic skeet speed is.\n3. Date would be about 2 to 3 months from whenever we get 64 people together. It would be enoug time to turn a rough area we use for personal shooting to an area fit for competition.\n4. Didnt think that far ahead, but you are right will need officials or referees for this. I''m sure services of people with relevant officiating experience can be hired for the days of the competition.\n5.each round is going to be 75 shots. Hence my point that people who reach the 2nd round will already have fired more shots and used more skeets than the 10k entry fee.\n6. Generator and batteries are going to be a non issue.

That''s a total of 64+16+8+4+2 = 94 rounds.\ninstead of 1000 I used 1050 per 25 cartridges the skeet price is the same as yours. \nSo that comes out to 94 rounds x 75 shots/round (cartridge+skeet) = total 7050 shots\n7050 shots x (42 cartridge + 20 skeet) = 437,100 I also added about 5% on top of that to cover wastage, such as broken skeet or misfires...so that is an extra 21,855. So the total comes out to about 459,000. \nThat leaves 640,000 - 459,000 = 181,000 \nthat will be used for preparing the range, maybe do some minor construction e.g build high house and low house, harden the 8 shooting stations with concrete,  generator fuel...buying spares for skeet machines, after all if a skeet machine is to handle 3500 skeet in one or two days... You have to keep spares on hand so a malfunction wont stop the competition, off the top of my head I can think of maybe an extra throwing arm, just in case...at least a few extra springs as my previous experience has shown that the spring loses its tension after about a thousand throws. Batteries, will also need to acquire a PA system...refreshments, seating arrangements, hiring some day labor for help.

I, then, asked him for how much would they make a license for me and he again said ''we dont make licenses without reference''; felt like I had entered his house rather than his shop that he was asking for so many references or as if I was asking for illegal arms (grenades etc) that he was asking for references; such an ass.\n\nAvoid![/QUOTE]\n\nYou are right bro! the same is very rude and have not good behaviour also seems like (khaaey kamaey hue), once i went there and asked for Sig P250, you know how he replied just "NO" with bad expressions and got busy on phone.

(471540, ' [QUOTE=bullahdabarda;309553]Dear mian sb, I calculated the cost as follows...\nthe first round will have 64 contenders...the 2nd round will have 16, then 8, then 4 and then 2... That''s a total of 64+16+8+4+2 = 94 rounds.\ninstead of 1000 I used 1050 per 25 cartridges the skeet price is the same as yours. \nSo that comes out to 94 rounds x 75 shots/round (cartridge+skeet) = total 7050 shots\n7050 shots x (42 cartridge + 20 skeet) = 437,100 I also added about 5% on top of that to cover wastage, such as broken skeet or misfires...so that is an extra 21,855. So the total comes out to about 459,000. \nThat leaves 640,000 - 459,000 = 181,000 \nthat will be used for preparing the range, maybe do some minor construction e.g build high house and low house, harden the 8 shooting stations with concrete,  generator fuel...buying spares for skeet machines, after all if a skeet machine is to handle 3500 skeet in one or two days... You have to keep spares on hand so a malfunction wont stop the competition, off the top of my head I can think of maybe an extra throwing arm, just in case...at least a few extra springs as my previous experience has shown that the spring loses its tension after about a thousand throws. Batteries, will also need to acquire a PA system...refreshments, seating arrangements, hiring some day labor for help. You also mentioned referrees...will probably have to pay a couple to officiate.\nthere you have it...that''s the plan...of course for all this to happen I still need to buy a 2nd machine. :-)[/QUOTE]\n\n\n Thanks for the elaborated clarification about calculations.We have to wait and see how the CLAY enthusiast will\n react to this.\n\n[QUOTE=bullahdabarda;309590]Dear mian sb...I just figured out that according to the Olympic skeet regulations the trap must not throw the skeet more than 67m and not less than 65m.[/QUOTE]\n\n That''s right Target falling zone should be between 65 and 67 meters in olympic SKEET,however it is being\n vigirously discussed at ISSF headquarters to increase the distance upto 69-meters and ABOLISH station No-8\n so,TWO SHOTS (High and Low) will each be added on station No 3&5.Any how it will be implemented later this year.\n\n Now the main concern for all the participants would be that,in current scenario you have only one machine and \n an in-complete layout,so HOW WOULD YOU OFFER PRACTICE SESSIONS FOR OLYMPIC SKEET,UNLESS YOU IMPORT\n SECOND TRAP AND GET READY WITH TRAP HOUSES AND SHOOTING STATIONS?.\n\n So, in other words all the participants must pay(First) and WAIT for the range to get FULLY READY for practice\n and actual competition.', ''),

That&#8217;s deep)[/B]. You either blow its head off or sever all major limbs along with its primary biting organ. I know it&#8217;s a gruesome end but totally justifiable when you consider what this thing is capable of doing even with extremely limited intelligence. Okie! You can chop off its genital organs too and take away its chances of reproduction as well but isn''t that a bit excessive/harsh? I mean the poor thing is going to get hacked up anyways.  \r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i998.photobucket.com/albums/af103/12gauge-pakguns/DSA%20Pump%20Action%20Shotgun%20Slug/Zombie_Attack_by_namesjames.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\nBack to the lecture at hand, perfection is perfected, so I am a let &#8216;em understand (Snoop Doggy Dogg): what would I do in terms of personal protection and the ability to feed my family and myself. What would be the most critical tool for the job? \r\n\r\nAmong many things; I would need a reliable firearm with high hit probability, hell and back sort reliability, ability to continue functioning with nothing more than my own spit as a lubricant and bomb proof durability.\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i998.photobucket.com/albums/af103/12gauge-pakguns/DSA%20Pump%20Action%20Shotgun%20Slug/corpse.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\nThats right, when it comes to delivering post-terminal payloads to a rotting zombie corpse, the power factor of a compact 12 gauge cannot be overlooked. Also, the sheer ubiquity of 12-gauge ammo means that even if your ammo supply comes from scouring wrecked houses for loose shells that may have been spilled in the first wave of the zombie outbreak, whatever you find, you''ll be able to use.\r\n\r\nSo&#8230;..that settles it. Its going to be a compact pump action shotgun. however cannot make use of an existing shotgun and upgrade/modify it to fulfill my requirements. It has to be a ground up design as the uniqueness of the circumstances/challenge (The Dead Walk!) call for a specialized pump action shotgun.\r\n\r\n[B]My requirements for a Zombie de-Animator Machine:[/B]\r\n\r\n1. 18inch barreled pump action shotgun with specialized barrel bore to ensure a consistent pattern of 6 to 8 inches from 5 yards to 15 yards.\r\n\r\n2. 20 inch special purpose barrel for slugs with ability to accurately fire slugs at 50 yards as I might need to harvest meat.\r\n\r\n3. Loose tolerances (beyond standard) to ensure reliable operation with a multitude of payloads.\r\n\r\n4. Combat platform as I would rather use a combat shotgun for hunting instead of using a hunting shotgun for combat.\r\n\r\n5. Smooth as silk cycling ability to ensure hit repeatability. I am talking minimum effort to cycle the action so that the shotgun remains on target while I am racking the forend.', ''),

(471570, ' With this I contacted DSA Peshawar where Mr. Mohammad Daud, a young and energetic mechanical engineer, was kind enough to accept my request to solicit DSA&#8217;s services and expertise to make this shotgun. We discussed (in more than one sitting and several telephone conversations over time) various design possibilities then we went for a couple of viable solutions.\r\n\r\nAfter making several barrels (and subsequently testing) with different bore diameters and various choke constrictions along with different sight setups, we ended up making the right barrel set for the job. I am not going to go into numbers but both barrels are &#8220;never been attempted before&#8221; custom designs with custom cylinder bore measurements to choke designs.

It means that it is produced to military specifications which emphasize generous tolerance, durability and dependability. The said shotgun is designed to be one of a versatile shotgun with interchangeable barrels that allows the owner to change from Zombie exterminating shotgun (and HD) to deer hunting without having the need to buy a half dozen guns.\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i998.photobucket.com/albums/af103/12gauge-pakguns/DSA%20Pump%20Action%20Shotgun%20Slug/DSAZARS3.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\nDSA ZARS is a manually operated pump action smoothbore. The bolt carrier is operated via two action bars, chamber locking is achieved via tilting breechblock bolt into the barrel extension. The safety is located at the tang of the receiver and is fully ambidextrous. The receiver is made from aircraft grade aluminum alloy and the 4140 cr-moly steel barrels are fully interchangeable by hand without tools.\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i998.photobucket.com/albums/af103/12gauge-pakguns/DSA%20Pump%20Action%20Shotgun%20Slug/DSAZARS4.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\nOne of the main tactical advantages of DSA ZARS is the position of the shell lifter. When considering a shotgun for home defense, the position of the shell lifter or cartridge elevator can make a big difference in your ability to perform a tactical reload if necessary.\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i998.photobucket.com/albums/af103/12gauge-pakguns/DSA%20Pump%20Action%20Shotgun%20Slug/DSAZARS12.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\nDSA ZARS shell lifter stays in the up position until the slide is fully retracted. This can be a distinct advantage for you if a tactical reload is required. you can load shells much easier in your shotgun during a reload. If you have a shotgun in which the shell lifter stays down during the process of loading, you could experience a problem that your thumb can get stuck between the end of the shell lifter and the magazine tube.\r\n\r\nBefore we head to the range related review, kindly allow me to share some closeups of this shot spitting beast. I hope that the images are self explanatory.\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i998.photobucket.com/albums/af103/12gauge-pakguns/DSA%20Pump%20Action%20Shotgun%20Slug/DSAZARS3.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i998.photobucket.com/albums/af103/12gauge-pakguns/DSA%20Pump%20Action%20Shotgun%20Slug/DSAZARS5.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i998.photobucket.com/albums/af103/12gauge-pakguns/DSA%20Pump%20Action%20Shotgun%20Slug/DSAZARS6.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i998.photobucket.com/albums/af103/12gauge-pakguns/DSA%20Pump%20Action%20Shotgun%20Slug/DSAZARS7.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i998.photobucket.com/albums/af103/12gauge-pakguns/DSA%20Pump%20Action%20Shotgun%20Slug/DSAZARS8.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i998.photobucket.com/albums/af103/12gauge-pakguns/DSA%20Pump%20Action%20Shotgun%20Slug/DSAZARS13.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i998.photobucket.com/albums/af103/12gauge-pakguns/DSA%20Pump%20Action%20Shotgun%20Slug/DSAZARS14.jpg[/IMG]', ''),

With no Zombie in sight, I had to test it on conventional bullseye target at various distances. First I tested the slug barrel and was astounded by the accuracy I was getting at range under 50 yards. Beyond the 50 yard mark, I was struggling to see the target as it totally vanished behind the front sight. May be with a better sighting setup such as a rifle scope I can extend the &#8220;reasonable accuracy&#8221; range 75-100 yards. However since my requirement was 50 yards, I am a happy camper.\r\n\r\n[B]Here are the results:[/B]\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i998.photobucket.com/albums/af103/12gauge-pakguns/DSA%20Pump%20Action%20Shotgun%20Slug/06102012943.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\nFiring the shotgun at 50 yards range. you can see that the 6inch standard bulleye target looks like a little black dot. used a pillow as a rifle rest to steady the weapon.\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i998.photobucket.com/albums/af103/12gauge-pakguns/DSA%20Pump%20Action%20Shotgun%20Slug/06102012934.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i998.photobucket.com/albums/af103/12gauge-pakguns/DSA%20Pump%20Action%20Shotgun%20Slug/06102012935.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i998.photobucket.com/albums/af103/12gauge-pakguns/DSA%20Pump%20Action%20Shotgun%20Slug/06102012936.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\nnothing much to say here except wow! thats phenomenal accuracy out of a smooth bore shotgun with slugs. I am truly impressed. other than the barrel itself, some of the reasons for this accuracy is the re-worked trigger by DSA and exceptional quality of rifle sights. one can see multiple groups as I was adjusting the sights as well after making each group. the objective was to bring group somewhere in the middle of the bullseye. gave up zeroing the sights as I was running out of slugs and quiet frankly, my shoulder was not in a position to take anymore beating for the day.\r\n\r\n[URL=http://s998.photobucket.com/albums/af103/12gauge-pakguns/DSA%20Pump%20Action%20Shotgun%20Slug/?action=view&current=Target.mp4][IMG]http://i998.photobucket.com/albums/af103/12gauge-pakguns/DSA%20Pump%20Action%20Shotgun%20Slug/th_Target.jpg[/IMG][/URL]\r\n\r\nThen I changed the barrel, moved to 10 yards and fired a couple of SG/LG rounds on the same target paper. all pellets landed within the 6-8 inch bulls-eye. awesome! thats a video of me firing 4 SG/LG rounds. kindly notice the low recoil that I am experiencing due the different barrel, choke and forcing cone profile. also notice the ease in cycling. this thing practically cycles itself, thanks to generous tolerances and action work to make it more smoother in cycling.

I have blurred the rest of the target to show only the pattern made by SG/LG rounds.\r\n\r\nSince I was having fun with this Zombie Eliminator, I just had to fire a couple more slugs just to see what this shotgun is capable of.

Due to this very reason Pakguns does not assume any responsibility of any such gathering.\n\n3-	 A novice having no practice would feel  discouraged / dejected and may not continue if directly thrown in the competition.\n\nI would be in for membership or any form of contribution if it will become source of learning and sport in a safe manner.

Just like you I am only interested in skeet.\n\nI also have a baikal o/u...and absolutely love it...it has fired close to 900 shaheen cartridges without a single misfire or dud (knock on wood). And it has been abused, a lot, guests have dipped the muzzle in talcum powder dirt...I love the fact that it can take so much abuse and keep on truckin''. and the extra weight is perfect for skeet, i.e, the recoil from the 1st shot wont disorient you for the 2nd shot. Its like the ak47 of shotguns, it''ll keep firing no matter what. \n\n1. It would be absolutely swell if experienced skeet shooters could take the time out for instruction.\n\n2. An excellent point...there is nothing if there is no safety, the SOP for competitions usually entails signing a liability waiver, and Mian Sb has an excellent suggestion about getting independent officials, and they will not only oversee the scoring but also ensure that everyone follows rules and regulations.\n\n3. The whole point of this sort of thing is to give absolute novices, who do not have access to a skeet machine, an opportunity to try out skeet shooting and it is my guess that majority of the people who participate will be novices...And some pressure during friendly competition is actually good in my view. Also, If we get the requisite number of participants, setting up practice sessions will not be a problem.\n\nThe hope is to continue doing this repeatedly so that, absolute novices become mediocre skeet shooters, then after a few more tournaments become good shooters and eventually become master skeet shooters, and then maybe one or two out of the lot, will rise to compete at the national and then international level.

(471792, ' But if this is the only "line" of law that has to be taken as the last word for P.B or NPB then I believe even .50BMG, AK can be announced NPB or atleast .44 can certainly be, which until sometime back could be purchased on the same sindh license but then atleast the DCO of my home district issued orders to stop the sale of .44 on this particular license.\n\nBut as Skeeter Sir rightly said that the caliber has got nothing to do with PB or NPB but its the nature of weapon that matters.\n\nBut then one can debate that if even .44 semi auto is not allowed on the license, which part of it makes it PB? the caliber or the nature? If Caliber, then we know caliber has nothing to do with the PB thing and if nature then one can say why are .22lr Semi-autos not PB?\n\nHence on this point I believe there is a lot of ambiguity in the law, as it should be clearly mentioned and explained for a layman like me to understand properly which things fall under PB and which don''t, as not everyone will go through long books of gun laws.\n\nI however once asked a dealer in Hyd if I could acquire a .223 bolt action, he flatly refused that he can''t.\n\nRegards', ''),

They were manufactured under the same roof in China for both Leapers/UTG and Crosman (CenterPoint). Some 3-4 months back Leapers (or their contractors in China) have stopped making CenterPoint scopes for Crosman. So the CP scopes in the times to come will look different from Leapers.\n\nFollowing in an excerpt from Tom Gaylord''s (a.k.a B.B Pelletier) post:\n\n"As most of you regular readers know, Leapers imports all their optics from various plants in Asia &#8212; mainly from China and Taiwan. They have very strong associations with those plants, so the products are made to Leapers&#8217; specifications, and not just bought from a generic list the way some optics are. And you also know that Leapers owns the UTG brand name that stands for Under The Gun, which is another large grouping of scopes and optics.\n\nUntil recently, Leapers also made all the CenterPoint scopes for Crosman. That association has ended, so in the future the CenterPoint scopes will look different from the Leapers scopes, and they will probably have different features".', ''),

(472255, ' Salam All,\r\n@isk bro, hope you''re well..... sorry to hear about your problem. You need to be a little more specific. First, if you notice when you slowly pull back the slide, the barrel follows the slide for a few mm''s and then drops. The slide then continues rearward while the barrel stays in line with the magazine. Now, can you tell me, when you say the slide jams a little bit in the end of the cycle, does it get a little gritty when the slide repicks the barrel?\r\n\r\nAlso, you are facing a nosedive, i.e the bullet gets partially into the chamber, but just jams. This can be due to a number of reasons. \r\n\r\n1. Please check the chamber of the barrel for any rough spots or defects.\r\n2. Please check whether the problem is with one or both of the magazines. There might be an issue with the lips of the mags.\r\n3. There can be an issue of the recoil spring, which would also explain the grittiness of the lockup at the end of the loading cycle.\r\n\r\nMost probably it is one of the above issues. If not, well then there might be a slight offset in the barrel lugs(on top of the barrel right after the chamber) and the slide lugs(on the inside of the slide right in front of the ejection port.\r\n\r\nPlease try to diagnose the issue, then it can be corrected by going to a good gunsmith.\r\n\r\nHope this helps.\r\n\r\nRegards.', ''),

As it was dripping with the oil I said  to myself maybe I have over done it so I bloated the oil with a cloth  and kept it in storage\n\nOn my second session the gun failed to  feed twice or thrice with action stuck open you could see the bullet is  trying to go in the chamber but it cant, on racking it would eject and  the second round would be ready to fire. After the session I thought may  be I need to lubricate it and sprayed brunox everywhere and bloating  was not such a good idea\n\nNow in the 3rd session especially on every 5th round the  action would remain half open half close with bullet being visible and  on racking the bullet would eject. So I opened and cleaned the weapon after which nine  rounds fired without any  event. \n\nIs something wrong with my weapon, does it still need  time to smooth out ( I have fired about 300 rounds), something wrong in  cleaning or lubrication.[/QUOTE]\n\nI think the ftf you are facing is the same as i faced in my sarsilmaz cm9.

But after seeing the results of all the work I am really feeling inclined to start gathering the stuff. But first of all I really have maybe some stupid questions to ask, so please guide me and bear with me\r\n\r\n1) How many callers do you exactly need, I mean can one call and a 5-8 decoys do the job if I intend to hunt alone? If above mentioned are not sufficient then kindly give me an idea as to how many would be?\r\n\r\n2) Does it requires a lot of practice to make the calling effective? or one becomes a duck out of the box?\r\n\r\n3) Qaiser Sahab mentioned about rabbit calls, and before reading his post I was wondering if Black Partridge calls are available?\r\n\r\n4) Do calls also work for coots or coots are bad listeners?\r\n\r\n5) What brand and make of calls would be a good value for money?

(472424, ' No worries brother you will always find your answers on pakguns. I will try to guide you as per my knowledge about duck hunting.\n\nfirst of all brother duck hunting is always a team work as it includes lots of risks so its always better to go for duck hunting with a team, so I suggest that you should go for duck hunting with a hunter that knows about duck hunting, it will help you start getting knowledge about duck hunting. Well If you ask me about the quantity of decoys then I would say 30 would be more then enough but not less then a dozen decoys, it helps attract the ducks into your hide. I always carry 30 decoys with me. \n\nDuck calling defiantly needs lots of practice. But you can start practicing it, it''s not that hard. There are many different types of duck calls available in the market but the real thing is to blow them. So any duck call would do if you are a good blower. Also you need to recognise the specie of duck before you blow the call as some ducks get afraid with the wrong calling and don''t land in your decoys. For example pintail and teals whistle they don''t quack \n\ndont have any idea about rabbit or partridge calls and not even coots\n\nso as you have pintails in your area you need a duck call with the whistling sound', ''),

I can be quiet overbearing. Ask DSA, I am sure they would agree. :)\r\n\r\nwith DSA ZARS, my objective was simply to raise the bar one step higher and design a dedicated Zombie Gun in a bid to create the ultimate HD/SD shotgun for extreme circumstances and to satisfy my thirst of knowledge and experimentation.\r\n\r\nanyways, I have requested Mr. Mohammed Daud to personally step in this matter and give it a serious thought of making this product commercially available. He has assured that he will consult with his finance department to work out the price of ZARS along with the price\r\nof all spare parts. one must understand that ZARS is supplied with barrels that have special bore profiles totally different from their regular production shotguns. secondly, almost all parts are hand finished in the end before assembly to increase reliability and the trigger mechanism is re-worked to get the most slug accuracy out of a smoothbore shotgun. \r\n\r\nPrices: DSA Sluggster is available at 30,000 whereas the price of ZARS is yet to be finalized however I have been told by DSA to expect a price tag to be somewhere in the vicinity of 35K - 37K.\r\n\r\nfor this prototype, The adjustable sights were custom ordered from LPA Italy therefore DSA is considering making it a regular thing with LPA as well. so... lets wait a little and see where the price point lands once the price of adjustable sights is determined.\r\n\r\nA little explanation of the two models:\r\n\r\n[B]DSA Sluggster:[/B]\r\n\r\n5+1 shot Pump action shotgun with a 20 inch smoothbore barrel designed to fire slugs with reasonable accuracy.\r\n\r\n[B]DSA ZARS:[/B]\r\n\r\n5+1 shot Pump action shotgun with a 20 inch smoothbore barrel designed to fire slugs with reasonable accuracy and an 18 inch barrel for HD/SD purposes. as for barrels, both are brand new concepts with longer forcing cones, gentle choke tapper, longer tapper length and for include a generous parallel section for increased pattern performance.\r\n\r\nRegards.', ''),

(472443, ' [QUOTE=12GAUGE;310627][B]AoA Everybody[/B]\n\nThanks guys, I really appreciate the kind words. and......about the price: its priceless! ;)\n\nDSA ZARS is a further evolution of Daudsons Armoury''s Sluggster shotgun which will be their dedicated offering for slug shooting.\n\nas for ZARS, it is still in prototype phase. it was created on experimental basis and this was a first-off custom built for testing. however that does not mean that it cannot be made commercially available. if the demand is there, I am sure DSA would be more than happy to oblige.\n\nwith ZARS, DSA went over the top to surpass all previous manufacturing benchmarks as the objective was to see how much they can push themselves in terms of innovation, quality and stamina/patience to bear my constant nagging. I can be quiet overbearing. Ask DSA, I am sure they would agree. :)\n\nwith DSA ZARS, my objective was simply to raise the bar one step higher and design a dedicated Zombie Gun in a bid to create the ultimate HD/SD shotgun for extreme circumstances and to satisfy my thirst of knowledge and experimentation.\n\nanyways, I have requested Mr. Mohammed Daud to personally step in this matter and give it a serious thought of making this product commercially available. He has assured that he will consult with his finance department to work out the price of ZARS along with the price\nof all spare parts. one must understand that ZARS is supplied with barrels that have special bore profiles totally different from their regular production shotguns. secondly, almost all parts are hand finished in the end before assembly to increase reliability and the trigger mechanism is re-worked to get the most slug accuracy out of a smoothbore shotgun. \n\nPrices: DSA Sluggster is available at 30,000 whereas the price of ZARS is yet to be finalized however I have been told by DSA to expect a price tag to be somewhere in the vicinity of 35K - 37K.\n\nfor this prototype, The adjustable sights were custom ordered from LPA Italy therefore DSA is considering making it a regular thing with LPA as well. so... lets wait a little and see where the price point lands once the price of adjustable sights is determined.\n\nA little explanation of the two models:\n\n[B]DSA Sluggster:[/B]\n\n5+1 shot Pump action shotgun with a 20 inch smoothbore barrel designed to fire slugs with reasonable accuracy.\n\n[B]DSA ZARS:[/B]\n\n5+1 shot Pump action shotgun with a 20 inch smoothbore barrel designed to fire slugs with reasonable accuracy and an 18 inch barrel for HD/SD purposes. as for barrels, both are brand new concepts with longer forcing cones, gentle choke tapper, longer tapper length and for include a generous parallel section for increased pattern performance.\n\nRegards.[/QUOTE]\n\nthats a very detailed reply bro, but u missed my question. is there a chance of getting a 28" barrel for hunting with it? that would make it a complete package for those who want to down everything from zombies to small game with just one shotgun ??', ''),

If, for example, you''re using a "light" ammo (like PoF Mk1Z or S&B 115 gr) then the "recoil force" generated may not be enough to for the recoil spring to cycle the slide properly. If so, try using "hotter" ammo like Chinese Redbox.\n\nI personally experienced this at the range this Sunday; a friend had brought an NIB 1911 with a very light recoil spring. While using Redbox, the slide cycled flawlessly. But when we switched to S&B 115 gr, I could actually see the slide come back, stop for a second, and then go back into battery.

I think if we even get 64 willing participants...probably more than half would have zero experience of this...Having said that...I''ve had people over that have never shot skeet...even they got 1 or 2 out of 5. My brother in law''s wife had never fired a shotgun before and she got 2 out of 2. Its not that tough. And believe me...if we go through with this...you''ll get plenty of opportunity to practice before we get to the competition. The beauty of skeet shooting is that you can tailor it to be easy or hard to shoot. You can adjust throwing speeds, to make it fly quicker or slower...\nThe whole point of this is...that there are probably a lot of people who own shot guns and they''re just lying there...and there arent very many opportunities to shoot or even improve your aim.

(472677, ' This Details I Copied from  Web\n\nREVIEW\n\n\nThe CF 98, also known as NP 42, is the most recent development of the Chinese state arms factories, and, apparently, it is now adopted by the PLA (Chinese people''s Liberation Army) forces. QSZ-92 (Chinese Nomenclature) pistol is available in two versions, with the only difference being caliber: one is chambered for most common 9x19mm Luger / Parabellum ammunition (QSZ-92-9), and another is chambered for proprietary 5.8mm ammunition with bottle-necked case and pointed bullets (QSZ-92-5.8). The development of the QSZ-92 pistol apparently began in 1994, and it is in limited service with PLA since the late 1990s.\n\n[B][U]Technical Specs[/U][/B]\n\n[B]Manufacturer[/B] Norinco’s ChangFeng Machine Shop\n[B]Variants[/B] QSZ92/NP42/CF98\n[B]Weight[/B] 760 g\n[B]Length[/B] 190 mm (7.48 in)\n[B]Barrel length[/B] 111 mm (4.33 in)\n[B]Width[/B] 35 mm\n[B]Height[/B] 135 mm\n[B]Cal[/B] QSZ92 - 5.8x21mm DAP92\nCF98/NP42 - 9x19mm Parabellum\n[B]Action[/B] Short recoil, locked breech, rotating barrel lock\n[B]Muzzle velocity[/B] 350 m/s (1,148 ft/s) (9x19mm Parabellum)\n[B]Magazine[/B] 15 (9mm) or 20 (5.8mm) box magazine\n[B]Sights[/B] Fixed, 3-dot type\n[B]Packing[/B]\nThe CF98 comes sealed in a plastic bag put in a nice plastic carry box. The box, other than the handgun, contains one extra magazine, one cleaning rod cum needle tool, an instructional manual (in Chinglish) and a pack of spares consisting the following:\n- Firing pin safety\n- Extractor pin safety\n- Indication rod\n- Trigger hammer pin\n- Hammer spring pin\n- Trigger spring\nThe instructional manual has been translated directly from Chinese Language to English (probably using some kind of software) but has lot of mistakes, mainly grammar and use of the right word at the right place. Not an easy manual to go through, but still a good reference.\n\n[B]Finish, Looks & Manufacturing Quality[/B]\nI think one picture says a thousand words! Polymer frame, phosphate finished slide, accessory rail, overall a nice looking handgun.\n \nAs the CF98 was initially intended for Military/LEA use, the quality of the manufacturing is as you’d expect of a standard issue firearm. Its not so flashy that you instantly fall in love with it. The polymer frame finish is very good, but on the metal parts you’ll see some roughness. Also the external finish is great but internally machining marks are visible.\n \n[B]Slide, Frame & Grip[/B]\nAs the CF98 has a polymer frame, so metal inserts are used for slide fitment. Even then the slide to frame fit is not that impressive. It has a bullet in chamber indicator on the extractor just adjacent to the ejection port on the slide. Although CF98 is not a very small handgun, but the grips are perfect for a person with small hands like me! It fits quite comfortable in my hands and feels good.\n \n[B]Action & Barrel[/B]\nThe CF98 is a short recoil operated handgun with a rotating barrel type breach locking system. Although it has a double stack double feeding magazine, but the barrel chamber lacks the double feed ramp (like that provided in Baikal Viking MP446). Instead, the feed ramp is provided as a separate piece, just below the barrel chamber. Now, for everything to go smooth, the chamber and the feed ramp must align perfectly for each round to feed properly. Even the slightest misalignment will result in a stoppage or FTFeed. The rotating barrel locking system is very tricky to manufacture, and that is where I think the QC jumps in. In my opinion every CF98, will perform somewhat different because of this aspect!\nIn action and Barrel I rate the CF98 to be\n \n[B]Trigger[/B]\nThe trigger is a Double Action/ Single Action type. Its normal pull as around 3 lbs, but I’ve felt it gradually decreases with use. I’ve fired around 1000 rounds from my CF98 and the trigger has become very light, almost equivalent to an Airgun’s trigger! Also there are reports about the failure of trigger spring somewhere around when 1500 to 2000 rounds have been fired. Not a very desirable thing. However, an extra trigger spring is provided with a new CF98. In DA mode the trigger becomes a complete POS. Call me paranoid, but somehow when I use it in DA mode, I feel that the trigger or its spring will break.\n\n[B]Balance and Recoil[/B]\nA fairly balanced handgun with low recoil. The reason for the low recoil is the recoil buffer spring introduced in models of 2008 onwards. Due to this, the recoil is reduced considerably, making follow up shots much easier to achieve.\n \n[B]Sights[/B]\nSights are factory zeroed and are normal 3 dot glow in the dark type, making them quite clear in dim light conditions. The sight radius is 5 7/8 inch, and are a bit thin, making them somewhat suitable for target shooting as well. The front sight is part of the slide, hence fixed. The rear sight is dovetailed in the slide, and only lateral adjustments can be made with a proper sight slider. As I mentioned before, its factory zeroed, and there is a mark on it in case some how the sight leaves its original position.\n \n[B]Magazine[/B]\nIt comes with two standard double stacked 15 rounds magazines. There is a window on it on each side, from where the rounds are visible. Also it has a bullets in magazine indicator. This is an area where the CF98 should have been better, but it’s not. The magazines are too sensitive, and in my opinion party to Failures to Feed.\n \n[B]Safety[/B]\nIn safety, CF98 offers a de-cocker and manual safety (in a single ambidextrous lever), plus a fring pin safety, which only disengages when the trigger is pulled.', ''),

He said the owner of O.A.Lahore told him some customers were complaining about this.[/QUOTE]\n\nDid he mean that the barrel rifling gets damaged!?? Cuz I''ve never heard of anything like silicone groove... Barrel grooves, as you must know are commonly referred to as ''rifling'' and the Hatsan is micro-grooved meaning that the groove are shallow and thin; therefore it causes minimum deformation to the pellet which in turn improves accuracy.\n\nOnly way of damaging an airgun''s rifling as per my knowledge is to shoot steel BBs through it. BBs are often not uniform and their diameter can be greater than that of the airgun''s usual .22 cal (5.5mm) and we all know steel is much much harder than lead therefore it has the potential to damage rifling. But even then it will most likely mess up your accuracy, it should not cause a failure to fire!!', ''),

ZARS was designed to be a dedicated Zombie Survival Shotgun and not a hunting shotgun. :)\r\n\r\nand as for the possibility of getting it is concerned, kindly allow me to explain (AGAIN) that this shotgun is not a commercial venture. it was basically a prototype aimed at answering many questions for the manufacturer (DSA) and the designer (me).\r\n\r\nsecond point: why would you want a Zombie Survival Shotgun with wooden furniture? next thing you would probably require is a velvet covered storage case and some silicon treated cloth to protect it against the elements. am I correct? ;)\r\n\r\nBro, ZARS is not designed to be protected against the elements. it is designed to face them head on and to function come what may. thats why you see powder coated treatment and polymer furniture. its not made for the comfort and looks that you looking for in a shotgun, its made for the extreme environment posed by a zombie attack.\r\n\r\nlastly: bro, why would you want a 28inch barrel too? I can understand that in a zombie attack scenario, one might need to hunt for birds but then again, are you assuming that one cannot hunt for birds with an 18inch barrel?\r\n\r\nAnyways, why don''t you contact DSA and ask them to make a regular pump action shotgun for you with 28 inch barrels and wooden furniture? this way, you''ll be saving a lot of money. while you are at it you can also consider getting a double barrel shotgun. perfect for upland don''t you think?\r\n\r\n[QUOTE=Nazim Sahib;311009]Very good work 12 Gauge.I have been preparing for a zombie invasion for quite some time now and am hoping it happens some time soon :)\r\nGreat idea for this shotgun.[/QUOTE]\r\n\r\nlols!

For the start I will share my experience with my 30-06.\r\n\r\nWe were shooting near Narang for ducks in the mornings and boars in the nights. On night shoot I was carrying my 30-06 with 150 grains S&B bullets. Scope was VX-I zeroed at 200 yards. We were looking for the boars on jeep when our light man tapped on the roof of jeep and pointed his light to an animal standing behind a bush at a distance of around 300 yards approx as I was not carrying my range finder (later on in the morning it was ranged at 287 yards). We were not sure whether it was a boar or a hog deer as it was not visible completely. We were told not to shoot any hog deer so I refrained my self from shooting at it. A few moments later and after adjusting our jeep for a shot, the animal showed its hind quarters and I saw its curly tail through my scope and after confirming that it was a boar, i decided to take it. My rifle was shooting about 1 inch high and a bit on the right when I zeroed it at 200 yards on the range. So I took the aim at the hind qaurters as that was the only part visible to me and pressed the trigger. With the blast of the rifle the animal dropped dead with a heavy thud. The bullet went through its right hind leg and came out from its neck damaging its vitals all the way and dispatching the animal instantly. I did not move my cross hairs from the POA and POI was the same as well.\r\n\r\nThats it for my 30-06 shooting. \r\nI will share my longest shot with my 22LR BRNO Model 2E as well.

(473023, ' [QUOTE=Leon;311158]@ 12 Gauge Bro! Is it possible to have single fixed barrel capable of firing both SG/LG and slugs (of course with reasonable accuracy) fitted with rifle sights? Regarding Tactical light and Tactical sling, I am happy that you are working on it. And what''s wrong with the idea of launching 12 Gauge signature P/A? It will be a matter of pride for all of us[/QUOTE]\r\n\r\nYes bro, its is quiet possible to use the same barrel for firing slugs and SG/LG. when we started this project, our intentions were to use a single barrel for both purposes. infact, the very idea of a Zombie Gun is to make the most of the least amount of resources. we ran into following problem while testing:\r\n\r\n1. slug is a single projectile therefore it poses it own unique challenges not shared by conventional smoothbore barrels.\r\n2. the barrel bore which promotes accuracy in slugs did not perform up to the mark when the pattern of SG/LG was involved.\r\n3. the barrel which gave good pattern results did not shoot slugs with any reasonable accuracy.\r\n4. the sighting setup which is great for slug shooting accurately is horrible for close quarter and rapid aiming.\r\n\r\nafter testing various barrel configurations, we had to settle for a multi barrel idea in the end.\r\n\r\nRegards.', ''),

(473131, ' [QUOTE=12GAUGE;311301][B]AoA Everybody[/B]\n\nLets talk a little on the subject of available holster options for the Scorpion. I for one always prefer a kydex type holster over anything else.\n\n[B]here is my candidate: Fobus SP11B[/B]\n\n[IMG]http://i998.photobucket.com/albums/af103/12gauge-pakguns/DSC00104-2.jpg[/IMG]\n\n[IMG]http://i998.photobucket.com/albums/af103/12gauge-pakguns/Dsc00343.jpg[/IMG]\n\nIts a high riding Yuqui style holster for Springfield Armoury that happens to fit this handgun like a glove. it offers rapid drawing ability and it stays snug to your body. meaning that it doesn''t move when you run/walk and draws no attention to itself. the gun is locked in its place by the locking indentation in the trigger guard of the holster therefore no need for staps or other locking devices which can come in your way should you ever need to draw your gun in an emergency. infact, the lock mechanism is so effective that you may even run with the gun held upside down in the holster and it will still stay in its pace. the only way to release the lock is to use a swift and rapid motion in the right angle for the lock to let go of the trigger guard.\n\nJourney to the right kydex holster for Scorpion was pretty long and expensive cause plenty of holsters were bought online and shipped only to find out later that they do not fit. problem with kydex holsters is that they either fit perfect or do not fit at all. its not like a leather or nylon holster where you can force your handgun in making room by conforming to measurements which can be slightly off.\n\nfor a kydex holster to fit, you need it to be an absolutely perfect fit. either your handgun would simply wont go in as you cannot force and make room in them or it will go in but will not lock due the difference in the shape of the trigger guard or the gun will rattle inside the holster if the holster is over sized. secondly, kydex holsters are heavily shape formed that even a slightest difference in angle or shape would make it impossible to fit.\n\nAnyways, this one came along as a holster for a Taurus PT-145 (Denovo87 bhai bought one online for his PT-145) and by chance it fitted the Scorpion like its made for it. I mean it fitted the Scorpion just as good as it fitted PT-145.\n\nso.... [I]ever since I have gone Kydex[/I], I have never looked back. you just cannot beat a kydex with leather or nylon holster in terms of presentation speed (quick draw) and the ability to stay snug to your body. another big time plus is that they print very less under clothes. you''ll be surprise how easily one can conceal a full size handgun such a scorpion in a kydex holster such as this one.\n\nRegards.[/QUOTE]\n\nsir ji price and is it available for pt 917c  taurus ????', ''),

Some people say that dry firing with a "dummy bullet" actually doesn''t do any harm to the handgun, but then there is another school of thoughts who claim even that isn''t recommended... One should not forget that the handgun purchased is to shoot live ammo, not just for "clicking", as for that, there are lots of toy guns available in the market... ;-) Some people might not agree with me, but in my humble opinion, a "little bit" of dry practice doesn''t do any harm...', ''),

(473258, ' [QUOTE=12GAUGE;311301][B]AoA Everybody[/B]\n\nLets talk a little on the subject of available holster options for the Scorpion. I for one always prefer a kydex type holster over anything else.\n\n[B]here is my candidate: Fobus SP11B[/B]\n\n[IMG]http://i998.photobucket.com/albums/af103/12gauge-pakguns/DSC00104-2.jpg[/IMG]\n\n[IMG]http://i998.photobucket.com/albums/af103/12gauge-pakguns/Dsc00343.jpg[/IMG]\n\nIts a high riding Yuqui style holster for Springfield Armoury that happens to fit this handgun like a glove. it offers rapid drawing ability and it stays snug to your body. meaning that it doesn''t move when you run/walk and draws no attention to itself. the gun is locked in its place by the locking indentation in the trigger guard of the holster therefore no need for staps or other locking devices which can come in your way should you ever need to draw your gun in an emergency. infact, the lock mechanism is so effective that you may even run with the gun held upside down in the holster and it will still stay in its pace. the only way to release the lock is to use a swift and rapid motion in the right angle for the lock to let go of the trigger guard.\n\nJourney to the right kydex holster for Scorpion was pretty long and expensive cause plenty of holsters were bought online and shipped only to find out later that they do not fit. problem with kydex holsters is that they either fit perfect or do not fit at all. its not like a leather or nylon holster where you can force your handgun in making room by conforming to measurements which can be slightly off.\n\nfor a kydex holster to fit, you need it to be an absolutely perfect fit. either your handgun would simply wont go in as you cannot force and make room in them or it will go in but will not lock due the difference in the shape of the trigger guard or the gun will rattle inside the holster if the holster is over sized. secondly, kydex holsters are heavily shape formed that even a slightest difference in angle or shape would make it impossible to fit.\n\nAnyways, this one came along as a holster for a Taurus PT-145 (Denovo87 bhai bought one online for his PT-145) and by chance it fitted the Scorpion like its made for it. I mean it fitted the Scorpion just as good as it fitted PT-145.\n\nso.... [I]ever since I have gone Kydex[/I], I have never looked back. you just cannot beat a kydex with leather or nylon holster in terms of presentation speed (quick draw) and the ability to stay snug to your body. another big time plus is that they print very less under clothes. you''ll be surprise how easily one can conceal a full size handgun such a scorpion in a kydex holster such as this one.\n\nRegards.[/QUOTE]\n\nVery nice and informative info and I was really looking for kydex holster, that one fit for scorpion perfectly.', ''),

(473572, ' [QUOTE=eemmads;310710]hsnmz thanks for the info in your previous comment. just want one favour from you......please next time when you take this beauty for firing, do make a video of the firing session so that somebody like me whose confused between baikal mp153 and hatsan, knows what to expect!!! that would be great help on your part!!! :nod:[/QUOTE]\n\nbro eemmads, IMO a mere video of shooting session won''t explain anything about the gun. However, please refer to the below link for a detailed comparison of both guns by our forums experts.\n\n[URL]http://www.pakguns.com/showthread.php?5539-Review-Baikal-MP-153-vs-Hatsan-Escort[/URL]\n\nIn my opinion  both MP153 and Hatsan are very nice weapons. I chose Hatsan because I wanted a gun which can serve both defensive and hunting purposes. I have observed a few very good things about this gun. First is that this gun is very smooth cycling. There is no feeling of the bolt movement.\nSince it''s a light weight gun so I was considering it to be a heavy recoiler but the recoil was quite less as compared to my expectations. I fired almost 25 cartridges in less than 10 minutes and really enjoyed it, meaning due to its low recoil I was not worried about the recoil or my shoulder getting hurt.\n\nAnother plus of Hatsan for me is its versatile loading mechanism. As explined by the expert members in the thread I linked above, MP153 requires the first cartridge to be fed in to the chamber directly. It can not load the first cartridge from the mag by just pulling and releasing the bolt. whereas in the case of Hatsan you just need to insert the cartridges in the mag and when the need arrives just pull the bolt back to load the first cartridge in to the chamber (just like a pistol). And if you want, Hatsan allows you to feed the first cartridge directly in to the chamber, release the bolt and then feed the rest of the cartridge in to the mag.\n\nSenior members in the thread above also mentioned that Hatsan has a better shot pattern as compared to MP153. This is a big plus for Hatsan while hunting.\n\nI would suggest that you should visit some arms shop, have a look at both the guns, pull these to your shoulder and then select the one you feel best for you. If both of these feel good then buy Hatsan if the points I mentioned above matter to you.', ''),

I for one always prefer a kydex type holster over anything else.\n\n[B]here is my candidate: Fobus SP11B[/B]\n\n[IMG]http://i998.photobucket.com/albums/af103/12gauge-pakguns/DSC00104-2.jpg[/IMG]\n\n[IMG]http://i998.photobucket.com/albums/af103/12gauge-pakguns/Dsc00343.jpg[/IMG]\n\nIts a high riding Yuqui style holster for Springfield Armoury that happens to fit this handgun like a glove. it offers rapid drawing ability and it stays snug to your body. meaning that it doesn''t move when you run/walk and draws no attention to itself. the gun is locked in its place by the locking indentation in the trigger guard of the holster therefore no need for staps or other locking devices which can come in your way should you ever need to draw your gun in an emergency. infact, the lock mechanism is so effective that you may even run with the gun held upside down in the holster and it will still stay in its pace. the only way to release the lock is to use a swift and rapid motion in the right angle for the lock to let go of the trigger guard.\n\nJourney to the right kydex holster for Scorpion was pretty long and expensive cause plenty of holsters were bought online and shipped only to find out later that they do not fit. problem with kydex holsters is that they either fit perfect or do not fit at all. its not like a leather or nylon holster where you can force your handgun in making room by conforming to measurements which can be slightly off.\n\nfor a kydex holster to fit, you need it to be an absolutely perfect fit. either your handgun would simply wont go in as you cannot force and make room in them or it will go in but will not lock due the difference in the shape of the trigger guard or the gun will rattle inside the holster if the holster is over sized. secondly, kydex holsters are heavily shape formed that even a slightest difference in angle or shape would make it impossible to fit.\n\nAnyways, this one came along as a holster for a Taurus PT-145 (Denovo87 bhai bought one online for his PT-145) and by chance it fitted the Scorpion like its made for it. I mean it fitted the Scorpion just as good as it fitted PT-145.\n\nso.... [I]ever since I have gone Kydex[/I], I have never looked back. you just cannot beat a kydex with leather or nylon holster in terms of presentation speed (quick draw) and the ability to stay snug to your body. another big time plus is that they print very less under clothes. you''ll be surprise how easily one can conceal a full size handgun such a scorpion in a kydex holster such as this one.\n\nRegards.[/QUOTE]\nvery nice holster 12 g bro and thanx  for solving my this holster  porblem for cz999 .can u just tell us if their is any option of right or left     hand side selection in it  when we order this holster . or is it only for right hand as v can see in ur pic.becoz when i saw this holster on different sites so didnt find any option.plz can u explain if u dont mind.thanx  once again .', ''),

This is not how competitive market works IMHO. You should just state the first time best competitive rate (with little margin to bargain). If the buyer is genuine he''ll buy, else at least he''ll be saying good words about you to other possible customers.\n\nCustomers usually have good idea about price. And this forum betters this ground.\n\nAnd a warm welcome to the forum,[/QUOTE]\nAre you a dealer , ofcourse not, so dont argue because we better know the mentality of customers and we deal them accordingly. you are from karachi here in hyderabad unlike karachi most customer dont have the knowledge about arms and ammunition so they dont see which item they are getting they only argue on price , they consider  finishing more than the performance.

(473733, ' Salam All,\r\n@zia raza, bro if you search the history of Beretta, you''ll see that the American Beretta Plant came into play right before the US army trials for a new handgun. The Sig p226 and the 92fs were top contendors for the spot, but Beretta won because the availability of spares and their price was more feasable than the sig''s, as they were being manufactured in the US. \r\n\r\nNow coming to your question, the US and Italian factories are owned and run by Beretta itself. As far as my limited knowledge goes, there is no signifacant difference in the US and Italian 92''s, except for markings on the gun. I have searched this topic for a long time, slight difference of finish has been reported by VERY FEW people on international forums which could be nothing more than difference seen in different batches from the same factory as well. The 92''s that I''ve seen have had no difference in them at all, whether Italian or American as long as its the same model being refered to, specifically the 92fs. Both are made from the same materials and have the Bruniton finish. Please keep in mind that I''m not talking of the Limited Edition handguns which are produced in limited quantities from time to time, these might be blued and have some cosmetic differences.\r\n\r\nRegards.', ''),

(473847, ' The method of bhagwa and using a tamed teetar for hunting are all  illegal and these methods lead to the extinction of birds. i used both  methods in my early hunting days but left them because i think this is  not hunting but it is killing . More over i have a teetar (desi ) one. i  got it as a very small chick , cared and tamed it , very loyal bird i  have ever experienced.... if any one want to know what to feed them  then, here it is. in villages u can find deemak , their favourite food  when chicks, no need to feed them on any thing else in first two weeks  because this food also gives them plenty of water as well. now after 15  days or more chicks become able to eat grasshoppers and bajra as well. \nin  cities if it is difficult to find deemak then , one can feed them on  bajra , grinding bajra into fine small pieces so that small chicks can  take them , also put some drops of water on bajra as well to fulfill  their water requirement . Believe me it is not easy to care small teetar  chicks u will have to effort more in 1st two weeks and after this  chicks become more resistant. Another thing is small chicks also need  heat and temperature and this is the most important thing. Dakhni teetar  lays eggs in home but desi teetar never does so.  so if one gets desi  teetar chicks and owns a dakhni big teetar female so he should use  dakhni teetar to care for chicks.  \nBlack partridge chicks have same  food and care methods but they need more care and taming effort than  desi teetar. i have tamed a pair of them as well. \nChakor chicks  again same food , same care methods.         One more thing that i have  seen many people hunt local birds to such extent that now these are in  danger and becoming extinct . in my area following practices are going  on which are very very bad. A real hunter will never do so.  People use  1)Bhagwa and tamed teetar/Chakor to hunt, a real hunter will never do  so.\n2) people use nets and catch birds alive , again a very bad practice.\n3)  breeding season of local birds is from April to October in our area.  teetar lays eggs twice or thrice in a year( 9 each time). bad practice  is that , these poor birds are not in comfort in breeding season as  well. their eggs or chicks are taken and sold , i have seen one person  this year in july brought 18 chicks in one day selling them in bazar.  more over people start hunting birds from october again a step to  destroy them because i have seen eggs of teetar in jungle in october  month which is a proof that this is still breeding month.\nnow taking  chicks of birds in breeding season and hunting them with Bhagwa and  calls in hunting season is a two way destruction of them.\nthis all i  told because this is not going in my region , i think every region  having such precious species has such bad peoples. i try to discourage  each such bad practice in my area. we all should play a role to protect  our nature and such beautiful local birds. otherwise that day is not far  that we will cry for these birds.     May allah bless all people with  thoughts to protect these birds.\nhere is link where i shared videos  of my teetar. u can see ,...... and some pics of my teetar and of deemak  and its place are under for understanding,...\n[url]http://www.pakguns.com/showthread.php?8803-My-grey-Francolin%28teetar%29-calling-and-following-me[/url]\n\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]13848[/ATTACH][ATTACH=CONFIG]13849[/ATTACH][ATTACH=CONFIG]13850[/ATTACH][ATTACH=CONFIG]13851[/ATTACH]\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]13852[/ATTACH][ATTACH=CONFIG]13853[/ATTACH]', ''),

Certain issues cannot be identified during testing or by firing a few thousand rounds. So, one should not really panic.\n\nIn the US product liability suits can result in big payouts especially when a foreign manufacturer is involved. Caracal, being an Arab company, has to be extra careful as in its case juries are likely to be even more generous.\n\nHowever, I am sure that Carcal is a responsible company and values a Pakistani, Thai or Philipino life just as much. If you have a Caracal with a serial number beginning with the letters mentioned above, you may want to put it away for the time being. If you cannot afford to put it away, be even more careful than one should normally be with firearms. \n\nWrite to Caracal both in the UAE and in Pakistan (the Caracal service center that people were mentioning on this site) and ask them why they did not consider it necessary to make a product recall in Pakistan, so far.', '');

(473986, ' Gentlemen, can we kindly refrain from multiple posts in quick succession?\n\nIf different thoughts come to you in the span of a few minutes, then rather than making successive posts just edit your existing post and add your subsequent thoughts to it.\n\nI am sure that you are not doing this to increase your post count with posts that do no add any value. However, we do have the situation where people with high post counts have the most basic of questions which have already been answered multiple times or give answers that are not meaningful but at best are an exercise in speculation. Case in point being posts # 3005 to 3007 of this thread. The same query from the same member being answered by one member in 3 separate successive posts made in the span of a few minutes. When, actually, the member asking the question should have searched the forums to get an answer. Though, one must say that with such a proliferation of posts, it does become difficult to search for meaningful info. In one case, a member with 300 plus posts announced that he had acquired his first firearm. Does make one wonder.\n\nFor the avoidance of doubt, I am not suggesting that a bit of banter is not a good thing. We all enjoy it once in a while and it adds colour to the forum.\n\nSeparately, welcome back ED. You were missed. My thread asking if anyone knew the reason for your absence was mercilessly :-) closed. Yet, we suffer pages and pages of "welcome bro" and "nice collection" as well as threads saying "I am ABC from XYZ". The point being, if social interaction is not encouraged and this forum strictly means business then "social" posts need to be discouraged, indiscriminately. How can "welcome bro" be more meaningful than having genuine concern for an active member''s wellbeing if he suddenly stops posting? Mods kindly take note.', ''),

U can then try and convince him that U need a firearms license. \r\n\r\nUsually a copy of your job letter and visiting card as well as a reason for a weapon.. that is all that is necessary. If u do convince him of your need for a fire arm. He will then issue u a paper which u wil then need to take to the DIG operations. \r\n\r\nGo and meet the PA of the DIG and convince him that u need to visit the great man.

Once u have his approval get in touch with the Spacial branch i think it is also the DIG there and again the PA and the whole thing all over again. \r\n\r\nThen it wil be the DIG CIA and his PA. . However the CIA has issues with the home dep these days. So u need to convince him that u need his approval without telling him the Home Sec wants it.. \r\n\r\nhow u do it is your responsibility. Then it wil be the SSP operations and his PA. all the way down to the SHO of your area. He will then send an ASI to your home to verify your antecedents. usually the ASI wil also need CNIC copies of your neighbours as character certificates.  U will then need to convince the ASI to write a good character certificate. \r\n\r\n\r\nOnce he does write it then it is his responsibility to give it to teh SHO whose responsibility it is then to write a favourable report for the Sp who wil then write a favourable report for the SSP Ops. who will then send a favourable report to the DIG operations. How htey write these reports is not your responsibility u can try visiting them and asking them to do it but that is it. \r\n\r\nThe DIG ops will the send the report to the Home Sec. U may try and keep visiting the home sec to know if they have received the favourable reports.. Once they do so. U wlil then be asked to give the fees i.e Rs. 4500 and then u will have to submit your data personally i.e photo wil be taken finger prints and personal data such as how much u earn and where etc etc. \r\nU will then be issued a token and will then need to visit repeatedly to know when your lic wil be ready. Once it wlil be ready and u will take delivery then U wil buy the weapon and take it back to the home dep and they wil make an entry on it. \r\n\r\nlater U wil need to visit the Home sec. so that u can convince him that u need a 144 carry permit for at least 90 days. Meanwhile, U wil also need to take the lic to the national bank to get it registered there as well.\r\n\r\nThis sir is the procedure in case u want to do it on your own.\r\n\r\nAnd hanh. U need to be at least 25 years old to be eligible for teh Home dep lics. DC ones are closed these days.', ''),
(474256, ' @zia raza\n1.The description of low bore axis is a pistol where the axis (center line) of the barrel sits low in the hand. The advantage of a pistol with a low axis is that recoil is more in line with the arm instead of high above where the recoil has a longer moment arm against your arm(The recoil will push the gun towards you which is more controllable then if it were to go upwards). The "Strizh" pistol has a lower sitting bore axis, thus recoil is more manageable and it is easier to get the gun back on target for a follow up shot\n2.These are over powered 9mm ammunition with higher velocity and deeper penetration.Most handguns can not withstand the power of these ammo types.', ''),

(474259, 'Kynoch Fighter (9mm) Ammo Report [B]Why I bought this ammo?[/B]\n\nHey guys... About a week or two ago I went to lucky star in search of cheap RANGE-purpose ammo, and what I expecting was actually CZ-75 ammo which is cheap, has brilliant finishing (as comparable to Chinese or russian ammo) therefore I went straight to HM Traders fromwhere I bought CZ75 ammo last time but unfortunately it was out of stock. But but but... they had 2 other types of local ammo for me, and quoted price of Rs. 20/= and Rs. 25/= per round respectively.\n\nI had no choice but to call our @ED bro for recommendation and found out that he along with a friend bought Kynoch Fighter brand ammo just a day before but they have NOT tested it yet. Uncle at HM Traders was asking Rs. 25 a round for Kynoch Fighter brand but I handed over my cell phone to him so our @ED bro could remind him of himself selling same ammo at Rs. 20 only a day before but SADLY he excused, telling me it was for "testing purpose" and Rs. 22 is the last price he can offer me... I was fine enough because that''s the price I bought CZ75 ammo for last time. I immediately bought 5 boxes of these rounds for testing purpose.\n[B]\nKynoch Fighter Ammo:[/B]\n\nI have attached a couple images to this post. Now about this ammo, I actually kind of had an idea when I was buying them but Nawaz bhai at ASCC range confirmed me its actually a RELOADED ammo when I was filling it in magz. But it was still worth a try??? I test fired first magazine and it was really good even Nawaz bhai tried 2 rounds shooting a target over 30+ meters which infact DID hit accurately on his second fire.\n\nFor me, I was playing with ammo on 5 meter and 10 meters. I found this ammo as good as CZ-75 which was infact as good as chinese red box ammo. I even used chinese ammo alongside to compare and found Kynoch Fighter ammo is really worth it even if its reloaded. Okay! I may not be the expert but range master did tell me the exact same thing!\n\nI tested exactly 200 rounds of this brand, in which there was only 1 round that failed to eject so that makes it 0.5% FTE? Not really that bad. But I never had any FTF/FTE with CZ75 ammo which I bought at same price (or maybe I only had 150 round of those at that time...)\n\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]13887[/ATTACH]\n\n[B]So my recommendation:[/B]\n\nGo for it! It may not be as good looking but its cheap, safe, accurate and the guy (range-master) who deals with these things almost everyday really praised this ammo at least 4-5 times. Happy Shooting :-)\n\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]13888[/ATTACH]', ''),

The Sig p226 and the 92fs were top contendors for the spot, but Beretta won because the availability of spares and their price was more feasable than the sig''s, as they were being manufactured in the US. \r\n\r\nNow coming to your question, the US and Italian factories are owned and run by Beretta itself. As far as my limited knowledge goes, there is no signifacant difference in the US and Italian 92''s, except for markings on the gun. I have searched this topic for a long time, slight difference of finish has been reported by VERY FEW people on international forums which could be nothing more than difference seen in different batches from the same factory as well. The 92''s that I''ve seen have had no difference in them at all, whether Italian or American as long as its the same model being refered to, specifically the 92fs. Both are made from the same materials and have the Bruniton finish. Please keep in mind that I''m not talking of the Limited Edition handguns which are produced in limited quantities from time to time, these might be blued and have some cosmetic differences.\r\n\r\nRegards.[/QUOTE]\r\n\r\nVery nice explain Kamranwali bhai, all you have explained is the theory of the said handgun.

(474325, ' It seems interesting to me that Steyr M-Series pistols also had a similar drop safety issue, and a recall. Same designer another brand name , similar issue. \n[b]I am Quoting "Those pistols also had the drop fire issue that the Caracal pistols are now experiencing. I haven''t looked at the Caracal, but the Steyr was dependent on near perfect machining of the sear and striker assembly. The pistol was also dependent on a tight fit between the slide and frame to achieve this proper mating."[/b]\nMaybe Moeen bhai can shed some light on that statement.\nNow As far as Caracal owner''s go ( I bought one for my Father even though he Hated the idea of a Striker fired handgun , he considers them dangerous, I wont hear the end of this) \n1. There were two reported incidents , one widely reported.\n2. It seems (speculation) they looked into the matter and found something wrong. Hence the recall.\n3.It appears that Caracal is calling back everyone''s pistol for a once over.Free shipping both ways and a free mag are promised.[u] I would expect Caracal owner''s in Pakistan to get the same treatment.[/u]\n\nThe onus now is on Caracal owner''s, investing our ego''s into a firearm is a bad idea and even thought the bashers might think they are helping , but since they don''t own the firearm, they didn''t bring this problem to light, or can''t help influence caracal to resolve it, Caracal owners however need to get in touch , Politely with Tayyablly and lets see how Caracal customer care responds to this issue.\nFor Caracal''s sake , I hope they respond efficiently otherviz I think they can kiss their growing market influence goodbye. In both the east and west.  \nAt the same time, its good to see Tayabally posting on the Forum. A Glock is a Glock not just becuz of its revolutionary design and reliability, but also becuz of its phenomenal customer care. Hopefully we can see that same attention given to Pakistani customer''s who are caracal owners. \n\n@ Ahnab bro , this is the only handgun that people in Pk can hope to get customer care for, that is a positive in my book. Also the price bashing worked Becuz the Company was interested in the PK market, and listened to Customers, and "potential customers " feedback.\nNot becuz of How ugly the Plastic Arab glock wannabe looked,and/or and supposed inaccuracies and failures. If pure bashing works , lets try to Bash the price of Taurus PT1911 back , or maybe the CZ handguns, infact Even the Stoeger 8000. However I agree , time for some tough love ( primarily from Caracal owners), and in all honesty, if you need to carry your Caracal maybe and empty chamber is a better idea, better still is to keep it in storage. \n\nP.S Also the caracal my Dad own''s seems to chuck empties occasionally into my face when I shoot it. Is this normal or is it a problem, ive never had any other handgun toss empties at me standing in an "I" stance.Rifles occasionally do that too , but no handgun I''ve come across, which isn''t that many to begin with.

I have actually taken his  criticisms as compliments.  But the thing is I consider myself bound to  only PakGuns rules which clearly allows me to discuss local 9mm  ammunation as they don''t fall under PB category yet (unless someone here  is given a chance to do that lol) and civilized behaviors where I  respect my seniors and my juniors who actually are still in process of  getting their first license.\n\nIf there is a member who has bought  one of the most expensive guns like Glock understands very well what  kind of ammo he/she "should" be using. For a guy like me with Stoger  Cougar in his hands can certainly rely on the ammo mentioned above, I  have TESTED it... it cycles well, it performs well, and its accurate as  well (tested on 5, 10 and ~30 meters).\n\nLast time I went to range with one of the most experience members of PakGuns, our @ED bro and @StormShadow (who is in process of getting his first license). We tried out CZ75 ammo which is also local and available at same Rs. 22/= price. Since CZ75 is not available (being promised after Eid, but I can hardly believe that because it was also promised to me last week), this Kynoch Fighter is an excellent alternative! Go for it guys!\n\nAlso same Kynoch Fighter brand box was bought by @ED bro and (I think) @Muhammad m (who both are senior members of PakGuns, and if it wasn''t for me they would have tested it first and made a thread here about it??) So why trouble a guy who shoots at 10 meters?\n\np.s. Doctor sahahb, learning process is indeed gradual. You see I could have also asked nawaz bhai to put target on 25 meters and start shooting on it, kuch na kuch to lagta na target pe?

And I do totally absolutely AGREE with your views on all the facts you have mentioned about checking ammunation and threats related to darra reloaded ammo. Also thank YOU for appreciating my intenions as they really were about "sharing information about this brand with everyone."\n\nNow some facts from my end:\n\nGuys, for SD purpose I use S&B hollow-points which cost Rs. 120/= a bullet. I have tested my gun with it and they fire very well and cycles very well... ofcourse thats a 120 PKR ammo! So if I go to range with ONLY 250 rounds of these its a straight Rs. 30,000/= cost for me JUST for the ammunition.\n\nBut if I take chinese red box ammunition which is @ 40 PKR a bullet. Those 250 rounds will cost me Rs. 10,000/= now with ammunition like CZ-75 and Figher I get a bullet @ 22 PKR only. I bought 250 of these bullets for exactly Rs. 5500/=.\n\nThis is a BIG difference... in contrast with gun prices, I bought cougar for 62k w/ rails. Even if I use this ammunition and believe that it reduces life of barrel. I must have saved enough money by then to buy a whole NIB cougar again and still learned a lot about target shooting.\n\nI surveyed markets several times with our senior PG members... This is infact a very popular RANGE ammunition produced in [U]proper factories in north western areas of Pakistan[/U]. Even if they are Rs. 22 a round, its still quite expensive as compared to original crap made in darra that is 8-10 PKR a round (a couple of dealers have told me, never seen them though).\n\nOkay I may not be able to tell accuracy of ammunition at 5, 10 or even 15 meters. But what we see in the ammunition is grouping, recoil, smoke... right? I never said I am an expert shooter but I did get EXACT same results with slightly more smoke after using this ammo in comparison when I use Chinese. I am sure that is exactly what makes fighter and CZ75 a very popular RANGE-purpose ammo.\n\np.s. In those 200 rounds of fighter, and 150 rounds of CZ75 at least my gun nor my hands blew up neither we felt any such threat with this ammo (remember I had company of senior member with me). Also empty shell after a round is fired were still in good shape (no crack or something on them to indicate any threat).', ''),

Few days ago my uncle asked me to make a licence for myself as he want to get me something. I did what i was told to and applied to moi through a reference and will receive my letter for nadra after Eid. Now at the same time my father asked me to give his PA my 2 photographs, a copy of ntn certificate and a copy of N.I.C. His PA told me that they have talked to CC Islamabad now the issue is i don`t live in Islamabad. I have a Punjab domicile and i don`t have any temp islamabad address on my NIC aswell. Now the question is if i get a licence through them with all these facts will it be a valid licence. Brothers i don`t want to end up in trouble. \n\nYou know its better to clear everything before getting into something. I know in our beloved country everything can happen but at least we should play a fair game.\n\nRegards', ''),

(474686, 'Hyderabad Chapter: Dealers I would try to share a bit of knowledge that I have regarding dealers in Hyderabad other members are requested to input their experience and knowledge:).\r\n\r\n1) Sindh Armory:\r\nBrief intro: The shop is run by what I think two brothers namely Faheem sahab and Mueen Sahab. Both are quite polite people to serve their purpose only. Means when a customer tries bargain or try to compare prices of other dealers before them then suddenly an attitude problem occurs with them. The prices are certainly on higher higher side. They do have accessories that one can find no where else in hyderabad. However Mueen sahab is better of the two. Mueen sahab has opened a new shop that I haven''t visited yet.\r\n\r\n2) Mehran Armory:\r\nI think the guy at Mehran armory is also brother of Sindh armory guys. So not much difference that I have felt in terms of attitude and prices, just that Mehran armory guy at times becomes really really rude for no reason. Prices also on the higher side.\r\n\r\n3) Fida Hussain armory: Lower on the prices as compared to the above two but very conservative when it comes to reselling him the weapon you bought from him.\r\n\r\n4) Saifuddin Ghulam Ali and Sons: The shop used to be run by two guys agha Khalil and Abbas. Agha Khalil has recently opened a new shop. Abbas bhai is a good decent jolly dealer, has a decent collection and is not at all a cut throat dealer.\r\n\r\n5) Agha Khalil: I don''t know the name of his new shop but prices there too are reasonable and as he has opened a new shop he offers very competitive prices.

Both are quite polite people to serve their purpose only. Means when a customer tries bargain or try to compare prices of other dealers before them then suddenly an attitude problem occurs with them. The prices are certainly on higher higher side. They do have accessories that one can find no where else in hyderabad. However Mueen sahab is better of the two. Mueen sahab has opened a new shop that I haven''t visited yet.\n\n2) Mehran Armory:\nI think the guy at Mehran armory is also brother of Sindh armory guys. So not much difference that I have felt in terms of attitude and prices, just that Mehran armory guy at times becomes really really rude for no reason. Prices also on the higher side.\n\n3) Fida Hussain armory: Lower on the prices as compared to the above two but very conservative when it comes to reselling him the weapon you bought from him.\n\n4) Saifuddin Ghulam Ali and Sons: The shop used to be run by two guys agha Khalil and Abbas. Agha Khalil has recently opened a new shop. Abbas bhai is a good decent jolly dealer, has a decent collection and is not at all a cut throat dealer.\n\n 5) Agha Khalil: I don''t know the name of his new shop but prices there too are reasonable and as he has opened a new shop he offers very competitive prices. A good person nature wise. and from him whatever you get NIB is NIB. He would tell you even if a pistol is very slightly used.[/QUOTE]Quite true brother ,There is a Guy on the Sindh Armoury named Seemab He seems a Bit better than his Elder Brothers ,Fida Hussain is Good for Ammo dealing ,Saifudin and ghulam Ali Is on Higher Side ,easy to Bargain but hard to get a discount.', ''),

Fact is this, lets not get impressed because some Caracal Agent tells us to send them an email and then wait for them to get back to us... that is BULLSHIT.  A gun is like a car a very serious item; furthermore a car can be used for transport, however a gun?  is for taking a life... thats what its meant for.  If someone shoots a gun for plinking, hunting, or other sport they are simply sidelining what what firearms are meant for.  So when there is a defect in the running of your vehicle you immediately go to get it fixed.  SAME APPLIES HERE.  If they don''t wanna fix it free under warranty then its time to BOYCOTT the item in this country.  I am even with Caracal if they wish to sell us the replacement parts, hell, if I have paid 66000/rs then I can afford to pay 5000/rs more.\nThe other thing I CAN state to you all, the Caracals being sent to US are FAR more durable, robust, and safe than the ones sent here.

Therefore a Beretta will almost always get you higher resale value than any other brand.\r\n\r\nto be honest, this trend is not just in Pakistan, its basically a universal thing. you will find that the respect that a Beretta commands globally is hardly shared by any other brand and anyone fortune enough to share the same level of respect is usually owned by Beretta as well (case of Benelli, Sako, Tikka).\r\n\r\nthen its the availability of spares and accessories, you''ll find that in this respect too Beretta wins by a huge margin.\r\n\r\nlets look at it this way: I am a huge Browning Maxus fan but will almost always invest in a Beretta if I am willing to commit 200+K in a shotgun.\r\n\r\nRegards.', ''),

(474939, ' [QUOTE=Kamranwali;312420]Salam All,\nThe caliber of the C96 Broomhandle is actually 7.63 Mauser. 7.62x25(.30 TT as we know it) is actually much hotter than 7.63 Mauser, and most of the broomhandles here in Pakistan have been damaged due to continous use of the .30 ammo in them. \n\nAs far as 7.63 Mauser goes, I once saw a Star model M in PRISTINE condition with a dealer once. Not even carried, just bought by someone and stashed away. I was in half a mind to buy it, but didn''t coz of the ammo. I told the shopkeeper of the limitation with the gun, and that 7.63 ammo isn''t readily available, and he kept on arguing with me that its a 30 bore and takes the same ammo. :D\n\nFew links\n[URL]http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/7.63×25mm_Mauser[/URL]\n[URL]http://home.comcast.net/~gunspotz/c96_763.htm[/URL]\n\nRegards.[/QUOTE]\n\n\nwow whats the usual price of a pristine broomie and the relatively used ones????im a real german weapon fan...and that cz looks awesome.', ''),

(474948, ' Ahmedsmaat i am sorry for what I have to say beforehand.\n\nAmongt the worst quality clones being produced by branded companies in Pakistan is KAC (Khybar Arms Company)\n\nfollowing is my review of their product. (please bear in mind that pump shotguns are very simple and therefore more reliable then their handgun counterparts) And this particular specimen broke without firing a single shot) \n\n[url]http://www.pakguns.com/showthread.php?9246-I-had-a-dream[/url]\n\nAs regards their .30 betty clones. I had a detailed discussion with the people at Ammar and co. (The sole distributors of the KAC brand in Karachi) They refused to even sell them!! \n\nThey said we are getting "complaints". Thing is .30 rounds are more powerful then 9mm ones and the betty is designed for 9mms. Ergo what happens is that the locking lugs (the thingies that keep the slide attached to the frame) may well snap and the slide will simply fly backwards and hit your face with enough force to... \n\nfiring a .30 from a a gun designed for a 9mm is dangourous enough, but a KAC product...\n\n(shudder) amongst the local 9mms I am researching the best ones are Zafar alams followed by GH (Gul Haji) and FAC (Frontier arms Co) and then PAC (Punjab arms Co) but the KAC brand is at the bottom of the list. \n\nlast i talked to teh Ammar people they said that they have started distributing KAC .30 betties again. \n\nBut then there was a time when KAC''s distributors were giving a warranty on their products for at least 1 year. After their guns started breaking left right and centre they have stopped giving any guarantees. \n\nThe KAC .30 betty is worth around 18k in the market currently.', ''),

After this, the firearm is examined to make sure it is still intact and if so, the metal (usually the barrel) is stamped with one or more "proof marks" of the testing agency. The proof marks create indented impressions on the metal surface, so they cannot be accidentally removed. Such a test certifies that the firearm is free from manufacturing defects and will not explode under normal usage conditions.[/I]\r\n\r\n[QUOTE=Salman_Ahmed;313111]I can understand that some people really really don''t like this firearm, but as far as I can tell, Nitro proof tests aren''t the norm .[/QUOTE]\r\n\r\nSeriously? ;) here is another part from the very link you posted: [I]"In many countries, proof tests are compulsory; and it is not possible to sell a firearm unless it has been proof-tested by an official testing agency approved by the government."[/I]\r\n\r\nFYI: UAE is a member of CIP and has an established proofing facility in Abu Dhabi.\r\n\r\nRegards.', ''),
