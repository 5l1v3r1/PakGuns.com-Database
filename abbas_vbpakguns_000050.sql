It has remained somewhat controversial ever since. At that time, it offered better long-range potential than any big game cartridge generally available on the American market. It has now been adopted by practically every manufacturer of standard bolt-action high-powered sporting rifles in the world. The Remington slide actions and Remington and Browning semi-autos are also available in 270-caliber. The cartridge is based on the 30-06 case necked-down. It was a long time favorite of well-known gun writer the late Jack O''Connor, who probably contributed more popularizing the 270 than any other individual.\r\n\r\nAlong with the 30-06, this is one of the most accurate and effective all-round American big game cartridges. Its reputation and popularity have increased at a steady rate since its introduction. Although not intended as a varmint cartridge, the 270 will serve very well in that capacity when loaded with 100 grains. It is generally conceded to be a better long-range varmint cartridge than its parent, the 30-06. The original 130-grain bullet at over 3100 fps muzzle velocity is considered adequate by many experienced for any North American big game. When first introduced, some deer hunters complained that this bullet had such an explosive effect it ruined too much meat. To satisfy the "need" for a deer load, Winchester brought out a 150-grain bullet at the reduced velocity of 2675 fps. However, it was short-lived because the people who demanded it wouldn''t buy it. The present 150-grain bullet at 2900 fps is intended more for maximum penetration on such heavier animals as elk, moose or the big bears. Some disagree, but current evidence forces the conclusion that the 270 is adequate for any North American big game and many African plains animals as well. Assuming the hunter uses the proper bullet weight and type for the job at hand, the 270 will deliver reliable performance. In any comparison of the 270 with the 30-06, much depends on intended use and hunting conditions. For some reason, probably less recoil, many individuals shoot better with the 270 than the 30-06. The 270 is flatter shooting than the 30-06, and thus makes a better varmint/big game rifle where this is a consideration. The 30-06, with its 180, 200 and 220 grain bullets, is conceded a better woods, brush or heavy game caliber. In accuracy and general killing power, there isn''t a great deal to argue about.

Have you used vortek kit ? If you have the kit please post some pics and also post some range result which was been shot after and before tuning the airgun . This will show the reult of the airgun .\n\nAlso what''s the procedure to get these kits ? Are they available easily in Pakistan. If yes i would like to know its price and from where to buy .\n\n Thanks[/QUOTE]\n\nDear Naveed,\n\nHere are some pics.\n\nHMO piston is an "O" ring type piston.  It is developed by "CCA" a company making products for airguners. This company has close relation with "Vortek".  Hence the product of CCA which is HMO piston is now being sold through Vortek as well.\n\n[U][B]Following is a review of HMO piston.[/B][/U]\n\n[I]"I have a 20 year old model 52 that I bought used (just to put the piston in  LOL!). When I got it, it was shooting 14.3 gr cp''s at 712 with an ES of 16, SD  of 4 for 10 shots...this translates to 16.1 fpe. This was stock piston, the  exact way I received the gun. I thought that was slow and that maybe the spring  was getting tired. Before HMO piston arrived I bought a JM monolith spring  to put in the gun. So I had that on hand. \n\nI received HMO piston  the other day and went ahead and tried the monolith spring on the factory guide.  This spring looks like a beast compared to the spring that came in the gun.  (BTW, I''m not 100% sure that the spring that came in the gun is an OEM spring,  but I THINK it is.) Anyways with the monolith spring the gun shot JSB heavies  which I weighed to be 18.2-18.3 gr. at 664 fps with an ES of 9 and SD of 3 for  10 shots- 17.8fpe. CP''s 14.3 gr, shot 748 with and ES of 10 and SD of 3 again  for 10 shots- 17.8 fpe. I did use the thinnest spacer provided...any more and  the spring would bind and the gun didn''t cock. Well, I took the monolith out  last night and put the original spring back in. (The monolith had taken a big  set and was quite a bit shorter than the original. It was unset when I bought  it.) So now with the original spring back in the gun and NO spacers used: JSB  heavies 710 avg, ES-3 SD-.81 for only 5 shots because it was beginning to rain  here. CP''s 801 AVG, ES-15, SD-4 for 10 shots. Both translate to 20.4 fpe!!! MUCH  BETTER than the stock piston!!! OVER 5 fpe gain with just the new piston  change!! \n\nBest of all the shot cycle is very nice...just a quick recoil  pulse...very, very smooth. In fact the shot cycle seemed to be identical to the  shot cycle of the monolith spring but with much more power- 17.8 fpe vs. 20.4  fpe. \nI would like to try a new OEM spring and may try to buy one in the  future. I do have another JM spring and guide coming from a wtb ad I placed on  the classifieds. The seller doesn''t know which JM kit it is, but it''s an old one  and doesn''t have a tophat just the rear spring guide. So, more testing to come.  \nregards."\n\n[/I]I think the above experience will help the readers to judge the benefits of HMO piston over Diana piston.\n\n[B][U]Vortek says[/U][/B]\n[U][B]Now I come to Vortek Kit[/B][/U]DYI tuning kits allow the air gun owner an inexpensive and simple, module tune kit to install. A self-contained drop-in system to correctly reduce piston and spring noise. In addition, most air guns quietly perform with increased velocity!\n\n The PG2 tuning kits come [B]complete with 3 guides[/B], ...mechanically tuned in the boundaries of the PG2 technology  that controls noise by homogenizing harmonics with-in and throughout the dampened dual-guide materials!\n\n Included in each kit: power spring, lubrication and instructions on how to install. No tight guides and tar! Full Power! \n[U][B]\nDiscussion[/B][/U]\nThere are two Kit makers in USA which are renowned.\n\n1. JM Maccari\n2. Vortek\n\nThe 3rd one is from UK\n3. V-Mach\n\nthese are world famous tuners and developers of unique tuning kits for different airguns.\n\nIn recent days, Vortek kits and HMO pistons have been proved to be the best.  \n\n[U][B]Price[/B][/U]\n\nHMO Piston      130$\nVortek PG2 Kit   79$\n\nThese prices are without shipment charges which are normally 11$.\n\nI know it is difficult to spend extra 130$ on an airgun but if some one has got funds, its worth using.  If an airgunner is really a gun lover, he will love this piston as it increases power without increasing recoil.\n\nThe rest of airgunners who cannot spend that much and have  Diana 34, 48, 52, 54, 56th, 460 or 350 can move to Vortek PG2 kit by spending 79$.  This is I think a one time investment after which if some one feels that power level has decreased due to years of usage of gun, the replacement spring price is just 17$. This spring will fit in the tuning kit.\n\nVortek kit is unique because it uses 3 guides.  While Diana uses only one guide.  3 Guides reduces the recoil and the gun becomes very accurate without compromising on power.\n\nEven if some one using Diana 54 puts this kit in, the firing behavior improves a lot.\n\nThis is a world wide practice.  These people are specialist in making these parts and in US a lot of people buy a new gun and replace its spring with the PG2 tuning kits and throw the original spring away.  That much is the difference between original Diana springs and Vortek product.\n\nI am using PG2 kit in my Diana 54.  \n\nI also want to give this knowledge to all other Pakistani airguners so that they could also get the best use of there airguns.\n\nSpecially the users of 350, 460 and 34 need to put Vortek kit in their guns.  If some one like the other way, JM maccari kits can also be their choice but those kits are difficult to install and technology wise Vortek is superior.  But JM Maccari kits also give very good results.\n\nI am here to help the airgunners in technical aspects.\n\nI think now we should discuss such things and improve our guns.\n\nWelcome to all', 1, 0, '202.163.115.148', 0, 1, 2, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

Reviews about this gun were not available in Pakgun, though one of the members has purchased it with Akkar but didn''t post any review. \n\nWhen I started searching this one then most of the dealers (rather all the dealers in Saddar and Chota Bazar) didn''t know anything about this gun. Only Badruddin knew it and even sold some pieces and he was very negative about this gun. As per his views, this gun does not load the cartridge (specially Pakistani), but as he didn''t have the gun so I just had to wait. Finally, he got one frm somewhere for me, it was 2011 production and he said that it didn''t have any such issues which were there in 2010 version. \n\nHe gave me the gun on 57K (Islamabad dealers were demanding 75K) and when I wanted to buy imported cartridges then he suggested to go for Shaheen and said these won''t be a problem.\n\nGun came with 2 Mags (3" and 2 3/4") of 5 which, i think, makes it 5+1. There were three chokes, full/modified/cylinder bore, don''t exactly know when and why to use them ... \n\nI have fired some 45+ Shaheen 4 No. and except one FTL (Load), 19th, everything seemed perfect. I categorize one feeding failure as the imperfection of the shaheen cartridge. As per my experience, Recoil is less than 2 Barrel and Pump Action with Stocks. Two times it didn''t lock-back the bolt (or whatever you guys call it, i don''t know these techinical terms) ... \n\nIt does not seem much heavy and it is the piece one should have. I cannot say that it is any threat to Saiga but, no doubt, it is something one wishes to have and fire. \n\nI will be trying to have a detailed review of its shooting as you guys are accustomed of here in pakgun. My shooting area is some 15-20 minutes drive frm my place, a village having mountains and I target bushes which, unortunately, are the worst thing to shoot at, no clue where the fire hit.\n\nEnd of too much of bak bak ... here are few pictures from my mobile ...

As I had written earlier, I personally carry chambered but with the safety on; I do so because I can easily reach & manipulate the safety lever with my thumb without having to break my grip or use my reaction hand (the advantage of having rather large hands :) ). Infact, I''ve gotten into the practice where I switch the safety off as I''m drawing from the holster.\n\nI''ve been told by some people on a few occasions that carrying chambered is "unsafe". Quite frankly, if a chambered firearm is unsafe in your possession, then you''re definitely [B]NOT[/B] competent enough to carry in the first place and [B]SHOULD LEAVE THE GUN AT HOME UNDER LOCK & KEY![/B] I personally believe that a majority of altercations can be resolved and/or diffused peacefully, without having to rely on punitive force. But, on the rare occasion when I may be forced to defend my life or the lives of my loved ones, then I will have absolutely no qualms about resorting to violence. In such a situation, my primary objective will be to neutralize the threat as quickly, efficiently and effectively as possible. And that means drawing my firearm and getting the shot off at the threat in as little a time frame as possible. The only way I can do that is if I minimize the time it takes between my weapon hand landing on my holstered firearm to getting the shot off at the target. Having to rack the slide, especially under dynamic stress where my life hangs in the balance, simply adds a whole series of wasted motions and wasted time.\n\nA firearm, IMHO, is carried primarily for personal safety & protection, irrespective of any imminent threats or not. If your firearm is [B]NOT[/B] in a "shoot-ready" condition as soon as it leaves the holster, then it''s nothing more than a glorified paper-weight.

Humbly, this is not a safe assumption in my opinion and can prove fatal as well, seriously.\n\nI know that quite a lot of you - [I]as evident from the red graph above[/I] - feel uncomfortable carrying your handgun in chambered mode. Yet, an unchambered gun - IMHO - puts you at a severe[I] disadvantage[/I][B] if you were to ever need it[/B],[B] [COLOR=#ff0000]which in my opinion, is the whole point of carrying it in the first place[/COLOR][/B]!\n\n If the need isn''t there, the whole point of carrying a handgun - chambered or not - is kind of literally[I] offset[/I]. I wouldn''t carry my handgun just for the habit or fun of it, or just because I''ve been sanctioned a license for it and can do so. In that case, it better be kept oiled n'' greased back in the closet.\n\n I observed quite a few replies in the preceding posts that "[B][COLOR=#0000cd][I]It doesn''t take too long to chamber your handgun when you need it[/I][/COLOR][/B]". Well, probably. But, It''s not just the few seconds, it''s the fact that under stress, studies have proven that nervous hands [I]can[/I] tend to do half racking (failure to properly chamber) as one of the concerns.\n\n  Furthermore, It takes a lot of experience and training to rack the slide and get a round off in a[I] stressful situation[/I] without having either an accidental discharge or failure.[B] [COLOR=#ff0000]Remember, you''re not watching yourself in front of the mirror and doing draw practice, you''re standing before a guy who''s there to harm you, one way or another[/COLOR].[/B] I personally wouldn''t take the risk, and rather prefer to have my stuff in a "ready-to-go" mode. In a vehicle, it''s of even greater importance, to have it "stand-by", ready to go.\n\n  The usefulness of [B]one hand free [/B]also can be very important as well and the racking of the handgun does imply - even if just for a fractional moment of time - [B]that you''re using both hands[/B]. Now, what if the would-be attacker is on top of you before you know it and at bad breath distance? Do you really think you can draw and rack or draw and disengage a thumb safety as well, if employed?? \n[B]\nAlso, how would we fend off an assailant with one hand[/B], would you ask him: "[B][COLOR=#0000cd]Hey, wait a second, let me just rack up this thing first[/COLOR][/B]"? Remember, the adrenaline is running high and you''re again not standing in front of your mirror, but in front a live, nasty, probably psychologically bewildered [COLOR=#ff0000][B]potential threat[/B][/COLOR]!\n \nAny number of things could easily prevent you from having both hands free to chamber a round, even if for the need of having a hand to keep the attacker off you, so that you can draw the darn thing out of the holster with the other.\n[B][COLOR=#0000cd]\n I personally know of two incidents of friends who were snatched away of their guns during this racking up time-delay.[/COLOR] [/B]One was an [B][COLOR=#ff0000][SIZE=5]ex. Army Major[/SIZE][/COLOR][/B], being stripped off his Beretta 92, and returned only after hectic jirga requests.\n\nAnother incident (2 weeks ago) was of 3 guys being stripped off of 2 handguns, one pump action, after one of them had been [I]neutralized[/I] and other 2 had to give up their drawn weapons. Can you imagine what could have happened in these two incidents, had the other party been adequately [I]junooned[/I] up??!! Hence, practical business is quite different from home-brewed theories, about having "enough of time", etc. Not to say, that you necessarily draw a chambered handgun to kill, but to say, that even a timely warning shot can deter quite a lot.\n\n I am therefore, humbly, of the opinion, that If you''re not going to chamber it at all, you''re really just carrying excessive paper weight.\n\n I do not - as stated before - have any experience with "Safe Action" Glock type of handguns. Yet, with a total trigger travel of 12.5mm only (Caracal''s being 8mm only), I certainly would be more cautious with chambered carry of those and ensure that I got just the right type of holster, preferably Kydex type that cannot interfere with the trigger, like cloth getting in the way.\n\n[COLOR=#ff0000][B]As far as DA/SA handguns are concerned, I''m of the opinion that the 10-12 lbs double action itself is safety enough.\n[/B][/COLOR]\n  Let me know, if anything of above appears as unfounded by some reasonable logic. I carry it chambered friends, with or without reasons of enmity.\n\n Thanks again for gracing this thread with your valuable inputs.

As per the information which he has received from some one in Pakistan Customs is that you need to be a member of a registered sports club / body in Pakistan or in the country from where you are carrying the airgun. This sports body / club needs to issue a letter in favour of the person carrying the airgun that he is authorized to import the airgun for sporting purposes.\n\nWhat happens now with my friend will be known in a couple of weeks, as he has no such membership and currently he is in UAE and will travel back to Pakistan in a couple of weeks. I will update on this forum whether or not he manages to bring the airgun to Pakistan without any problem. \n\nAnother of my friends, based in Germany who happens to be an "Airgun Doctor", and is a professional match player recently brought an FX Royal with him to Pakistan, and he was talking about the long procedure he had to go through in Germany to get permission to export the airgun out of Germany temporarily, as he intended to take the airgun back with him on his return from Pakistan. I noticed that there was an A4 sized sheet on his airgun case, with his club membership details and exact flight itinerary. Since he did all the paper work in Germany, he had no problem with Pakistan Customs. Based on this, we can deduce that there might not be any problem if you are a member of a sports club outside of Pakistan.\n\nFor those looking for importing an airgun into Pakistan from Canada, please note that in Canada, all airguns having muzzle velocities over 500fps are licensed, and the procedure is too complex to export a licensed gun outside of Canada.\n\nAs for the airgun pellets, I got around 4kg of different pellets from Canada recently, which were in the luggage and no one even bothered to check these at Islamabad airport, perhaps due to the over crowding at the airport due to Hajj Flights or some other reason.', 1, 0, '124.109.46.242', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

One of the most important things one can train for is the muscle memory through consistency. No matter what the argument, if one feels more comfortable carrying in condition 3, and has trained to effectively draw and rack the slide, then that''s the condition he/she is gonna carry in. For me, I have always trained with 1911s in condition 1 from a concealment holster... so that is how i feel confident in carrying my piece. However, I have carried DAs in the past... and I have carried them in condition 0, for as put by AK bhai, the heavy trigger pull of a DA pistol is a safety enough.\n\nFor people who have not trained/are not proficient in ccw usage, I don''t think the first 3 conditions are for them (counting 0 as the first condition).\n\nI read in the thread somewhere about shooting the mobile snatchers in the back after they have robbed you and are running away.

One of the most important things one can train for is the muscle memory through consistency. No matter what the argument, if one feels more comfortable carrying in condition 3, and has trained to effectively draw and rack the slide, then that''s the condition he/she is gonna carry in. For me, I have always trained with 1911s in condition 1 from a concealment holster... so that is how i feel confident in carrying my piece. However, I have carried DAs in the past... and I have carried them in condition 0, for as put by AK bhai, the heavy trigger pull of a DA pistol is a safety enough.\n\nFor people who have not trained/are not proficient in ccw usage, I don''t think the first 3 conditions are for them (counting 0 as the first condition).\n\n  Just my 2 cs.\n\n@faisji... nice to hear bro that u carry a 1911 on daily basis... :) yeh cheez! :) Which IWB holster do you use?

I respect your stance fully, inasmuch as I respect Dr. Zakir Sb''s for un-chambered carry. I agree with both of you, if the "danger zones" could be avoided as much as possible, leave alone chambered carry, the carrying itself is needless.\n\nI do not however agree with the higher risk of accidental discharge when carrying chambered, especially not from the hands of such experts, coz I still believe, the trigger of a gun will never pull itself. Hence, the gun is safe to carry, only the carrier himself is a danger.\n\nI must say, I do not advise the "sometimes chambering" stance at all. The habit has to be [I]singular[/I] and [I]uniform[/I], either carry chambered, or don''t carry chambered. The "sometimes" habit bears the risk that you may forget the status of your gun, either loading or unloading of same. Hence it may be un-chambered when you need it at the most, or remain chambered when you don''t need it all! Moreover, it will require more frequent chambering/unloading and hence higher risk of unintended discharge, irrespective of presence the decocker.\n\nRegards.[/QUOTE]\n\n[QUOTE=Denovo87;231853]Ak bro; most of the incidents of AD I heard about were by the hands of very expert gun handlers ;) secondly its not myself I am worried about but the people around me who I love and care,  since I carry my pc in car so even my driver who washes my car is my concern. \nIn society we live n the culture we have is a bit different than US & Europe where every one minds his own business but in our society every one like to find what other is doing (carrying).

You tell me honestly how many times you showed your weapon (or asked to show) to your friend, relative, colleague at other than a shooting range? for me it happens when ever some one close finds me with a gun. \n\nI even am afraid of handing over my chambered gun to a police man at a check post & un chambering a gun in front a police officers at a check post scares me more where they are quite ready to react on the sound of a slide rack. \n\nResponding a threat with un chambered gun will cost me an extra ''second'' but the same extra second can favor me in case my own gun goes into wrong/bad in a hold up situation; in this case I even will have more time as its me who knows the gun is empty not the offender ;)\n\nYes; when you are going through the circumstances where a threat can come from any direction & at any time; you are well justified to carry (a) a biggest possible chambered gun (b) with as bigger magazine as your gun allows & (c) as close as you possibly can.\n\nFor a social person with now known enmities, working class citizen traveling in urban area most of the times, going to civilized places mostly as a part of his job or the circle he moves in etc I dont think carrying a chambered gun is a wise decision. I see white collard people daily indulged in road rage and by seeing their vicious behavior I always thank God that none of the two opted to carry a chambered gun ;) so everything ends in [I][B]slinging the mobiles[/B][/I] to call backup instead of [I][B]slinging loaded Rami''s[/B][/I]  that would end one in police station n other in morgue ;)[/QUOTE]\n\n1+ Denovo bro,\n\ni agree with Faisji bro regarding having enough practice where your gun becomes an extension of you, but sir i wish we all could have the opportunity and the means of practicing to that level which in our dear Homeland is non existent.', 1, 1, '39.47.196.84', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

The prizes for this division win were a belt-buckle; gold and silver with saphires (small gems and electroplated I am certain, but it looks nice), and a Citadel M1911, imported to the US by Legacy Sports, International.  I understand this gun to be of Phillipine manufacture along the lines of Rock Island Armory.\r\n\r\n[url]www.legacysports.com[/url]\r\n\r\nThe factory stock pistol came with a extended beaver tail, raised grip safety, ambi-dexterous thumb safety, Novak style sights, and wooden grips.  The trigger was breaking rather clean at about 5 lbs, with a little creep.  For a free gun I wasn''t complaining.\r\n\r\nI had won a certificate for a fourth place finish in Single Stack at the Area 4 Championships from XS sights.  I placed my order for the XS standard dots with tritium inserts.  When they arrived, on they went.\r\n\r\n[url]www.xssights.com[/url]\r\n\r\nI had some VZgrips, Operators II, recently removed from my Kimber, so they went on.  Those looked really good.\r\n\r\n[url]http://vzgrips.com/gun-grips/1911-pistol-grips-1/operators-ii-2[/url]\r\n\r\nFinally I added a magwell from Wilson Combat, ordered from Midway USA.  I took a Dremel and file to that magwell to make it "just right."  It took removing a little material from the underneath side of the grips to match the "hooks" on the magwell, but that was as simple as tracing the outline and working it out with the Dremel tool.\r\n\r\nI noted that I wasn''t getting a positive engagement of the grip safety, I placed a small strip of aggressive skateboard tape over the bump on the grip safety which semi-permanently holds the grip safety down.  It''s also made the gun feel a little more secure in the hand.\r\n\r\nDuring some early test firing I found encountered a few rounds which nose-dived into the feed ramp.  I took the firearm to my gun smith and told him to do what he needed to ensure the rounds feed reliably.  He built up the mag catch a bit to raise the magazine higher in the gun and polished the feedramp.  Since then the only faliure to feeds have been with a specific magazine and I don''t attribute the error to the gun but rather an issue with that particular magazine.\r\n\r\nThe gun shoots great.  I have no complaints.  At 7 yards/21'' It will print a single hole if the shooter is up to the task.  I''ve shot 2" groups at 15 yards, resting my arms on my gun bag.  The trigger is not that of my Kimber Super Match II or my wife''s Kimber Custom II... but you won''t pay the same price either.  It''s been to the range a number of times for practice sessions and fired in one IDPA competition.  Until the sights were adjusted, it was shooting left, but now it fires right at point of aim.\r\n\r\nThe XS sights take some getting used to, but for quick sight acquisition they are just the trick.  The tritrium night sights make them a smart bed-stand or carry choice.  They line up like the letter, "i" with the front sight being a glowing dot, and the rear sight being a glowing straight line.\r\n\r\nFor a 1911 that can be had for about $500 US this was a surprisingly well crafted gun.  It had a little play with downward pressure on the barrel hood.  The factory allignment of the sights on the slide to the barrel was off and required some adjustment.  The trigger was the most notable part of the gun- very nice for a low end 1911.  My smith who mostly works as a 1911 trigger smith said it could use a little polishing but nothing of the trigger screamed for immediate work or replacement.\r\n\r\nIf you are looking for a entry level 1911 with very good for the money trigger and features, consider this 1911 from Citadel.', 1, 1, '139.76.224.66', 0, 1, 8, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

(231966, 7767, 231347, 'StevenCline', 912, '', 1324071113, 'Always Chambered.\r\n\r\nWhen the time comes to use deadly force you can''t have counted on situational awareness, tactics, mental acquity, or the time to chamber a round.  You should plan for it to sudden, loud, bloody, violent, messy, and frightening as hell.  You''ll want to be able to draw and shoot in as little time as possible with as little bother as necessary.  The more you have to do under the stress of you or your loved one''s dieing the next second the more you can muck up.  I think a Glock with chamber loaded or 1911 with big thumb safety well practiced is ideal.\r\n\r\nI think that if you fear the loaded gun you are likely admitting you need more practice. The practice buildings confidence and instills a certain sense of security.  That fear of the loaded gun is like dreams about drawing your gun to shoot a bad guy and the trigger feels like it''s a 2000 lb pull, the gun is not loaded, or the shots don''t stop the bad guy.  This is your puppy brain telling your conscious mind it wants more range time.  "Protect me, daddy" is what it is screaming.\r\n\r\nLaws differ from location to location, State by State here in the US.  But most of the time the law requires a "immediate" need.  If you really had time to draw and rack, was it immediate?  Maybe it wasn''t.  I think the idea that we carry because we only "might" need to use the handgun is deceiving.  We should carry as if we "know" we are going to need to use and thank God everynight when didn''t that day and every morning when we didn''t the night before.  Not having that mind set is leaving you open to the frozen mind that comes with not believing it can happen.  You should make the mental check a number of times a day- it can happen.  As you leave your house remind yourself that a bad guy might be encountered on the way to the car, not just in the car on the way to work.  Remind yourself at least once at work that anytime the door opens it could require a violent response to a violent attack.  As you leave work make the same life-saving reminder.  When the unexpected visitor darkens your entryway at home in the evening, prepare your mind for the worst and enjoy anything less.  \r\n\r\nBe polite to every stranger, but have a plan to kill them.  I know that sounds mean.  I know that sounds paranoid.  But in reality it makes me offer a polite greeting to all I met, they don''t know I''m considering shooting them, at least for a moment.\r\n\r\nSure, the heavy fighting might ought to be left to the hired guns, but ultimately you have the responsibility to save yourself and your loved ones.  If the hired guns fail, you don''t get to blame them, you have to blame yourself.  I am the last and final layer of protection, and reality, the only real layer of protection for me and mine.  The police arrive to photograph the blood stains.  I can''t afford highered guns.  But I can afford to practice at least once a week with live ammo and dry practice is free all the time.  What''s your life and those of your family worth to you?  Twenty draws and reload practices a week? Really, you can''t afford that?  Some dry fire trigger time while watching the news? A box of ammo once or twice a month even?

However, the webpage of one of its distributors is as under which gives the basic features:\n[URL]http://www.raacinc.com/index.php3?pageid=AkdalProducts.htm[/URL]\n\n@Hussain Ali, I am at Karachi, and bought it at Rs. 59K from Saddar Armoury, Lucky Star, Saddar, though the price quotes in the market vary to a considerable extent. Got the gun in .......... probably October, 2011. In Karachi you can get the quotes from 60k to 85k (for black colored gun), and if you don''t know inside out, you have to pay the price. This is the way Karachi armour market works. The largest dealer "Haris" (at DHA-2 Extension) advised me a price of Rs. 85K while innocently asserting that AKDAL MKA 1919 is available only with one mag. Perhaps they might be dealing in magz separately as well :p. You can understand what I mean. :) Anyway.\n\nPls note that black colored MKA 1919 is cheaper by almost Rs. 10k than the AKDAL MKA 1919 CAMO that is available in a camouflaged painting/color . However, there is no technical difference at all except for color''s variation......and to my choice black looks awesome.\n\nJust to point out, the prices of all guns at Karachi are always higher than the prices of Lahore and Islamabad by around Rs 5k to Rs. 10k. Therefore, buying at Rs. 59K, looks a good deal. :)\n\n@Armughan, jiggar you very well know why the gun has missed a detailed testing so far despite having been bought around 2-3 months back. :) I have a provincial license which, reportedly, is not so eagerly welcomed by Navy''s shooting club therefore, I have not tried that option. Waiting for my buddy Naval Commander who is on training at Lahore........as soon as he reverts, would try the club or hawksbay etc. Otherwise, let me visit Punjab with my guns ;) . Phir tu apni zameenain aur apni guns, you know :) .

It turned out to be my old [B]Stevens .22 LR[/B] rifle ! Hadn''t seen it in decades ! Seeing this rifle took me back many years, it was the first gun I remember shooting. I think I was 3 years old and had not even started school yet, every morning I got the treat to shoot 10 rounds of Winchester (the yellow box) in my front lawn. Those were the good old days and there were empty fields (which is now main DHA road) beyond my house in Cantt, Lahore. I looked at the Rifle closely and found it in a bad state. It had not been maintained or even touched for 20 years, was just lying around in stuff without a cover. Also when it fell, the sight broke. \n\nI thought for old time sake and nostalgia reasons this rifle deserves to be restored. You don''t see Stevens stuff around anymore as I  think 80 years ago or so it was merged into Savage Arms. This model was also  sold with Springfield and Savage stampings. A interesting fact which some  new friends might not know is that Stevens was the inventor of the .22  LR round. \n\nAnyway since I''m not the fiddling around type nor  interested in much beyond shooting firearms I thought I should hand over  the Stevens to our resident "Hands on Expert" [B]12G [/B]and present it as a  challenge.

I have not shot it but it seems to function fine. The Challenge details below:\n\n[B]The Budget : Rs. 25,000[/B]\n\nCondition 1). The rifle should look like it just rolled off the assembly line (heh heh) \nCondition 2). A Scope (Variable or 9x) needs to be fitted to it when it''s finished in the same budget.\nCondition 3). Not spending a Ruppee more than 25k. No cheating :nono:\nCondition 4). Time to build approx 45 days (Must be Finished by 1st of Feb 2012) \n\nOther than the 4 things above you have complete control over everything else.

I personally feel it to be relatively more concealable due to no rail (rail isn''t my priority) and sights are better than the 75D compact.\n\nIt weighs almost equal to a P07 duty. For me this was a big plus in favor of this gun being an all Aluminum made and weighing equal to a half plastic made gun.\n\nGun grips very nicely and looks very beautiful, everyone who held it liked it.

I paid about $275 US.  \r\n\r\nThese converstion kits are a complete upper which is placed onto your existing 1911''s frame and comes with one magazine.  The strongest selling point of these kits in my opinion are that they afford you trigger time on your favorite 1911- you shoot the same trigger, but with less recoil and for a whole lot less money.\r\n\r\nI quickly discovered why the kit was being resold used- many malfunctions.  But, unlike the previous owner I was unafraid to diagnose and fix the problem.  There was a lot of friction of the slide moving over the barrel hood during recoil.  So much so that it did not cycle fully and often did not pick up the next cartridge from the magazine.  I noted that by using a different slide stop the friction was reduced.  The "pin" portion of the slide stop was slightly smaller than that which came with the kit.  That did not completed reduce the malfucntions so out came the sand-paper.  After some time the slide was moving smoothly across the hood and the malfunctions ceased.\r\n\r\nThe kit is pretty much a standard 1911 configuration.  It has a slide which is milled from alluminum to make it lighter.  A barrell which is .45 caliber in circumference with a .22 caliber diameter hole.  A barrel bushing, recoild spring and guide rod complete the configuration.  The ejector on your 1911 .45 will not work on the .22.  Affixed to the barrel in an arm which extends rearward with a small extention on the end towards the center of the gun.  As the slide works rearward extracting in realtively normal fashion eventually the case strikes that small extention which acts as the ejector.\r\n\r\nI have fired probably 10,000 rnds through the conversion kit since it''s purchase.  When it becomes very dirty or dry the malfunctions start.  It is also very finicky to ammo and limp-wristing.  My kit perfers Federal ammo but not Winchester, and like most 1911s- the wetter the better.\r\n\r\nRecently I fired it for accuracy at 15 yards.  These shots were fired at 15 yards, standing, two-handed but otherwise unsupported at the “little blue man” on a B27 Law Enforcement target.  The target with 15 shots measures about 1.75” by 2.25”.  The second group of 11 shots measures 1.5” by 2.5”.  I hit the "little blue dude" with 13 out of 15 and 10 out of 11 respectively.\r\n\r\nThe Kimber .22LR conversion kit was mounted on a Citadel M1911 frame.  The ammo was Federal Target Grade .22LR, 36 grn.  It was 65 degrees and relatively still, and partially cloudy.\r\n\r\nIF available, I recommend the .22 conversion kits.  They provide a lot more shooting for the same ammo cost.  You benefit from shooting the same trigger.  Also, .22 competions are fun.  Children and adults both can learn to shoot on a low recoil, low report, low blast firearm allowing them to focus on fundamentals when full powder firearms may distract the shooter with the louder booms, more violent recoil and larger flash of gunpowder.', 1, 1, '139.76.64.66', 0, 1, 5, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

If threatened with a gun pointed at you there are but two choices.  1) Total Compliance: hope for the best, beg for mercy.  Leave the outcome largely to him.  Your actions will either tend to motivate the person with the gun to not shoot you if he is already inclined not to shoot you, or, shoot you if he is already inclined to shoot you.  2) Total War!  You move, you draw, and you fight!  You influence the outcome to the greatest degree you can.  Your actions will either tend to motivate the person with the gun to not shoot you if he is already inclined not to shoot you, or, shoot you if he is already inclined to shoot you.  You can not know and therefore cannot say that the fight option will make the person shoot you who was not going to shoot you.\r\n\r\nIf something indicates compliance would end the situation, I might opt for compliance.  If I had any indication he was headed toward violence then I would bring everything in my arsenal to change that end.\r\n\r\nWhat is for certain is that the act of chambering the round will delay your ability to influence the person pointing the gun at you.  Very few people can chamber that round in less than one second, most will add about 2 seconds to the situation... do we really wish to give the man pointing the gun at us two more seconds to shoot us?  I prefer not to.\r\n\r\n[quote]secondly it would be  individual confidence in carrying a chambered gun .[/quote]\r\nWith much respect I completely agree.  It should always remain an individual''s decision and persons on both sides of this discuss have no business declaring only one carry method should be exercised.  We can only offer our observations and opinions and let them decided.\r\n\r\n[quote]thirdly decision to carry a chambered weapon will also depend upon the circumstances , going to  a known danger zone where chances for encounter are more or traveling late at night   then chambered gun is preferable. as i am not dealing with these situations so i prefer to carry unchambered weapon.[/QUOTE]\r\n\r\nWith much respect, I agree again.

But, as far as LEA''s are concerned, one must keep in mind that they are seldom engaged in a firefight alone, while most of us ordinary folk end up going toe to toe with the bad guy all on our own. LEA''s can call upon immediate backup, us ordinary folk can''t. For example, I know for a fact that if someone barges into my house and, God forbid, a firefight ensues, I''ll have no armed backup for atleast 10 minutes. And I seriously doubt anyone needs to be told that 10 minutes in a gunfight is like bloody eternity!\n\nI think a lack of proper and/or professional handgun training facilities here in Pakistan is a major reason why people might be unconsciously afraid to carry chambered. A majority of folk here train on their own time with whatever resources they have available. That, plus the natural human mindset that the worse case scenario will never happen to you. I personally have experienced such a "worse case scenario", and the first thing that went through my mind was, [B]"How the hell can this be happening to ME!?"[/B] I was very lucky to have made it out of that situation unscathed, but it was certainly a very bitter lesson in real life.\n\nReal life can be sudden, sharp, and utterly unexpected with a heavy doze of absolute terror. How can you be sure you''ll have enough time to unholster your weapon, let alone rack the slide? What if you''ve been shot in your reaction arm, how can you be sure you''ll even manage to rack the slide with just one hand? How many of us actually practice firing supine or prone? How many of us practice firing accurately with simulated injuries? How many of us know how we''ll shoot when our veins are pumping more adrenaline than blood and our heart rate is hammering away at 180-200? Where in the cosmic rulebook does it say that the threat will openly present itself, give you ample amount of time to rack the slide of your weapon, get into the ideal firing stance with the perfect grip, and then start the engagement? Chivalry, ladies & gentlemen, exists only in fantasy and has no place on the battlefield. If someone is bent on causing me or mine harm, then I will do whatever is necessary to stop & eliminate the threat as quickly and effectively as possible. Plain & simple.\n\nI carry chambered because I have absolute faith in my firearm and complete confidence in my abilities.

Now I want to ask from senior members that what should be done as precautionary step before collecting the new card and surrendering my books to NADRA. \n\nThanks & Regards,\nAta[/QUOTE]\nBrother dont surrender your books until they gives you the card with perfect details on it.

But I still stand by my opinion that if a firearm is carried, then it should be done so in a "ready to rock" condition.\n\nPlease remember, it is [B]IMPOSSIBLE[/B] to anticipate when and to what degree things will go bad! One minute you''re going your merry way, the next moment all hell breaks loose. Yes, there are instances when it''s foolish not to be on your guard (like leaving a bank with a large amount of money or driving alone in a dangerous part of town), but what can guarantee that you won''t run into trouble even in the more "secure" places or times? Remember, complacency is the death of the brave; only when we feel the most secure are we the most vulnerable.\n\nI''ve personally had a [B]VERY [/B]scary experience where only  God''s grace and my mother''s prayers saved me. It happened in broad  daylight in one of the "safest" parts of town with absolutely no  warning, and I can tell you for a [B]FACT[/B]  that it was over in a matter of seconds! And within such a time frame, one [B]MUST[/B] be ready to retaliate immediately and effectively.\n\nIf someone feels uncomfortable or unsafe carrying a chambered weapon, then in my opinion they shouldn''t carry at all. A firearm is a piece of machinery which is specifically built for one purpose and one purpose only: [B]to kill![/B] If you''re unsettled by the thought that (God forbid) one day you might be forced to draw your weapon in your defense and take a life, then you might want to rethink the reason why you have that weapon in your possession in the first place. Your firearm may be a collector''s item or status symbol (believe me, I know of such idiots!), but first & foremost, it is a weapon meant to kill! You should [B]NOT[/B] be scared or feel uncomfortable of a firearm; yes they''re inherently dangerous but that''s why we have gun safety rules and are expected to follow them fanatically to the letter. Know your weapon intimately, know it like the back of your hand. No two guns are alike, even if they''re the same make & model. You should know each and every nook & cranny, every quirk & twitch of your weapon. Befriend your firearm and get to know your weapon inside & out; know it like a lover''s body because one day the only thing standing between you and a world of pain can be that same weapon. Train often & train hard, as much as you can. Spend as much as time with your firearm as possible; shoot it as regularly as you can in as many scenarios as you can think of, whether on a range or during some back forest plinking.\n\nI don''t have any "enemies" or immediate threats, yet I CC everyday, even when I''m at work or out for a walk or meeting friends & family. I don''t go around flaunting the fact that I''m packing heat, nor do I go around with an itchy trigger finger and a mad desire to shoot people. I consider myself a very calm person, and personally believe that all confrontations can be resolved quite peacefully. But that doesn''t mean that I won''t resort to "going hot" if my life or the lives of my loved ones is threatened in any way.\n\nPlease don''t get me wrong, I''m not belittling anyone''s preference or stance, but merely expressing my own personal opinion on the subject based on my own experiences. I''ve already had a gun pulled at me once because I was too bloody complacent to defend myself, like hell I''m gonna let that happen again.

But I still stand by my opinion that if a firearm is carried, then it should be done so in a "ready to rock" condition.\n\nPlease remember, it is [B]IMPOSSIBLE[/B] to anticipate when and to what degree things will go bad! One minute you''re going your merry way, the next moment all hell breaks loose. Yes, there are instances when it''s foolish not to be on your guard (like leaving a bank with a large amount of money or driving alone in a dangerous part of town), but what can guarantee that you won''t run into trouble even in the more "secure" places or times? Remember, complacency is the death of the brave; only when we feel the most secure are we the most vulnerable.\n\nI''ve personally had a [B]VERY [/B]scary experience where only  God''s grace and my mother''s prayers saved me. It happened in broad  daylight in one of the "safest" parts of town with absolutely no  warning, and I can tell you for a [B]FACT[/B]  that it was over in a matter of seconds! And within such a time frame, one [B]MUST[/B] be ready to retaliate immediately and effectively.\n\nIf someone feels uncomfortable or unsafe carrying a chambered weapon, then in my opinion they shouldn''t carry at all. A firearm is a piece of machinery which is specifically built for one purpose and one purpose only: [B]to kill![/B] If you''re unsettled by the thought that (God forbid) one day you might be forced to draw your weapon in your defense and take a life, then you might want to rethink the reason why you have that weapon in your possession in the first place. Your firearm may be a collector''s item or status symbol (believe me, I know of such idiots!), but first & foremost, it is a weapon meant to kill! You should [B]NOT[/B] be scared or feel uncomfortable of a firearm; yes they''re inherently dangerous but that''s why we have gun safety rules and are expected to follow them fanatically to the letter. Know your weapon intimately, know it like the back of your hand. No two guns are alike, even if they''re the same make & model. You should know each and every nook & cranny, every quirk & twitch of your weapon. Befriend your firearm and get to know your weapon inside & out; know it like a lover''s body because one day the only thing standing between you and a world of pain can be that same weapon. Train often & train hard, as much as you can. Spend as much as time with your firearm as possible; shoot it as regularly as you can in as many scenarios as you can think of, whether on a range or during some back forest plinking.\n\nI don''t have any "enemies" or immediate threats, yet I CC everyday, even when I''m at work or out for a walk or meeting friends & family. I don''t go around flaunting the fact that I''m packing heat, nor do I go around with an itchy trigger finger and a mad desire to shoot people. I consider myself a very calm person, and personally believe that all confrontations can be resolved quite peacefully. But that doesn''t mean that I won''t resort to "going hot" if my life or the lives of my loved ones is threatened in any way.\n\nPlease don''t get me wrong, I''m not belittling anyone''s preference or stance, but merely expressing my own personal opinion on the subject based on my own experiences. I''ve already had a gun pulled at me once because I was too bloody complacent to defend myself, like hell I''m gonna let that happen again.

I have scouted many fields and this particular one had the corn harvested recently, so there is some fresh corn left behind on which the ducks are feeding heavily. today I bought some 20 ft of Burlap and used some tent poles to put the cloth over them. I ended up with a light weight, portable blind yet big enough for two people. I also got Spray Paint Can in Back color which I will spray on the burlap to make some shadows, branches, camo etc. Will take it out this upcoming weekend and will post the results.\nThanks,\n Bigbore', 1, 1, '50.92.184.142', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

It is grey-buff to pinkish-grey overall, a little darker above than below, with a blue-grey underwing patch. The tail feathers are grey-buff above, and dark grey tipped white below; the outer tail feathers also tipped whitish above. It has a black half-collar edged with white on its nape from which it gets its name.\n The Collared Dove is not wary and often feeds very close to human habitation, including visiting bird tables; the largest populations are typically found around farms where spilt grain is frequent around grain stores or where livestock are fed. It is a gregarious species and sizable winter flocks will form where there are food supplies such as grain (its main food) as well as seeds, shoots and insects. Flocks most commonly number between ten and fifty, but flocks of up to ten thousand have been recorded.\n Most of you would be familiar with the unique Coo-coo-Coo of the dove. The Collared Dove is much larger in size than the Mourning Dove in America (The most hunted game bird in the US annually), and the local Palm Dove"totru"\n It makes a perfect table bird, and the meat has a distinct taste. There are many delicious possibilities ranging from Barbequed doves, to Khuggi Pulao, dove roast, etc.\n \n.Where to see them:\n\nJust about anywhere, but often around towns and villages. They''re common visitors to gardens and parks. After they have fed, they can be seen swarming electricity cables in the countryside as well as urban areas. If you''re out shooting these with a rimfire or air rifle, the best time to get these would be 10-12 AM and 3-5 PM, just when they have filled their tummies and feel like absorbing some sunlight.\n\nIf you want to hunt them in an open area, scatter a lot of grain in the field, they''ll fall for it no matter what. Few birds shot in the beginning would do perfectly as decoys. \n\n.What they eat:\n\nSeeds and grain.\n\n\nThis thread has been started to gather information about collared doves,  your own personal experience of them of shooting them, pics of the hunt, and a lot of recipes!\n\nHere are a few pics...

Here I would like to share some of my impresssions about the gun.\r\nThe CEO at Baksh Elahi told me that they are not sure about the origin of this gun as it is either Turkey or Portugal (I confirmed subsequently that they are being manufactured in Turkey under licence, however I am still not sure about Portugal). I also confirmed that the guns are then shipped to England UK for final proofing by the Company. The gun came in hard plastic casing slightly larger than Beretta but with Average finish. The box included the gun , a set of five chokes, wrench and the manual . \r\nSpecs:\r\nGuage- 12 \r\nweight- Approx 3.6 kgs\r\nTrigger- Single Selective in Gold ( trigger pull 3.7 lbs for upper and 3.5 lbs for lower barrel as claimed by manufacturer)\r\nEjectors- Yes\r\nRibs- Ventilated at top and middle\r\nChokes- Cyl, IC, M, IM and Full.\r\nMy first impression was that from outside the gun appeared elegant but little large. It had a top mounted safety lever which functions both as safety and barrel selector. Here the manufacturer could have done a better job for the sake of the optics. The gun employs a conventional Box lock action built on mono block principle. The Box lock action is with minimal no of parts with considerable simplification in cocking and ejecting. The muzzle is threaded to accept extended choke tubes which when installed protrude 25mm ahead of muzzle end. each choke is marked for steel or no steel. The forearm and the buttstock are nicely finished in Turkish Walnut with a little darker shade . The front sight is an illuminated bead which is good for easy acquiring. The recoil is considerably good and recovery for the second shot is perfect.\r\nI have been taking this gun out at the Skeet Range for last three weeks (once a week) and my impression is:\r\nAs far as the looks are concerned it is better than average however it does offer all the features which are currently popular in sporting guns. The balance is good and being a little heavier gives a good follow through. The trigger pull is satisfactory compared to beretta and the ejection is smooth and good (threw empty shells slightly over a meter). The performance of the gun made me comfortable since I have been achieving an average result of 22-23 out of 25 at the range. The gun handles well for the value of money costs slightly over 600 Pounds sterling in UK and i paid approx Rs 120000/- some images', 1, 0, '39.45.169.240', 0, 1, 4, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

It has happened to me many times that I keep missing the same bird again & again, and pellets are so stupidly dispersed that the bird doesn''t even realize that its being shot at.\n\nAnd do note that if you are able to hit bulls eye with a match pellet, Pro mags will still be missing, as each pellet type has its own physics involved, and trajectories are never the same. So you have to make sure that your gun is at perfect "zero" for the pellet which you will be using during the hunting.\n\nSince you are using 350 Mag, if you can get good results with match pellets on paper, knocking birds off will get fun as there is too much power in the pellet fired by a 350 mag.

Gauge is determined from the weight of a solid sphere of lead that will fit the bore of the firearm, and is expressed as the multiplicative inverse of the sphere''s weight as a fraction of a pound (e.g., a 1&#8260;12th pound ball fits a 12-gauge bore). Thus there are twelve 12-gauge balls per pound (etc.). The term is related to the measurement of cannon, which were also measured by the weight of their iron round shot; an 8 pounder would fire an 8 lb (3.6 kg) spherical cast iron ball and had a bore diameter of about 91 mm (3.6 in).'' copied from wikipedia. \ngauge and bore is one and the same thing. its actually we Pakistani wrongly speak ''tees-bore'' in reality internationally its thirty caliber or .30th inch. such is the case is for SMG, internationally smg refers to mp5 or any sub compact rapidfire gun where as in Pakistan it refers to Chinese AK47. also one more example, German Shepherd dog(GSD) and Alsation are one and the same thing but in Pakistan we refer alsation to local breed bhagyari or an east german line GSD as alsation or any dog that resembles jackal or wolf. :)', 1, 1, '182.178.58.73', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

Some will state that this later case is not correct.\n\nExample:\nan M1 Garand fires a bullet having a diameter of .308"\nan AK-47 fires a bullet having a diameter of .311"\nThey are both referred to as being .30 caliber rifles.\n\nThe bore of the gun is the inside of the barrel (like a "hole," it''s not actually anything concrete, but where stuff is missing) it can also refer to the inside walls of the barrel ("there is rust in the bore")\n\nMost barrels have rifling, which is also described as "Lands and grooves" the lands are the areas sticking up, and the groves are the areas pressed (or cut) away.\nIf you imagine a cross-section of a gun barrel now, you would see something like a circle with a "gear tooth" edge. (remember that the metal is on the outside of this shape, not inside it) You could draw one circle touching the tops of the lands, following the inside shape (cutting off the teeth), and one circle touching the bottoms of the grooves (making the circle as big as the teeth).\nThe diameter of the smaller circle (measured from the tops of the lands) is the Bore Diameter. It is the largest round thing you could pass through the barrel, without having to miss-shape it to make it fit.\nThe diameter of the larger circle (taken from the bottoms of the groves) is the Groove Diameter. This represents pretty much the largest thing you can pass through the barrel, and whatever you push through it, will be cut, or pressed into by the lands of the barrel sticking up, in its way. Bullets, for the most part, are this diameter.\nCaliber USUALLY refers to this larger size, and thus, too the diameter of the bullets used in the barrel too.\n\nTo give an example (I think these numbers are correct, but I have not verified them):\nIf you have a .30-06, the bullet 308/1000 of an inch (.308") passes through the barrel, which has a BORE of .300" and a grove diameter of .308".\nIf you have a .50 BMG, the bullet .510" passes through a barrel with a bore of .500", and a groove diameter of .510"\n\nUnless you are involved in some technical aspect respecting firearms, most people will use the bullet''s diameter "Caliber" to describe both the barrel and the bullet, because one number for everything is much easier for everyone involved.\n\n\nAs for bullets and weird sizes, I''ll add to that: Why do they use numbers that don''t reflect anything accurately?\nYou will find, in many cases, that weapons firing bullets of seemingly similar calibers, even if from different cartridges, are, in fact, the same [COLOR=#366388]caliber bullet[/COLOR]. Markets usually don''t reinvent the wheel. The .30-06, .308, .300 Win Mag, and .30-30 (I believe) all use the same .308" standard. similarly, 6mm and .243 cartridges are using the same caliber, and most center-fire (not rim-fire) .22s are using the .224" bullet. These include the .22-250, .220 Swift, .223 Remington (aka 5.56mm x45/NATO) and more.\nI''ve always found it interesting to note that, while it makes sense to round .308" to a nice, round "thirty," that the actual metric equivalent to that is 7.82mm, and that the no-less-complex 7.62 is simply a nice, round "thirty" in inches.\nDespite what I state here, if you''re dealing with foreign cartridges, you will often find them using similar but different actual diameters. (the British .303 is something like .312" and the AK-47 is .311" I believe)\nAlso worth mentioning is that the .38 is a .357" and the .44 is a .429". Sometimes they''re not that close.\nThe best advice I can give you with stated calibers and cartridge names is: memorize them, and realize they can lead you astray.\n\nI hope this gives you more understanding than confusion.', 1, 1, '182.177.159.29', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

The next day I tried culling some crows/kites but was missing simply every shot. This missing had been going on since a month or so, when my stock of other imported pellets ran out.... and I was just relying on Gamo Pro Mags bought from Pindi. These pellets are totally rubbish, no doubt. I have done a brief review on them too, too lazy to post the link here, but you can scroll down my threads if interested in reading it. Not a big fan of punching paper, finally today I decided to punch some... oh yeah, I did some target shooting yesterday too, but the pellets were dispersed all over the A4 sheet of paper. \n Don''t know of the airgun is zeroed or not, probably slight error remains, but I''ll get that done once I get hold on some good imported pellets. I shot many pellets without clicking the ''slight adjustment screws or whatever they are called'' just to see the grouping at 10 yards. I am not using a scope, but am going to get one soon.\n I was shocked after shooting about 50 pellets or so and seeing that even 2 consistent shots weren''t grouping together. One would go too above the center, the next too right, one would be near the center, and so on (I mean I was getting +6 inch groups at 10 yards)... At this point I was thinking about the deep trouble I was stuck in. Then opened my inventory to see if any other pellets were left, just had those stupid H&N Rabbit Magnum II pellets (24.69 grains) which are too heavy and in-accurate. Borrowed a few Crosman Copperhead Wadcutters from my brother, and started punching some paper again... This time I was quite relieved with the results achieved. Though I was not shooting very carefully, just checking the grouping, shot 8 pellets and they grouped quite well (of course there was some human error). After this I tested my H&N rabbit mags, the grouping was again similar to the rubbish named ''Gamo pro magnums'', all disperesed over the target and about half a feet under the center of the intended target. I have also written a brief writeup on these pellets a couple of months ago, describing them and their lack of accuracy.\nWell here are the pics;\nDiana RWS 350 MAGNUM (Classic/Feuerkraft)\n[IMG]http://i1203.photobucket.com/albums/bb399/B77W/TargetSHooting001.jpg[/IMG]\nThe setup\n[IMG]http://i1203.photobucket.com/albums/bb399/B77W/TargetSHooting003.jpg[/IMG]\nNone other than the rubbish, Gamo P.Ms\n[IMG]http://i1203.photobucket.com/albums/bb399/B77W/TargetSHooting002.jpg[/IMG]\nThe groups on the left are with a the 350, on the right with my Rainbow 35, both not exactly zeroed, just to see the groupings, majority of the ones going out of the circles being the Rainbow 35 shots.\n[IMG]http://i1203.photobucket.com/albums/bb399/B77W/TargetSHooting004.jpg[/IMG]\n350''s scattered shots\n[IMG]http://i1203.photobucket.com/albums/bb399/B77W/TargetSHooting005.jpg[/IMG]\nAnother target\n[IMG]http://i1203.photobucket.com/albums/bb399/B77W/TargetSHooting006.jpg[/IMG]\nThe other side of it\n[IMG]http://i1203.photobucket.com/albums/bb399/B77W/TargetSHooting007.jpg[/IMG]\nHere we''ve got the irregular grouping of Rabbit Magnum pellets..

What I have guessed is that the pellets I use (Gamo Pro Mags) are the cause. There is no choice in the market except Irani, Gamo Match and Pro magnums, the Irani ones and Gamo P.Ms being illegible for powerful airguns, they only choice left is Gamo Match. Will try those in a couple of days. The only solution to this problem is getting different top-end pellets and checking them for accuracy in each of your air-rifles, and stock up the best (in terms of accuracy)... Don''t know whether this is feasible because you won''t often go abroad for these and relatives won''t be arriving every month.\n Will Crosman Premier hollow points and domed pellets give me more accuracy, because I''m about to order them from USA.

If the rabbit does not sit still, I say so much the better. In this case it will take a true marksman to nail the game. Mind you, a shotgun has its place. Next time why not leave the shotgun at home and take a 22LR instead? If you don’t have a 22LR, it is a very good time to consider buying one. The investment will outlast you and many generations to come in your family. Don’t forget, 22LR is cheaper to shoot than any center fire ammunition. Shotgun kicks like a mule. The 22LR does not - essentially no recoil. \n \nThe true champion in the shooting and hunting sport is the world-renowned 22LR. Other calibers have come and gone.

Let''s start with the mechanics of the gun. With exception of the bore and the chambers in the cylinder, your revolver doesn''t know the difference between dry fire and live fire. The internal parts all get exercised the same except you are much more likely to damage a gun from dry firing. \n\nDry firing to break a gun in is not wise. Yes, a few parts will smooth up but mostly what you are doing is wearing all the parts prematurely. Here''s an analogy that is a bit over dramatic using 60 grit sand paper and assuming the surfaces of the sandpaper represent the mating surfaces of internal parts. Start by placing the sandpaper with the rough sides facing each other. This would represent a mating surface in your gun where both parts are rough. Rub the two pieces of sandpaper together and soon you will see both pieces have worn the roughness off each other. Both pieces will be notably smoother but way thinner, indicating considerable wear. Now place the rough surface of one sheet of sandpaper against the smooth back on another sheet and rub them together. This would simulate a rough part rubbing on a smooth part inside your gun. As you continue to rub them together, the smooth surface now becomes rough and the rough surface stays about the same. For internal parts, that means the smoother mating surface becomes rougher and wears, but not as fast as if both surfaces were rough. Last, place the sheets of sandpaper back-to-back with the smooth surfaces facing each other. You can rub a long time with minimal wear and in fact you will polish the surfaces. This simulates two smooth parts rubbing together. When you dry fire or live fire, the parts behave much the same as the sandpaper. If you start off by smoothing the parts mating surfaces, wear is minimized and the gun will last much longer. If you dry fire to break a gun in, don''t expect it to last near as long.\n\nThe reason why dry firing causes more damage is twofold. First, people tend to be a bit more aggressive when pulling the trigger in DA or cocking the hammer in SA when they dry fire. This makes the cylinder rotate very fast and come to an abrupt halt when the cylinder latch contacts the cylinder''s lock notches. This peens the lock notches and the frame''s "window" for the cylinder latch. It doesn''t take long and the cylinder lock-up becomes loose. Additionally, the hand pushes a ratchet to rotate the cylinder. These two surfaces wear which retards cylinder timing (carry-up) and the faster you operate the gun, the faster they will wear.\n\nThe second issue with dry firing is purely in the numbers. You are more likely to dry fire a thousand times than to live fire a thousand rounds so the revolver is subjected to more repetitions. Usually internal wear has more to do with how you dry than the number of times you dry fire. If you pull the trigger or hammer more slowly, you will minimize peening the cylinder and frame. Lubrication does not prevent peening.\n\nNow for "Snap-Caps". These have to be about the most worthless things ever made and even worse, they give the owner a false sense of security. Snap-Caps do absolutely nothing for the gun''s internal parts. Yes, they do cushion the firing pin but they don''t even do a good job of that. Ruger''s firing pins are made of a copper and steel alloy that are nearly immune to breaking so it is very rare to see one break. Snap-Caps are worth using in the older single and double barrel shotguns where firing pins are more subject to breaking. In modern guns, they do absolutely nothing except to occupy space in the chamber instead of a live round.\n\nRuger''s manuals say it''s OK to dry fire but what they really mean is you won''t break parts (especially the firing pin) by dry firing. They do not address excessive or improper dry firing that causes wear or damage. Normal dry firing for training or doing a function test on your revolver is not a problem but sitting in front of the TV and clicking away countless times is. When I had my gunsmith shop, it was pretty common for customers to bring in guns with excessive wear. When I asked them how much the gun had been fired, I often got an answer like "I''ve only fired a couple boxes through it". My next question was about dry firing where I usually got some dumb look instead of an answer.', 1, 1, '202.125.149.250', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

It is quite light somewhere around 3 kg bcuz of the extensive plastic used. Most of the mechanism is just like M-16, bolt stop and release, manual safety and carrying handle etc. Because of its shape and style, I guess its main purpose is for LEA and HD and its not for ALL types of hunting. I have purchased it for HD purpose and I am satisfied with it, so far. I am not reproducing here the technical specifications of the gun from some website, barrel length blah blah, everybody can read it on web.\n \n[b]Ammunition used[/b]\n \nI fired total 55 shots on Sunday and details of ammo are:\n \nSellier & Bellot, Czech Republic, special slugs – 10\nOlympia, Cyprus, Buckshots – 10\nShaheen SG/LG – 25\nShaheen No. 4 – 10\n\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]6886[/ATTACH] \n\n[b]Reliability[/b]\n \nOnly one time it FTFeed, it was Olympia Cyprus buckshot. First five went flawlessly but when the second mag was being fired then 2[SUP]nd[/SUP] or 3[SUP]rd[/SUP] (don’t exactly recall) got stuck while being fed into barrel, I ejected it and remaining went just fine. So, only one FTFeed in total of 55 shots with absolutely no FTE and FTFire. It makes it 98.18% reliable on Sunday. \n \nI had already fired 46 Shaheen No. 4 with this gun which also had only one FTFeed. No FTE and no FTFire then too. So, in total, I fired 101 shots with no FTE, FTFire and only two FTFeed which makes it 98.02% reliable. \n \nI guess that only two FTFeeds in 101 shots are bcuz of some problem in the cartridge and not any problem in the gun itself, otherwise it would have stuck much more often. \n \nAs can be read above, many types of ammo was used so gun’s virtually perfectly cycling the ammo gives the hint of the strength of the gun for all types of ammo.\n \nI don’t how do you guys measure reliability but it was simple mathematics from my side. I apologize if I didn’t do it correctly or missed out the whole hell of a main point.\n \n[b]Accuracy[/b]\n \nAnd time of “another” disclaimer …\n \n[b]Disclaimer No. 3[/b] … [i]This target shooting was my first time ever with any type of the gun. Earlier, I had just fired the guns with no aim, whatsoever, just firing straight on the mountain bushes and not knowing where it actually hit. So any haphazard formations of hits on the targets are entirely my fault. Gun should not be blamed … [/i] :D\n \nMy target sheets were simple made. Took some print-outs on A4 page of targets available on net (linked somewhere in pakguns) and then pasted them on simple charts bought from a Bookshop. When I first aimed at the middle of the target then I felt that my left arm was swaying like I was “moving” my arms on Salman Ahmad’s Jazba song in Imran Khan’s Jalsa and I doubted that if I was ever be able to hit the chart, what to talk about target. But, however, somehow managed to save my honor and below are the results. \n \nFirst went 5 S&B Slugs from 25+ meters. My first ever shot on target was some 4-5 inches up and right to the centre of the target which made me feel better that I am not THAT bad though it tore off some part of the chart. Second shot went more up and right and completely tore off the part of chart. So, I placed the chart upside down and fired next three shots which are clearly visible in the picture below. I was not only pleased to hit the target and near around it but was also pleased that the gun is accurate. Here goes the picture:\n\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]6887[/ATTACH]\n \nNext came 5 Shaheen SG/LG from 20+ meters. Result speaks of itself, first full chart picture and then close up of spread.\n\n\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]6888[/ATTACH][ATTACH=CONFIG]6889[/ATTACH]\n \nThen again came 5 Shaheen SG/LG from 20+ meters and again results were good, to my standards. Here is full chart picture and close-up of spread.\n\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]6890[/ATTACH][ATTACH=CONFIG]6891[/ATTACH]\n \n \n5 S&B Slugs again. All remained below the “belt” but nonetheless accuracy of gun got established, I guess. Here is full chart picture and close-up of spread.\n\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]6892[/ATTACH][ATTACH=CONFIG]6893[/ATTACH]\n \nTime for 5 Olympia buckshots.  Rapid fire from 35+ meters. I was having difficulty in re-aiming after each shot in rapid fire, first bcuz there was no “target point” in the chart to aim at and second I was not getting adjusted so fast after recoil to aim again. Anyhow, Spread took the whole of the chart, everywhere, literally. \n \n[ATTACH=CONFIG]6894[/ATTACH]\n \n[b]Comparison with Saiga 12[/b]\n \nNow this is the difficult part. I don’t want to sound “blasphemous” comparing it with saiga but in Pakistan these are the only two mag fed shotguns, so I have no choice but to compare them. \n \nSaiga has ALL SUPERIORITY over MKA1919 being from the AK47 family and who does not love AK47. \n \nSaiga comes with 8 fed mag and extandable to not only 12 but also drum of 20 is available but for MKA1919 I have not seen any extendable mag in Pakistan, though saw a 10 fed mag in a youtube video, and love to have two of such.\n \nMKA1919 is almost half of the price of Saiga in Pakistan, so I guess, keeping in view the budget constraint of most of us, taste of saiga can be availed thru buying MKA1919.\n \n[b]Conclusion[/b]\n \nAs per my little understanding of the subject, this gun is quite reliable and accurate and this is the stuff shotgun lovers should have for HD purpose.\n\n[b]Disclaimer No. 4[/b] ...

For the friends coming from punjab by road or if some body comes by air and lands at sukkur , it would be feasible to cross the khairpur larkana bridge on river indus and than take the route of dadu/ karachi and after crossing waggan & nasirabad towns they would be on the way to mehar and from there the link road laeding to faridabad would take them to the gartal.\n    the guests had arrived one day before the scheduled programme and were made comfortable in the tent city used by arab royals for their hunt in this area. they alredy had their hunting  trip completed few days back. there was a light musical programme during night also.\n the shooting started in early hours when the visibility got clear . the targets were set up at the distance of 400 meters. it was previously decided to allow 3 shots to each contestant but as the number of contestants was only 26 thus it was decided to allow each shooter a string of 5 shots \n\n      after the   firing session , the score was calculated and following compititors secured the positions as under;\n\n      1.

With the In-Line Inertia Driven System, the burned propellant residue and gases are shot out of the barrel, for a cleaner action.\r\n\r\n[url=http://postimage.org/image/3kb7betav/][img]http://s15.postimage.org/3kb7betav/inline_inertia_detail.jpg[/img][/url]\r\n\r\n\r\n[size=150][u][b]QuadraFit Plus System[/b][/u][/size]\r\n\r\nThe QuadraFit Buttstock Module customizing system allows easy adjustment of drop, cast, comb height and length-of-pull in a matter of minutes, with no tools required. The polymer QuadraFit Buttstock Module with ComforTech Plus connects directly to the receiver by a simple turn-and-lock, steel-to-steel attachment. \r\n\r\n\r\nhttp://i970.photobucket.com/albums/ae189/azamkakar/Picture042.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[size=150][u][b]Packing:[/b][/u][/size]\r\n\r\nVinci comes in a beautiful blue oblong custom plastic carry case of good quality. The gun is broken down into the 3 major components already. The first component is the stock, the 2nd is the barrel bolt combination already together, and the 3rd is the trigger assembly/forearm/magazine. Inside the case following items are included with the gun; \r\n\r\n- 5 Optima chokes ( F, IM, M, IC, C )\r\n- Shims\r\n- Benelli oil \r\n- Choke key\r\n- Sling swivel studs\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[size=150][u][b]Finish, Looks & Quality:[/b][/u][/size]\r\n\r\nThe gun looks beautiful in its ergonomic shape and rubberized finish. As far as quality is concerned I guess that it must have been made with the best quality raw materials available\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i970.photobucket.com/albums/ae189/azamkakar/Picture012.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[size=150][u][b]Grip & Stock[/b][/u][/size]\r\n\r\nBenelli''s V-Grip has a non-slip surface that is molded into the synthetic material of the forearm and pistol-grip offers a more secure hold of the weapon.\r\nThe stock can be simply removed (or swapped), which is easily adapted to fit by means of shims which alter cast and drop\r\n\r\nThe stock incorporates Benelli’s ComforTech Plus recoil reduction system.\r\n\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i970.photobucket.com/albums/ae189/azamkakar/Picture023.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[size=150][u][b]Action & Barrel:[/b][/u][/size]\r\n\r\nThe Vinci Free-floating barrel system operates on the same principle applied on high-performance bolt-action rifles thus ensuring outstanding ballistic accuracy. \r\n\r\nThe lug less design of the free-floating barrel leans on the Receive Module through a flat base   which allows for natural vibration of the barrel and virtually non-existent muzzle climb.\r\n\r\nThe chrome lined, steel proofed barrel is topped off with vented 5mm rib and red high visibility extended bead and flows into the integral bolt-housing. The bolt  is incredibly smooth in function and feel.\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i970.photobucket.com/albums/ae189/azamkakar/Picture018.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[size=150][u][b]Trigger:[/b][/u][/size]\r\n\r\nstraighter trigger pull that is more like a rifle than a traditional shotgun.\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i970.photobucket.com/albums/ae189/azamkakar/Picture019.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[size=150][u][b]Balance and Recoil:[/b][/u][/size]\r\n\r\nI found the recoil to be very soft, even lighter than Beretta A 400 Xplor. The gun is very balanced with natural swing as the weight is at the center of the gun where it is supposed to be i.e between the shooter’s hands.\r\n\r\nBenelli claims that with “Benelli’s ComforTech Plus recoil reduction system, offering a drop at comb and heel of 13/8” and 2” with a standard length of pull set at 14¼”, the gel chevron inserts, sculpted recoil pad and gel comb expand and contract dissipating the recoil in a sideways direction and away from the shooter’s shoulder hence making the felt recoil considerably less than many gas-valve driven shotguns”.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[size=150][/size][u][b]Sights:[/b][/u]\r\n\r\nRed front fiber optic bead (receiver tapped and drilled for mounting)\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i970.photobucket.com/albums/ae189/azamkakar/Picture029.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[size=150][u][b]Magazine:[/b][/u][/size]\r\n\r\nThe magazine tube holds three shells. It has a release button that allows you to remove shells from the mag without cycling the bolt.\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i970.photobucket.com/albums/ae189/azamkakar/Picture032.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[size=150][u][b]Safety Mechanism:[/b][/u][/size]\r\n\r\nThe safety is recessed into the trigger housing in front of the trigger and is a tight push to move from safe to fire.\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i970.photobucket.com/albums/ae189/azamkakar/Picture016.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[size=150][u][b]Reliability:[/b][/u][/size]\r\n\r\nExtremely reliable gun. Took it out NIB and fired and fired a couple of hundred rounds with almost no FTF & FTE.\r\n\r\n\r\n[size=150][u][b]Maintenance:[/b][/u][/size]\r\n\r\nThe internals of the gun have been made very simple and cleaning of the gun definitely make life easier\r\n\r\nWith this gun, hunters and shooters can go for longer periods in between cleaning sessions as is it not gas operated which leaves very little residue in the operating system.\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i970.photobucket.com/albums/ae189/azamkakar/Picture004.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i970.photobucket.com/albums/ae189/azamkakar/DSCF2875.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\n\r\nPrice:\r\n\r\nThe gun is currently selling just over 300k.', 1, 0, '210.2.171.170', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

Me n 7mm disassembled the pistol and it was fine (not best though), pistol lacked in outer finish. Magazine was very finely finished and smoothly working. Pistol also lacked in good grip.

Due to the vastness of the terrain, and many other factors, this is not practical.

(234086, 7849, 0, 'Moeen', 704, 'Project CZ 75 TS (Tactical Sports)', 1325009844, 'Salam All,\nA little over a year ago (Nov. 2010), I purchased a CZ75TS (Tactical Sports), at that time I had also placed an order with a dealer for the Sig Sauer X6 PPC Edition.  Upon picking up the CZ 75 TS, I realized that this gun has a lot of potential if one can invest a little more time and money.  I had also ordered custom trigger, adjustable rear sight, magwell housing, base pads for it.  I had them installed and the gun really looked good aesthetically and worked even better making the trigger even more crisp.  Upon shooting it at the range I along with two other colleagues realized that there was no longer a need for the Sig Sauer X6 and we hoped that the dealer wouldn''t get them in as we were committed to buy should the X6s have arrived.\nThen I jumped the gun by selling it off to a dear brother of mine, who was all too happy to take my customized CZ 75 TS home.  I jumped the gun by waiting for the CZ 75 CzechMate, which arrived after three months or so, I remember rushing off to the dealer to pick it up.  At the dealer I was really dismayed when I saw that the CzechMate was only available with two magazines rather than the four in quantity stated; furthermore, there were no extra two in quantity barrels with the CzechMate.  Talk about a disappointing day for me.  To add insult to injury the dealer wouldn''t lower the price (380000/rs).  Later on I found out that he did sell it off to another friend of mine for 330000/rs.\nAbout a little over a month ago I received a call from my dear brother Malik Fayaz of Hira Arms, Nila Gumbad, Lahore.  He asked me to come down and make a visit to him as he had something to show me.  I went and low-and-behold he puts a fully loaded (ALL Options Included) CZ 75 CzechMate in front of me.  He states "Do you want this?  I remember you wanted one."  I stated yes by taking out my check book and proceeded to write him his check.  On the way out Malik Fayaz tells me he needs me to drop by his house as there is something else he has there for me which he promised me over a year and a half ago!  We get to his home and WOW again... he gifts me a Walther PPK in .22lr.  He tells me "Moeen Jee, I never forgot I owed you this gun, now give me your license so I can enter this weapon as well and you can be on your way, otherwise you are welcome to stay here at my house."  I quickly took out my license and got the pistol entered and then hauled ass home to Isb..  Thank you again Fayaz bhai. \nAfter reaching home, tired as much as I was I still couldn''t go to sleep till I held the CzechMate for a while.  The next day upon waking up and with the heart beat back down to normal, I took the CzechMate out again and started to go through its things.  I saw that the rear sight is still the fixed model (disappointing), the trigger is still plastic (very disappointing), and lastly the compensator unit doesn''t have a front sight blade (very very disappointing).  So what was the main difference between the CzechMate and the TS I had customized?  A holographic sight?  Extra barrels which I probably will never need?  Whatever!  I still have a CzechMate... the little voice in my head was trying to convince me.  Then something happened which made the little voice in my head SHUTUP.\nI went to the range with my old customized CZ75TS and with my new CZ75 CzechMate.  I found out that both were giving me the same recoil.  The open sighted TS was also very quick in dropping the plates as was the CzechMate BUT the CzechMate was giving me problems with the dot as - further the distance the more harder to control the red dot over the target becomes.  That red dot C-More was doing the disco bogalloo all over the place.  Aside from that I couldn''t notice anything different.  I got home and took both guns apart trying to figure out what makes the CzechMate better or different than the TS.  I found out that the TS frame is longer and that toward the muzzle, the TS has a nice one inch Steel lip to give it more front weight/balance; the CzechMate has this entire area cut along with the slide so one can either install a compensator (with out a front sight) or  a bushing with a front sight.  It all equals out to the same muzzle end weight; but I will put my bet down on a muzzle heavy gun verses compensated guns as they are ammo sensitive.  Now someone please try to make me understand this logic: I paid a pretty penny on a gun which looks great and I want to shoot it with the variable options given; however, those option(s) don''t add up!  For example, I want to shoot open sights but with compensator - I can''t.  I can go on but won''t.  [B]DISAPPOINTING.[/B]\nSo I got rid of the CzechMate quickly, as it still is a desirable piece.  I then proceeded to locate another TS.  It turns out the person I had sold my TS to had his original one still in box unfired/untouched.  I purchased that from him and off I went.  MY MISSION: to make a TS which will COST WELL UNDER 300000/rs AND WILL MELT ANY CZECHMATE PUT DOWN BESIDE IT IN LOOKS AND IN USE - ANYDAY AND ANY PLACE.  This TS will include my option(s) to use the open sights AND also allow me to indulge in the pleasure of the optic sights whenever wanted.  [B]GAME ON![/B]\n \nI ordered the following:[LIST=1]\n[*]Rear Adjustable sights.\n[*]CzechMate style hammer.\n[*]Grips.\n[*]Magwell.\n[*]Basepads.\n[*]A custom Trigger from CZ CUSTOM.\n[*]A rear slide racker/optics mount from CZ CUSTOM.\n[*]Burris Fast Fire II optics.\n[*]SS recoil rod and plug.\n[*]Two in quantity, recoil springs.\n[/LIST]I then proceeded to sand blast the frame as I have always hated that crappy silver finish (a real B***h to remove), then I had the frame blued in the matt black finish.  Rather than putting everyone to sleep - I will let the pictures do the talking for me.  Followed by a video at a later date.  Enjoy, as I am very happy and content now.  And currently looking for a CzechMate to turn green or even better...

But other friends swear by 6# and 4 cuts (IMP CYL choke) combination ... I am sure 6# has advantage of dead-drop kill as its a bigger load & larger diameter pellet, though I like to take advantage of more pellets in 8#. Mod/8# combo has one limitation i.e. if you fire at very close range, the partridge bursts in air (all meat gone) so one has to let the bird go about at least 15-20 yards before firing. It happened with me in last hunt by accident, when a partridge flushed from 5 yards near my feet and shot was impulsively taken at abt 10 yards.\r\n\r\nMy experience with 7# reg Shaheen is also not good. I think 8# and 6# due to more sales volumes are made in better quality than the 7# as they are high volume running items, otherwise if you use Eley (UK) 7# it has very good results. I think it is the quality of cartrg and not 7# issue.\r\n\r\nPls do keep me posted about how you train pointers off season to be fit & pointing (within range) during partrg season.

(234193, 7853, 0, 'Abbas', 1, 'CARACAL F Review and 1100 Round Endurance &amp; Torture Test !', 1325075857, 'Salams,\n\nRecently I was given a Caracal F and Caracal C by the guys at Caracal Pakistan and they asked me to test and review them. I told them plain and simple that the review will be unbiased and I would need a 1000 or so rounds to test it with. They obliged and yesterday I tested the Caracal to my satisfaction.\n\nA few words on Caracal before I go on:\n\nThe Caracal is a new combat handgun from the U.A.E. It was designed by Wilhelm Bubits who first worked at Glock and then moved to Steyr to design the Steyr Mannlicher M & S family of pistols. Caracal''s are made to compete directly with the likes of Glock, Steyr and XDM line of pistols. There are three versions, the F, C & SC which respectively compete with the Glock 17, 19 & 26. It is perhaps also pertinent to mention that Caracal owns the German Shotgun and Rifle manufacturer Merkel which produces the Caracal handguns under licence in Germany as well. \n\nOn to the review: \n\nThe Caracal came in a decent quality plastic box, included in it was the gun, two magazines and a users manual. The manual is in English and well written. The F itself is about the same size as the Glock 17 however it has a 4.1 inch barrel compared to the 17''s 4.5 inch barrel. The gun comes with a safe action (DAO) trigger which functions great and breaks smoothly, the trigger pull is about 5 lbs. The gun comes with two different kind of sights, conventional straight 8 ones (in which you align the two dots to form a figure 8 to be on target) and a quick sight which roughly starts from above the barrel chamber area and extends to the muzzle end. Mine came with a Straight 8 sight which while easy to align were nothing spectacular. The sights also seem to be part of the slide itself which is not a positive. On the back of the gun is a loaded chamber indicator which tells you when the gun is loaded.\n \nThe finishing of the slide and the polymer frame is quite good and defiantly in the exclusive Glock/Styer neighborhood. It weighs about 125g more than the Glock 17 at 750g which is quite welcome as the gun feels very solid to hold. Holding the gun for the first time felt amazing, infact I think it is the most point able gun I have ever held. It gives you Steyr like depth of grip with Glock like solid feel without the Glock grip angle (which does not suit everyone). The checkering on the Polymer grip is very comfortable to hold and even after shooting it quite a lot it still felt good. It does have a ambidextrous mag release but the slide release is only on the left hand side (for right handed shooters). There is a picatinny rail on the front for mounting accessories and a Glock like serial number plate on the bottom of the frame but strangely no serial number printed on it. Overall the polymer frame is top notch/high quality. The disassembly lugs situated right above the trigger finger are made of hardened steel and make disassembly surprisingly even easier and quicker than the Glock (I didn''t realize it could get easier). \n\nPictures below:\n\n\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]6919[/ATTACH]\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]6920[/ATTACH]\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]6921[/ATTACH]\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]6922[/ATTACH]\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]6923[/ATTACH]\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]6924[/ATTACH]\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]6925[/ATTACH]\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]6926[/ATTACH]\nShooting review to follow shortly:', 1, 0, '117.102.36.197', 0, 1, 8, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

The gun came with 3 magazines of 15 rounds capacity.\n\nMore on the[I] Technics later, let''s enjoy some fresh gun porn first, it''s the absolutely best "feel in hands" I''ve ever had from of holding a compact in my hands:\n\n[COLOR=#b22222][SIZE=5][B]The Box:\n[/B][/SIZE][/COLOR][/I][/I][/I]\n\n[IMG]http://i1136.photobucket.com/albums/n497/wahstar1/PG%20upload/Picture014Small-1.jpg[/IMG][I][I][I][COLOR=#b22222][SIZE=5]\n[B] The Contents:\n[/B]\n[/SIZE][/COLOR][/I][/I][/I][IMG]http://i1136.photobucket.com/albums/n497/wahstar1/PG%20upload/Box1Medium.jpg[/IMG][I][I][I][COLOR=#b22222][SIZE=5]\n\n[/SIZE][/COLOR][/I][/I][/I][IMG]http://i1136.photobucket.com/albums/n497/wahstar1/PG%20upload/Box2Medium.jpg[/IMG][I][I][I][COLOR=#b22222][SIZE=5]\n\n\n[B]The Beauty:\n[/B]\n[/SIZE][/COLOR][/I][/I][/I][IMG]http://i1136.photobucket.com/albums/n497/wahstar1/My%20Guns/Picture015Medium.jpg[/IMG][I][I][I][COLOR=#b22222][SIZE=5]\n\n[/SIZE][/COLOR][/I][/I][/I][IMG]http://i1136.photobucket.com/albums/n497/wahstar1/My%20Guns/Picture016Medium.jpg[/IMG]\n\n\n[SIZE=5][COLOR=#b22222][B]The Frame:\n[/B][/COLOR][/SIZE]\n[IMG]http://i1136.photobucket.com/albums/n497/wahstar1/PG%20upload/CaracalFrame1Medium.jpg[/IMG][IMG]http://i1136.photobucket.com/albums/n497/wahstar1/PG%20upload/FrameMedium.jpg[/IMG][IMG]http://i1136.photobucket.com/albums/n497/wahstar1/PG%20upload/Picture001Small.jpg[/IMG]\n\n\n[COLOR=#b22222][SIZE=5][B]The Slide:\n[/B][/SIZE][/COLOR]\n[IMG]http://i1136.photobucket.com/albums/n497/wahstar1/PG%20upload/30-06002SmallMedium-2.jpg[/IMG]\n\n[IMG]http://i1136.photobucket.com/albums/n497/wahstar1/PG%20upload/CaracalSlide1.jpg[/IMG]\n[IMG]http://i1136.photobucket.com/albums/n497/wahstar1/PG%20upload/Picture004Medium-2.jpg[/IMG]\n\n\n[COLOR=#b22222][SIZE=5]The Barrel:\n[/SIZE][/COLOR]\n[IMG]http://i1136.photobucket.com/albums/n497/wahstar1/PG%20upload/30-06005Medium.jpg[/IMG]\n[COLOR=#b22222][SIZE=5]\n[/SIZE][/COLOR][IMG]http://i1136.photobucket.com/albums/n497/wahstar1/PG%20upload/CaracalBarrel2.jpg[/IMG]\n\n\n[COLOR=#0000cd][B]Check below post for more specifications, impressions.\n[/B][/COLOR]\n[COLOR=#8b4513][B] [I]For Range Report See post#16 below [/I][/B][/COLOR]\n[B]\nRegards.[/B]\n[COLOR=#b22222][SIZE=5]\n\n\n[/SIZE][/COLOR]', 1, 1, '203.99.173.227', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

This with the retention of the 15 shots capacity as that of Glock 19. Hence it''s [I]compacter[/I] than the G-19, whilst being more solid with added 100 grams to the weight.\n[/SIZE][/COLOR][COLOR=#b22222][B][SIZE=5]\n[/SIZE][/B][/COLOR][COLOR=#000000][SIZE=5][SIZE=4]The F model is exactly between the sizes of the Glock 17 and 19, being about 6mm shorter in length than the G-17, and 4mm longer than the G-19. Thickness is 2 mm thinner than both. Height is 7mm more than the G-19 and 3 mm shorter than the G-17. This with an increased capacity by 1 round, hence 18+1 vs 17+1 of the G-17!\n\nBarrel lengths, 4.04" of the F model, and app. 3.75" of the C model, respectively, are roughly 10 mm shorter than their Glock counter part''s, G-17 and G-19.\n \nIt really appears like if they managed to pack in quite some improvements there, with reduced dimensions.\n[/SIZE][/SIZE][SIZE=4]\nThe trigger pre-travel of 8mm''s in both models is said to be about 4-5mm [I]shorter [/I]than Glocks, offering a better break and being much crisper, also. Reset is naturally longer, when pre-travel is shorter, it''s a "Safe Action" DAO handgun and naturally the trigger has to go all the way back for the consecutive shot. \n\nI have not fired the handgun as of yet, but hope to be back with more in a couple of days, with respect to the field experience. Chief''s review however was very reassuring of my buy, though I had no idea that he was set for the torture test of the Caracal F, as in his review. Thanks Chief.\n\n[/SIZE][/COLOR][COLOR=#b22222][SIZE=4][I][SIZE=5][B]Initial impressions:[/B][/SIZE][/I]\n[/SIZE][B][SIZE=5]\n[/SIZE][/B][/COLOR][/SIZE] [SIZE=4][COLOR=#000000]The Caracal C seems to me one very fine weapon of quality make, and probably the best and most viable, value-for-money solution to the shooter with a requirement for a Safe Action type of duty handgun here in Pakistan.\n\nThe 1100 rounds review posted by Chief himself on the F model seems to be convincing enough on it''s performance, and answering all questions beyond doubts on the reliability/durability side of the Caracal handgun. \n\nI wish to say, to those who still may have some critique for a " newcomer", that this is no "random new make", that was just conceived by someone " Mr.Random" and then manufactured in UAE. The gun is the very brainchild of Wilhelm Bubit, whose Steyr M9A1 is still conceived by many as being an edge over the Glock 17/19 [/COLOR][/SIZE][COLOR=#000000]series[/COLOR][SIZE=4][COLOR=#000000] in many aspects.\n\nThe gun has a "feel of luxury" to it that you may find only in the Glock/Steyr/XDM series of handguns.\n\nHence, to expect that this gun would fall in the category of Taurus or Turkish handguns in the market would be totally out of place to expect or wish for. At the closest - [I]and despite of being a totally different platform handgun[/I] - it may eventually land up in the closer vicinity of CZ handguns -[I] price-wise - [/I]as per our market trends over here in Pakistan[I].\n[/I]\nSee you soon[I].\n\n[/I][/COLOR][COLOR=#000000]Regards.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[/COLOR][/SIZE]', 1, 1, '203.99.173.227', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

Designed by the same guy who designed the Steyr M9.\n3.  Gun passed the NATO standards.\nThings I didn''t like:\n1.  The slides underside is bare showing all kinds of flat sheet springs, should one come out during cleaning, will cause problems not to mention its more liable to jam when it gets dirty.  As started to happen in Abbas bhai''s case. \n2.  The rear sight is all metal fixed to the backplate, that means can''t buy or change rear sights on whim.  Also can''t install an adjustable sight to it.\n3.  Had a similar problem when I had attached the stock, and its NOT the recoil part as the more firm you hold the gun the more likely its to recoil fully rather than in the hand which takes up most of the recoil with movement.\nThing(s) in question:\n1.  For 100k does it come complete in a big case with the foregrip and the rear stock and the lock??\n2.  What about parts?  I know Dubai is near but this stuff is hard to purchase, plus I understand they are not keeping up with the production.

Remind me to change your nick to MIA this month ;) Let''s meet soon. \n\n@SlayerJatt, Malik160, AzharShafiqch Thank you. \n\nI''ve received so much feedback about the price of the gun that I must make one [B]serious recommendation to the distributors[/B]. This gun should [B]not [/B]retail for more than Rs. 80,000. It is pointless to launch a gun when good press is being generated about it only to waste it all by sticking to a price at which no one is willing to purchase it. The distributor is of the mindset that it is a competitor to the Glock and Steyr so should command premium prices like them and the consumers are of the opinion that it is a new gun from a new manufacturer whose country has no export restrictions to Pakistan so it should be sold at normal prices. If CZ did not have a presence in the market perhaps CARACAL could have managed to convince people it was worth 100 k + but with the $ 1000 + CZ''s selling for Rs. 100,000 to Rs. 125,000 surely trying to sell a $ 500 pistol for Rs. 125,000 is foolish.\n \nDuty structure, manufacturer prices is really no excuse. We see $ 400 Taurus''s (from Brazil which has no export restrictions to Pakistan) being sold for Rs. 50,000 and $ 275 CF-98''s (from China) being sold for Rs. 30,000 or $ 400 Canik''s selling for Rs. 45,000. Why then can''t a gun which is being sold for $ 500 in the U.S be sold in Pakistan for Rs. 80,000 ?\n\nCARACAL tried the Glock pricing formula in the US and failed miserbly, only a handful of hard core gun nuts picked it up as a curio and the consumers when asked to choose between a Glock or a Caracal didn''t think twice and picked up the Glock. Pakistan has the potential to be one of the largest markets in the world for Caracal, not because of our purchasing power but because we genuinely need a sensibly priced replacement for Glock and equallily reasonably priced ammo to put through it. \n\nIn most Western countries people will never accept CARACAL over Glock even if the next generation of the gun is better than it. We here in Pakistan have no such hang up''s or bias and don''t look down at a gun from U.A.E or Turkey to be any less than a gun produced in the U.S. We are willing to accept it whole heatedly but [B]the price should be right[/B].', 1, 0, '117.102.36.197', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

I decided to give the best demonstration of this with the quickest firing that I [/COLOR][COLOR=#0000cd]possibly[/COLOR][COLOR=#0000cd] could squeeze out from the Caracal C, since this only could really put the gun''s trigger "reset" to a tough test and confirm if any flaws here.\n [/COLOR][COLOR=#B22222][SIZE=4]\n[SIZE=5]I was [/SIZE][/SIZE][/COLOR][/B][SIZE=5][B][COLOR=#B22222]pleased to find that there''s NO such issue at all with the Caracal C.[/COLOR][/B][/SIZE][B][COLOR=#B22222]\n[SIZE=4]\n[/SIZE][/COLOR][/B][COLOR=#000000][SIZE=4]Check my vid below, I threw in a full mag of 15 shots and believe I could only beat this[I] rate of fire[/I] with a PB item. The duration of the drill - [I]if counted from start to end of the actual shoot[/I] - was hardly an affair of short 5 seconds, [B]4.5 seconds [/B]to be more accurate, and that''s pretty fast for 15 shots, I believe!\n  \nNo doubts, this may prove to be one of the best "double-tappers", if not to say "tripple-tapper" around, of the Safe Action handguns available with the DAO. It really handles the rapid mode impressively and the trigger is one pleasure to squeeze and break:\n\n[/SIZE][/COLOR][video=youtube;M4zw53KjIAQ]http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M4zw53KjIAQ&amp;context=C3c7c040ADOEgsToPDskJO  NKCwND2vfsceNB7SI5kg[/video]\n\nSadly, my friend making the video cut it short as soon as I had finished the rapid string, not even giving me a chance to complete my remarks. I wanted him to turn the camera towards the target, but he had already cut the clip. \n\nBefore shooting this rapid string, I had commented to him:\n \n"[I]Look, I''m not gonna get more than the 1.st shot onto the board with this rate of fire, but keep recording all the shots, my purpose is to show it''s trigger performance, not the accuracy[/I]".\n \nI am therefore not "ashamed" at all to present how the target looked like, finding that I still got 8 shots onto the board, even one to the head, you could measure it [I]half glass full or empty[/I], whichever, lolz!:\n\n[IMG]http://i1136.photobucket.com/albums/n497/wahstar1/Caracal/RapidFiretarget-1.jpg[/IMG]\n\n[COLOR=#000000][SIZE=4][B]I must praise the [/B][/SIZE][/COLOR][COLOR=#b22222][SIZE=4][B]QS[/B][/SIZE][/COLOR][COLOR=#000000][SIZE=4][B] feature here again, I feel, it really helped in keeping the gun pointing rightly with such a fast string of 15 shots.[/B]\n\nI cannot speak of the F model, since I haven''t had the opportunity to use it, but as far as the C model is concerned, I really did not have to worry about the trigger getting all the way back or not, with it''s approximately 4lbs trigger pull, it was just kind of fast squeezing of a single action handgun. I believe the vid should prove this assertion of mine, you simply cannot think about the trigger''s [I]revert to normal stage[/I] with this rate of fire.\n\nOverall, let me sum the shooting experience up, the Caracal C is no doubts one pleasure to shoot out and with the lowest recoil factor to it that I personally ever have felt from a 9mm para.\n \nI have never really been a good judge on the recoil factor and always thought it to be a natural "behavior of guns", probably because I have rarely felt a great difference with this respect from one 9mm handgun to another, when comparing two of same category handguns, be it full sized or compacts. The Carcal C stood out with this respect due to it''s "soft" recoil, almost air-soft.\n\nI have used a Glock and find that the grip of the Caracal is by far more [I]user friendly[/I] than Glock''s "brickish", [I]aggressively contoured[/I] type of grip, especially for the small to mid sized hands, and it adds to the overall shooting pleasure, [I]control[/I].\n\nLet me know if I missed out anything, will be back with my final remarks on the Caracal in my subsequent post.\n\n\n[/SIZE][/COLOR][COLOR=#000000][SIZE=4]\n\n[/SIZE][/COLOR][COLOR=#000000][SIZE=4][/SIZE][/COLOR][SIZE=7][SIZE=4][B][SIZE=4][/SIZE][/B][/SIZE][/SIZE][SIZE=4][COLOR=#000000]I have been asked by quite a few friends about the price paid and whether if I deemed it an appropriate pick to fullfill my requirement for a poly framed duty gun, by choosing a whole new, untested brand.\n[/COLOR][/SIZE][B][SIZE=4][COLOR=#000000]\n[/COLOR][/SIZE][/B][SIZE=4][COLOR=#000000]Let me clarify my stance with respect to the Caracal being a "new entrant'', and you''re certainly free to disagree and comment your views.\n[/COLOR][/SIZE][B][SIZE=4][COLOR=#000000]\n[/COLOR][/SIZE][/B][SIZE=4][COLOR=#000000]The perfection in handguns comes with times and several generations of the same base model,the manner by which Glock has developed from it''s initial version to the present gen 4, the Steyr M9A1 from version 1.0 and on-wards.\n \nCaracal could thus both be seen as a new entrant as well as an "old" [I]continuation[/I], since it''s basically just another link to the [I]evolution[/I] of Safe Action handguns, the kinds of Glocks, Steyr''s, XDM''s, etc. Moreover it has been designed by the very man who''s brainchild the Steyr M9A1 still is a preferred duty gun for many across the world, some deeming it a notch above the Glock as well, in a few aspects.\n[/COLOR][/SIZE][B][SIZE=4][COLOR=#000000]\n[/COLOR][/SIZE][/B][SIZE=4][COLOR=#000000]I would therefore rather call it an[I] old gun[/I], [I]further perfected[/I], and manufactured from a different place of origin, than the traditional Austrian. \n[/COLOR][/SIZE][B][SIZE=4][COLOR=#000000]\n[/COLOR][/SIZE][/B][SIZE=4][COLOR=#000000]The improvements, as if compared to the Glock/Steyr, lie basically [/COLOR][/SIZE][COLOR=#000000]in[/COLOR][SIZE=4][COLOR=#000000] below main things:\n[/COLOR][/SIZE][B][SIZE=4][COLOR=#000000]\n[/COLOR][/SIZE][COLOR=#0000cd][SIZE=4]\n1) Parts reduction to 28 from +30.\n\n2) Lower bore axis\n\n3) Better, crisper trigger\n\n4) Reduced dimensions, retention of mag capacities, even increased in F model to 18+1 vs Glock17''s 17+1.\n[/SIZE][I][SIZE=4]\n[/SIZE][/I][SIZE=4]5) Better ergonomics.\n\n6) Model variations ( F, C, F and C-QS.)\n[/SIZE][/COLOR][SIZE=4][COLOR=#000000]\n[/COLOR][/SIZE][/B][SIZE=4][COLOR=#000000]\nAs I have stated earlier, The Steyr is the most identical to the Caracal, and vice versa, and you can definitely see and feel the Bubit heritage in the Caracal. Let me add a couple of pics, the 1.st one showing the Steyr vs Caracal bore axis, where clearly the Caracal''s can be seen as [I]lower placed[/I]:\n \n[B]Caracal to the right:[/B]\n\n[/COLOR][/SIZE][IMG]http://i1136.photobucket.com/albums/n497/wahstar1/Caracal/M_C_Compare_front.jpg[/IMG]\n\n[B]\n[SIZE=5]On dimensions:[/SIZE] (Steyr to the left in first pic, Glock to the left in 2.nd pic)[/B]\n\n\n[IMG]http://i1136.photobucket.com/albums/n497/wahstar1/Caracal/IMG_4987Small.jpg[/IMG][IMG]http://i1136.photobucket.com/albums/n497/wahstar1/Caracal/IMG_5013Small.jpg[/IMG]\n\n\n[SIZE=4][COLOR=#000000][B]\n[SIZE=5]Vs the G-19:[/SIZE]\n[/B]\n\n[/COLOR][/SIZE][IMG]http://i1136.photobucket.com/albums/n497/wahstar1/Caracal/Glock19vsCaracal1.jpg[/IMG][SIZE=4][COLOR=#000000]\n[/COLOR][/SIZE][IMG]http://i1136.photobucket.com/albums/n497/wahstar1/Caracal/Glock19vsCaracal2.jpg[/IMG][COLOR=#000000]\n\n\n[SIZE=5]So as you can see, it''s basically more of an [I]evolutionary link [/I]to the already existing "chain" of Safe Action polymer handguns, and not "new entrant" as a whole as such.[/SIZE]\n\n[/COLOR][COLOR=#B22222][B][SIZE=6]Price:[/SIZE]\n[/B][/COLOR][SIZE=5][COLOR=#000000]\nI''ve been asked this question right from the moment it landed with me and I truly appreciate that the closest of friends did have the patience to wait it out. Let me be clear, price is quite a [B][I]relative[/I][/B][/COLOR][B][I] matter[/I][/B][/SIZE][SIZE=4][I], [/I][SIZE=5]which[/SIZE][/SIZE][SIZE=5][COLOR=#000000] you have to gauge in comparison to your already existing options in handguns of [I]similar platforms[/I].\n \nHence comparing it to the price of CZ''s is kind of[I] irrelevant[/I], since these are two totally different things. Caracal is best compared to the Glock/ Steyr series of handguns, which are priced at some 350K''s and 240K''s, [/COLOR][/SIZE][SIZE=6][SIZE=5][I][COLOR=#000000]respectively[/COLOR][/I][/SIZE][/SIZE][SIZE=5][COLOR=#000000], with minor variations from city to city.[/COLOR][/SIZE]\n\n[SIZE=5][COLOR=#000000]I''d say - especially in the light of Abbas bro''s 1100 rounds torture test of the F model - that this handgun, in terms of quality has already established itself. Some of our close friends have even fired thousands of rounds from this handgun and were satisfied, even when there were still doubts on [/COLOR][/SIZE][COLOR=#000000][B][SIZE=5]whether[/SIZE] [/B][/COLOR][SIZE=5][COLOR=#000000][SIZE=5]the handgun would be introduced here commercially or not.[/SIZE]\n\n[SIZE=5]With thanks to Arms & Accessories, the Caracal distributors in Pakistan, I was handed over the C -QS model, with 3 mags as a promotional package, a year''s warranty and a box [/SIZE][/COLOR][B][COLOR=#b22222]@ 100K''s ($1100)straight[/COLOR][/B][/SIZE][COLOR=#000000][SIZE=5][B]. [/B][/SIZE]\n\n[/COLOR][SIZE=5][SIZE=4][SIZE=5]Now you may consider it high or low, whatsoever, yet kindly do bear in mind, that the warranty attached does have it''s cost and significance. The distributors offer a year''s limited warranty with the boxes as 1.st time concept with handgun''s in Pakistan and I feel this does justify a slightly increased deal than what most would have expected.[/SIZE]\n[/SIZE]\nLet me say, before the critiques - [I]if any[/I] - start pouring in,[/SIZE][COLOR=#b22222][SIZE=5]" [SIZE=6]it''s certainly no [B]sin[/B] [I]not[/I] to take it [/SIZE]"[/SIZE][/COLOR][SIZE=5], if you don''t like it or feel there are better 100K options of it''s kind to take instead, but at the same time it would probably be a "blessing" to your collection and at a reduced/favorable\n cost if you do.\n \nI''d still say, I''d prefer to have 3 Caracal''s over the price paid for 1 Glock in Pakistan, and 2 Caracal''s over 1 steyr at it''s respective price tag, everything in life is "relative".\n\nI''ll post a comparison review soon, that will clarify that it''s a much better, more potent CCW package than a CZ-Rami 2075D and more "carry friendly" than a P07 Duty, if we still should compare it to DA/SA handguns of same price range.\n\n[B][COLOR=#b22222]I''d recommend the QS model only to those who have a [I]genuine SD requirement[/I]. The F and traditional C models are better suited for traditional shooting, sports, owing to better sighting variations.[/COLOR]\n[/B]\nFinally, my thanks to Arms & Accessories, Karachi, and the Caracal distributors for some very fine customer dealing, and I truly hope they''ll be dealing with our forums to the best of our satisfaction. I talked to one of these gentlemen yesterday and was told that prices would be tried the best to be kept at a [I]constant level[/I], no "artificial shortage" abrupt hikes.\n\n\n[SIZE=5]Regards.[/SIZE]\n\n\n\n\n[/SIZE]\n[COLOR=#000000][SIZE=4]\n[/SIZE][/COLOR]\n\n \n[COLOR=#000000]\n\n\n\n\n[/COLOR][SIZE=5][COLOR=#000000]\n[/COLOR][/SIZE]', 1, 1, '119.153.74.231', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

The only difference we could make is that we as responsible hunters, start obeying the regulations. If we don''t obey the rules as mentioned in our licenses, how can we raise fingers on others, may they be torchers or netters or whoever they are.\r\n\r\nTo be honest, we all should take a moment to think about our pasts and see how many times have we exceeded our bag limits.

This is wrong and I have decided never to hunt with falcons again in my life, even if wildlife department forecefuly issues me a license for this kind of hunting.

After your comments and of the other brothers in this thread about the torture test being one of a kind, I tried today to find similar tests on Youtube. Could not really locate any. Most of them are 1 or 2 minute clips and usually one video just has one test not all of them.\n\nAnother thing that I noticed watching the Youtube video''s is that people do a lot of outtakes (i.e the video''s are cut and paste and not continually recording). As in someone would claim that they shot 5,000 rounds though a handgun but the clip will only be a minute long. \n\nAnyway I tried to find torture tests for the Beretta 92, the Glock and the HK to see how they compare with the Caracal and I have to say so far the CARACAL outshines them all !\n\nHere are best two Berreta / Glock video''s I could find:\n\n[video=youtube_share;Srg4nwVv6go]http://youtu.be/Srg4nwVv6go[/video]\n\n[video=youtube_share;e6bNQ4Orp6U]http://youtu.be/e6bNQ4Orp6U[/video]\n\n[video=youtube_share;uORhTcKe8Ms]http://youtu.be/uORhTcKe8Ms[/video]\n\n@Bbiillaall It''s surprisingly fine.

Always glad to help! :) For conceal carry, get the Shark-C or the Piranha-C; they''re THE best CC/compact 9mm out there for less than 50K. The Piranha-C is a little hard to get, so go for the Shark-C instead. It''s specs are identical to the CZ-75 Compact, only frame differs.  For a full frame, I''d suggest getting either the Piranha-F (Canik55''s version of the CZ-75 SP01 or CZ-97), the Dolphin (Canik55''s version of the stock CZ-75) or the Shark-F. I wouldn''t recommend the Stingray simply because it''s VERY heavy; where all the Caniks have aluminum construction, the Stingray (despite having ambidextrous controls and a loaded chamber indicator) is made of steel, making it extremely heavy. All in all, ANY Canik is an excellent buy; they''re all based on the tried & true CZ-75 family, have a robust construction with and are worth every penny![/QUOTE]\r\n\r\n\r\nWow thx Ahnab you pretty much summed up what i couldnt understand for ages lol.\r\nI used to think there was only 1 Canik but after visiting there website i really got confused.Your lucky you live in Lahore you have the best variety at your doorstep.\r\nAnyway i hope someone sheds some light over there POF handgun soon so i can decide whch is better.I doubt it would surpass the Canik but lets not underestimate POF so quickly.\r\nWhat are your views?\r\nThx', 1, 1, '119.154.149.110', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

The frame in my opinion is even better, more rugged and perhaps stronger than Glocks and it certainly feels better to hold. One of Glock''s unique selling points was it''s simplicity as the entire gun just had 34 parts, Caracal have taken it a step further and reduced the number of parts to an amazing 28 ! Lesser parts means lesser things to go wrong and more reliability. \n\nI appreciate the lengths Caracal went to make their guns more reliable and then to prove a point they were sent for the most stringent testing available worldwide. Here is a excrept I came across on Wikipedia:\n\n[I]Before being put into production the Caracal pistol was evaluated through independent tests. These tests were carried out by the Federal German Armed Forces Technical Center for Weapons and Ammunition (WTD 91) in Meppen, Germany which included metallurgic and composite analysis, functional fitness-for-purpose and quality evaluation, endurance firing, environmental exposure, safety and accuracy tests. A certificate was issued by the Bundeswehr Technical Center for Weapons and Ammunition (WTD 91) in May 2006 after the pistol successfully complied with the NATO D14 standard, the German Federal Police Standard and the German Federal Armed Forces Technical Purchasing requirements. These tests are the most stringent test protocols ever devised for a service firearm.\n[/I]\nThat is seriously impressive as just the Nato test includes the following:\n\n[I]The pistol must also complete an environmental conditions test: \nThis means cold, heat, dust/sand and mud.\nThe pistol must fire after being frozen for 24 hours at &#8211;35C (-36F).\nThe pistol must fire after being heated for 24 hours at 70C (126F)\nThe pistol must fire after being submerged in mud, sand and combinations including being stripped of oil then completing the sand and mud tests again.[/I]\n\nPlaying around with and using the gun for a while I did like a few things about it. \n\n1). The trigger while double action only is pretty decent and a large improvement over other DAO triggers that I''ve shot.\n2). The slightly heavier frame absorbs the felt recoil better compared to a Glock.\n3). The checkering of the frame is almost perfect for me. In shooting 1100+ rounds I did not have any chaffed skin, grip impressions on my hand and cuts.\n4). The slightly lower barrel placement/low profile slide make double taps extremely accurate. The gun naturally comes back to the correct position. If you watch Part III at time 2:08 you can see what I mean. \n5). I like the loaded chamber indicator placed on the back of the slide instead of near the extractor or on top of the gun. This makes it much more practical. \n6). I very much like the full slide rails on the frame (shown in picture 7 on page 1) compared to the Glock.\n7). The Straight 8 sights are easy to align. \n8). Of the 22 mags that I had all fit well, there were no magazine issues (quality control, ejection, malfunctions etc.)\n9). It''s better looking than the Glock.\n10). 18 magazine capacity compared to Glock 17''s 17.\n11). The easiest take down I have ever used.\n12). The optional mag loader is one of the best I''ve come across.\n\nThere is some stuff however that I would love to see improved / modified in the Generation 2 Caracal:\n\n1). Removable sights. Trijicon/Tritium/Adjustable/Novak as options.\n2). The slide realize should be extended a bit. Perhaps make the whole area on the left side of the frame where it says "Caracal F" a slide release.\n3). The loaded chamber indicator should be colored not plain black.\n4). The disassembly lugs should be made or atleast coated in polymer.\n5). The extractor needs redesigning. I''ll attach a sample CZ extractor design compared to the Caracal. Although the Caracal one might be more robust/efficient it is at times erratic.\n6). The belly of the slide / firing pin area should be covered / enclosed and ideally the firing pin should be easily removable like the CZ Shadow.\n7). The trigger assembly needs to be made more resilient to sand and specially mud. It needs to be protected.\n8). Quality of stamping on the Slide could be improved.\n9). The magazine springs are too rigid, almost impossible to load the 18th round by hand. \n10). Glock like 33 round extended magazines would be great. \n\n[B][U]Final Verdict:[/U][/B]\n \n[B]I would like to rate this gun a "MUST HAVE". It is simply an improved Glock for 1/3 the price.

Please elaborate.[/COLOR][/B][/QUOTE]\n\n[B]@Abbas...[/B]....Thanks for your kind words Chief, appreciated.\n \nAs for the QS, you can''t imagine how many times I didn''t try to exposure with my digi cam, the direct line between the two sights, as when taking the aim, yet failed every time, since even the Makro settings on my cam wouldn''t allow such close distance exposure! I will try again sometimes this night, as I just returned from the village and am bound to leave again early morning, also to shoot out this babe tomorrow afternoon, Inshallah, for the completion of this review. More impressions shall be added also.\n\nBasically, the QS system, as explained by Caracal and the people around the world who have used it, is a new sights set-up, which kind of turns the little wonder to a "point & shoot" instrument, hence quicker SD response. In a way, you''re just aiming with the fibre optics front sight! The rear sight by the ejection port and front sight are pretty close to each other.\n\nThe sighting radius does decrease, no doubts, but - [I]reportedly[/I]- transfers no ill effects to the POI up to the range of some 20 yards or so. This should be more than enough for a SD carry/duty gun. Beyond this, there may be a discrepancy of an inch or so to the Y-axis of the POA.\n\nIt''s a totally different feeling of taking the aim, yet I''ll be in a better position to comment on this, after having fired it off.\n\n[B]@Wolf Hunter, ARJ, Nazim Sahib, Zaheer, BL, TH, Canik, Soldier 786, Ahnab, Pakipower.....Thanks guys.\n\n@TH..[/B].............Thanks TH bro, you''re welcome to question me, course, yet let me clarify, I still stand by my debate on the steel vs polymer question. Nevertheless, I had always stated and mentioned my collection wishlist would include at least 1 Safe Action handgun, be it Steyr M9A1, Glock, XDM series, whatever. The Caracal just landed here very timely for me, when I was all ready to pick the Steyr M9, even had arranged one for the pick.\n\nFinally, no, the Caracal C or F models - [I]regardless of closeness in price to the Duty [/I]- will[B] not[/B] be compared to the PO7 Duty, coz of totally different platforms.

Therefore, it is popular with shooters wanting a vermin and deer rifle with the option to upgrade to larger calibers as there are 23 choices of caliber.\r\n\r\nThe 202 Polar comes with a tough synthetic stock and polymer coating named Ilaflon, which is applied to all the metal parts, ideally suiting a real stalking rifle with maximum weather resistance and is highly resistant to scratches.\r\n\r\nThe strength of the action is partly because the switch barrel locks directly into the chamber end of the barrel. Barrels can be easily changed, so it is possible to use a variety of calibers on one chassis (unfortunately, we in Pakistan do not have this option).. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[color=#FF0000][size=150][u][b]BARREL, BOLT AND ACTION [/b][/u][/size][/color]\r\n\r\nThe barrel is retained by three cross-bolts that transverse the front of the receiver and clamp it securely in place around the chamber end with the aid of a locating peg. It is not as fast a barrel change as Blaser rifles, but it is very secure. \r\n\r\nThe barrel length is 23.6 inches with Krupp steel hammer forged construction and is silver Ilaflon coated for ultimate rust protection.\r\n\r\nThe bolt has a solid body with a supported head that locks directly into the barrel. There is a single claw extractor that efficiently expels fired cases from the rifle. \r\n\r\nA great feature is the short bolt lift angle of 60% that not only makes for a fast and relatively short bolt throw, but avoids the bolt knob coming anywhere near the eyepiece of the scope. The bolt handle has a distinctive butter knife profile and is known for its smooth movement. \r\nThe Sauer’s switch barrel system differs from others in that the barrel is retained in a yoke at the front of the action where three cross-bolts securely clamp the barrel in place with a precise fit. \r\n\r\nUnloading is done by releasing the safety to open the bolt. The magazine pops out after pushing a small plunger.\r\n\r\nBoth barrel and action are covered with the Ilaflon coating, which forms an effective barrier against rust.\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i970.photobucket.com/albums/ae189/azamkakar/Picture020.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i970.photobucket.com/albums/ae189/azamkakar/Picture025.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i970.photobucket.com/albums/ae189/azamkakar/Picture049.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i970.photobucket.com/albums/ae189/azamkakar/Picture042-1.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i970.photobucket.com/albums/ae189/azamkakar/Picture036.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[color=#FF0000][size=150][u][b]TRIGGER, SAFETY AND MAGAZINE [/b][/u][/size][/color]\r\n\r\nThe safety catch requires minimal movement from the hand to operate it. It has a single set trigger mechanism.The rifle''s single set trigger can be used in two ways. The first by simply lifting your trigger finger upwards against a plunger to release the safety and squeezing the trigger, just like any rifle. The second is to release the safety as before but then push forward the trigger into its set position. When once set, the lightest of pull fires the rifle\r\n\r\nThe base of the action houses the magazine, which is detachable and has a 3 round capacity. To release the magazine, press a small button at the front of the magazine well and the box is ejected.\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i970.photobucket.com/albums/ae189/azamkakar/Picture032-1.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i970.photobucket.com/albums/ae189/azamkakar/Picture030.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[color=#FF0000][size=150][u][b]TWO-PIECE STOCK [/b][/u][/size][/color]\r\n\r\nThe Sauer has a two-piece stock, which is secured to the action via long, threaded bolts accessed through the butt and fore-end. The rifle can be stripped down to a very short overall length for safe and convenient storage.\r\nIt has a tough polymer-stock with the Snow camo pattern which merges perfectly with the steel surface.\r\n\r\nThe butt has a well designed Monte Carlo style cheek piece, allowing good scope-to-eye alignment.. The soft touch-feature, an anti-slip coating, works very well in wet and hot conditions. This rifle offers the possibility to take off the butt stock to shorten the whole rifle and that also without taking out the barrel.\r\n\r\nThe pistol grip is designed to accommodate even the largest hand and allows for a natural hold. The fore-end is floated from the barrel and is slim.\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i970.photobucket.com/albums/ae189/azamkakar/Picture044-1.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i970.photobucket.com/albums/ae189/azamkakar/Picture026.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[color=#FF0000][size=150][u][b]Scope[/b][/u][/size][/color]\r\n\r\nI have got a Leupold VX-2 3-9 x40mm scope  for my rifle. Scope-mounting relies on separate bases and scope rings. Scope bases and rings are black in color and have been taken out for the review as they were not matching with the rifle color. Have ordered silver bases and rings.\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i970.photobucket.com/albums/ae189/azamkakar/Picture062-1.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[color=#FF0000][size=150][u][b]ACCURACY [/b][/u][/size][/color]\r\n\r\nI did not conduct any accuracy test. I just fired a couple of shots at random targets and they were all taken out. Recoil is pretty well manageable. There should be no doubt in this rifle being accurate. However, people who have conducted accuracy tests say that it is a highly accurate rifle and gives ½ inch groups at 100 yards.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[color=#FF0000][size=150][u][b]Reliability[/b][/u][/size][/color]\r\n\r\nNo feeding and ejection problems. This is a very reliable rifle from Sauer and can be used for decades without any problems.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[color=#FF0000][size=150][u][b]Price and Value for Money[/b][/u][/size][/color] \r\n\r\nIn Pakistan, it is rarely available in NIB or used condition. Considering the high price of 1 million over here, I would say that there is no comparison between value and money.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[color=#FF0000][/color][size=150][u][b]Maintenance[/b][/u][/size] \r\n\r\nSauer 202 is not a very difficult rifle to maintain except the availability of parts. The rifle can be taken apart easily for cleaning. Parts are available from online gun parts stores but are not very cheap and they do not ship to Pakistan.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[color=#FF0000][size=150][u][b]CONCLUSION [/b][/u][/size][/color]\r\n\r\nThe Sauer 202 Polar is a true hunting rifle which is built with quality engineering. It is designed for serious use in all weather conditions and can withstand any abuse and neglect.

The 264 Magnum is one of a series of cartridges based on the original Winchester 458 belted case, necked-down. It is interesting for several reasons, one of being that it is the first American 6.5mm cartridge since the long-defunct 256 newton was announced back in 1913. It was originally available only in the Winchester bolt-action Model 70 "Westerner" with a 26-inch stainless steel barrel. At present, Winchester offers the standard weight Model 70XTR Magnum with a 24-inch barrel, which means some reduction on the original ballistics. For a time, the Remington 700 Series was offered in 264-caliber.\r\n\r\nThe 264 Winchester is a very fine, ultra-velocity cartridge with excellent long-range possibilities and ballistics somewhat superior to the time-tried 270 Winchester. Its development may well have been suggested by the 257 Weatherby Magnum, for the two are quite similar. The 264 should be able to equal anything the 257 WM can do, but with the added advantage of the heavier 140-grain bullet for the larger species of big game. The 100-grain bullet is intended for animals in the deer and antelope class, the 140-grain for elk and above. The rifling twist used by Winchester is not quick enough to stabilize spitzer bullets of more than 140-grains. However round-nosed bullets up to 160-grains have provided satisfactory practical accuracy in many rifles. The handloader has a wide choice of bullets ranging from 87 to 160 grains. All things considered, the 264 Magnum should be adequate for any North American big game, but it is plains and mountain cartridge, not intended for heavy brush or woods hunting. The ballistics listed in the current Winchester catalog show muzzle velocity reduced 380 fps for the 100-grain bullet and 170 fps for the 140-grain. This is probably due as much to reduced loading as it is to the shorter barrel.', 1, 0, '113.203.151.30', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

The Caracal must be something really special as it is the only handgun which fulfilled your wish list for 1 polymer framed gun. I really was impressed with the fact that the manufacturers have put their heart and soul in their creation which one can see from the packaging and the overall gun quality. The following is an account of my interaction with Caracal....\n\nWent to my gun store a couple of days earlier. The guy had both the models of Caracal as well as a Glock. We stripped off the Caracal and the following are my overall impressions:\n\n1. The finishing of the internals was very good but did not look solid at all like we find in CZ pistols or even Taurus PT99 for that matter\n\n2. The internals were a replica of a glock''s internal\n\n3. Used a weighing scale to weigh the Caracal (full sized) and a glock (full sized) and the glock was lighter\n\n4. Caracal''s slide (upper portion) appeared to me as too thick and came across as a toy pistol as far as looks are concerned\n\n5. Overall finishing of the exterior was good but not eye catching (was dull)\n\n6. Trigger pull (dry fire) was crisp\n\n7. Grips were somewhat comfortable but nothing very impressive\n\n8. The curves of the recoil spring were flat as opposed to being cylindercal shaped\n\n9. Not really comfortable with striker fired pistols as it tkes an effort to double check whether a round is chambered or not. That tiny rod on the slide indicating the same in striker fired pistols is nearly invisible in low lit situations\n\n[B]Overall Impression:[/B]\n\n100k plus is a very very high price tag. Even if it was on the lower / mid price range I would prefer to pick off something else from the shelf as 1. I ain''t a plastic fan and 2. The overall design of glocks and their replicas do not impress me. Needless to say that the positive market repo of Caracal''s designer would make it a handun worth to try out.

Cocking effort for 80,90,95 respectively is 34,40,46 lbs.. this will send you sweating after a couple of shots. IMO even the 80 has a not-so-easy cocking effort before breaking-in.\n. 80 and 90 are less loud than the 95. \nSo 80 is a good option.\n\nThe cons of Weihrauch springers are:\n. Heavy\n. Slightly lesser powered than RWS ones (but very very accurate and very manageable recoil unlike RWS, so thumbs up to Weihrauch)\n. I hate the auto safety on it. RWS airguns safety can be turned off if you''re doing target practice and taking successive shots, and the safety on RWS can be reapplied if you have already turned it off and the bird/animal flys off or whatever the circumstances be. Both of these are not possible on Weihrauch airguns.\nPlus I find the safety on RWS''s more comfortably located.\n.Weihrauchs are more costly.\n\nHowever, given I have the funds and Weihrauchs are available where I am, I would opt for them, anyday.', 1, 1, '119.73.10.200', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

Now we know from a reliable source how much torture this machine can withstand.\n\nI have always been hooked up on the idea of  an improvement on the Glock design with a lesser price tag and Caracal has done it well. However, like you said, the price should be right. It is an extremely important dimension to our (the gun-enthusiasts/owners) life-style and purchasing habits that you point out. Nevertheless I think the comparisons should broaden a little and at least models which already present themselves in our local market as Glock competitors should be compared against this design too. One comparison I am particularly interested in is Caracal viz-a-viz the newly (relatively) Taurus 24/7 Gen. 2. The said gun is in the range of 70-75K and compares excellently to a Glock.\n\nThe two things I like the most in the Caracal are its unique trigger reset system and the low-bore-axis. The thing I hate the most is the sights. Anyhooo, lessee where it stands in days to come and perhaps I''ll find a way to afford it.\n\nCongrats on the pure delight of firing the gun extensively and thank you for sharing it with us.\n\nRegards,\nCD.\n\nPS.

Initially it was chambered in the Remington Model 740 autoloader, later in the 760 slide action and the 721 and 725 bolt actions. The 700 series bolt-action rifles by Remington originally included the 280 chambering. From 1979 to 1980, Remington cataloged the 280 as the "7mm Express Remington," but too much confusion resulted and they went back to the original 280 moniker. Most European manufacturers have added to their bolt-action rifle line. The 280 Remington, actually a 7mm with a bullet diameter of .284-inch, is based on the 30-06 case necked-down, and is very similar to the 7mm-06 which has been around for a good many years. In 1979, Remington introduced a new 150-grain loading.\r\n\r\nThis is a 30-06 class cartridge of slightly more power than the 270 Winchester, at any rate, it can be loaded to greater power if fired from a bolt action rifle. If used in the autoloader or the slide action, pressures must be kept below 50,000 psi. Factory ammunition is loaded to about 47,000 psi. It would be stretching a point to say that the 280 is better than the 270 Winchester, although it is probably a little more versatile due to the variety of factory bullets available. The 280 is certainly adequate for any North American big game and would also lend itself for use on varmints and the lesser varieties. It is another case of a good wildcat cartridge finally emerging in a commercial version. It has picked up a modest following among 7mm fans since its introduction. The new 150-grain bullet at 2970 fps brings out some of the latent potential of the 7mm/280, which is truly an excellent long-range big game cartridge.', 1, 0, '113.203.171.115', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

Tried the red box at the range together with some freely supplied POF 1Z. Loved the POF as compared to the red box. Sadly POF was unavailable so bought S and B 124 grains FMJ. Like I said I carry both FMJs and JHPs for SD and HD. As you are aware that JHPs are incapable of penetrating through wooden doors or metal objects or a sofa seat to be precise so that is where my S and B FMJ comes into action.

Honestly speaking I did not think of Caracal as much than a knock of or a wanna be clone of Steyr, or rather an unholy birth stemming from the union of Glock and Steyr LOL. \n\nBut after having a conversation with you, you were kind enough to elaborate different aspects of this handgun in detail, and I was convinced enough to do a little bit more research by myself. And after having the conversation with you and after some research I started to look at the handgun in different light and starting to hold a certain respect about it that is reserved for some select few handguns.\n\nWell many things highlighted by you are impressive, such as the rifling etc, plus the slimmer design and especially the quick sight concept is thought provoking when it comes to actually buying a polymer striker fired handgun. Also an extra mag in the package is impressive, because lots of us are usually in search of an extra mag for our handguns. But what is really impressive is that it comes with a limited warrantee with it, I only want to know that when this gun will be mass marketed, how are they going to deliver on that, I mean will we have to send it all the way back to the manufacturer or are they going to give us some facility or any qualified and certified guys for repairing this gun here in Pakistan.\n\nAnother aspect I found impressive is the trigger in it, by the looks in the video and Moeen bhai''s statement backing it up, I am darn impressed with its performance, also it may be just me, but I noticed that the recoil and the muzzle flip were almost absent during the rapid fire, if it is so, then I believe that the added weight of the handgun compared to Glock etc also helps in this aspect and is very very impressive. Now I believe that there is a torture test has already been carried out by Abbas sb, and both of your reviews hold this gun in very impressive class.\n\nAs for the price aspect, I believe that its a relative term, and we all have to be realistic in this aspect as well, we must keep in mind how much we are paying for handguns here, a small example the Mark 23''s were sold as high as 700k, although we have to compare apples to apples and oranges to oranges, but that was just an example so that we should be realistic when thinking about the price of this handgun, which in case of the two reviewers is as good as Glock and Steyr, and maybe surpass them in some aspects, because after all this handgun was conceived and manufactured after Glock and Steyr, so in a way its and evolution to those handguns, just my opinion though.\n\nAnyways, all in all a great review.

It is based on the unmodified 308 Winchester case necked-down to 7mm and loaded with a 140-grain bullet at 2860 fps. Remington advertised this cartridge as the "......first modern 7mm round designed for use in short-action rifles." This is rather interesting claim in view of the fact that the 284 Winchester designed for the same purpose, arrived on the scene in 1963. Furhter more the 7mm-08 is a direct copy of the 7mm/308 wildcat that dates back to at least 1958, probably earlier. This is not meant to denigrate what is a very fine cartridge, but rather to demionstrate that there really isn''t much new under the sun despite advertising claims.\r\nOriginal rifles chambered for the 7mm-08 were the Remington Model 788 and 700BDL Varmint Special bolt-actions. Current Remignton catalogs list 700 series and Model Seven bolt actions as available in this chambering. Other makers are begining to chamber it; among the early starters were Savage and Alpha. Silhouette shooters of all types also use the 7mm-08 Remington.\r\nRemington has certainly hung their hat on 7mm caliber and with considerable success. They now offer five chamberings: 7mm-08, 7x57mm Mauser, 7mm Express (280 Remington), 7mm Remington Magnum and 7mm BR for the XP-100 silhouette pistol. However, the 7mm BR originated as something of a semi-wildcat based on the 308x1.5-inch necked-down. Remington has contributed more than any other company to the belated recognition ot the ballistic advantages of the 7mm caliber by U.S. shooters.\r\n\r\nThe 7mm-08 140-grain load surpasses the 308 Winchester 150-grain load downrange, according to Remington tests from a 24-inch barrel. Based on Remington ballistic data, this appears to be true, particularly at around 500 yards. At that range, the 7mm bullet has an edge of 238 fps and 750 fpe over the 308 bullet. This would make at least some difference in potential killing power and also help in better bullet placement at unknown distances. This is not sufficient difference to cause owners of 308-caliber rifles to rush down and trade them off for 7mm-08s, but it does illustrate the ballistic advantages of the smaller caliber.\r\nThe 7mm-08 is a great favorite with many metallic silhouette shooters, and many glowing reports have been heard regarding its accuracy on the range, particularly with handloads. It is also building a good reputation as a long-range deer and antelope cartridge. When handloaded with heavier bullets than the factry 140-grain, it would alo be suitable for heavier game such as elk. Unfortunately, the two factory bullet weights do not make for a very flexible big game cartridge unless one is willing to handload. On the other hand. by handloading, this cartridge can be adapted to anything from varmint shooting through elk and becomes quite versatile.\r\nThe case capacity of the 7mm-08 is slightly less than the 7x57mm Mauser and performance with the heavier bullets of around 175-grains is about 100 to 150 fps less, which is not anything to get real excited about. The fact of the matter is that the 7mm-08 is adequate for most North American hunting, but is handicapped by only two commercial bullet loadings. Possibly Remington did not visualize the 7mm-08 as a hunting cartridge, but as primarily a target and silhouette round, so they stayed with the lighter-weight 120- and 140-grain bullets.', 1, 0, '113.203.189.205', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

The cartridge was actually the work of Ken Waters, a well-known and popular gun writer and ballistic expert. He began planning the cartridge in 1976, as a high-vlocity, flat-trajectory round for the short, handy, lever-action carbines. These are many problems to be overcome by those who would improve on the performance of the 30-30-class cartridges and lever-action rifles. Severe restrictions are imoosed by the tubular magazine, the lenght of the action and the permissible working pressure. However, by 1982 Ken had, by working within these constraints, developed a cartridge that would push the 139-grain 7mm bullet at close to 2600 fps. At this point, U.S. Repeating Arms Co., who now manufacturers Winchester brand rifles, became interested in the project and decided by 1983 to go ahead and produce Model 94 lever-action rifles for this cartridge. \r\nfederal Cartridge Co. then worked on the final version of the cartridge, making various dimensional changes and opting for the 120-grain bullet weight because they could achieve higher velocity at less pressure than with the 139-grain bullet. The current commercial loading uses a 120-grain Nosler H-jacket bullet which develops a velocity at the muzzle of 2700 fps when fired from a 24-inch barrel.\r\n\r\nThe 7-30 Waters does offer improved performance for those who like the lever-action carbine or rifle and should make a good deer/ black bear- class caliber. However, the majority of 30-30 lever-action fans prefer the short carbine since most are woods and heavy brush hunters, and the 7-30, with its light 120-grain bullet is unlikely to best the 30-30, 32 Special, 38-55, etc. in brush or woods. Also, it is not going to be the answer for the long-range plains or mountain hunter. When fired from a 20-inch barrel, its performance will be considerably reduced, so anyone interested in this caliber will be better served if they buy the rifle rather than the carbine. The light recoil of this cartridge makes it an excellent choice for a woman, boy or anyone who is recoil shy. The 7-30 would probably be at its best in broken-type country with shots varying from patches of brush and trees to open areas and shot ranging from, say, 75 to 175 yards ofr more.', 1, 0, '113.203.189.205', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

In 1893, Spain adopted a new model Mauser in this same caliber. This rifle has been called the Spanish Mauser ever since, although it was also adopted by Mexico and a number of South American countries. Remington chambered their rolling block and Lee rifles for the 7mm about 1897, and later the Model 30. The Winchester Model 54 and 70 also chambered it. Currently, the Ruger Model 77 and Winchester Featherweight bolt action, plus the Ruger Number One single shot offer the 7mm as standard among American-made rifles. However, most British-and European-made bolt-action rifles and combination guns chamber the 7mm Mauser, as do many custom-made rifles each year.\r\n\r\nAlthough originally a military cartridge, the 7x57mm Mauser has proven itself as one of the best all-around sporting rounds ever developed. It is particularly useful in lightweight rifles because it delivers good killing power with  moderate recoil. It has been used successfully on every species of big game on earth, including elephant. However, it is no elephant cartridge in the true sense of the term and its success is due largely to the hunting conditions and ability of the hunters who have used it. Ballistically, it is only less powerful than 270 Winchester or the 280 Remington. It is adequate for most American big game, but is perhaps on the light side for Kodiak bear or moose unless used by an experienced hunter. The 7mm Mauser was discontinued in American-made rifles about 1940 due to lack of popularity. Since the end of WWII, it has become increasingly common due to the influx of surplus 7mm military rifles for several years after the war.

(235473, 7913, 0, 'Ahnab', 6111, 'PISTOL MALFUNCTIONS - Immediate &amp; Remedial Actions', 1325508413, 'Salam & greetings all!\n\nPistol malfunctions is something which we all experience atleast once on the range, irrespective of the type of firearm or ammo we''re running. The usual and tried & true method of "tap, rack & bang" is a sure fire process to clear almost all known stoppages, yet I''ve learned that, at times, this generic method is a simple waste of time. Now, I understand that on the range we have all the time in the world to fix malfunctions, but if you find yourself (God forbid) in a shootout with your life hanging in the balance, time is a commodity we almost never have.\n\nI know that there are a lot of seniors and experienced shooters here for whom remedying these malfunctions is something they could do in their sleep. I''m writing this for relative newbies like myself, as a way of showing more efficient and effective methods of clearing jams in as little time as possible.\n\nNow, first off, a semi-automatic handgun can experience [B]ONLY FOUR TYPES OF MALFUNCTIONS[/B] (provided there''s nothing physically wrong with your firearm or you''re not experiencing any ammo related problems). These malfunctions are: [B]Failure to Feed, Out of Battery, Stovepipe and Double Feed.[/B] A pistol, no matter it''s make, model or year of production, [B]CAN NOT[/B] suffer any malfunctions other than the above mentioned under ordinary circumstances.\n\nOrdinarily, we''re taught that the first three of the aforementioned malfunctions can be cleared using the "tap, rack & bang" method (also known as an [B]"immediate action"[/B]), while the Double Feed requires the longer, [B]"remedial action"[/B]. I think having a generic method of clearing jams, while being easier to remember, is a waste of precious time. A firearm, like any other machine, constantly communicates with the operator, and as such we''re supposed to respond accordingly. So instead of going through the usual "tap, rack & bang" every time, we should look at the malfunction, listen to what the gun is saying, and then reply with the appropriate immediate action.\n\nFirst step in optimizing the kind of immediate action we will take is to remember that there are two places through which the gun will tell you what the problem is: The rear of the slide, and the ejection port (or the chamber). As soon as you experience a malfunction, you simply tilt the nose of the gun up by 10 degrees; this will give you a clear line-of-sight to both possible areas of problem.\n\nBelow is the normal firing stance.\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]7150[/ATTACH]\n\nAs soon as you experience a malfunction, tilt the gun up by 10 degrees.\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]7151[/ATTACH]\n\nBy doing so, you will immediately see the rear of the slide and the chamber.\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]7152[/ATTACH]\n\nNow, you can begin  to problem solve and trouble shoot. Lets take a look at the four malfunctions and the most efficient methods of solving them. Remember, the following methods are meant to save you time, make your fixes more efficient and remove any waste movements you might go through (especially, as I had mentioned earlier, in a shootout).\n\n[B]1. Failure to Feed[/B][B]:[/B] This malfunction requires an immediate action. You will know you''re experiencing a misfire when you pull the trigger, the hammer/striker slams the firing pin and yet nothing happens. This failure usually happens if, either you''re carrying "dud" ammo or the magazine hasn''t seated properly. Since it is impossible to know which of the two is the cause, we tap the magazine to seat it properly incase it wasn''t, and then rack the slide to remove the "dud" round incase it was culprit. Here''s a breakdown:-\n\nStep 1) Tap the magazine to seat it properly.\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]7153[/ATTACH]\n\nStep 2) Rack the slide to remove a misfiring round.\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]7154[/ATTACH]\n\n\n[B]2. Out of Battery:[/B] This malfunction requires an immediate action. In this particular instance, the slide doesn''t follow through properly after the recoil, either because of dirt or mud stuck in the rails, or the fresh round not being chambered properly. You will notice this malfunction when, as you tilt the gun up, the rear of the slide will be "hanging" out of place. Because of this, the gun won''t fire. Here''s what should be done:-\n\nStep 1) You tilt the gun up and see that the slide is out of battery.\n [ATTACH=CONFIG]7155[/ATTACH]\n\nStep 2) To fix, simply slap the rear of the slide to get it back into battery.\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]7156[/ATTACH]\n\n\n[B]3. Stovepipe:[/B] This malfunction requires an immediate action, and is perhaps the easiest to diagnose; if you have a hunk of brass sticking straight up out of your ejection port, you''re experiencing a stove pipe. This malfunction is usually caused by a failure to extract the spent casing of the round you just fired. Here''s the method to clear it:-\n\nStep 1) Tilt the gun up, and you''ll see the spent casing sticking out of the ejection port.\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]7157[/ATTACH]\n\nStep 2) Simply sweep aggressively across the spent casing to dislodge it. This will get rid of the stovepipe and the slide will rack home.\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]7158[/ATTACH]\n\nStep 3) Get your gun back on target and shoot away.\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]7159[/ATTACH]\n\n\n[B]Continued in my next post...[/B]', 1, 1, '111.68.105.241', 0, 1, 10, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

Here''s the fix:-\n\nStep 1) Pull the slide back and lock it.\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]7160[/ATTACH]\n\nStep 2) Dump the source of ammunition.\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]7161[/ATTACH]\n\nStep 3) Aggressively rack the slide thrice to make sure that the chamber is now clear.\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]7162[/ATTACH]\n\nStep 4) Load up a new magazine.\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]7163[/ATTACH]\n\nStep 5) Rack the slide to chamber a fresh round.\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]7164[/ATTACH]\n\n\nThat''s it, all four malfunctions covered.

However I don''t think it''ll ever be in the 70 K range as it is a much better gun than Taurus etc. \n\n@Ak47 A little birdy told me you were in talks for some days and getting one yesterday. ;) Congratulations you got yourself a winner ! Looking forward to your review.\n\n@Mitho & Mig The trigger reset is not a problem just a personal preference. We are used to shooting Double Action/Single Action triggers, the Caracal has a Double Action Only (DAO) trigger. I.e the trigger does not get lighter after the first shot, it stays the same on every shot.\n\n@Aquarius Lolz, I completely agree and the very same thought went through my mind when I was shooting it afterwards ;) \n\n@Moeen On point 1: I agree, thought the same thing that it should be covered but upon closer inspection not easy to get those little springs out. There was quite a lot of mud on the slide underbelly after the mud/water test but it still kept shooting. Personally like you I''d like one to be there just in case.\n\nOn point 2: Agreed again. The sights should really be removable. \n\nIn 100k there is just the box, gun, two mags and a manual. Accessories are optional. Dunno how much they cost. As far as parts, I raised that question with the distributor and he assured me parts will not be a problem and the guns will come with warranties.

However, the Sharpe & Hart case has a slightly larger rim and base diameter but its popularity in the U.S. was quite limited by competition from the 7mm Weatherby Magnum, the 7mm Remington Magnum and various wildcat developments. The 7mm S&H is, nonetheless, a very fine fine cartridge for any North American game and most African plains game.

The 7mm Weatherby Magnum, offered as a maximum performance cartridge to satisfy the demand to the 284 enthusiasts, is probably the best known widely used 7mm Magnums. This is due to the availability of factory-loaded ammunition with a good selection of bullet weights, and in part to the very fine Weatherby rifles. The 7mm has a slight edge over the 270 Weatherby on tough or dangerous game because it uses somewhat heavier bullets and churn up greater energy. However, if long-range varmint shooting is on the agenda, the 270 is better choice. The 7mm WM is adequate for any North American big game and all thin-skinned African game.

Most other manufacturers have since added it to their lines. It took an American manufacturer nearly 40 years to realize that the 275 Holland & Holland (made long ago by Western Cartridge Co.) is a first-rate, medium-game, long-range caliber. The long line of 7mm wildcats and the 7x61S&H are much like the old 275 H&H, which came out in 192-1913.\r\nRemington chose to ignore the classic 7mm bullet, a 160-grain spitzer, in its 7mm Magnum loads. For some inexplicable reason, too, Remington handicapped the 150-grain by using  a rather round-nosed bullet.\r\n\r\nThe 7mm Remington Magnum is fine, long-range, gir game cartridge that could also be adapted to varmint hunting. There ia a good selection of 7mm bullets available and the handloader could make it do for just about anything. It has ample power for any North American big game and probably most thin-skinned African varieties. However, it would be an open-country, plains or mountain cartridge rather than a woods or brush number. Many will compare it with the 7mm WM or the 7x61mm Sharpe & Hart. Bitter arguments will ensue as to which is the best or most powerful. This will be akin to the ancient Greek pastime of discussing how many spirits can dance on the head of a pin. In other words, any difference in these cartridges will be strictly a matter of opinion or imagination. They all have about the same case capacity and none will do any thing the others can''t duplicate. In fact, the 7mm Remington is hardly a new or brilliant design because it is largely a commercial version of several of the wildcat short-belted 7mm magnums (Auckley, Luft, Mashburn, etc.). Its principal advantage lies in the fact that it is a standard factory product that is widely distributed and available in well-made, moderately-priced rifles. Come to think of it, that''s quite a bit to a lot of people.

The 284 Winchester should be a good long-range cartridge for any North American big game under ideal conditions. It could also be adapted for varmint shooting.

"The Pakistan Hunting & Sporting Arms Development Company"...\nWhat was the show called by PHSADC? "The Premier Shooting & Hunting Sports Show"\n\nMy question to PHSADC is: Is an assault rifle really a hunting & sporting gun? Was there even a single 0.22 cal bolt action rifle displayed by any of the participants (to the best of my knowledge, there was none, as I spend 2 hours finding one). They should have been clear in the first place about what will be allowed to be displayed & what not.\n\nWhat our local industry needs to do is to focus on small/big caliber hunting / target shooting bolt action rifles alongwith improving quality of the 12Gague shotguns, and this is the prime weakness in our local arms industry. \n\nI was surprised to find some 12guage SxS Sidelock shotgun, being displayed by the most reputable armory in Pakistan, with price tag of 400k+ (export only model), and when I asked the reason for such a nice price tag, I was given the example of "Holland & Holland" that see how expensive they are....Well, this cannot justify this price tag. The only thing that can justify such prices is the quality and the art of workmanship put in by the gunsmith, and to my disappointment, when I asked the exhibitor to disassemble the shotgun, so that I could examine the barrel independently, after struggling with it for around 5 minutes, he excused that the gun is brand new and seems like it needs some oiling... this was the mechanical quality which I saw, and about the quality of the bore, better not discuss it at all. I wonder if there is a proof house in our country?\n\nI have been using shotguns since last 15 years, and I have never put any oil in my shotgun except for the kerosene oil which I use for cleaning purposes. Yet the assembling & dissembling is as smooth as anything... And here, I am referring to a 50 years old, cheapest gun of its time "by Gecado, Germany" which I inherited from my grand father... This doesn''t even have any engraving in it....\n\nBy this post, I do not intend to finger point at any company in Pakistan, but want to give some serious points to ponder for PHSADC. We want to buy Pakistani hunting guns, we want to rely on their brand names for quality and performance, but how can we? Any new gun enthusiast hunter today will go out, get a license (its another story how to get it...), and >80% of the time will opt for an imported gun...\n\nThis is the age of global competition.

If the buyer sees that a handgun is being offered in a US$ 350 - 400 range in the US market whereas other prominent brands, such as CZ, are being offered in the range of US$ 800 - 1,200 then the buyer would EXPECT more or less the same price differential. What is happening is that here in Pakistan, we have CZ''s top of the line products being offered in the range of Rs. 90,000 to Rs. 130,000 whereas Caracal''s two models, F and C are being offered at Rs. 100,000 to Rs. 125,000.\n\nA knowledgeable buyer will also be aware of the fact that the documentation and import duties involved, while importing firearms to Pakistan, from US/EU countries are 2 to 2.5 times higher as compared to importing firearms from South America, UAE, China and Turkey. Even the processing time is much shorter.\n\nBased on these (as well as other factors, already discussed in earlier posts), *it is my firm view that the Gun-Enthusiasts'' Community of Pakistan will expect the price to further come down.*\n\n\n*Local market options*\n\nWe are comparing Caracal with Glock and Steyr. We MUST understand that Glock and Steyr are already positioned at an artificial and exaggerated price in Pakistan. A Glock sells for around US$ 400 in the US market (remember, CZ sells for at least twice that amount over there) and Caracal is trying to position itself at a price lower than US$ 400 over there. So, therfore, it is not logical to compare the price at which Caracal is trying to sell their products here in Pakistan with the ridiculous price at which Glock is being sold here (Rs. 300,000+ or USD 3,750+). \n\nWe should also note that price-wise, a Glock and Caracal comparison is not an apples to apples comparison from the perspective that (because of reasons mentioned above) brands originating from US/EU should be compared with other brands originating from the same region. We should not compare prices of brands originating from US/EU with brands originating from countries like Turkey, UAE, China and Brazil. \n\nPakistani gun-enthusiasts have several other options (even better options) in the price range of Rs. 100,000 to Rs. 150,000. Caracal will have a very hard time trying to position itself as a serious contender in this price range. If they are really interested in penetrating the market and it is turnover that they are interested in, then an introductory price of Rs. 50,000 to 60,000 should be considered. Even CZ adopted the same approach, when they entered our market at Rs. 80,000 and then slowly increased their price to Rs. 100,000''ish. And we all can see how well they have positioned their products now.\n\n\n*CONCLUSION:\n\n_REALISTIC PRICE RANGE: RS. 55,000 - RS. 75,000_\n\n\nHaving said all that, we will still have A FEW enthusiasts who will always be willing to procure a gun at the first given opportunity without giving much consideration to the price. There will still be few for whom price is secondary. However, from a business perspective, Caracal should not be targeting those few but rather, the overall gun-enthusiasts'' community at large. Moreover, let me assure everyone that those FEW are becoming FEWER by the day because of contributions of a couple of our local gun forums, both of which are trying their best and doing a commendable job in educating the gun-enthusiasts community and helping them make better buy decisions.*', 1, 1, '182.178.165.164', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

I''d rather train hard & train right in order to save time in a gunfight, than learn a generic process and loose time in a gunfight.

If I can save even a tenth of a second clearing a jam in the middle of a gunfight, that fraction of a second will allow me to get back into the fight faster and may very well save my life. In all honesty, I actually found having four different methods simpler to follow and learn because they''re very logical, and therefore very instinctive.

But the asking price of 100k is definitely an insult to my intelligence. \n\n@ 12gauge bro\n\n\n+1. Now I did suggest in a post of mine on the other thread (by Mr. Abbas... the torture test thread) that the comparison should be broadened for Caracal is not the only (and certainly not numero uno) manufacturer of polymer guns in the world... and we do have the tauruses available locally which are excellent polymer guns for their value and are often compared to the Glocks (of course I''m not excluding Turkish guns from the list, but Taurus is the more compared make against Glock generally). I don''t think it is proper to pin Caracal specifically against Glock/HK... that only aids in creating a hype which would ultimately benefit the dealer/s.\n\nOn reliability: No test is like the test of time. The piece does look good. But only time would tell how well it can be relied upon. Both Glock and HK have proved their worth and tactical usefulness over a lengthy period of time.\n\nAnother point is the propriety Plasox treatment that Caracal undergoes:\n\n"[COLOR=#000000][FONT=sans-serif]The metal parts receive a proprietary "Plasox" [/FONT][/COLOR][URL="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitriding#Plasma_nitriding"]plasma-based nitriding[/URL][COLOR=#000000][FONT=sans-serif] with an enclosed postoxidizin surface treatment producing an oxidation protective coating resistant to aggressive environmental conditions.[/FONT][/COLOR][SUP][URL="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caracal_pistol#cite_note-13"][14][/URL][/SUP][SUP][URL="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caracal_pistol#cite_note-14"][15][/URL][/SUP][COLOR=#000000][FONT=sans-serif] The manufacturer claims that this proprietary protective coating method is relatively environmental friendly, is very durable and protects well against rust.[/FONT][/COLOR][SUP]"\n[/SUP]\n(Copied from Wikipedia)\n\nWe can look at Caracal''s Plasox treatment viz-a-viz the Melonite of Glock/XDm or the Tennifer treatment of HK/Taurus. Ultimately i guess it is Ferritic Nitrocarburizing vs. the Heat Treatment (Nitriding). Perhaps you can shed some more light on this as science is your field.

To my understanding FOB Ex-factory price of Caracal F is not more than US$350 which translates into  Rs. 31500 ( I am not taking under invoicing in account which definitely be there).\n\nNow all the duties on import per current rates (accumulated) are 50% for a semi auto pistol taking its landed cost to Rs. 47250, adding 10% more on account of overheads be its net cost for importer that is [B]Rs. 51975 ( and be Rs. 44550 if invoice value is USD300).[/B]\n\nNow my question to all dealers/importers bitten gun enthusiast community is; HOW MUCH PROFIT A DEALER n IMPORTER SHOULD BE HAVING ON ?\n\nMy personal resolution is not to buy Caracal above Rs.65000, I will never buy it (even its proved 3 times better than Glock) unless its sold on its natural price point. I am better of with any Turkish handgun than UAE''s if had to pay premium on; although paying premium on the guns originated from countries we are on their embargo list pinches a lot but for Caracal its totally not acceptable. \n\nOnce again I no way am bashing Caracal, I love this gun & be having one as soon its available at the price it should be, my concern is UNDUE PROFIT TO DEALERS which to my surprise all the above posts are over looking & even being helpful to be made from innocent gun enthusiast community.\n\nOk more later....[/QUOTE]\n\n+1 denovo brother: Further to your working if someone compares the price of Glock and Caracal (If dealershaip still remains) in USA, he should also consider the fact that Glock is their homeland production without any custom levies where as while importing any firearm out of the US borders, its fob increases by freight and custom levies making it equal to glock''s price. A very good example of this calculation is the price of Viking in the US and Canada market which is almost equalent with the MRSP of Glock. Point to note that probably even not legally imported in Pakistan, Viking is available at Rs. 50K.\nAs far as duties and levies of Pistol imports in Pakistan, you have already granted an allowance for Caracal while taking it at 50%. Actually aggregate % of duties and levies comes to 40% of the invoice value for NPB''s and 50% for PB''s.\nIn case importers of Caracal considers reasonable profits, I am in the list of Want to Buy.', 1, 0, '119.154.126.112', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

To my understanding FOB Ex-factory price of Caracal F is not more than US$350 which translates into  Rs. 31500 ( I am not taking under invoicing in account which definitely be there).\n\nNow all the duties on import per current rates (accumulated) are 50% for a semi auto pistol taking its landed cost to Rs. 47250, adding 10% more on account of overheads be its net cost for importer that is [B]Rs. 51975 ( and be Rs. 44550 if invoice value is USD300).[/B]\n\nNow my question to all dealers/importers bitten gun enthusiast community is; HOW MUCH PROFIT A DEALER n IMPORTER SHOULD BE HAVING ON ?\n\nMy personal resolution is not to buy Caracal above Rs.65000, I will never buy it (even its proved 3 times better than Glock) unless its sold on its natural price point. I am better of with any Turkish handgun than UAE''s if had to pay premium on; although paying premium on the guns originated from countries we are on their embargo list pinches a lot but for Caracal its totally not acceptable. \n\nOnce again I no way am bashing Caracal, I love this gun & be having one as soon its available at the price it should be, my concern is UNDUE PROFIT TO DEALERS which to my surprise all the above posts are over looking & even being helpful to be made from innocent gun enthusiast community.\n\nOk more later....[/QUOTE]\n\n+1 denovo sir...price must be reduced and dealers should refrain from making extraordinary profits....i think if the dealers start selling this handgun at the price equivalent to taurus/turkish handguns, there sales would increase two or threefold.hence they ''ll be able to make the same (or more) amounts of profits than wat they are making now.', 1, 0, '203.99.178.142', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

I am involved in the International Brand supply chain business and  know very well what a licensed shop is in comparison with an ordinary  shopkeeper.\n\nWe are welcoming Caracal UAE with open arms (all this debate is a clear indication of)  we love to use products of our brotherly countries and all Turkish  brands selling here are a good example of that. We donot have any  problem with Caracal UAE [B]they made an excellent handgun and  showed good gesture by giving a reasonable discount on products being  exported to Pakistan which we must thank them for.

Still what do the two have in common aside from independent designers?  WAKE UP EVERYONE!!!!  They were made in Austria by a mostly Austrian labor force recognized by world over (you don''t ever F**k with the: Austrians, Swiss, & Germans).  Who makes the Caracal?  No I mean WHO IS ACTUALLY MAKING THE CARACAL?  Its NOT the Euros mentioned above, yeah they designed it.  Its not the Arabs as they believe that labor is beneath them.  PEOPLE, ITS THE PAKISTANIS, INDIANS, AND OTHER THIRD WORLD SERVANTS!  I remember a recruitment drive in DAK for this Caracal factory over five years ago; and can very very easily trace out the DAK workers there should anyone be interested.  Sooo, maybe I should do the same - get a desi .30 bore and then have a Chinese official or some gora sign off on it - it will NOT make my item unique or EVOLUTIONARY.  AND they are not assembling only, this foreign third world labor is doing just that labor (making, grinding, bluing, casting, etc).\n[*]Then lets talk a little about Evolution, in case of Glock, since its design inception, it went through four different model designs before finalizing on Gen One, and then so on; however, the overall mechanism(s) has remained the same.  In case of Steyr, there is some stuff borrowed over from what Glock never used in design AND ALSO obsolete in the eyes of the International Trade Copyrights and Patents.  The rest was pretty much restyled to beat the lawsuits.  One must remember that once a designer sells his patents to a company; he looses ALL rights to at a later time copy or rework that design unless authorized by the owner of the patents.  Either that or the person can wait for 15+ years.  So a gun designer is approached and then is given money for his design and given money to make it even better prior to production.  This has been done with Steyr M9.  Sooo I am curious as to what kind of camel-hump-meat was given to this Caracal designer for dinner to so call "evolutionize" over the Glock or Steyr with a Caracal.\n[*]Fact is, given this market of international patents and copyrights - the designers had to choose what mechanisms could be had with form changes 20+% and what needs to work the same but using other variables.  So they got rid of the internal rods, pins and replaced them with leaf springs (In my opinion a very bad idea especially when exposed to the elements or the user who cannot do a proper field strip or to just the carbon buildup from usage).  Some of the things they decided to bypass common sense, like the rear sight, come on, even .30 bore has a removable sight.... and it costs less.  On the their plus side Caracal concentrated on the Glocks movie look.  A front pistol grip and a rear stock... yeah right!  Ok ok done but should have been done with elegance... not the airsoft look.  Then we get to the side panels, on Abbas bhai''s Caracal review I can see one of the side panels is protruding out meaning about to fall out.  And the side panel thing is crap if its only offering colors.  This idea came out with the HK P30 and they give you extra for various grip and size options.  In case of Caracal: Oh no Not Yellow (for days I feel like a chicken), not blue (for days I am blue), and red and black... what ever!\n[*]I was there when in 1985, a Florida Police Dept put the Glock through the tests with SWAT.  There was only one gun given.  It was dropped from third story tower (where SWAT practiced window intrusions) LOADED.  It was picked up and fired immediately (NOT CLEANED).  Then it was thrown in beach sand (Loaded) taken out - shaken and then shot (fired only five rounds then jammed).  But the worst thing they did to check strength was hammering in a 9x21 round in the barrel/slide and then firing it!  After replacing a magazine rel. button and ejecting the blown case from the chamber, they kept firing for another 500 rounds.  Oh and did I mention their water test?  Take a bucket fill with water and then clay fine mud - dump the gun inside and then roll it around - take it out - shake off the mud and fire (fired a little of half a clip). \nI have many many points I can start to think of as I sit here in front of my pc but will not waste time.  Rather if I remember something I will only add to this post.  I am of the humble opinion that this Caracal is NOT worth more than 70k with all the goodies (goodies = butt, four mags, foregrip, and panels).  Caracal needs to sort itself out by being more objective as to their design rather than trying to make a picturesque object.  They need to get a better (more educated) labor force.  For me there is nothing special about this pistol.  Caracal is charging the same money for their product as Glock but are NOT able to make the same quality via labor where as Glock and Steyr is.  [I][SIZE=4]As for AK47 bhai, he is in love with this pistol so to him even if he paid over 110k/rs he is content - I say more power to you brother and to hell with what everyone else thinks.[/SIZE][/I]\n[*]Lastly, I say this, I am willing to test against two Caracals the F and the C models some of my pistols WITH minimum of 2 Mods present.  I will conduct the test as I see fit EQUALLY meaning no complaining about broken sights or color marring or dents or dings on plastic.  So when can we do the test?

I have at the moment forgotten what became of the gills and the gill-slits in reptiles/mammals but I think it transformed into larynx or the throat or something like that. And no hiccuping has nothing to do with the remains of our gills. If that had been the case all land quadrupeds (descendants of the primitive 4-legged creatures) would be expected to hiccup, which is not the case. Hiccup is a characteristic feature of mammals only. The definite reasons of it are not fully understood yet. Snakes, lizards, birds, frogs and crocodiles don''t engage in this (in)glorious activity.\n\nHaving written all this mini-article has drained my mental and finger energy for now.

Still what do the two have in common aside from independent designers?  WAKE UP EVERYONE!!!!  They were made in Austria by a mostly Austrian labor force recognized by world over (you don''t ever F**k with the: Austrians, Swiss, & Germans).  Who makes the Caracal?  No I mean WHO IS ACTUALLY MAKING THE CARACAL?  Its NOT the Euros mentioned above, yeah they designed it.  Its not the Arabs as they believe that labor is beneath them.  PEOPLE, ITS THE PAKISTANIS, INDIANS, AND OTHER THIRD WORLD SERVANTS!  I remember a recruitment drive in DAK for this Caracal factory over five years ago; and can very very easily trace out the DAK workers there should anyone be interested.  Sooo, maybe I should do the same - get a desi .30 bore and then have a Chinese official or some gora sign off on it - it will NOT make my item unique or EVOLUTIONARY.  AND they are not assembling only, this foreign third world labor is doing just that labor (making, grinding, bluing, casting, etc).\n[*]Then lets talk a little about Evolution, in case of Glock, since its design inception, it went through four different model designs before finalizing on Gen One, and then so on; however, the overall mechanism(s) has remained the same.  In case of Steyr, there is some stuff borrowed over from what Glock never used in design AND ALSO obsolete in the eyes of the International Trade Copyrights and Patents.  The rest was pretty much restyled to beat the lawsuits.  One must remember that once a designer sells his patents to a company; he looses ALL rights to at a later time copy or rework that design unless authorized by the owner of the patents.  Either that or the person can wait for 15+ years.  So a gun designer is approached and then is given money for his design and given money to make it even better prior to production.  This has been done with Steyr M9.  Sooo I am curious as to what kind of camel-hump-meat was given to this Caracal designer for dinner to so call "evolutionize" over the Glock or Steyr with a Caracal.\n[*]Fact is, given this market of international patents and copyrights - the designers had to choose what mechanisms could be had with form changes 20+% and what needs to work the same but using other variables.  So they got rid of the internal rods, pins and replaced them with leaf springs (In my opinion a very bad idea especially when exposed to the elements or the user who cannot do a proper field strip or to just the carbon buildup from usage).  Some of the things they decided to bypass common sense, like the rear sight, come on, even .30 bore has a removable sight.... and it costs less.  On the their plus side Caracal concentrated on the Glocks movie look.  A front pistol grip and a rear stock... yeah right!  Ok ok done but should have been done with elegance... not the airsoft look.  Then we get to the side panels, on Abbas bhai''s Caracal review I can see one of the side panels is protruding out meaning about to fall out.  And the side panel thing is crap if its only offering colors.  This idea came out with the HK P30 and they give you extra for various grip and size options.  In case of Caracal: Oh no Not Yellow (for days I feel like a chicken), not blue (for days I am blue), and red and black... what ever!\n[*]I was there when in 1985, a Florida Police Dept put the Glock through the tests with SWAT.  There was only one gun given.  It was dropped from third story tower (where SWAT practiced window intrusions) LOADED.  It was picked up and fired immediately (NOT CLEANED).  Then it was thrown in beach sand (Loaded) taken out - shaken and then shot (fired only five rounds then jammed).  But the worst thing they did to check strength was hammering in a 9x21 round in the barrel/slide and then firing it!  After replacing a magazine rel. button and ejecting the blown case from the chamber, they kept firing for another 500 rounds.  Oh and did I mention their water test?  Take a bucket fill with water and then clay fine mud - dump the gun inside and then roll it around - take it out - shake off the mud and fire (fired a little of half a clip). \nI have many many points I can start to think of as I sit here in front of my pc but will not waste time.  Rather if I remember something I will only add to this post.  I am of the humble opinion that this Caracal is NOT worth more than 70k with all the goodies (goodies = butt, four mags, foregrip, and panels).  Caracal needs to sort itself out by being more objective as to their design rather than trying to make a picturesque object.  They need to get a better (more educated) labor force.  For me there is nothing special about this pistol.  Caracal is charging the same money for their product as Glock but are NOT able to make the same quality via labor where as Glock and Steyr is.  [I][SIZE=4]As for AK47 bhai, he is in love with this pistol so to him even if he paid over 110k/rs he is content - I say more power to you brother and to hell with what everyone else thinks.[/SIZE][/I]\n[*]Lastly, I say this, I am willing to test against two Caracals the F and the C models some of my pistols WITH minimum of 2 Mods present.  I will conduct the test as I see fit EQUALLY meaning no complaining about broken sights or color marring or dents or dings on plastic.  So when can we do the test?  Anyone?\n[/LIST]\n[/QUOTE]\n\nLovely post my BnS bro, no one can advocate a Glock better than you bro... Bravo\n\nAnyways I dont give a damn if subcontinent or Ethiopian labor is employed to make Caracal, if Mr. William B. was a in designer team or shooting team, Caracal is on my wish list and I will be buying 2 of these very very soon as I know they are coming to the price point I voted for very very soon.', 1, 1, '182.178.130.70', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

For three-quarters of a century, .22 was the sales leader in America, while .177 lead in Europe nearly all that time. In the 1970s, when many British and European models started being imported to this country in large numbers, the preference for .177 came along with them and now the U.S. is in line with the rest of the airgun world. But newcomers often ask, "What are the significant differences between these two calibers, and why should I care?"\n\n\n. In any airgun, .22 is always more powerful.\n\nThis is true irrespective of the type of powerplant, length of barrel or anything else. Twenty-two delivers about 20% more punch in any given airgun. The technical specifications for the Air Arms Pro Sport illustrate that.\n\nThe same difference holds true for all other models of air rifles and pistols. When the velocity is given, the .22 is always slower, but we should not fail to appreciate that it shoots a pellet weighing twice as much. That''s where the extra power comes from.\n\n. .177 is the caliber for 10-meter target guns - period!\n\nOnly .177 is the caliber accepted by all international 10-meter shooting organizations. That means all target guns are made in that caliber and no other. The extra care given to the construction of target guns ensures that .177 target airguns are the most accurate. There are no .22-caliber equivalents.\n\n. .22 caliber dominates the hunting scene\n\nWhile is is possible to hunt with a .177, .22 caliber is by far the favorite. Sometimes, a .177 pellet will pass through the game animal without doing enough severe damage to stop the animal. Hunters who have had their quarry run away after a solid hit often switch to .22 immediately thereafter.\n\nEven a .22 pellet is no guarantee of a humane kill. The pellet still has to hit a vital spot, and even then there may be some running or thrashing after the hit - but hunters notice a decided advantage when they use .22 caliber.\n\n. .177 pellets are cheaper\nThere is a big advantage to the smaller caliber here. Not only are there more pellets to choose from in .177, they also come more to a box and cost a significant amount less. Look at Crosman Premiers in .177 compared to Premiers in .22 for a comparison. If you look at the pellet count per box, you''ll see that you get exactly twice as many .177s as .22s for the same price. That''s a dramatic example, for sure, because the usual price difference is more like 30%, or so. If you plan on doing a lot of target shooting and general plinking, .177 is your best bet.\n\n\n\nI hope this short discussion helps some people make the choice between calibers. In the end, of course, either caliber can satisfy most shooting needs.\n\n^ Link: [url]http://www.pyramydair.com/blog/2005/04/differences-between-177-22-and-which.html[/url]\n\n\nBeing a hunter and not punching much paper, I have, and always will prefer .22 over the .177 in small-bore airguns. The points are stated above.\n\nSome may argue that the .25cal delivers more energy for a cleaner kill of small sized game like rabbits, squirrel, etc, than the .22, but then the trajectory intervenes.. .22 has a relatively flat trajectory especially in the more powerful air rifles, and this is almost the same as the .177s trajectory. The .25 is a much heavier pellet and thus the pellet starts dropping after say half the distance as of a .22 or .177. We can conclude that it has a RAINBOW-LIKE trajectory and thus many will prefer the .22 over the .25 in this aspect.\n\n\nEdit: And folks, newer .177 airguns, specially Magnum Springers produce velocities over 1200fps. At this speed, the pellet will swirl on the way (as it crosses the sound barrier and thus moves around), resulting in poor accuracy.', 1, 1, '119.73.6.247', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

You&#8217;ve heard good things about the shotgun  as a defensive weapon, it was even endorsed by anti-gun vice president  Joe Biden, and you are wondering if it is the right weapon for you.  Today we are going to help you make that decision.\n\n I must say that believe that a shotgun can make an excellent weapon  for home defense.  There are a lot of shotgun myths out there, though,  and here we are going to separate the fact from the fiction so that you  are better able to make an informed choice about whether or not the  shotgun is the right weapon to defend your home. What follows are three  of the most common myths associated with shotguns along with the  reality. If you are considering a shotgun mainly for one of the  following reasons, than you might want to reconsider and go with another  option.\n\n\n [B]Myth #1: Shot spreads so you don&#8217;t have to aim[/B]\n\n This myth commonly includes something to the effect that shotguns are  good in dim environments because you just have to point it in their  general direction and the spread pattern of the shot will do the rest.  While it is true that the pellets spread after firing, it is equally  true that many people exaggerate the amount of spread in their heads.  Buck shot from a standard off the rack 12-guage spreads at a rate of  between one half inch and one full inch per yard, so if you are shooting  at somebody fifteen feet across your living room, the spread is only  going to be one and a half to three inches. While this is certainly a  larger margin of error than the less than half inch of a .45 or 9mm  round, it still requires some aiming to be effective.\n\n\n [B]Myth #2: Shotguns are less [/B][B][B]dangerous [/B]to neighbors and co-inhabitants because the pellets will not go through the walls.[/B]\n\n \n In truth a 00 buck shot pellet will go right through drywall, and can  even go through wood paneling at the ranges that we are talking about  in most confrontations in the home.  If you are using a slug, rather  than shot, it will go through your wall, the neighbor&#8217;s apartment, and  their far wall as well. Ah but what about bird shot? You ask. At close  enough range even bird shot can go through drywall, although the chances  of it happening are slimmer, the real problem with using bird shot for  home defense is lack of stopping power.  With bird shot you are nearly  as likely to anger the intruder as you are to drop him, even former vice  president Cheney shot a seventy-eight year old man in the face with a  load of bird shot while hunting, and he pulled through just fine.If your  load has trouble eliminating septuagenarians it has no place in home  defense.\n\n [B]\nMyth #3: The impressive sound of a pump action shotgun racking will stop any intruder in his or her tracks.[/B]\n\n While this myth might be &#8216;true&#8217; in some situations, it will prove to  be otherwise as well. Everybody has a different reaction to a sudden  burst of fear such as can be caused by the sound of a well-armed home  owner racking his 12-guage, but for most people those reactions boil  down to two responses, flight (which is what you are hoping for) or  fight (which is not). This reaction can lead to a more dangerous  confrontation than would have otherwise been, as a burglar not knowing  you were home suddenly thinks he has to kill or be killed because he  knows you are armed and know he is there. Even worse, in this situation  the sound of you sliding your pump has given away your location.\n\n With those myths exposed for what they are, do you still consider a  shotgun to be a good option for defense of your home? As I said  previously, I am a believer in the shotgun as home defense weapon, and  would certainly reach for mine if I heard somebody breaking into my home  in the middle of the night. A shotgun packs a tremendous amount of  energy in a close range environment such as those in defense of home  situations, and is good at dropping an intruder with one shot provided  you get a decent hit.\n Get the facts you need about shotguns &#8211; [URL="http://www.homedefensegun.net/shotgun"][B]The Home Defense Shotgun.[/B][/URL]\n\nthe link to this article: [url]http://www.homedefensegun.net/3-shotgun-myths/[/url]', 1, 1, '116.0.62.161', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

This should be determined by looking into the prices of guns which land here without any extra bribes or passing through any kind of restrictions. Almost all shotguns, .22rifles and handguns made in Turkey, China, Brazil, Russia fall in this category. To my knowledge importes get 30% discounts on minimum recomended retail prices.

I did take afew pics of the Clone when I was in Pakistan and you''d be pleased to know just found them on my USB Memory Stick, However I do not have any pics of the Original one yet bcos I live in the UK and I got my cousin to buy that for me a few months ago while I was here so I have not seen it myself either, apart from seeing it on the Skype, lol. I did not get a chance to test fire the clone either due to a very busy schedule when I was in Pak, which was only for a short time. So the Clone still remains a virgin. BUT, I will be popping its cherry when I go Pakistan next time Inshallah, Along with a few other foreign babes (Handguns and Rifles) that have been purchased for me in my absence including the new Original CF by Norinco. And I will tell u what I''ll do for you guys... I will do a quick comparison bw the Clone and the Original. Even though the results is pretty obvious that the Original one is gonna be on top but we’ll see what the clone has to offer for it’s Price. I Bought it from a well-known dealer in Peshawar who were probably the first ones to set up their own CF98 (Clone) plant and gave me assurance that it shouldn’t let me down but I am yet to find that out myself when I take it for a ride on my next visit Inshallah. When my cousin went to get the Original CF for me a few months ago I told him to ask the dealer about the possibility of Part-Exchanging the Clone towards the price of the new Original one and he did. He rang me back and said that the dealer’s best Offer if I wish to part exchange my CF98 Clone towards the price of the new one is 10K, which means he’ll knock off 10K off the new price and I will end up getting the Original CF for 30K instead of 40K. It was the same dealer I had bought the Clone from and He knew the price we had paid him for the Clone  was higher than hiss offer and also knew the Clone was still brand new un-used in original packing, Not fired and almost same condition as it was when we bought it from him. But that’s a dealer for you. However after giving it a thorough thought I refused to Part-ex the clone towards the new Original one and decided to keep the Clone for rough use. I’ve kept the Clone because I''m just gonna rag it out. Abusing it is not gonna bother me at all due to the fact its a Clone and also due to its Price. Another reason for keeping it is off course the use of local Ammo which is something I’ll not be using with my Original one. As this is not my main hand gun so I intend to get lots and lots of local ammo and bhang the life out of it, it’s a cheaper way of having fun I guess. have already bought a box of 50 “Sher” brand 9mm rounds for Rs.800. Lol. I’ve tried that Brand with a .30 Bore TT before and not even a single one miss-fired so I assume that should be the case with 9mm too. \n[ATTACH=CONFIG]7293[/ATTACH][ATTACH=CONFIG]7294[/ATTACH][ATTACH=CONFIG]7295[/ATTACH][ATTACH=CONFIG]7296[/ATTACH][ATTACH=CONFIG]7297[/ATTACH]', 1, 0, '90.193.158.158', 0, 1, 5, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

"The Pakistan Hunting & Sporting Arms Development Company"...\r\nWhat was the show called by PHSADC?        "The Premier Shooting & Hunting Sports Show"\r\n\r\nMy question to PHSADC is: Is an assault rifle really a hunting & sporting gun? Was there even a single 0.22 cal bolt action rifle displayed by any of the participants (to the best of my knowledge, there was none, as I spend 2 hours finding one). They should have been clear in the first place about what will be allowed to be displayed & what not.\r\n\r\nWhat our local industry needs to do is to focus on small/big caliber hunting / target shooting bolt action rifles alongwith improving quality of the 12Gague shotguns, and this is the prime weakness in our local arms industry. \r\n\r\nI was surprised to find some 12guage SxS Sidelock shotgun, being displayed by the most reputable armory in Pakistan, with price tag of 400k+ (export only model), and when I asked the reason for such a nice price tag, I was given the example of "Holland & Holland" that see how expensive they are....Well, this cannot justify this price tag. The only thing that can justify such prices is the quality and the art of workmanship put in by the gunsmith, and to my disappointment, when I asked the exhibitor to disassemble the shotgun, so that I could examine the barrel independently,  after struggling with it for around 5 minutes, he excused that the gun is brand new and seems like it needs some oiling... this was the mechanical quality which I saw, and about the quality of the bore, better not discuss it at all. I wonder if there is a proof house in our country?\r\n\r\nI have been using shotguns since last 15 years, and I have never put any oil in my shotgun except for the kerosene oil which I use for cleaning purposes. Yet the assembling & dissembling is as smooth as anything... And here, I am referring to a 50 years old, cheapest gun of its time "by Gecado, Germany" which I inherited from my grand father... This doesn''t even have any engraving in it....\r\n\r\nBy this post, I do not intend to finger point at any company in Pakistan, but want to give some serious points to ponder for PHSADC. We want to buy Pakistani hunting guns, we want to rely on their brand names for quality and performance, but how can we?

At sharah e faisal, entering to Tipu Sultan sultan road, from dunkin donuts, i was talking on my cell phone, with half of the window down, my sixth sense alarmed that a bike (with two persons) has started following me, since i was talking on phone so didn''t bother, when i tried to take left turn (towards KMCHS), they hit on right front fender, when car was dead slow, I stopped the car (that was my mistake), and asked them whether everything was alright, (while i was still in the car), the guy sitting on the back of bike suddenly grabbed my shirt and asked for the mobile / valet, the other person had the 636 (with hammer up). I said okay okay wait wait, day raha hoon, day raha hoon and i started looking for my mobile which i placed on dashboard near cig. lighter of car. While i was picking my phone, looking at their face, both of them had an eye contact with each other, that was the time i pulled out my gun. The guy sitting on back shouted, bhaag iss kay paas TT hai. They ran away, i rushed from there keeping gun in my hand afterwards i put that front seat, reached home, then i observed that there was a bullet in a chamber with hammer pulled up. I tried to remember when did i slide the rack, but wasnt able to remember, it must be done when i just pulled out my gun, though i dont remember.\n\nThe crux is, when you can use the gun, you will definitely slide the rack in the event of danger, naturally, like when we drive the car, we dont even remember when we change the gear from 1 to 2, 2 to 3 and onwards.\n\nMy dad (R.I.P) used to say, never pull out your weapon, unless you and your family are in a safe position.

"The Pakistan Hunting & Sporting Arms Development Company"...\r\nWhat was the show called by PHSADC?        "The Premier Shooting & Hunting Sports Show"\r\n\r\nMy question to PHSADC is: Is an assault rifle really a hunting & sporting gun? Was there even a single 0.22 cal bolt action rifle displayed by any of the participants (to the best of my knowledge, there was none, as I spend 2 hours finding one). They should have been clear in the first place about what will be allowed to be displayed & what not.\r\n\r\nWhat our local industry needs to do is to focus on small/big caliber hunting / target shooting bolt action rifles alongwith improving quality of the 12Gague shotguns, and this is the prime weakness in our local arms industry. \r\n\r\nI was surprised to find some 12guage SxS Sidelock shotgun, being displayed by the most reputable armory in Pakistan, with price tag of 400k+ (export only model), and when I asked the reason for such a nice price tag, I was given the example of "Holland & Holland" that see how expensive they are....Well, this cannot justify this price tag. The only thing that can justify such prices is the quality and the art of workmanship put in by the gunsmith, and to my disappointment, when I asked the exhibitor to disassemble the shotgun, so that I could examine the barrel independently,  after struggling with it for around 5 minutes, he excused that the gun is brand new and seems like it needs some oiling... this was the mechanical quality which I saw, and about the quality of the bore, better not discuss it at all. I wonder if there is a proof house in our country?\r\n\r\nI have been using shotguns since last 15 years, and I have never put any oil in my shotgun except for the kerosene oil which I use for cleaning purposes. Yet the assembling & dissembling is as smooth as anything... And here, I am referring to a 50 years old, cheapest gun of its time "by Gecado, Germany" which I inherited from my grand father... This doesn''t even have any engraving in it....\r\n\r\nBy this post, I do not intend to finger point at any company in Pakistan, but want to give some serious points to ponder for PHSADC. We want to buy Pakistani hunting guns, we want to rely on their brand names for quality and performance, but how can we? Any new gun enthusiast hunter today will go out, get a license (its another story how to get it...), and >80% of the time will opt for an imported gun...\r\n\r\nThis is the age of global competition.

One of of the main reasons I wanted to get this Pump action shotgun is the fact its made in Turkey by the Akkar Company so the quality is kinda reliable second reason is it has a folding buttstock which helps in terms of "concealed carry" issue and also could be easily carried in the car even though the barrel size is same as the fixed butt (18.5 Inches I think). I''m not sure of its exact price but goodthing about Akkar pumps is they are not too expensive comparing to other foreign made shotguns I.e US and European ones.

Expansion to an extent will be impacted by the distance range between the shooter and the target. For example a JHP is fired to hit a target at 25m will not be as deadly as to when a taget is shot at 10m.\n\nThe weight of the bullet is of no major significance at shorter distances but at further distances heavier bullets will fall short. It is a battle between velocity vs. penetration. The flesh expansion between a 124gr and 115gr bullet is not a major difference as compared to a JHP. YOu''re being attacked by a pack of dogs then here velocity is the key.\n\n147 gr bullets and P and +P ammo is a sensitive topic as there are limited guns which are capable of firing these.

The judge was hearing different petitions filed by arms license holders who challenged the Ministry of Interior directions ordering the license holders to surrender their licences to Nadra by Dec 31st. \n\nThe court on the previous hearing had barred the ministry from implementing the deadline. On behalf of the petitioners, Barrister Syed Ali Zafar submitted that the process for issuance of arms licences, ownership of firearms, their sale, purchase and exchange as well as the issuance of ammunition was regulated and prescribed by Pakistan Arms Ordinance, 1965 and Arms Rule 1924. He said the only method of amending these rules was through a gazette notification. \n\nHe argued that, instead of amending the rules after due consultation with all stakeholders, the government had instantly issued the impugned directions. Although the government had issued a notification delegating powers to make rules to Nadra, he said, adding that it was not a notification of the rules, terming it illegal because there was no power to sub-delegate. He said there was no harm in computerisation of the licences, and the entire process should be contained in duly notified rules which provided for all aspects, relating to possession, transport, sale and transfer of firearms.

The goal was for citizens to obtain computerized arm licences in August this year.\nThus far NADRA has received around 1,586 applications from 16 districts of Balochistan, Interior Minister Rehman Malik said in his written reply to the National Assembly.\nMaximum applications for revalidation process came from Punjab and Sindh.  Malik had assigned the task of revalidating all the licences by Dec 31. This is also a deadline for citizens to register their licences.\n“According to rough estimates around 3 million Pakistanis have arm licences.” said a retired Secretary of the Interior Ministry, who asked not to be named.  But officials dealing with arms licences claim that they don’t know the total number issued since Pakistan’s inception.\nThe government informed the Supreme Court that the Sindh government from 2001 to 2011 has handed out around 0.5 million arms licences to citizens.\nPakistan Muslim League-Nawaz  MNA Malik Shakeel Awan sought details of arm licences which are being verified by NADRA.\nThe government has spent Rs53 million on renovations of NADRA’s headquarters during the last five years, Rehman Malik told the National Assembly.\nAround Rs2 million were spent on renovation of the NADRA  chairman’s office in Islamabad, while an amount of Rs1.62 million was spent in 2011, he added.\nExpenditures of some Rs51 million were for repair and maintenance of NADRA headquarters from 2006 to 2011, while Rs14.2 million was spent during the current fiscal year.\nIn reply to a lawmaker’s question, Malik said NADRA issued 89.145 million Computerised National Identity Cards till December 14, 2011.\n“Around 94.89 per cent registration has been completed in the country.

You never know if your firearm is going to last 50 years or have it explode in your hand on the first day. \n\nI completely agree with Skeeter60 assessment that we need a proof house but the problem is that in Pakistan that is just another stamp for cottage gun makers to add to the firearm to make it look genuine. \n\n@Marker It is one of my dreams to have Pakistani manufacturer developing quality weapons here in Pakistan. Unfortunately the red tape, government interference and corruption is not worth it. Everyone can be making guns left right and center and no one will be asked a question, only the largest and properly setup, tax paying factory will get frequent visits from all kinds of ground level bureaucrats/officials like law enforcement, taxation, health and safety etc etc whose sole concern in life is just to make life miserable for the person doing business in a legal way.\n\nOn the same topic, I was seriously considering setting up a large, mechanized ammunition factory in Pakistan targeting the domestic market solving our problems of quality decently priced ammunition in all commercial calibers. But as I started to work on my project I found out that I had to go through about 20 + Government bodies and the ''costs'' for making them all work were just not economically viable.

I also saw an original Chinese Baretta at a gunshop in Peshawar the asking price 27K just over a year ago. Again a Chinese Import. So In my opinion despite it''s high and reliable quality, the price should still be alot lower as its a home production. Lower prices will also result in higher sales which means they will break even alot sooner than they will at the current price. The profit margin may be low but POF or "WIL" will make their money in terms of selling in a higher quantity, public demand may increase, as it''ll become affordable for average working class Pakistani citizens so for once they will get value for money, relaibaility and will no longer have to be restricted to buying the poor quality un-relaible Desi weapons from Darra or other private factories due to the limited budget.

It seems like the toolings were obtained under license of some sort by POF.\nAs for the barrel. This is not a Darra made weapon. The barrel would meet and exceed army and international standards. We must remember that the same factory produces barrels for our machine guns, assault rifles and even for heavy weapons.  A very welcome addition to POF inventory and a great step forward towards complete self-reliance.

It seems like the toolings were obtained under license of some sort by POF.\r\nAs for the barrel. This is not a Darra made weapon. The barrel would meet and exceed army and international standards.

I shoot some Lambro brenneke rifled slugs yesterday from a distance of 40 meters to a big metal plate. The problem is that I aimed at the center of the plate and shoot 5 slugs. The 3/5 went above the plate about 60 cm and the other hit the target but not the center, and the last that I aimed very low at the target the slug was accurate. I shoot 00 buckshot the same day at the target with succes with 32/36 inside the big plate but not center. And also I shoot birdshots number 5 at the same distance with great accuracy at the target and little wooden targets and birds with no problems. The slugs were shoot through a full choke and the weapon is 12/89 with 76 mm smothboar barrel.please help[/QUOTE]\r\n\r\nThe problems I see in your approach:\r\n\r\n1. do not shoot slugs out of a full choke: only use Cylinder choke or Improved Cylinder choke. some slugs can be fired through full choke but after firing they are so deformed that they do not offer any reasonable accuracy. therefore it is always recommended to use either Cylinder or Improved Cylinder choke.\r\n\r\n2. reduce the distance: the distance of 40 meters is very difficult for a "front bead only" shotgun. if you want to increase the distance, you must install slug sights. you need front sight along with rear sights for proper aiming at any distance larger than 25 meters with a shotgun.\r\n\r\n3. change the brand of slugs: different brand of slugs give different level of accuracy out of each shotgun.\r\n\r\nHope it helps.\r\n\r\nRegards.', 1, 1, '182.177.125.238', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

Unfortunately I am not impressed by Taurus Pt-92 even though I had usually found very good reviews regarding this handgun and thus purchased it as my first handgun.

I don''t find it smooth as it should be. (I have fired around 350 rounds from my handgun yet).\n\n2) Poor grip. The beaver tail pinches the back of my hand after few rounds, and because my hand gets sweaty after a while, the grip becomes difficult to hold.\n\n3) I am not impressed by the poor finish quality of Taurus Pt-92.\n\nAfter handling and finring a few other guns at the range, I have selected two options for my next handgun purchase (in replacement of my Taurus Pt-92).

I reside in Peshawar though got a Urdu speak background. \n\n So far no luck regarding the Stoeger 3500, I was told that it is available with Punjab Arms in Lahore for 72k though they had very limited stock so they soon ran out of it, later was told by two Peshawar arms dealers that they can arrange it for me though after 10 days of wait both said that it isnt available and initially both gave the price of 55k (not a bad price).\n\n I will never ever say that Benelli, Browning etc. are the best guns, for me every gun is the best companion when it functions smoothly at the required time and situation. Yeh the Benelli`s inertia operated system is tempting option though I also know that recoil reducer is useless since I (most of us) would be using the standard Shaheen`s cartridges.Also I really dont want to go for the usual choices like Baikal, Hatsan etc. Also I got Stoeger Cougar 9mm pistol that I am happy with, so its also one of the reasons for going for the same brand. \n\n To be honest with you I am more a Double Barrel and Over n Under guy when it comes on shotguns, semi auto seems more like an excuse for not coming back empty handed from the hunt, have seen guys firing NON STOP to kill one bird, I avoided such guns for years though just want to get one for the heck of it and see such type is for me or not.

Mods can shift to proper thread if needed.\r\n\r\n"ISLAMABAD: The interior ministry has endorsed a proposal seeking issuance of licences for prohibited and non prohibited bore arms on the recommendations of the members of parliament and provincial assemblies.\r\n\r\n[B]Under the proposal, 10 licences for prohibited bore arms and 20 for non-prohibited bore arms could be issued every month on the recommendations of each member of the Senate and National Assembly.\r\n\r\nSimilarly, five prohibited and 10 non-prohibited bore arms licences could be issued on the recommendations of each member of provincial assemblies.[/B]\r\n\r\n[I][B]This was said by Interior Minister Senator Rehman Malik at a briefing given to the National Assembly`s Standing Committee on Interior here on Monday. It means over 7,700 new licences could be issued for prohibited bore arms and over 15,800 for nonprohibited bore arms on the recommendations of around 1,100 lawmakers.[/B][/I]\r\n\r\nThe decision elicited a strong reaction from the committee members with Bushra Gohar of the Awami National Party saying that powerful arms mafia was using lawmakers to promote its interests and another member warning against issuing licences to the people with criminal record.\r\n\r\nMr Malik, however, downplayed the fear licensed weapons would be used in criminal activities, saying only un-licensed weapons were used in crimes. He said a number of lawmakers `genuinely` needed security.\r\n\r\n`Whether weapons are used as a status symbol or to feel protected, the fact is that they are in demand,` he said, adding that under the Constitution it was the responsibility of the state to provide security to citizens but it was not possible to make each area, street and house secure.\r\n\r\nThe minister said that after the 18th amendment work relating to issuance of arms licences had been devolved to provinces. The interior ministry has not issued any arms licence after June 30, 2011.\r\n\r\nHe said a revised arms licence policy hadbeen formulated which would be soon submitted to the prime minister for approval.\r\n\r\n[B]Mr Malik said Nadra had been assigned the task for revalidation and issuance of computerised arms licences, adding that by Jan 4, 2012 it had received 109,800 licences for revalidation. Another 2,400 cases for revalidation were pending owing to deficiency of required documents, he said.[/B]\r\n\r\nHe directed Nadra to introduce measures aimed at facilitating people.\r\n\r\nBanned groups` leaders \r\n\r\nOn the issue of unchecked movement of leaders of proscribed outfits raised by Minister of State for Human ResourceDevelopment Sheikh Waqas Akram, the interior minister said provincial governments would be asked to keep a check on activities of such elements.\r\n\r\nSheikh Waqas said the leader of a banned outfit came from Karachi to Punjab and hurled threats on him.\r\n\r\nHe said the leader of another proscribed organisation was seen freely moving in Islamabad`s red zone with masked armed men in two double-cabin vehicles escorting him.\r\n\r\nMr Malik said a scam of transferring illicit weapons to Karachi through oil tankers had been unearthed, adding that a large cache of arms had been seized and some arrests made."', 1, 0, '182.185.144.11', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

I reside in Peshawar though got a Urdu speak background. \n\n So far no luck regarding the Stoeger 3500, I was told that it is available with Punjab Arms in Lahore for 72k though they had very limited stock so they soon ran out of it, later was told by two Peshawar arms dealers that they can arrange it for me though after 10 days of wait both said that it isnt available and initially both gave the price of 55k (not a bad price).\n\n I will never ever say that Benelli, Browning etc. are the best guns, for me every gun is the best companion when it functions smoothly at the required time and situation. Yeh the Benelli`s inertia operated system is tempting option though I also know that recoil reducer is useless since I (most of us) would be using the standard Shaheen`s cartridges.Also I really dont want to go for the usual choices like Baikal, Hatsan etc. Also I got Stoeger Cougar 9mm pistol that I am happy with, so its also one of the reasons for going for the same brand. \n\n To be honest with you I am more a Double Barrel and Over n Under guy when it comes on shotguns, semi auto seems more like an excuse for not coming back empty handed from the hunt, have seen guys firing NON STOP to kill one bird, I avoided such guns for years though just want to get one for the heck of it and see such type is for me or not. (one bird - one cartridge) \n\nToday once again I will check few guys before giving up the search, wish me good luck :)\n\nSMSabir[/QUOTE]\nWA ALLAIKUM ASSALAM SABIR BR!\n\n72k is too much for it and 55k is best price i must say as it is currently unavailable!\nand i totally  agree with your view regarding benelli,brownings etc and recoil reducer!\n[B]congrats for your handgun and best of luck for the upcoming purchase![/B]\nthese days i m also looking for an autoloader for my younger son,his preference is stoeger or baikal in camo or synthetic stock. \n\ni myself use semi auto for only ducks,geese shooting,for every thing else i prefer my dbbl o/u.', 1, 0, '182.177.180.66', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

After firing the two shells and opening the barrel for reload, the ejectors didn''t throw the spent shells from the barrel. \n\nI believe I have the set screws positioned to enable the ejectors.   That is, the slots in the screws are turned vertical (running parallel with the barrels).  I''m following the graphic in the photos.  Note that I have tried the other setting just to see if that worked.   They appear to work about the same, regardless of the setting.\n\nThe manual is a little confusing about this because it is contradictory regarding the setting of the screws for the ejectors.   It says to turn the screw slot vertical but running perpendicular to the barrels! :dizzy:  However, the photos show the screw slot running parallel to the barrel and is more consistent with the vertical explanation.\n\n So, finally onto my question, are the ejectors something that improves over time with more break-in, or is there something I can fix to get better performance from the shell ejectors?\n\nThanks for the help.

Skeeter Sahib''s state of mind is fully identical to my own, since respected Skeeter Sahib was visiting me here in Wah and the drawing-room in question was mine, none else''s!\n\nI had [I]un-chambered[/I] all my guns prior to Skeeter Sahib''s visit, since that is and used to be [B]my[/B] perception of [I]a loaded handgun[/I].

What so ever the glove should be according to bird :) LOL, like if luckily you got Goldie you can’t handle it on motor cycle gloves you should need triple layer leather glove which also covers your elbow.\n\nBelow you can read type of gloves and their usage:\n\nSingle layer glove: Shikra (male& female), Sparrow hawk (male& female), Red-headed Merlin (male& female), Shaheen & Peregrine males only.\nDouble layer glove:  Shaheen (female), Peregrine (female), Saker (male& female), Goshawk (male& female).   \nTriple layer glove:  Any kind of eagles.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n2) You don’t need a verity of hoods but you can purchase 2-3 hoods in different styles but same size for your bird for the best fit, because sometimes we have to alter the openings for its beak and cere. (You can also ask SUFI for a falconer in KHI, he can guide you).\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n3) It also depends on bird: there are only 3 sizes available in market.\n\nSmall size: Shikra (male& female), Sparrow hawk (male& female) & Red-headed Merlin (male& female).\nMedium size:  Shaheen (male& female), Peregrine (male& female), Saker (male& female) & Goshawk (male& female).   \nLarge size:  Any kind of eagles.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n4) Traditional leather jesses are best if made properly and works well in emergency cases when you don’t have nylon one’s because you can’t get all sizes. And you can get Arab jesses and leash set with swivel from the same manufacturer. But sizes are available for only Shaheen (male& female), Peregrine (male& female), Saker (male& female) & Goshawk (male& female).\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n5) As I have told you earlier you can get an Arab nylon leash with jesses and swivel but no doubt you can also choose or make of your choice (light in weight and strong) depending on bird’s strength. :)\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n6, 7) Perches are very important for the prevention of their talons and you can’t keep a raptor in a cage :shocked:. Yes you can keep them in bedroom hooded or unhooded if they are properly manned but they need sunlight on daily basis in winter especially, so you should also give them a weathering area (lawn). But in summer birds shed their feathers and grow new ones (Moult) and during moulting season you can’t keep them in bedroom & you need a good aviary or a separate room which has good ventilation and sunlight.  For 1 bird like Saker, Shaheen or Goshawk, Size of mew should be 10’ Length X 8’ Depth X 8’ Height is best. \n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nIt’s your choice if you like falcons than go for a male lugger and if hawk than you should start from a shikra. And rite time to practice is September or October because in these months the weather is good.\n\nI tried my best but still your questions are welcome.\n\nRegards,', 1, 0, '175.110.53.77', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

The leather must be kept properly maintained for optimum performance of the holster. Neat foot oils or mink oils should be avoided as these products can make the leather holster too supple. The soft leather may have a difficult time holding onto the pistol. \n\n\n[B]Leather Break In[/B]\n\nRemove all ammunition from the firearm before fitting the pistol into the holster for the first time. Breaking in the holster may be necessary if the pistol fits too tight within the leather. While holding the holster in your left hand, insert two fingers of the right hand into the opening. Beginning two inches down from the top rim, push outward with the right-hand fingers to stretch out the leather. Continue this process until you have worked all around the perimeter of the leather holster and as far down into the holster as possible. Insert the unloaded pistol into the holster and check the fit. Repeat the process as many times as necessary for a correct fit of the pistol to the leather. \n\n\n[B]Cleaning[/B]\n\nOccasionally the leather holster will need cleaning. In times where the holster is in contact with body perspiration, cleaning may have to occur on a monthly basis. Remove the firearm from the holster and any straps or belts attached to the holster. Use a hard bar glycerin soap and a soft cloth. Work the soap into a soft lather onto the cloth with warm water. Rub the soapy cloth against the leather. Work the lather into any deep crevices and stitching. Perspiration can over time affect and weaken the stitching. There are special leather soap lotions available that can be worked directly into the leather. Allow the leather to air dry. Do not apply any type of artificial heat to the leather. Replace the firearm as soon as the holster is fully dry. \n\n[B]Things Not to Do[/B]\n\nKeep the holster out of any submerged liquids. When this condition occurs remove the firearm immediately and dry the leather with a clean cloth. Allow the holster to dry naturally.

What so ever the glove should be according to bird :) LOL, like if luckily you got Goldie you can&#8217;t handle it on motor cycle gloves you should need triple layer leather glove which also covers your elbow.\n\nBelow you can read type of gloves and their usage:\n\nSingle layer glove: Shikra (male& female), Sparrow hawk (male& female), Red-headed Merlin (male& female), Shaheen & Peregrine males only.\nDouble layer glove:  Shaheen (female), Peregrine (female), Saker (male& female), Goshawk (male& female).   \nTriple layer glove:  Any kind of eagles.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n2) You don&#8217;t need a verity of hoods but you can purchase 2-3 hoods in different styles but same size for your bird for the best fit, because sometimes we have to alter the openings for its beak and cere. (You can also ask SUFI for a falconer in KHI, he can guide you).\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n3) It also depends on bird: there are only 3 sizes available in market.\n\nSmall size: Shikra (male& female), Sparrow hawk (male& female) & Red-headed Merlin (male& female).\nMedium size:  Shaheen (male& female), Peregrine (male& female), Saker (male& female) & Goshawk (male& female).   \nLarge size:  Any kind of eagles.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n4) Traditional leather jesses are best if made properly and works well in emergency cases when you don&#8217;t have nylon one&#8217;s because you can&#8217;t get all sizes. And you can get Arab jesses and leash set with swivel from the same manufacturer. But sizes are available for only Shaheen (male& female), Peregrine (male& female), Saker (male& female) & Goshawk (male& female).\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n5) As I have told you earlier you can get an Arab nylon leash with jesses and swivel but no doubt you can also choose or make of your choice (light in weight and strong) depending on bird&#8217;s strength. :)\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n6, 7) Perches are very important for the prevention of their talons and you can&#8217;t keep a raptor in a cage :shocked:. Yes you can keep them in bedroom hooded or unhooded if they are properly manned but they need sunlight on daily basis in winter especially, so you should also give them a weathering area (lawn). But in summer birds shed their feathers and grow new ones (Moult) and during moulting season you can&#8217;t keep them in bedroom & you need a good aviary or a separate room which has good ventilation and sunlight.  For 1 bird like Saker, Shaheen or Goshawk, Size of mew should be 10&#8217; Length X 8&#8217; Depth X 8&#8217; Height is best. \n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nIt&#8217;s your choice if you like falcons than go for a male lugger and if hawk than you should start from a shikra.

When I had to buy my first gun, I also did a lot of research here on PG and on google as well. I am a research freak :-) I chose Taurus Pt-92 as my first handgun based on reviews, will full confidence that it will be my life time partner, but unfornately the reality was a bit different. \n\nI have mentioned the points which I don''t like about Taurus Pt-92 another thread, which mainly are poor grip, hard and unsmooth trigger in single action (compared to many other guns), and lower finish quality which I guess is a personal preference only. (by the way, I have had 3 FTE with my Taurus Pt-92 yet. I have fired around 350 + rounds till now).\n\nNow in my view, the best way to choose your first handgun is to physically hold and possibly fire a few rounds with them, and see with whom you are most comfortable with. Comfort lies in grip, acquision of point of aim, recoil management, etc. This is best way to choose your first handgun. (You can rule out those guns which have got a bad repute e.g. Taurus 809, but it is very important to physically hold and possibly fire the models you like and are generally considered reliable).\n\nIn range, I shot with CZ Sp-01 TS, CZ Sp-01 Shadow, Glock 19, Zigana T (Law Enforcement), Sig P 226 Tactical Ops. I have liked CZ Sp-01 Shadow and Zigana T the most probably and I will choose CZ Sp-01 Shadow as my next handgun. It will suit my needs ofcourse. \n\nI therefore suggest you to atleast hold the guns which you plan to buy and check how much you are comfortable with them. I have not fired CZ Duty, but I have held it and it feels very good in hands. In my opinion it will be much better option than Taurus Pt-92.', 1, 0, '182.178.169.197', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

Since I moved to Kuwait the Shooting itch was there but I was in the process of settling in. After the initial settling in I went to Kuwait Shooting Range for couple of times for the fun shoot. Couple of weeks ago I was at the shooting range and a Range Officer was observing my shots, when I finished my round he approached me and told me that could be a potential member of their Practical Shooting Team.\r\n\r\nThe guy approached me was the President of FAST (Filipino Action Shooting Team) Mr. Manny Cornelio and he introduced the FAST to me and I gladly accepted the offer to joined the team. I became the member next day and started my First Practical Shooting on 20th December 2011. FAST organizes the Practical Shooting Event every Tuesday, this provides a great opportunity to the members to have hands on practical shooting by creating different scenarios.\r\n\r\nDue to the busy schedule I went there the 2nd time on last Tuesday 10th January 2012 and had great fun in the practical shooting. As this was my 2nd time to compete in the Practical shooting, my main aim was to focus on the precision rather than to be quick in finishing the round. In the draws for the line up this Tuesday my name came the first to start the event. I will leave rest of the details of the event to the article of the Arab Times online edition, the link is attached below. The Arab Times covers the event and publish the details every Thursday. Check out the link and you can find out how I performed in the event (my performance mentioned in the last paragraph of the first column). Remember this was my second time in practical shooting). :)\r\n\r\n[url]http://www.arabtimesonline.com/Portals/0/PDF_Files/pdf12/jan/12/50.pdf[/url]\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\n\r\nGlockcohlic (Malik Javed)', 1, 1, '178.61.29.128', 6, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

I am still very much inclined towards 3500model though it isnt available and I am really hoping that I will getsome good reliable lead about this. 2000 model considered to be agood product and 3500 came with all the modifications while removing(as much as possible) the flaws that they were discovered in 2000.Thats why I am so keen about getting that baby. \n\n\nBy the way I will like to add my ownpersonal quote here in reply of your quote of “Huntingis a Royal Sport” - for me “Hunting is the passionate way ofexpression for those who believes on fighting back with honor andintegrity” (I know it sounds too dramatic hahahahaha)\n\n\nYes its true thatnow the prices of weapons and ammo are shooting up and up, a littlewhile back I tried working on an idea of starting my own smallmanufacturing unit for 12 bore cartridges (only and only 12 bore)though the government people were too kind to scare me off  big timeabout the legalities and big bribes required for all the paper workso never bothered again though I do believe that we can easily cutdown the cost of cartridges into half (at least) if we are having agood market competition that we dont. Shaheen is more a mediocrebrand, Ely is with a SLIGHT touch of class and after that its all themoney game.\n\n\nYou know what Ithink I will try one more time to find the 3500, if I got lucky thenawesome and if not then I will wait, I am not settling down forBaikal or 2000.

However, the notification for computerization of these licences had been challenged on the ground that the federal government must consult the stakeholders and then make rules providing for all the aspects, which should thereafter be notified in the Official Gazette. He said the petitioners were not against the computerization but the process of computerization should be clearly prescribed.\n\nThe counsel further argued the rules had to be made by the federation but they illegally authorized Nadra to formulate the rules, which was not an entity envisaged under the Arms Rule 1924.\n\nArms licences holders filed these petitions challenging the advertisement and notification issued by the federal government in which all arms and ammunition licences were to be cancelled and new computerized licences issued by Nadra.', 1, 0, '182.178.146.122', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

The CZ 75 is a wondernine and one of the best handguns ever made. The problem that needs to be understood is that instead other quality items bringing down the prices of Glocks or Berettas, the prices of these items are taking the prices of other items higher. An example is that the CZ Rami was originally 85 k but they are priced around 110 k now. This is only because of the positive reviews that CZ got when they reached here.\r\n\r\nThis is a dilemma. And i do hope and pray that what you are saying does really happen, so that you, I and all gun lovers get their fair share of the action. :)\r\n\r\nRegards.', 1, 1, '182.180.67.3', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

Generally, the width of Taurus 1911 is mentioned as being 1.5 inches, now don''t know from where this measured, from the grip width or the slide. The slide itself however appears slimmer. I''ll check it out in comparison with some other handgun, probably the Mil Pro .45.ACP.\n\n\nAs for the grips, well, since it''s single stacked magazines, I trust it''s the slimmest you can encounter with, suits all hand sizes with a very comfortable hold. I usually measure grips from how far my thumb can overlap my index finger, when hand wrapped around the grip. With this one I feel my thumb is reaching well onto the first knuckle of the index finger and that secures a very firm hold.\n\n\nHope you got an idea,\n\n\nRegards.[/QUOTE][/SIZE]\n\n[SIZE=4]Thanks Sir.

(239421, 8011, 239287, 'Slayerjatt', 203, '', 1326623525, '@ american lockpicker\n\nfollowing is the english version i found:\n\nIn 1973 the war between Arabs and Israel was about to start. Meanwhile an American Senator visited Israel on a special mission. He was chief of the Senate Arms Committee. A meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Golda Meir was arranged immediately. \n\nGolda Meir welcomed him into her home, like any common housewife welcoming a family guest. She took him to the kitchen. While seating him at the kitchen dining table, she went over to prepare tea for the guest. \n\nAs the water was kept for boiling, she came over and sat on a chair near the dining table. She opened the discussion regarding planes, missiles, and guns. In the course of negotiations, she got the aroma of the brew. \n\nShe prepared two cups of tea, and offered one cup to the Senator, and another to an American guard who was standing at the gate. On returning, she came back, continued talking with the Senator. After a discussion they settled the arms deal. In the meantime, she stood up, collected all the cups, and turned to senator and said "I agree to this deal. You can send your secretary to my secretary for written deal". \n\nIt may be remembered that Israel at that time was facing a serious economic crisis, but the huge arms deal was settled by Meir with the greatest of ease in the history of Israel. It was quite astonishing that earlier, the Israeli cabinet had rejected the same deal, because they thought it would be so costly, that the whole nation would have to make do with a single meal a day, for years to come. \n\nMeir knew about their stand, and said, "Your doubt are well founded, but if we win this war, and defeat the Arabs, history will remember us as the victors, and in history, once a community is know as the victor, it forgets how many eggs they ate and how many times they had food. Whether there was jam, honey, butter on the table, and how many holes they had in their shoes. Or whether the sheaths of their swords were new or old! A conqueror is a conqueror." \n\nBased on Meir''s solid logic, the Israeli cabinet approved the deal. Later it was proved that the decision taken by Meir was right, and the whole world witnessed the Jews knocking on the doors of the Arabs with this artillery. A war took place, and the Arabs faced a shameful defeat at the hands of an old lady. \n\nAfter a gap of one decade after the war, a reporter of the Washington Post interviewed Meir, asking "Was the logic you had in your mind for the arms was spur of the moment decision or you had had an advance strategy?" \n\nMeir''s reply was very surprising. \n\nShe answered, "I got this logic from the prophet (of the Muslims) Mohammed (peace be upon him). When I was a student, my favorite topic was comparative study of religions. Those days I studied the life of Mohammed (PBUH). One author stated that when Prophet Mohammed (PBUH) died, there was not enough money to buy oil for a lamp, his wife (Ayesha Siddiqua[Raziallah-u-ta''ala unha]) mortgaged his battle shield to buy oil, yet there were nine swords hung on the wall of his house. \n\nWhen I read this account, it occurred to me- how many people in the world would have known about the worst economic condition of Islamic state? But everyone recognizes them as conquerors of half the world. So I decided that I would buy arms at any cost; even if we would have to starve or to live in camps instead of buildings, but we would prove ourselves as the victor". \n\nMeir revealed this secret, but requested the interviewer to keep it "off the record", and refrain from publishing it, because if she referred to Prophet Mohammed(P.B.U.H), the Jews would have revolted against her and the Muslim position would have strengthened. \n\nOver the time, world situation changed. Golda Meir died. By this time the interviewer had given up the profession of journalism. Meanwhile another correspondent was busy interviewing 20 famous American journalists. In connection with this, he met the journalist who had interviewed Meir as a representative of the Washington Post. \n\nIn this interview, he recounted the story of Meir that drew on the life of Prophet Mohammed (PBUH). \n\nHe said he was not ashamed to tell the story. Further, he said, "After this incident I studied the history of Islam, and was astonished to know about the savoir-faire of Arabs. Because I learnt that Tariq bin Ziyad conquered Spain through Gibraltar, while more than half his army did not have complete suit of clothes. They subsisted for 72 hours at time on water and dried bread. \n\nIt was then that the interviewer agreed with Meir''s view that history counts victory; it does not count the eggs, jams and butter on the table."', 1, 1, '116.71.168.101', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

Generally, the width of Taurus 1911 is mentioned as being 1.5 inches, now don''t know from where this measured, from the grip width or the slide. The slide itself however appears slimmer. I''ll check it out in comparison with some other handgun, probably the Mil Pro .45.ACP.\n\n\nAs for the grips, well, since it''s single stacked magazines, I trust it''s the slimmest you can encounter with, suits all hand sizes with a very comfortable hold. I usually measure grips from how far my thumb can overlap my index finger, when hand wrapped around the grip. With this one I feel my thumb is reaching well onto the first knuckle of the index finger and that secures a very firm hold.\n\n\nHope you got an idea,\n\n\nRegards.', 1, 1, '119.154.151.129', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

I showed it to my wife, we discussed and decided to visit this beautiful phenomena of Mother Nature, ice covering everything like a blanket, moreover I wished that I would meet Mehdi and for that very reason I haven’t yet replied to his thread (Pics of Muree) I was drafting a detail talk with him so that I could meet him upon my trip to Muree some time soon.  Denovo bro  as you said your as well as mine wish will remain un-granted and I pray that  “He certainly found  better friend than you,  better company than ours and more beautiful ambiance than any where found in this world” (Ameen).  \r\n@ Asad Raja I would only say that you are lucky man that you have had a wonderful father and had a chance to spend time with him. In my case I hadn’t granted enough time. I only have flashing memories of him, being posted out station he had a chance to meet us only on weekends and he passed away when I was in Grade 5. One more thing I would like to share with you is : when my mother got severe CVA attack and she was in comma (later she survived), I thought what possible in this very world could take away that great sense of sorrow, sense of losing some one near and dear to you and the sense of being left alone. Believe you me that I found it for the time being whenever I offered Prayer, since then never feel left alone.  All the best wishes for you and sincere prayers for the dear departed.

Meanwhile an American Senator visited Israel on a special mission. He was chief of the Senate Arms Committee. A meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Golda Meir was arranged immediately. \n\nGolda Meir welcomed him into her home, like any common housewife welcoming a family guest. She took him to the kitchen. While seating him at the kitchen dining table, she went over to prepare tea for the guest. \n\nAs the water was kept for boiling, she came over and sat on a chair near the dining table. She opened the discussion regarding planes, missiles, and guns. In the course of negotiations, she got the aroma of the brew. \n\nShe prepared two cups of tea, and offered one cup to the Senator, and another to an American guard who was standing at the gate. On returning, she came back, continued talking with the Senator. After a discussion they settled the arms deal. In the meantime, she stood up, collected all the cups, and turned to senator and said "I agree to this deal. You can send your secretary to my secretary for written deal". \n\nIt may be remembered that Israel at that time was facing a serious economic crisis, but the huge arms deal was settled by Meir with the greatest of ease in the history of Israel. It was quite astonishing that earlier, the Israeli cabinet had rejected the same deal, because they thought it would be so costly, that the whole nation would have to make do with a single meal a day, for years to come. \n\nMeir knew about their stand, and said, "Your doubt are well founded, but if we win this war, and defeat the Arabs, history will remember us as the victors, and in history, once a community is know as the victor, it forgets how many eggs they ate and how many times they had food. Whether there was jam, honey, butter on the table, and how many holes they had in their shoes. Or whether the sheaths of their swords were new or old! A conqueror is a conqueror." \n\nBased on Meir''s solid logic, the Israeli cabinet approved the deal. Later it was proved that the decision taken by Meir was right, and the whole world witnessed the Jews knocking on the doors of the Arabs with this artillery. A war took place, and the Arabs faced a shameful defeat at the hands of an old lady. \n\nAfter a gap of one decade after the war, a reporter of the Washington Post interviewed Meir, asking "Was the logic you had in your mind for the arms was spur of the moment decision or you had had an advance strategy?" \n\nMeir''s reply was very surprising. \n\nShe answered, "I got this logic from the prophet (of the Muslims) Mohammed (peace be upon him). When I was a student, my favorite topic was comparative study of religions. Those days I studied the life of Mohammed (PBUH). One author stated that when Prophet Mohammed (PBUH) died, there was not enough money to buy oil for a lamp, his wife (Ayesha Siddiqua[Raziallah-u-ta''ala unha]) mortgaged his battle shield to buy oil, yet there were nine swords hung on the wall of his house. \n\nWhen I read this account, it occurred to me- how many people in the world would have known about the worst economic condition of Islamic state? But everyone recognizes them as conquerors of half the world. So I decided that I would buy arms at any cost; even if we would have to starve or to live in camps instead of buildings, but we would prove ourselves as the victor". \n\nMeir revealed this secret, but requested the interviewer to keep it "off the record", and refrain from publishing it, because if she referred to Prophet Mohammed(P.B.U.H), the Jews would have revolted against her and the Muslim position would have strengthened. \n\nOver the time, world situation changed. Golda Meir died. By this time the interviewer had given up the profession of journalism. Meanwhile another correspondent was busy interviewing 20 famous American journalists. In connection with this, he met the journalist who had interviewed Meir as a representative of the Washington Post. \n\nIn this interview, he recounted the story of Meir that drew on the life of Prophet Mohammed (PBUH). \n\nHe said he was not ashamed to tell the story. Further, he said, "After this incident I studied the history of Islam, and was astonished to know about the savoir-faire of Arabs. Because I learnt that Tariq bin Ziyad conquered Spain through Gibraltar, while more than half his army did not have complete suit of clothes. They subsisted for 72 hours at time on water and dried bread. \n\nIt was then that the interviewer agreed with Meir''s view that history counts victory; it does not count the eggs, jams and butter on the table."[/QUOTE]\n\nwow!! and thanks for translating gin English :)', 1, 1, '182.178.108.50', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

I.e, I ain''t got a single No.4 shell in my house of 12G ammo, every pack is some sort of BG medicine buck shots, and was kind of [I]reprimanded[/I] by the better half on this lately, as to what the heck my weapons were good for, if I couldn''t take her out for some fun hunting, lol!\n\nSame goes for the pick of 124 grainers, since I deem 115 grainers are best suited for range/target shooting, the 124''s a bit better for the SD use.\n\nNext pick will be 115.

I think it has been established in some other thread here, that 124 grainers were probably the most balanced Fmj''s for SD carry, etc.. The difference between 115 and 124 is hardly 0.5 gram, one being 7.5, other being 8.o grams.\n\nThe 115 grained gives a higher muzzle velocity than the 124 grained and hence for serious target shooting may be stabilizing it''s cruise comparatively a bit better than the 124 grained, thus comparatively with bit better accuracy also, but not what would be significantly better than the 124 grained with respect to self defense purposes, where a slightly heavier round may be preferred for the better [I]impact poundage[/I].\n\nI am not much into ballistics, else than the general facts above, perhaps an expert here would be better able to conclude.

I showed it to my wife, we discussed and decided to visit this beautiful phenomena of Mother Nature, ice covering everything like a blanket, moreover I wished that I would meet Mehdi and for that very reason I haven’t yet replied to his thread (Pics of Muree) I was drafting a detail talk with him so that I could meet him upon my trip to Muree some time soon.  Denovo bro  as you said your as well as mine wish will remain un-granted and I pray that  “He certainly found  better friend than you,  better company than ours and more beautiful ambiance than any where found in this world” (Ameen).  \n@ Asad Raja I would only say that you are lucky man that you have had a wonderful father and had a chance to spend time with him. In my case I hadn’t granted enough time. I only have flashing memories of him, being posted out station he had a chance to meet us only on weekends and he passed away when I was in Grade 5. One more thing I would like to share with you is : when my mother got severe CVA attack and she was in comma (later she survived), I thought what possible in this very world could take away that great sense of sorrow, sense of losing some one near and dear to you and the sense of being left alone. Believe you me that I found it for the time being whenever I offered Prayer, since then never feel left alone.  All the best wishes for you and sincere prayers for the dear departed.

The handgun was priced above other of it''s type and price was later reduced to be at par level with other of it''s type/class, before the import link went down.

I have found it with two dealers, one has 26" barrel and is offering five chokes (I Don''t know how this is possible because as per all reviews I have seen, Baikal MP153 comes with three chokes), and the second option is 28" barrel with three chokes. Please guide me which one I should choose and with pros and cons.\n\n2) I have read problems in 2011 model here on PG. Should it be safe to buy 2011 year model, or should I stick to 2010 or before models. (Its almost impossible to find models before 2010 in NIB condition).\n\n3) Can anyone guide me of some range or other place where I can practice with my shotgun...I am member of LRC but they don''t allow shotguns.\n\n4) And finally can Baikal MP153 be used as Home Defence weapon?? I know its meant for hunting but what if it is used for HD as well? \n\n5) Please suggest me some other handguns which I should be looking at.

Shot number\r\n2. degree of choke\r\n3. length of the cartridge\r\n4. shot placement\r\n5. number of pellets that hit the target\r\n6. Number of shots fired\r\n\r\ngenerally speaking:\r\n\r\na buckshot cartridge (SG/LG 2.75inch) fired from a cylinder choke (no choke) shotgun will probably and effectively put any BG down at 15 yards or less. assuming that the BG get a full cartridge load at chest.\r\n\r\nif you wish to extend that range any further than that then you will have to the increase the choke constriction or go to 3inch or longer cartridge. but in most cases, the range will not be any more than 25 yards because Primarily, shotguns are short range firearms. their biggest weakness is also their biggest strength. if you switch to a single projectile (slugs) you might be able to extend the effective range to 100 yards but sort of a kills the very purpose of a shotgun. plus it is also very difficult to aim at that distance and you''ll probably be better served with a rifle for that kind of a distance to target.\r\n\r\nshotguns may be short range weapons but within their effective range, their lethality is second to none. any BG shot with a blast of 9 pellets of OO buck will certainly find himself pushing up daisies.\r\n\r\nRegards.', 1, 1, '182.177.19.167', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

Lolz, it wouldn''t even go back to normal when I first took it in my hands, all gummed up from the inside.\n\nI''d say, triggers of all quality handguns in single action mode are smooth enough for the SD concern, as long as you hear a bang with the pull. The Rami''s DA pull is relatively heavy for an accurate 1.st shot in the hands of a less regular shooter, hence I keep it[I] half-cocked[/I] and it''s pretty easy from this stance.\n\nI''ve personally not been very critical of triggers, until the Caracal trigger confirmed it to me, what it actually means to be "crisp".\n\nYet, as regards the Rami, CZ-Sp01 Tactical, etc, triggers are all the same, difference stepping in with Omega system only and the trigger of CZ-SP01 Shadow.\n\nHence, unless you''re sports interested only - [I]and I doubt you''d be so with a CZ Rami [/I]- the trigger is nothing to worry about or make comparisons with the Duty''s.

They are very keen and love to herd animals, sometimes even little kids and their owners. They are dedicated to their work, courageous, fearless and alert. Very protective of their property, owner and sheep. They can be trained easily because they love to learn new things. Pakistani Shepherd Dog are very loyal toward their work and handler, loving their family. They obey their owners every command. The Pakistani Shepherd Dog has a loving nature and is very playful with children, enjoying playing games. This breed is bred to work, and can''t sit idol all the time. Being able to work is their passion. They should be socialized from an early age and training should start as a puppy. Bhayri Kuttas should not be left alone with other small non-canine pets. This is a very obedient and loyal breed whom are not aggressive, but will protect their owners to the death should the need arise. This breed needs owners who are naturally authoritative over the dog in a calm, but firm, confident and consistent way.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHeight, Weight:	\r\n\r\nHeight: Dogs 24-25 inches (61-64 cm.), Bitches 20-24 inches (50-61cm.).\r\nWeight: 77-99 pounds (35-45 kg.)\r\n\r\n\r\nHealth Problems:\r\n\r\nProne to flea allergies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLiving Conditions:\r\n\r\nThis high energy, relentless breed keeps on working in desert temperatures of 104 degrees F (40 degree C.) and sometimes higher.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nExercise:\r\n\r\nThe Pakistani Shepherd Dog love strenuous activity, preferably combined with training of some kind, for these dogs are very intelligent and crave a good challenge. When not being worked they need to be taken on a daily, brisk, long walk, jog or run alongside you when you bicycle. While out on the walk the dog must be made to heel beside or behind the person holding the lead, as in a dog''s mind the leader leads the way, and that leader needs to be the human. Most shepherds love to play ball or Frisbee. This breed does best with a job to do. Without enough exercise, mental and physical they will become bored and destructive and it will effect their good temperament. \r\n\r\n\r\nLife Expectancy:\r\n\r\nAbout 8-10 years.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGrooming:\r\n\r\nThis breed sheds bits of hair constantly and is a seasonally heavy shedder. Bathe only when necessary, over bathing can cause skin irritation from oil depletion. Check ears and trim claws regularly. \r\n\r\n\r\n...................Origin.................\r\n\r\nThe Pakistani Shepherd Dog is a breed from Pakistan, which has been used for herding and protection for centuries. The word Bhagyari comes from the root word of the Punjabi language "Bhagyaar", which means "Wolf" and, "kutta" which means "dog". This breed is mostly found in the province of Punjab and Sindh in Pakistan. There are different theories on the origin of the Bhagayari Kutta. According to the most popular theory, the Pakistani Shepherd Dog originated between a wolf and a domestic dog of some type, hense the name Pakistani Shepherd Dog (meaning Wolf Dog). If you have ever seen an Asian (Pakistani) Wolf, you will see that the Pakistani Shepherd Dog really resembles that type of wolf. \r\n...........................................\r\n\r\nThese dogs are very common in villages in rural areas and suburban Punjab. \r\n\r\nThey make very good guard dogs, are very fierce.\r\n\r\nI''m thinking of getting a Puppy of this breed for HD as it''s feasible. Getting a GSD is not. You cannot find a good one under 40k. And money earned from selling dogs is Haram.\r\nBhagyaris can be acquired without spending any dough.\r\n\r\nSECONDLY THIS BREED IS NOT TO BE CONFUSED WITH THE GSD (German Shepherd Dog). This breed is Pakistani Shepherd dog/Bhagyari. Popular belief in pak is that these are Alsations. That''s wrong. Alsations and GSDs are literally the same thing. \r\nThis breed Bhagyari is a seperate breed just like Beligian and German Shepherds are different. \r\n\r\nOther famous Pakistani Dog Breeds are Bully Kutta (Pakistani Mastiff), Tazi (Pakistani Tazi Hound/Greyhound) and Gul Teria (Pakistani Bull Terrier). Bullys and Tazis are not suitable for HD and not very aggressive towards intruders.\r\nHowever Pakistani Bull Terriers make a great \r\ndog, just like the Bhgyari breed.\r\n\r\nNeed your comments on the Bhagyari breed specially if you own one and are using it for security purposes.\r\n\r\nHere are some Pics of this breed\r\n[IMG]http://i1203.photobucket.com/albums/bb399/B77W/BhagyariKutta.jpg[/IMG]\r\n[IMG]http://i1203.photobucket.com/albums/bb399/B77W/Bhagyari3.jpg[/IMG]\r\n[IMG]http://i1203.photobucket.com/albums/bb399/B77W/Bhagyari7.jpg[/IMG]\r\n[IMG]http://i1203.photobucket.com/albums/bb399/B77W/Bhagyari6.jpg[/IMG]\r\n[IMG]http://i1203.photobucket.com/albums/bb399/B77W/Bhagyari8.jpg[/IMG]\r\n[IMG]http://i1203.photobucket.com/albums/bb399/B77W/Bhagyari2.jpg[/IMG]\r\n[IMG]http://i1203.photobucket.com/albums/bb399/B77W/Bhagyari4.jpg[/IMG]\r\n[IMG]http://i1203.photobucket.com/albums/bb399/B77W/Bhagyari5.jpg[/IMG]', 1, 1, '119.73.7.235', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

Thus was born the .45. During 2nd World War tha american side Arm was Colt 1911 while the Germans carried Luger and mauser Pistols in 9 mm. It was quoted that often during close battles inside trenches the shots by Germans would end up sending the American Soldiers to field Hospitals from where a good number would recover to once again join the battle lines while the shots taken by Americans equipped with Colt 45s would just slump the Germans dead in tracks. The 1911 .45 pistols became so popular with the soldiers that they preffered to use them instead of baynots . 8 rounds of .45 at close ranges with greater maneauverability would add a tremendous punch. However this did not mean that 9 mm lost its credibility, since it is still a very favourite cal and the development of ammo like Hydra Shock and other hollowpoints for Sd purposes may set aside the former reasoning.

Did some research and was even more confused. As it seems almost customary for the Remington to use abbreviations for defining a certain model like.\n1 700 SPS (Special Purpose Synthetic)\n2 700 XHR ( Xtreme Hunter Rifle)\n3 700 VLS  ( Varmint Laminated Stock)\n4 700 SPS DM (Special Purpose Synthetic Detachble Magazine)\n5 700 XCR (Xtreme Corrosion Resistant)\n6 700 VL SS (Varmint Laminated Stainless Steel)\n7 700 VTR (Varmint Tactical Rifle)\n8 700P (Police)\n9 700P TWS (Police Tactical Weapon System)\n\nUnfortunately the only un explainable abbreviations were ADL, BDL, and CDL. But how could it be possible??? I tried to dug further deep and came up with this information. \n\nInitially company introduced two models of 700, ADL and BDL. Remington 700 ADL was a low priced model having average finish and blind magazine. Remington 700 BDL was bit expensive and had better finish, black fore-end cap, hinged magazine floor-plate and pistol grip cap etc. Company was advertising these models in early seventies as "Deluxe" for ADL and "Custom Deluxe" for BDL (Ref "Field and Stream Jul 1974, Popular Science Sep 1971, Popular Mechanics Nov 1972" Basic difference between the two was hinged floor plate other than cosmetics. Here we may safely conclude that DL was for DELUXE and other abbreviations "A,B" were for distinguishing between the models without representing any specific word.\n\nFinally the last CDL. It is defined as in "Hunter''s Guide to Whitetail Rifles Pg 89" Classic Deluxe for more traditional looks, having oil finished walnut stock and satin blued barrel and action.', 1, 1, '139.190.99.103', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

I had been interested in Guns ven I was a child. My father use to have Pak made revolver, Later on my ZID he purchased SPAS 12 shot gun. I used to sleep with that gun whom I still call "My Darling". I purchased it in 25k in 1988. I still have that gun like a zero meter. I shot many rounds off it on Auto as well as Manual. The only problem with it is short barrel. I have also purchased a turkish Volcano Shot gun (PA). But I am looking for a SA. I think Hatsan Escort Combo is the most feasible gun for both the HD and hunting purpose. I have also gone through Mosseberg 930 Combo. Mosseberg also seems to be reliable but is bit weighty than Escort. I would like my seniors and experienced gunners to guide about the selection of gun either I should go for MOSSy or Escort.[/INDENT]\n\n[/COLOR]\n\n[/INDENT]\n\n[RIGHT][URL="http://www.pakguns.com/editpost.php?p=241318&do=editpost"][/URL][/RIGHT][URL="http://www.pakguns.com/editpost.php?p=241318&do=editpost"][/URL]', 1, 0, '42.83.85.65', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

Naveed bhai was kind enough to take time from his busy schedule and we started looking for saiga. There were only two pieces available in the market and the shopkeepers were charging very high prices. So we ended up buying this gun. Because only these two guns are available in Pakistan with removable mags, we have to compare them with each other. Although there is no comparison of Saiga with Akdal :). Saiga 12 is way out of its league. The Akdal Mka1919 comes in a cheap cardboard box and the packing is very un impressive. But that''s what you get with this kind of money. \n\n [IMG]http://i1113.photobucket.com/albums/k512/bilal_qureshi1/IMAG0138-1.jpg[/IMG]\n [IMG]http://i1113.photobucket.com/albums/k512/bilal_qureshi1/IMAG0139-1.jpg[/IMG]\n\nInside the box you get the gun itself, two mags( 2/34 and 3"),although you can use both with our normal 2 3/4 Shaheen shells. One barrel extension/ full choke and a Flash supressor and user manual. \n\n [IMG]http://i1113.photobucket.com/albums/k512/bilal_qureshi1/IMAG0141.jpg[/IMG]\n\n [IMG]http://i1113.photobucket.com/albums/k512/bilal_qureshi1/IMAG0140.jpg[/IMG]\n\nTechnical Specifications:\nModel                              : Mka1919\nCaliber.                            : 12 Guage\nOperation.                      : Gas operated, semi-auto\nWeight( empty)               : 3300 g \nOverall length.                : 40.5 inch \nHeight.                             : 7.5 inch \nBarrel length.                  : 19.7 inch \nSight radius.                    : 23.6 inch \nMagazine weight(empty) : 300 g \nMagazine capacity.         : 5 cartridges\n\nThe Akdal Mka1919 gas operating system is based on Remington 1100 platform, which is not as fast as Saiga 12''s gas system. But it is faster then most of us pulling the trigger. When disassembled, I was not impressed with the machining of the gun. But then again that''s what you expect from budget Turkish weapon. Here see what I mean. \n [IMG]http://i1113.photobucket.com/albums/k512/bilal_qureshi1/IMAG0146.jpg[/IMG]\n [IMG]http://i1113.photobucket.com/albums/k512/bilal_qureshi1/IMAG0145.jpg[/IMG]\n\nDisassembling the Akdal Mka1919 is a pain***. I couldn''t even fully disassemble the gun because I didn''t have the required tools. I mean what''s with that. The handguards were very flimsy and are not very durable. \n\n [IMG]http://i1113.photobucket.com/albums/k512/bilal_qureshi1/IMAG0148.jpg[/IMG]\n [IMG]http://i1113.photobucket.com/albums/k512/bilal_qureshi1/IMAG0151.jpg[/IMG]\n\nThe Akdal Mka1919 gets really really dirty even after firing few rounds. That might be because of the gas operating system or it might be the Shaheen cartridges. I remember my Remington 1100 alway use to jam if not cleaned after each firing session. So I think this gun should be cleaned after each firing sessions if this is your primary HD weapon to avoid jams. See how dirty it gets after firing 50+ rounds. But one thing that I like is the quality of the barrel, its very well made and cromed from inside. \n\n [IMG]http://i1113.photobucket.com/albums/k512/bilal_qureshi1/IMAG0149.jpg[/IMG]\n [IMG]http://i1113.photobucket.com/albums/k512/bilal_qureshi1/IMAG0150.jpg[/IMG]\n\nThe Akdal Mka1919 is a very ergonomic and very well balanced. When held, it doesn''t feel heavy at all and very comfortable to shoot with. The recoil with Shaheen  2 3/4 SG shells is very low. It''s softer to shoot them normal pump shotguns. I''ve heard that it gives problems when firing light loads. It wasn''t the case with this one. We fired all #4,6,8 and SG/LG Shaheen cartridges with no FTFeed or FTEject. The gun comes alive when you fire it. It puts a smile on your face, it did on mine. You guys will see. When firing Mka1919 you forget about how its made or where its made you just want to keep firing and it eats all you through at it. So my conclusion is that if you can afford the insanely high prices of Saiga 12 then that''s the best money can buy period, Sauga''s firing speed is better, trigger is better, magazines are better, how can I forget the mags. The mags of Akdal Mka1919 are not good, they not well made and are very difficult to load. That''s my experience with them. Might be better to look for some aftermarket ones. Or it might get better after a while. You''ll see in the video later. For now here''s some eye candy.\n\n[IMG]http://i1113.photobucket.com/albums/k512/bilal_qureshi1/IMAG0155.jpg[/IMG]\n [IMG]http://i1113.photobucket.com/albums/k512/bilal_qureshi1/IMAG0156.jpg[/IMG]\n [IMG]http://i1113.photobucket.com/albums/k512/bilal_qureshi1/IMAG0157.jpg[/IMG]\n [IMG]http://i1113.photobucket.com/albums/k512/bilal_qureshi1/IMAG0158.jpg[/IMG]\n [IMG]http://i1113.photobucket.com/albums/k512/bilal_qureshi1/IMAG0160.jpg[/IMG]\n [IMG]http://i1113.photobucket.com/albums/k512/bilal_qureshi1/IMAG0161.jpg[/IMG]\n [IMG]http://i1113.photobucket.com/albums/k512/bilal_qureshi1/IMAG0162.jpg[/IMG]\n\n[I][COLOR=#0000cd][B]A few Video''s \n[/B][/COLOR][/I][URL="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2qYPJzkbgI&feature=youtube_gdata_player"]\n[/URL][video=youtube;W2qYPJzkbgI]https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2qYPJzkbgI&amp;feature=youtube_gdata_player[/video]\n[video=youtube;mjNdef0K6Vo]https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mjNdef0K6Vo&amp;feature=youtube_gdata_player[/video]\n[video=youtube;ZyNiE8Q6cSM]https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyNiE8Q6cSM&amp;feature=youtube_gdata_player[/video]\n[video=youtube;gdjuIL7ZBFY]https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdjuIL7ZBFY&amp;feature=youtube_gdata_player[/video]', 1, 0, '202.69.15.156', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

To celebrate their flagship''s Golden Anniversary, Big Green is offering the limited production (2012 only) Model 700 BDL 50th Anniversary Edition, shown at the 2012 SHOT Show in Las Vegas. The single available caliber is 7mm Remington Magnum, the most popular magnum rifle cartridge in the world, which was also introduced in 1962.\n\nHere are the published specifications for Remington''s 50th Anniversary Model 700 BDL:\n\nOrder number: 84063 \nAction: Twin lug, front locking, bolt action \nCaliber: 7mm Rem. Mag. \nMagazine capacity: 3 cartridges \nBarrel length: 24" \nTwist: 1 turn in 9-1/4" \nMetal finish: Satin blue \nSights: Fully adjustable rear, ramp front with hood; receiver drilled and tapped for scope mounting \nTrigger: Remington X-Mark Pro, adjustable for pull weight \nSpecified trigger pull weight: 3.5 pounds from factory \nSafety: Two position \nStock: Reverse checkered black walnut, Monte Carlo comb, ventilated recoil pad \nStock finish: Satin synthetic \nOverall length: 44-1/2" \nLength of pull: 13-3/8" \nDrop at comb: 1" \nDrop at heel: 1-5/8" \nAverage weight (empty): 7-1/2 lbs. \n2012 MSRP: $1399 \nThe Model 700 in 7mm Rem. Mag. was a smash hit when introduced in 1962. It was the right rifle and cartridge at the right time. I remember reading that the popularity of the 7mm Magnum cartridge caught Remington by surprise and Model 700''s in the caliber were back ordered for months. The 7mm Rem. Mag. immediately became a best selling cartridge and remains so today. Among big game hunting calibers, only the .30-06, .270 Winchester, .30-30, .308 Winchester and .243 Winchester exceed Remington''s Big Seven in ammunition sales. It is the best selling magnum rifle cartridge of all time and at one point outsold the .270 Win.\n\nWinchester played into Remington''s hand with the infamous 1964 revision of their famed Model 70 bolt action, which transformed the Model 70 from controlled feeding to push feeding and was poorly received by both the outdoor press and the buying public. Even worse for Winchester, the early Model 700 BDL ("B" grade, meaning a notch above the basic "A" grade M-700 ADL) was one of the best looking bolt action rifles ever produced, while the new Model 70 was clunky looking, a definite aesthetic step backwards from the pre-64 version and miles behind the svelte Model 700.\n\nThe Model 700 action was based on the earlier Model 721 and 722 (long and short) bolt actions, which had been designed for inexpensive manufacture with 1950''s technology. These were strong, functional and accurate rifles, but very plain. The introduction of the Model 700 was, essentially, Remington''s very successful attempt to make a silk purse out of a sow''s ear. Suddenly, Remington''s plain Jane rifle became a deluxe item. (Literally, as the "DL" in BDL represents "deluxe.")\n\nThe 1962 Model 700 BDL featured a nicely shaped, black walnut stock with a functional Monte Carlo comb, smoothly curved pistol grip with black grip cap and a forend with a traditional black tip. There were two small diameter pins in the receiver area to reinforce the stock against recoil. The magazine floorplate was hinged for easy unloading. There were white line spacers, popular at the time, at recoil pad, grip cap and forend tip. The five panel, fleur-de-lis checkering pattern impressed into the pistol grip and forend was generous and very attractive. Detachable sling swivel studs were provided. Model 700''s chambered for magnum cartridges were supplied with black ventilated recoil pads.\n\nThe new 50th Anniversary Model accurately reproduces these features. The stock finish I remember from the 1960''s was a glossy and very durable synthetic, but the Anniversary Model stock wears a satin finish to match its blued bolt and satin blued barreled action.\n\nImpressed checkering was a cost cutting innovation pioneered by Remington. Heat and pressure were used to impress reversed checkering into the wood. By reversed, I mean that the diamonds pointed down into the wood, instead of up. Ultimately, impressed checkering fell out of favor, but it was very popular during the 1960''s. Personally, I liked (and still like) the look. However, impressed checkering did not provide as secure a grip as normal (positive) checkering. For their 50th Anniversary Model 700, Remington has chosen to recreate the look of impressed checkering by laser cutting the original reversed pattern. (Today, neither Remington nor anyone else is equipped to actually impress checkering.)\n\nThe Model 700 receiver was drilled out of bar stock, rather than machined from a steel billet, which is why it is round to this day. The receiver, while an open top design and thus superior to many of the latest actions that merely provide slots for ejection ports, has a more restricted loading/ejection port than Winchester 70, Mauser 98 and pre-war Remington actions. This can slow manually loading a single cartridge in an emergency. Since the round receiver has no integral recoil lug, one was added by the simple expedient of trapping what is essentially a thick washer between the barrel and receiver.\n\nA spring cir-clip extractor and a plunger ejector, both mounted in a recessed bolt face, served to extract and eject fired cases. This extractor takes a much smaller bite on a case rim than a full length Mauser or short Weatherby claw extractor and is more fragile. It is perhaps the most criticized feature of the Model 700 bolt design, yet it generally works. I have never had an extractor fail in over 45 years of using Remington bolt actions. One of the real benefits of the Model 700 action is its very fast lock time, which Remington claims is 2.5-3.0 milliseconds. The 1960''s metal finish was a polished hot blue.\n\nBy recessing the bolt face, Remington--like Weatherby--was able to advertise that the case head was enclosed by "three rings of steel" (the recessed bolt face, barrel chamber and receiver ring). In fact, the Model 700 is a very strong action. The bolt knob is fine-line checkered, which is attractive and adds a deluxe touch.\n\nModel 700 rifle barrels have always been free-floating. This was (and is) advertised as an accuracy feature by virtually every rifle manufacturer who uses it, but it is actually designed to reduce production costs by eliminating the necessity of precisely inletting the barrel into the forend. Sporter weight barrels typically shoot better when bedded full length, although heavy varmint/target weight barrels generally do shoot better when free-floated. Today, all Model 700 barrels are hammer forged, which is cheaper and leaves a smoother finish than broached rifling. Hammer forging is claimed to produce consistently accurate barrels.\n\nThe cost savings engineered into the Model 700 design allowed Remington to become more profitable and other gun manufacturers were quick to notice and adopt similar actions. The push feed Winchester Model 70 of 1964 adopted some of these features and the Savage 110 action, introduced in the mid-1960''s, copied most of the Remington features while adding some of its own. Later rifle designs have gone even farther into the realm of lowering production costs, so that today the Model 700 is considered a relatively expensive action to produce.\n\nThe Model 700 safety is a convenient, two-position lever at the right rear of the receiver. On early model 700''s, the rearward (safe) position also locked the bolt closed to prevent inadvertent opening in the field. However, all modern Model 700''s, including the Anniversary Model, allow the bolt to be opened with the safety on.\n\nPerhaps the best feature of the original Model 700 action was its fully adjustable trigger mechanism. This was one of the best triggers ever supplied in a production rifle. It could be screw adjusted for a perfect, light and clean, trigger pull. Unfortunately, tort lawyers forced Remington to first seal and then redesign the Model 700 trigger. The current version of the X-Mark Pro trigger used in the 50th Anniversary Model 700 is user adjustable for weight of pull only, but cannot be set as light, or quite as clean, as the original trigger. Regardless, the latest X-Mark Pro is a good trigger mechanism. Remington claims that X-Mark Pro triggers are set at 3.5 pounds at the factory, but the ones I have measured were heavier.\n\nThe 50th Anniversary Edition rifle is supplied with a "B" grade walnut stock, better wood than found on most current Model 700''s. The black anodized, aluminum magazine floorplate is laser engraved and filled in white to commemorate 50 years of Model 700 production. The floorplate release is conveniently mounted inside the trigger guard. The trigger guard and bottom "iron" are cast from aluminum alloy, while the separate magazine box is formed of sheet steel. Magazine capacity is three rounds of 7mm Rem. Mag. The bolt release is a stamped sheet steel part that is activated by pressing inward on a square tab located directly in front of the trigger. Adjustable open sights are supplied on all Model 700 BDL''s in 2012, as they were in 1962. While it looks much like an original 1962 Model 700 BDL, in all mechanical respects the 50th Anniversary Model is the same as other 2012 Model 700 BDL''s.\n\nI am old enough to remember the introduction of the Model 700 BDL. Aside from the much more expensive Weatherby Mark V Deluxe, I thought it was the handsomest bolt action rifle on the market. If I remember correctly, a M-700 BDL retailed for about $150. (That sounds really cheap today, but in those days I was making about $1 an hour, so it cost about a month''s pay--before taxes!) A Mark V, at almost $300, was well beyond my modest means, but a Model 700 BDL was almost within the realm of possibility.\n\nOne of my hunting partners bought a M-700 BDL in .30-06 and, since we went shooting every week, I became quite familiar with his rifle, which I greatly admired. One of the great things about the M-700 stock was that it seemed to fit almost everyone and consequently handled recoil very well. From the very beginning to the present day, Remington Model 700 stocks have been exceptionally well designed. It was a comfortable rifle to shoot and that, along with its excellent trigger and fast lock time, made it easy to shoot accurately.\n\nSomehow, I never did get that 1960''s vintage Model 700 BDL I wanted. I have since owned other Model 700''s with complete satisfaction, and even some Weatherbys, but every time I see one of those 1960''s vintage Model 700 BDL''s, I regret not owning one. I still think the original BDL is the most attractive of all the many Model 700 variations.\n\nNow, Remington has given us a second chance to own one of these classic hunting rifles. I have already requested a sample for review and when it arrives and we put it through its paces, I will add the accuracy results and appropriate user comments to this article. In the meantime, get your 50th Anniversary Model 700 BDL on order, because they will only be produced in 2012. If you miss this opportunity, you will have to wait another 50 years!\n\nCourtesy: [url]http://www.chuckhawks.com/remington_50th_M-700BDL.htm[/url]', 1, 1, '119.154.0.129', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

I''ve seen his stocks and truly one even forgets the original ones, he''s a master with this respect, leave alone chequering, etc, he can even put your good portrait on it, lolz!\n\nAnyhow, congrats and best of luck with the restoration work, I myself just completed some [I]rejuvenation[/I] of mine, a 30-06 by FN, the wooden color of which had faded and become dry. Since it''s a keeper and I care nil for market status, it was simply done with just a few swabs of almost non-color polish, and finally laminated with quality lamination stuff for the continued protection and shine. I like it now, it''s smooth and lovely.\n\nAs for the bolt re-finishing, I simply went to my number-plate guy and asked him to buff it out with a soft brush over the machine, using some brasso like agent. When done, I took it home, cleaned once more to wipe away the loose carbon residue from the buffing job, and then applied some steel-polish for further cleansing and shine.\n\n[B]The bolt now looks like this:[/B]\n\n[IMG]http://i1136.photobucket.com/albums/n497/wahstar1/Rifles/30-06015Small.jpg[/IMG]\n\n\nOne must however be careful that the buffer man does not buff the parts engaging the locking part of the bolt, which I asked him to do bu handwork.\n\nI stripped the magazine and - after complete cleaning, [I]especially of the hairlike ridges by the bends of the spring which can be very prone to rust collection[/I]- greased the whole thing up with some quality white grease, reason why you can''t see the shine, otherwise it''s like new:\n\n\n[IMG]http://i1136.photobucket.com/albums/n497/wahstar1/Rifles/30-06019Medium.jpg[/IMG]\n\n[B]\nFew years back the gun looked like this,[I] default finish[/I]:[/B]\n\n\n[IMG]http://i1136.photobucket.com/albums/n497/wahstar1/Rifles/30-062.jpg[/IMG]\n\n\n[B]Weatherization/climatic effects dulled the appearance up recently as you can see in this picture:\n[/B]\n\n[IMG]http://i1136.photobucket.com/albums/n497/wahstar1/Rifles/30-06012Small.jpg[/IMG]\n\n[B]\nAnd some restoration work recently got it back to this:[/B]\n\n\n[IMG]http://i1136.photobucket.com/albums/n497/wahstar1/Rifles/30-06018Small.jpg[/IMG]\n\nSo you can judge from above both the before/after as well as original state pictures, that it''s not any "over-do" as if compared to the pictures of 3 or so years back.\n\nThe gun needs no bluing work for now as such, but I polished the barrel with top notch Mothers auto-wax and it''s uhmmm now!\n \nNow only looking for the butt-plate which had broken few years back, and in addition to this, probably some options for mounting a scope, since the gun has no default set up for it.\n\nIt''s almost "auto" smooth now, with respect to the working of the action.\n\n Wanted to share long ago, but with a field review also, ruined by the fact that i forgot all the ammo back at the hill station this summer.\n\n\nLooking forward to seeing your further upgrades/work with your new beauty, and welcome to the 30-06 gang, congrats again.\n\n\n\nRegards.', 1, 1, '119.153.63.177', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

Had a detailed discussion with the officer dealing the arms license and carry permits. I asked for the procedure of obtaining carry permit. He asked do u have any life threat. I said no. He asked do you have any FIR registered of an attack on your life. I said no. He said then there is a no permit for you. I asked that i need to carry my NPB weapon for security reasons and current law and order situation. He said that you do not need any permit for carrying NPB in concealed manner whether on person or in car. Permit are only issued for Display of weapon. All pakistan permits are issued from MOI and provincial are issued by respective DC office.\n\n\nI inquired about carrying NPB while 144 is imposed. He said if the 144 notification states that Carrying is banned then you cannot carry, otherwise you can carry in concealed manner. In 144 general notification, permits for displayed carrying are suspended. In short he said carrying of NPB weapon is allowed in concealed manner only. For display/brandishing of weapon, permits are issued. And currently none are being issued from MOI and DC office.\n\n\nI asked for the policy document if any. He said MOI has it.Now I am planning to visit MOI for the most wanted policy document so that we all can know the policy for the firearms handling lawfully.\n\n\nSecondly I was travelling in Islamabad two days back, near Serena, with 2 of my friends in my mehran when i was stopped at checkpost. The police constable asked us to step out. Which i did. He did a body search, before he could feel the weapon on me , i told him that i have a weapon. He asked me to show. I took it out, said that i will unload it , unloaded it and handed over to him. just the gun. He had a deep look to it. Asked me to show the license. which i did. he matched the number. He asked about the number of rounds i am carrying. i said 15, he asked for the magazine, which i handed over to him. He felt the weight of the magazine. and handed over the gun and magazine to me and started examining the license. Meanwhile i loaded the gun in front of him and holstered it. He returned the license to me. I smiled and said thank you to him sat back in car and left. Rangers were also present on that checkpost.\n\n\nthought of sharing this incident with you all.[/QUOTE]\n\nI had sent letter to MOI for the same and i got the response that "Licence is itself a permit to carry a weapon.
