I am new to this forum and very proud that we have such a community who takes guns as these tools should be taken. Sports, Hunting, Self Defense and pride collection.\n\nIn our country getting guns is not so difficult as we all know but getting them legally is a hassle  so most of our fellow country men who are committed to get them in a legal way get them illegally (Chai pani or dealer way).\n\nI decided to go all legal took a lot of time but finally I paid Rs. 4530/- and got my computerized license without chai pani and source. :peace:\n\nThe actual story would be very long as it took me years :Cry: but I will tell the part from where the real process starts. \n\nAlso the story seems short but it took me days in every department I am making it all very short so more and more people get encouraged of going by themselves.\n\nAfter going here and there to lot of dealers who were asking 25k-35k for computerized license. I decided to go by myself. Went to HD the police man didn''t let me in cause it was 3:00 PM and the timings were till 12 noon. bad start.\n\nWent next day with the request letter for getting an arms license, my office card, passport, CNIC, NTN and salary certificate. Went into HD ask where is the Home Secretary office.\nwhy?\n for arms license.\n\nHe does not deal that, go to arms section officer.\nOoh why didn''t I see this panaflex Computerized arms license complete details written and documents needed. Said to myself looks pretty easy ahhmm.\n\nTried to enter SO arms office "kidher kis sayee milna hai"\nSO Arms.\nKia kaam hai.\nlicense banwana hai.\n\nWait.\nWaiting.....\n\nThe guy opened the door and closed it busy hain... WAITING..........\n\nFinally got my turn. Told SO that I want a new arms license are they closed no it was never closed only for elections. But I cannot issue it because I need the recommendation from Home Secretary sahib.\n\nWent back he is not there but go to additional secretary he will do it. \n\nWent there to my surprise people outside the doors are much like bunch of idiots and the person inside is a well educated one well dressed polite and helpful (off course he is commissioned officer and I guess cleared his exam on merit). \n\nTold him that I want a new license and I am not going to pay extra amount as this is my right and as a tax payer I should be able to get one easily. Had good chat with him and he finally endorsed my application and the form and sent me back to SO arms for further process. The rest should be easy. (__:tape2:__) got my data entry done and given the token. Paid the fees in Income tax NBP branch came back sir police certificate bhi lana hooga .... not again a new chapter opens here I said to myself. \n\nThen another hassle for verifications went from one office to another and you all know what I must have been through but finally all done went back to HD submitted the form. Police man who didn''t let me in the first day from him to many other in HD by now recognize me. One even did a favor, told me sir waisay hoota nahi hai magar hum app ka license jaldi print kerwa dayeen gayee and got it printed within a week.\n\nWell the actual procedure tells you go and get an illegal weapon all the criminals have them and are using freely in Karachi. \n\nI applied for three licenses but the approval was for only one so got one license will try for another after sometime.\n\nThe exercise shows that we are the culprits who have paid huge amount of money and created this dealer and some officials mafia.\n\nAtleast this community should encourage people to go by themselves and get it done, the benefit is that now I know that the license I have is purely legal and authentic. No chai pani which is legally haram hence illegal. Imagine you caught up for bribing an official. The culture here has taken this fear away from us. We are not so comfortable carrying illegal arms but ok for bribing. \n\nNext I will go for a 144 permit after I buy a good new handgun.\n\np07 Duty or EZ9 compact. \n\nBest of luck all who take this step I recommend please try for once, you''ll have something to say that I tried and DID/didn''t manage.', 1, 0, '110.38.24.47', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

Zastava was in contract and was forbidden to sell that handgun anywhere else. thats why in those days you couldn''t see EZ9 listed on their website.\r\n\r\nSome time back, the importer terminated the contract over quality issues in EZ9 and now Zastava is free the sell it where ever it wants. both handguns are essentially the same thing with only superficial differences. \r\n\r\nThe difference in quality between the two stems from the tendency of the accessory rails to break in EZ9 or the finish from the rails wear off quickly. otherwise not much of a difference between the two.

Zastava was in contract and was forbidden to sell that handgun anywhere else. thats why in those days you couldn''t see EZ9 listed on their website.\n\nSome time back, the importer terminated the contract over quality issues in EZ9 and now Zastava is free the sell it where ever it wants. both handguns are essentially the same thing with only superficial differences. \n\nThe difference in quality between the two stems from the tendency of the accessory rails to break in EZ9 or the finish from the rails wear off quickly. otherwise not much of a difference between the two. I for one, prefer CZ999 Scorpion. To me, the handgun looks far more handsome without the funny looking rails.\n\nRegards.[/QUOTE]\n100% right sir,in fact Cz999 still rocks and is a great gun in its price range.', 1, 0, '119.157.204.148', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

I visited teo stores one was on some road i do not rembemer the name of the road but it was a factroy outlet of Shooter Arms Manufacturing (SAM) there brand name is SAM also and was managed my a women and second one was in a big departmental store named as Robinson like Metro or Makro here in Lahore.Before discussing these stores and posting the pics and awsome rates of different branded guns they told me i would like to share there gun laws and special role of private security guards etc.\nLicence in Philippines is difficult to get as in Pakistan these days they issue card licences only for 3 years and after that you have to get new card after every 3 years and fee is around 100USD for three years and if you want to carry you need separate permit that can b cancelled at any time due to some reasons like elections etc.Also not everyone is eligible for arms licence you have to prove to the authorities that you need a gun in true sense usually busnissmen \nand rich people who are really in need get licences.There are many private security agencies and they get licences of .38 special revolver,pumpaction or i only saw one Escort samiauto with a gaurd at the entrance of my hotel most of them have .38,wood rod and a handcuff too that was interesting that private guards having handcuffs but i was told that this is just show off,but i have seen these guys even controlling the traffic which i was told that it was also part of their duty somtimes.In my six days stay i only saw one police van equiped with M16 rifles and Glock17 pistols they usually do not come on the roads if they are not called.Most of people in some parts of the country keep illegal weapons even they guy who was assigend a driver to me have Smith&Wesson 9mm w/o licence so things are much like Pakistan.Now i will start with SAM i visited this shop on last Friday when i was there it was being managed by a women and girl women was around 36 and girl was around 22 .There total arsenal was few .45ACP 1911 pistols and few airguns in .22 calibre and very well build they shown me the pistol but not airguns because these were packed in PE packings.The women was not cooperating and then told her that i am also gun dealer back in Pakistan then she jumped in joy and called her boss in factory and he talked to me and offered me visit to my factory which i refused due to time shortage but took snaps of the 1911 in .45 ACP and airguns spare parts and bullets of .40 and .357 mangnum which i will b sharing shortly then i will tell u prices of Glock 17 and you will see the difference that how much we are being made fool by dealers in Pakistan.The price 1911 made by SAM was around 27000 Pesos and if we convert in Pak rupees it will be 64800 rupees.', 1, 0, '182.180.79.223', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

The dealers have to arrange special permissions from concerned departments which is time and money consuming. Even after obtaining these permissions, they are allowed to import limited quantity. These restrictions is quite relaxed when it comes to sporting weapons like shotguns and bolt action rifles. That is the reason, their prices are quite reasonable. It is another story that Pakistani Government don''t allow import of rifles and issue import permit in limited quantity which affects prices of rifles. But when it comes to pistols other than .22LR, they fall in the category of assault weapons thus making it difficult to get export permission from EU and US.\n\nSometimes, the dealers have to use other channels to import weapon into Pakistan like routing them from third country which again involves lot of money (import & export taxes, shipment costs), time and hassle. That''s why they charge premium on those weapons \n\nThat is the reason, the prices of pistols other than EU and US make (CZ, Taurus, Zastave, Norinco and etc) are quite reasonable.\n\nOn other hand, the money involved in getting import permit from Government of Pakistan also affect prices of weapons which dealers pass on to the consumers. So, basically it is not import duty which affects prices of weapons but other factors as well.[/QUOTE]\n\nMakes quite some sense concerning the EU and US made weapons. But again, all the recent lots of Beretta were imported from Turkey, the LEA lots inclusive, so the shelf price doesn''t justify the above situation, that''s where I see it black-marketing that involves pool-ups in a cartel way. Likewise, Glock is Austrian and is openly exported, directly from manufacturer, and further tree. Asad of Sardar Adil is a major handler  and is located almost right next to Major Sahb (the Taurus importer) in Bank Square, The Mall. The MSRP difference, I repeat, is just USD ~200 and the calibre is same. One sourcing agent is adding just a 35-50% premium and the other is charging like up to 500%, that is actually what I haven''t been able to understand. It is not (only) that i''m unable to afford a Glock at that much price, but it just doesn''t simply *justify* if you know what I mean.

Most would agree that this in particular is what requires an utmost level of mechanical-optical skillset as well as precise machining, no lathe, no levelling but a pure CNC.\n\nFTF and FTE are common issues with various import arms too and most of the times it is caused by a faulty spring or rust & rough surface at some edge. Not every owner is a keeper, and keepers know how to DIY it in just about a couple of minutes to fix such issues be it a local or import arm. So, this isn''t as much of a blame we put on locally crafted cheap versions.\n\nWe buy the top of the cheapest line Chinese stuff and then keep whining China produces the worst quality whereas it is the same China that excels in all electro-mechanics dozens of times better than our produce whereas consumer industry is concerned. China produces all qualities, some even outrun the German produce, yes they do, it depends on what the importer takes aboard with ''em.\n\nLikewise, when it comes to a locally crafted guns, we fear to buy expensive ones due to our own sceptics and end up purchasing the bottom line product for cheap bucks. Quality NEVER comes cheap, it NEVER does, swallow it! There are some Russian AKs that won''t melt down for as long as 500 rounds stress test, but there are some Russian AKs that would result a melt down for below 300 rounds. And then there are some Darra produced AKs that won''t melt down for as much as a 1000 rounds, literally. They just dump the barrel into water for a second and then start shooting again, yes, THEY have learnt the metal physics hard ways, inevitably, finally, and fortunately.\n\n[I]To all those whom it may concern[/I]: oh c''mon, stop whining like a cry-baby and for God''s sake put trust not into the abilities but the set of expertise we so have in dear motherland. Channelize it to the right direction, don''t just flood it out and make a waste. Pakistani Arms Industry has immense potential, we aren''t just willing to unleash the Asian Tiger as of yet!!!\n\nNow, let''s come back to SD hand guns that you may play plinking with but wouldn''t take to a range. I can tell you, I can always spend even upto 50k on a desi, custom-made for myself, on my terms, with my chosen metal combination, on my suggested spring set torque tested for stress in PSI even to decimals, and last but not least, the barrel with 30% inwards-from-top compensation vents, ejector and firepin of my choice.

"They fly in town, they get shot down."\r\n\r\n If passed, the ordinance would see one-year drone hunting licenses sell for $25, and there''s talk of a novelty drone-hunting festival to boost tourism.\r\n\r\n To Steel it''s a serious issue, however.

The administration reminded the public that it regulates the nation''s airspace, including the airspace over cities and towns.\r\n\r\nA drone "hit by gunfire could crash, causing damage to persons or property on the ground, or it could collide with other objects in the air," the statement said. "Shooting at an unmanned aircraft could result in criminal or civil liability, just as would firing at a manned airplane."\r\n\r\nUnder the proposed ordinance, Deer Trail would grant hunting permits to shoot drones. The permits would cost $25 each. The town would also encourage drone hunting by awarding $100 to anyone who presents a valid hunting license and identifiable pieces of a drone that has been shot down.\r\n\r\nDeer Trail resident Phillip Steel, 48, author of the proposal, said in an interview that he has 28 signatures on a petition — roughly 10 percent of the town''s registered voters. Under Colorado law, that requires local officials to formally consider the proposal at a meeting next month, he said. Town officials would then have the option of adopting the ordinance or putting it on the ballot in an election this fall, he said.\r\n\r\nThe proposed ordinance is mostly a symbolic protest against small, civilian drones that are coming into use in the United States, Steel said. He acknowledged that it''s unlikely there are any drones in use near Deer Trail.\r\n\r\n"I don''t want to live in a surveillance society. I don''t feel like being in a virtual prison," Steel said. "This is a pre-emptive strike."\r\n\r\nHe dismissed the FAA''s warning. "The FAA doesn''t have the power to make a law," he said.\r\n\r\nThe FAA is working on regulations to safely integrate drones into the skies over the U.S., where manned aircraft are prevalent. The Congress gave the FAA until 2015 to develop the regulations, but the agency is behind schedule. FAA officials have estimated that once regulations are in place, thousands of drones will be in use across the country for a wide variety of purposes, from helping farmers figure out which crops need watering to tracking sea lions in remote rocky outcroppings to aiding search and rescue missions.\r\n\r\nBut the Deer Trail proposal is the latest ripple in a spreading backlash against drones. Dozens of laws aimed at curbing the use of the unmanned aircraft have been introduced in states and cities. Privacy advocates have expressed fear that police will use drones to cheaply and effectively conduct widespread surveillance without warrants.\r\n\r\nThe Association for Unmanned Vehicle Systems International, a drone industry trade group, was concerned enough last year about people threatening to shoot down drones that it issued a statement warning that such comments were "irresponsible, dangerous and unlawful."\r\n\r\nMichael Toscano, president and CEO of the group, expressed similar concerns Friday, saying drones "are being designed to serve the public good....The myriad of important uses will be imperiled if they become targets. ...

For relevance one can read PakistanFirst''s post "Shopping for Rifle Scope? How Will You Decide Which One to Buy?”\r\n\r\nI Hope that PakistanFirst will soon enlighten us further. Anyhow, I would like to share my thoughts with you, if you don''t mind?\r\n\r\nFirst thing is your budget. Obviously, if you could afford Honda Civic then why buy a Suzuki Mehran. Both are cars but with lot of differences in their qualities. Such is also the case with riflescopes. You mentioned that you have CZ-455 Standard. Its latest in .22lr from CZ and is a great gun. I don''t know its exact price. I bought its earlier model CZ-452 Varmint couple of years ago from Orion Arms Lahore in 65000 Rupees. I think you must have paid above that. Make any purchase by keeping your firearm''s worth in mind.\r\n\r\nSecond thing in my mind is that you will use it for hunting activity mainly as you asked. When I am hunting with .22lr, a problem I often came across is magnification because my riflescope is Redfield revolution 3-9x40mm.  Maximum magnification of my riflescope is 9X and I still have problems for long shots on small targets and the maximum magnification you told is 7X so I am little concerned for your long shots on small targets. So please keep this point in mind. Don’t get me wrong that I do not prefer rim-fire riflescopes, they are good and they get the job done in fewer amounts. But keep in mind, buy 12X magnification riflescope atleast.\r\n\r\nFor both of my above mentioned points you can simply view youtube videos and see for yourself that guys who love .22lr sports really used high magnification and good reputation riflescopes.\r\n\r\nI have also review a Nikon P-22 2-7 X 32 mm BDC 150 scope riflescope which you mentioned and its reticle but I have some my observations which I will share with you in my next post.\r\n\r\nPlease stay in touch and enjoy your CZ-455 .22LR', 1, 0, '39.32.122.30', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

I talked to Saif, and couldn''t confirm the grade the barrel is made of, but it''s most probably the 316. Only the pre-finishing surface DA and DE polishing are run prior to assembling, which is manual. IMO, the overall frame incl. slide and lower carrier are reliably good-to-go. Sights are 1:1 to original, and accurate. Moonstar offers a lifetime warranty too, Khyber Arms offer one year warranty.\n\nUnfortunately, none of them has STLM mechanism to test coil spring for load & tension values for deflection, compression, displacement at the moment. None of the springs has an exact & accurate PSI figure, and they were unable to provide me any. In their routine SOPs, they evaluate by experience and state that it''s give-and-take the same. IMO, provided a post-purchase upgrade- [I]in compliance with the slide weight & travel differences[/I]- would increase the functionality, usability and reliability to upto 99% in comparison.\n\nBottom line, upgrading this Moonstar/Khyber/Frontier Arms Beretta clone with *genuine* Beretta replacement Part No. 1, 6, 13, 18, 38 and 55 with around USD 184.9 which includes $125 for original Beretta barrel) would actually, and literally bring to you a SD/HD handgun in 1:1 ratio perfection, originality and peace-of-mind i.e. totalling PKR 39,999 or less.

Illegal weapons are used in crimes not the licensed ones. It is the right of every free citizen to bear arms for his family’s and property’s defence. In a country like ours where the protection of common man is non existent, the right of self defence can not be taken away. The writer has referred to the tribal areas as law less areas because of weapons where as its the other way round, thefts, rapes etc are negligible in those areas.

For one, none of the parts (not even the sights, to my knowledge) are interchangeable. Even grips that are designed for the Sig P226 will not fit on the EZ9 due to its ambidextrous de-cocker. Heck, even the holsters won''t fit!\n\nAs far as my knowledge, the design of the CZ99 (the grand-daddy of the EZ9) was "influenced" by the Sig P226 and the Walther P88. There''s a good picture on the internet with all three guns together and it really shows how the EZ9 is quite a bit different from a Sig P226, at least far from a true copy as you said. \n\nThe Norinco NP22, however, is a Sig Clone. \n\nTo the OP: The Zastava series pistols (CZ99, CZ999, EZ9) are all tried, trusted, and battle-proven weapons. They are built like the proverbial tank and are fairly accurate. I''ve held and fired both weapons, and the Viking (in my opinion) doesn''t even come close in terms of fit, finish, and accuracy. Don''t forget that Zastava has been producing firearms for over 150 years! It is a highly respected manufacturer.[/QUOTE]\n\nI respect and agree with your logics, and then i will come back to my post as i said i will prefer 446 on personal liking. Secondly, i said it a copy on first instance and then for shashka added the clone word ........... ;) \n\nI Agree on Zastava reputation but i am not worried about that Russian company either making 446, its an icon in itself too. We dont get PYa (ofcourse better than 446), since this 446 is another version of PYa that differs in frame material and barrel quality. But produced by the same manufactures. Not a copy.\n\nI hope brothers, i am not stepping IN this thread, just like it had happened in CARACAL CLUB.

I was in local market of Peshawar city to buy cover and one Afghani guy came to see my gun. He told me that this is a very hot item in Afghanistan and was being sold at around US$1800 few months back and these days it is around $1200. I saw on net the price in difference countires was ranging from $1400 to $1800. So no need to worry.

I was in local market of Peshawar city to buy cover and one Afghani guy came to see my gun. He told me that this is a very hot item in Afghanistan and was being sold at around US$1800 few months back and these days it is around $1200. I saw on net the price in difference countires was ranging from $1400 to $1800. So no need to worry.

A low capacity-compliant version of the 9mm is available with  two 10 round magazines. \n  	With a 3” barrel and an unloaded weight of less than 26 ounces, the  black polycoat, alloy-framed RAMI is ideal for concealed carry.\n\n[QUOTE=Enigmatic Desires;378509]Why do U say that pisces 007? \n\nWould u share your expereince with the weapon spacialy with regard to its 14 rounder magazines?[/QUOTE]', 1, 1, '182.178.25.161', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

I talked to Saif, and couldn''t confirm the grade the barrel is made of, but it''s most probably the 316. Only the pre-finishing surface DA and DE polishing are run prior to assembling, which is manual. IMO, the overall frame incl. slide and lower carrier are reliably good-to-go. Sights are 1:1 to original, and accurate. Moonstar offers a lifetime warranty too, Khyber Arms offer one year warranty.\n\nUnfortunately, none of them has STLM mechanism to test coil spring for load & tension values for deflection, compression, displacement at the moment. None of the springs has an exact & accurate PSI figure, and they were unable to provide me any. In their routine SOPs, they evaluate by experience and state that it''s give-and-take the same. IMO, provided a post-purchase upgrade- [I]in compliance with the slide weight & travel differences[/I]- would increase the functionality, usability and reliability to upto 99% in comparison.\n\nBottom line, upgrading this Moonstar/Khyber/Frontier Arms Beretta clone with *genuine* Beretta replacement Part No. 1, 6, 13, 18, 38 and 55 with around USD 184.9 which includes $125 for original Beretta barrel) would actually, and literally bring to you a SD/HD handgun in 1:1 ratio perfection, originality and peace-of-mind i.e. totalling PKR 39,999 or less.

I saw a 92FS clone yesterday at a local dealer and the finishing was good in and out (inspected the gun all opened) and barrel looked good too but your technical knowledge surpasses mine and these dealers. The dealer did inform me that 1 or 2 manufacturers now have the kits to make exact clones for the 92FS, so you are correct that it is most likely some parts they skimp on to keep the prices low for local buyers. I, like you, wouldn''t mind paying 40K for a near perfect clone with critical 92FS''s original parts in it. As for barrel, most american gun makers use a specific scaled RC hardened 416SS as 316SS is cheaper and easier to drill and work with. Original barrel will be ideal.\n\nSent you a friend request.

Mr Ab sees 3 armed men coming to him with automatic weapons he manages to get his tt from the dashboard and pulls the slide back \nfour shots were fired ............... and he gets out his car which was almost junk now miraculously he manages to walk though one leg was injured and he was bleeding from his head \nthe four shots were from Mr Ab''S pistol which he had shot being upside down through the cars door his car was upside down with the wind screen facing the right side he saw them coming from the left window while being injured the bullets left clean punches in his door the distance was almost 10-15 meter when he fired the shots the first one missed the rest hit the three leaving only one critically alive 3 shots were chest shots \nnow this is a true incident i wrote up to show you the accuracy and power of the .30 \nand Mr Ab can hit bottle caps with his .30 at +18meters\nhe owns a very classy selection of  shotguns and rifles but for pistols he now trusts his life with the Chinese TT', 1, 1, '182.185.255.239', 4, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

Went to Saeed Book store (F7 Markaz), picked up Acrylic Fluorescent paint tubes (large tubes, PKR135 each) and 3 x size 0 and 1x size 1 brushes (PKR25 each). Original White sites are not fluorescent but these are. Orange fluorescent paint was out of stock as someone had picked up every tube they had!\n\n@doc pistol bh: It is a simple diy job. I cleaned the inner area with the medical alcohol wipes and then lightly scratched the to be filled area for the acrylic paint to stick. Acrylic sticks well to the metal and hardens quickly so avoid water based paint. Take the brush, pick up a suitable amount of paint from the tube and fill the sites fully (no air gaps etc). It is okay if it is an overfill as that can be cut out and removed later with a very sharp tip knife/blade as acrylic paint can be cut when dry - if you overfill too much then clean it all with a tissue. I''ll get some close-up pictures with a proper camera, these were taken with the tablet. I was able to get the exact maroon colour for the safety as well, as one side did the runner too! Hence 4 brushes. I had considered using medical syringes (plenty of doctors in family!) to fill the paint but brushes were fine for the job. With the syringes, one doesn''t get overspill however more paint is wasted along with the syringes and acrylic paint is quite thick so wider syringes would have been required. Brushes can be cleaned and reused with a thinner. \n\n@Ameer bh: Thanks :)\n\n@Nazim bh and eminentpk bh: Yes, pink is interesting and ''innovative'' :) .... I have flourescent Green too but didn''t go for yellow rear and green front combo as front site (for me) needs to be of a totally different colour. Ideal would have been fluorescent Orange for front and fluorescent green for rear but lack of Orange lead to the current combo.

I saw a 92FS clone yesterday at a local dealer and the finishing was good in and out (inspected the gun all opened) and barrel looked good too but your technical knowledge surpasses mine and these dealers. The dealer did inform me that 1 or 2 manufacturers now have the kits to make exact clones for the 92FS, so you are correct that it is most likely some parts they skimp on to keep the prices low for local buyers. I, like you, wouldn''t mind paying 40K for a near perfect clone with critical 92FS''s original parts in it. As for barrel, most american gun makers use a specific scaled RC hardened 416SS as 316SS is cheaper and easier to drill and work with. Original barrel will be ideal.\n\nSent you a friend request. Thanks.[/QUOTE]\n\nBro, I have reached some info on this by talking to a couple of manufacturers in extended details, the barrels they''re making are already 316ss and good for around 700-1000 bullets, just like any other weapons. Once you''re done with the original barrel, you can then get yourself an Beretta replacement part (~$100 to ~125, widely available). For now, only the guide spring would suffice.\n\nAgain, it''s not just the kit, esp.

I talked to Saif, and couldn''t confirm the grade the barrel is made of, but it''s most probably the 316. Only the pre-finishing surface DA and DE polishing are run prior to assembling, which is manual. IMO, the overall frame incl. slide and lower carrier are reliably good-to-go. Sights are 1:1 to original, and accurate. Moonstar offers a lifetime warranty too, Khyber Arms offer one year warranty.\n\nUnfortunately, none of them has STLM mechanism to test coil spring for load & tension values for deflection, compression, displacement at the moment. None of the springs has an exact & accurate PSI figure, and they were unable to provide me any. In their routine SOPs, they evaluate by experience and state that it''s give-and-take the same. IMO, provided a post-purchase upgrade- [I]in compliance with the slide weight & travel differences[/I]- would increase the functionality, usability and reliability to upto 99% in comparison.\n\nBottom line, upgrading this Moonstar/Khyber/Frontier Arms Beretta clone with *genuine* Beretta replacement Part No. 1, 6, 13, 18, 38 and 55 with around USD 184.9 which includes $125 for original Beretta barrel) would actually, and literally bring to you a SD/HD handgun in 1:1 ratio perfection, originality and peace-of-mind i.e. totalling PKR 39,999 or less.

Went to Saeed Book store (F7 Markaz), picked up Acrylic Fluorescent paint tubes (large tubes, PKR135 each) and 3 x size 0 and 1x size 1 brushes (PKR25 each). Original White sites are not fluorescent but these are. Orange fluorescent paint was out of stock as someone had picked up every tube they had!\n\n@doc pistol bh: It is a simple diy job. I cleaned the inner area with the medical alcohol wipes and then lightly scratched the to be filled area for the acrylic paint to stick. Acrylic sticks well to the metal and hardens quickly so avoid water based paint. Take the brush, pick up a suitable amount of paint from the tube and fill the sites fully (no air gaps etc). It is okay if it is an overfill as that can be cut out and removed later with a very sharp tip knife/blade as acrylic paint can be cut when dry - if you overfill too much then clean it all with a tissue. I''ll get some close-up pictures with a proper camera, these were taken with the tablet. I was able to get the exact maroon colour for the safety as well, as one side did the runner too! Hence 4 brushes. I had considered using medical syringes (plenty of doctors in family!) to fill the paint but brushes were fine for the job. With the syringes, one doesn''t get overspill however more paint is wasted along with the syringes and acrylic paint is quite thick so wider syringes would have been required. Brushes can be cleaned and reused with a thinner. \n\n@Ameer bh: Thanks :)\n\n@Nazim bh and eminentpk bh: Yes, pink is interesting and ''innovative'' :) .... I have flourescent Green too but didn''t go for yellow rear and green front combo as front site (for me) needs to be of a totally different colour.

But a company spokeswoman told [URL="http://mdjonline.com/view/full_story/23200043/article-Lock-and-load---Marietta--Atlanta-police-departments-ready-to-reload-with-Glock-guns?instance=home_business"]The Marietta Daily Journal[/URL] that the fourth-generation Glock pistols, the type involved in the contract, retail to the public for between $599 and $734, although law enforcement receives a discounted purchase rate.\n\n\nGlock [URL="http://us.glock.com/news/release/glock-secures-atlanta-police-department-as-newest-law-enforcement-customer/"]says[/URL] about 65% of U.S. law-enforcement departments now use its pistols, a remarkable accomplishment for a company that started manufacturing firearms only [URL="http://glock.pro/glock-pistols/358-glock-pistol-history-evolution.html"]in the 1980s[/URL].\n\n\nGlock took the gun world by storm when founder Gaston Glock came up with an innovative design for a semiautomatic pistol using lightweight plastics and other synthetics. \n\n\nThe Glock is also easy to fire and maintain. And while an old-school revolver typically holds six shots, a Glock -- depending on the magazine used -- can handle up to 19 rounds, giving police the additional firepower they were looking for.\n\n\nThe gun also caught on with the American public. It was seen in TV cop shows and movies. In "Die Hard 2," Bruce Willis'' character gives a [URL="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yf8sC_1deyM"]short speech[/URL] about the advantages of the Glock. References to the guns also kept popping up in rap lyrics, and by the mid-1990s Glock sold more than a million of its guns in the U.S. alone, according to this [URL="http://www.nbcnews.com/id/41046787/ns/business-world_business/t/americas--year-love-affair-glocks/#.UfE4sW0pjMi"]2011 report[/URL]. \n\n\n\nAccording to an [URL="http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/09_38/b4147036107809.htm"]extensive 2009 article[/URL] on the company by Bloomberg Businessweek, Glock''s estimated profit margin on its pistols runs around 68%, and it has sales of [URL="http://articles.washingtonpost.com/2012-07-23/opinions/35489738_1_gun-culture-gaston-glock-gun-control"]about $100 million[/URL] annually in the U.S.\n\n\nWhile supplying law enforcement, Glock has had some brushes with the law also. The Businessweek article noted the company has long dealt with allegations of widespread corruption, as well as a failed contract assassination attempt on Gaston Glock by a former business associate.\n\n\nBut controversies aside, it doesn''t appear Glock will be relinquishing its hold on its place in U.S. law enforcement. \n\n\n\n"We believe Gliock offers a trusted, superior firearm for our officers," Atlanta Police Chief George Turner said in a company [URL="http://us.glock.com/news/release/glock-secures-atlanta-police-department-as-newest-law-enforcement-customer/"]press release[/URL].

(378965, 5797, 377598, 'PakistanFirst', 5092, '22LR - Leupold, Nikon &amp; Redfield Scopes', 1374794851, 'This post discusses the Leupold Rimfire VX1 2-7X28, Nikon P22 2-7X32 and Redfield Revenge 3-9X42 scopes. All three manufacturers are well established and are respected brands. Redfield is now a part of the Leupold enterprise. I called Leupold, Nikon Sport Optics and Redfield to validate the specifications of their scopes to give an informed advisory. I have not personally used any of the mentioned scopes.\n \nBeside the mechanical and optical quality, other factors need to be considered in purchasing a scope.  Brightness at dawn and at dusk is low. If your shooting involves low light levels, you want a scope that offers relative high brightness. This factor is derived by dividing the objective lens diameter (in mm) by the power factor of the scope. This gives us the exit pupil diameter.  Pupil diameter of the human eye changes depending light condition. In low light, the pupil will dilate to 7 millimeters. A scope with a relative brightness of more than 7 will be of little benefit. On the other hand if you want to use scope in low light, a scope that gives you higher relative brightness would be valuable.     \n \nKeep in mind that the magnification markings on the scopes may not be accurate in all instances. Actual magnifications of each scope at low and high power appear in the table below. Following are the relative brightness level computations at the actual low and high power magnifications. \n \nLeupold at low power - 28/2.4 = 11.67; at high power 28/6.7 = 4.12\nNikon at low power 32/2 = 16; at high power 32/7 = 4.57\nRedfield at low power 42/3 = 14; at high power 42/8.6 = 4.88\n \nAll three scopes offer more than adequate relative brightness at low power. At high power, the Redfield has an advantage. Under the criteria I mentioned earlier, let us compute the maximum magnification of each to achieve relative brightness level of 7. \n \nLeupold, 28/7 = 4X. Nikon, 32/7 = 4.6X. Redfield, 42/7 = 6. For a less string criteria - relative brightness of 5, Leupold computes as 28/5 = 5.6X; Nikon as 32/5 =6.4X and Redfield as 42/5 as 8.4X.\n \nComputed relative brightness is not everything.  A scope may be described as “coated”, multicoated” or “fully multicoated”. On a “fully multicoated” all lens surfaces receive multiple layers of coatings. A “multicoated” may possibly have multicoating only the lens surfaced exposed to air. Other surfaces of the lenses in this type of scope may not have any coating or just single layer on inter lens surfaces.  All three scopes mentioned in this  article are fully multicoated.\n \nHigher magnification scopes make the target appear closer. This advantage is at the expense of smaller linear field of view (FOV). Linear field of view is the width of view at a given distance.

For this reason the parallax is adjusted for short distances - 60 yards in the case of Leupold and 50 yards for Nikon. The Redfield is designed for center fire rifle. For this reason, Parallax is set for distance of 150 yards. If your eye can be aimed directly at the center of the eyepiece, then parallax is of little concern.\n \nLeupold VX1 2-7X28 LR Duplex reticle is described here on page 21.\n [URL]http://www.leupold.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/BAS_Inst_Manual_17July12.pdf[/URL]\n \nNikon P22 2-7x32 is available with the BCD 150 or the Nikoplex reticle. The ranging systems of these two scopes are totally different. \n \nNikon scope with the Nikoplex reticle (Rapid Action Turret Technology) is furnished with two elevation turrets One turret is for standard velocity is for standard velocity (1200-1300 f/s) ammunition and the other for hyper velocity (1500-1640 f/s) ammunition. You place the appropriate turret on the scope and sight it for any distance that is marked on the turret. Thereafter you rotate the turret to any other desired distance marked on the turret. For ammunition with velocities between 1300 and 1500 feet per second, you can use either turret. But to get the proper setting for such ammunition, you can access Nikon Sport Optics web site to use their program that will furnish the number of clicks that need to be counted for proper turret settings.     \n \nThe turrets are marked in 25-yard increments from 50 to 150 yards. Bear in mind that if you want to aim the rifle scope to any “in-between” distance marked on the turret, you would have to count the turret clicks (marks) to make the appropriate up or down adjustments. Since the two turrets are for a range of ammunition velocities instead of a single velocity, you are bound to get errors. This error can be easily validated by using a ballistic calculator. \n \nNikon scope with the BCD 150 reticle has four open circles for 75, 100, 125 and 150 yards. The standard crosshair is deployed for 50-yard distance target. Nikon BCD 150 reticle is described here: [URL]http://www.nikonusa.com/fileuploads/pdfs/BDC_manual.pdf[/URL]\n  \nIt is possible that the P22 2-7X32 with Nikoplex reticle may have the wrong turrets. Here is the link to that advisory from Nikon. [URL]http://www.nikonsportoptics.com/Service-And-Support/Service-Advisories/P-22-2-7X32-NikoPlex-Riflescope-Service-Advisory.page[/URL]\n \nRedfield offers four reticle styles  for the Revenge scope. Redfield Revenge 3-9X42 is described  here: [URL]http://www.redfield.com/redfield-revenge/[/URL]\n[URL]http://www.redfield.com/_media/downloads/redfield_3-9x42.pdf[/URL]\n \nAfter reviewing all the information that I collected from the manufacturers, I am inclined to go for the Nikon. What I do not like is the fact that elevation and windage adjustment per click is coarse. The Nikon turret are not click-type, but friction-type. When you rotate the turrets, you do not hear clicks. The turrets have markings on the dials. Each move of one mark on the dial equates to ¼” at 50 yards and ½” at 100 yards. To me, this is a big handicap. The Luupold has the lowest relative brightness at low and at high power. The Redfield is not only the heaviest but also the longest. Redfield’s parallax setting at 150 is not appealing to me for a 22LR rifle.\n \nIf my choice is limited to the Leupold Rimfire VX-1 2-7X28, Nikon P22 2-7X32 and Redfield Revenge 3-9X42, I would first visit a sporting goods store that carries all three scopes and have a first-hand look. At this point in time I am inclined to go for the Leupold. Not mentioned here is the factor of price. This factor may sway me away from the Leupold towards another scope that is not even discussed here. If the store has other scopes, I would also take them into consideration before making my final choice.', 1, 1, '75.140.10.210', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

If it is imposed to ban carrying of weapon in any state then you need permit. But if 144 is imposed on display of weapon, then you don''t need permit to conceal carry or carry in your car. As stated above, legally police cannot search you car but they do it. This is all Chai Pani arrangement. Legally, they cannot register any case against you and even they do so, that will be decided in first hearing. But none of us want to go through this hassle. Secondly, the permit displayed here is just a letter to authorities to inform that there is no restriction on conceal carrying and it is not a permit. No permit is required in Punjab.

The range master disagreed and told me I could only shoot from 25 yards. My argument was that new gun, 3" barrel, sub compact and myself being only a recreational shooter will not be able to do much at 25 yards. \n\nAnyway, I took the gun and let the first shot rip. The recoil was quite smooth and much less then expected. Another 4 shots and I walked to the target to see the result. Lo and behold - a 2.5" group from 25 yards with a brand new gun. I was shocked to say the least. And mightily impressed by the Rami. \n\nWent back and shot another 5 - another 2.5" group. More amazement. And internal screams of joy. :)\n\nAnyway, all bullets were hitting about 5-6 inches left of the center mass - at 25 yards. If I aimed 5-6 inches right I was dead center. Can any of the seniors guide me as to how to adjust the sights and how much should I move it? Mine came with the TruGlo sights and I believe the rear should be adjustable for windage. Please help.\n\nSecondly - as in previous Rami posts - the 14 round mag does have an issue. If the mag is fully loaded the 3rd of the 4th round FTE''s. If only 10 or 11 rounds are put in the mag works well. Any senior members know what I can do to correct this issue?\n\n- Usman\np.s.

But if 144 is imposed on display of weapon, then you don''t need permit to conceal carry or carry in your car. As stated above, legally police cannot search you car but they do it. This is all Chai Pani arrangement. Legally, they cannot register any case against you and even they do so, that will be decided in first hearing. But none of us want to go through this hassle.

When I came back, around 11 pm in the night, I noticed the main door had been broken, the wood slab that has the handle had been smashed to unhinge the locks. I called DHA security, since I dont have much faith in our police. I waited outside the house for them, not knowing if someone was still in.\r\n\r\nThey came fairly quickly, although the armed old timer had the longest double barrel I have ever seen. Looking at that gun, I was afraid more so for him than the robbers since it provided no maneuver room for him in a closed area like a house. Anyway, I led the way into the house and we found that no one was there. The main bedroom had all the wardrobe belongings thrown down and searched through. The rest of the house was clean ie didnt look as if someone paid much attention there.\r\n\r\nShortly after, a few policemen arrived. They looked as if they had just woken up, no pun intended. I gave them a guided tour of my house as well. They told me to come to the police station next day and have an FIR registered and left.\r\n\r\nThe worst part was that my CZ-999 and about 30 rounds of bullets were stolen. I didnt care much for the usual cash and jewelry, although they were significant in terms of monetary amount. The only reason I had left the gun at home was that my computerized license had expired and didnt want to have a weapon with me in that situation.\r\n\r\nLong story short, we suspected it was someone from the house workers or one from the neighbors (the ones that always love to sit outside and observe other houses). However I didnt name anyone suspect in the FIR and the person assigned to inspect it questioned our maids and then wanted to throw our poor gardener in jail along with the neighbors servants.\r\n \r\nI felt if the police did their usual activity we could get to the culprit but the whole process revolved around punishing our workers without first determining guilt, some of whom had been with us for some time and I feel are honest people. I also heard from others about how their gardeners are now on the ''maskook list'' ie everytime something happens in the city, the poor souls get thrown into jail to show progress. So I decided to stop cooperating and just ignore their requests for further interrogation of our workers. The policeman was pissed at me and in the end said, dont open an FIR if you''re not willing to go through with the investigation.\r\n\r\nI now have a alarm system installed with a local security firm and think its a decent investment to stop at least the entry level thieves.', 1, 0, '182.178.195.119', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

Conversion kits for 1911-pattern guns have been around for a very long time. In the revolver world, rimfire equivalents to full size duty guns go back even further. A major resurgence of .22 training has come about in response to the 2009 ammunition shortage. SIG-Sauer and other companies now offer factory OEM conversion kits for their most popular pistols. Other companies opt for a dedicated training gun like the upcoming S&W M&P pistol in .22lr or the well established Ruger 22/45.\n\nThe twenty-two can certainly be a beneficial tool. A .22 pistol eliminates most of the recoil and blast that can be so intimidating to beginners. For more experienced shooters, the substantially lower price of .22lr ammunition often provides the means for more live fire practice than one might be able to afford with centerfire 9mm, .45 Auto, etc. There are also times and places where a .22 — especially a suppressed .22 — can be used but larger, more powerful, louder pistols might not.\n\nThe important thing to keep in mind when practicing with a .22-cal equivalent to your normal pistol is that the .22 has essentially no recoil. Ten year old children can easily tame the kick and muzzle rise of most .22lr pistols. From a training perspective, what this means is that the .22 is not suitable for any training that focuses on the speed of firing multiple shots at a single target. Do not trick yourself into believing otherwise.\n\nFar too many people sacrifice grip and proper sight tracking while simply going spasmodic on the trigger of a twenty-two. Then they falsely believe they can shoot a serious duty or carry gun faster, as well. Instead, that person has started to form bad habits that will actually diminish his speed when handling a centerfire pistol.\n\nSkills you can work on effectively with a .22 equivalent to your normal pistol:\n\nmarksmanship\nstrong- and weak-hand only shooting\ndraw stroke\nreloads\ntransitions\njudgmental shooting\nshooting on the move… With SOM, the line between good .22 training and bad .22 training is definitely easy to cross. But like transition drills, SOM training can benefit from a .22 in terms of learning how to move your feet and position your body for a stable shooting platform on the move.\nSkills you should not practice with a .22lr handgun:\n\nrecoil management\nsight tracking\nrapid multiple shots on a single target\nfailure drills\nAlso, the more similarity between your .22 trainer and your standard pistol the more beneficial certain drills will be. While you can get marksmanship benefit from shooting almost anything, having the same trigger system and sights (or better yet, the same identical trigger and sights) will obviously translate into more direct skill building. A heel magazine release and single stack magazine is not giving you 1:1 benefit for your button release double stack pistol reloads. Malfunction clearances with an Advantage Arms .22 conversion kit will be more helpful than doing similar drills with a Ruger 22/45. And so on.\n\nA .22lr training pistol can be an effective and economical way to practice many handgun fundamentals, but misused it can also lead to a very false sense of proficiency. By keeping in mind what a .22 can and cannot mimic, both the beginner and the dedicated shooter can wring real benefits from a sub-caliber practice pistol.\n\n\n[I]Source pistol-training[/I][/FONT][/COLOR]\n\n[COLOR=#323D4F][FONT=Lucida Grande][/FONT][/COLOR]', 1, 0, '175.110.250.248', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

Once you got the permit, you need to contact an arms dealer who will arrange import for you. They charge good money for this service.

Once the gun is imported, you will have to pay all the taxes and duties levied by government. In the end, you will save few bucks but you will have to go through lot of hassle.

In some places, zoning commissions regulate where and what kind of businesses or residences are allowed.  A few lucky places don''t have zoning.\n\n Third, find out what it takes to acquire stock for your store.  In some cases, you have to purchase some (large) minimum per order or per year to get good pricing.  In other cases, the vendor owns everything, and you just provide shelving.\n\n Fourth, contact your tax authorities and find out if there are any special or supplementary taxes that apply to your business, and how often you have to file.  \n\n Fifth, find out if you''re required to have insurance, and how much it will cost, and how often it must be paid.\n\n Sixth, find out if what you''re selling has special regulations concerning who you can sell to, and what kinds of records, if any, must be kept.\n\n\n You might also scout around and see if there''s a similar business already in Karachi, that might be interested in a partner or investor.

Breakdown of first 300 is as follows:\n \nThe first 200 round were fired alongside brand new never fired 4 Sig P226s by current and ex-army personnel who bought these Sigs together. Targets were upper half human size. First 50 were just to get to ''know and feel'' the guns and next 150 shots were rapid fires and up to 75 meters, my Stoeger won hands down on target hit counts against every Sig in 25m, 50m & 75m - we started with 25m and moved longer in distance to 50m to 75m and finally to 100m. At 100m 5 rapid fire was last test (single handed only, no second hand support under the mag), 1 sig and my stoeger hit the target with 1 bullet each. I don''t claim to be a sharp shooter but against seasoned shooters with brand new Sigs, if Stoeger performed that well from new then I don''t consider it to be a risk. \n\nAt a private 8 kanal remote ''range'' to train my other half on Stoeger, PT99 and MKA1919 shotgun, it was all 100 shots rapid fire at 2 head size empty metal paint cans (filled with bricks and rocks to keep them in place and stable) with A4 paper glued/taped to it for hit counts after every 30 rounds and paper replaced, at 75m distance and 6ft height and it had shattered the bricks. In that test, PT99 was used too (100 rapid rounds again each) but site adjustments were not getting right so lots of off target (hence replaced with PT92 within 2 weeks after that).. This test was filmed with video cam on tripod with just the cans in focus. My mrs loves the Stoeger as she found it way more accurate and hated the PT99 even though it has a lot less recoil.\n\nIn my humble opinion, my SC is now a hard run from new break-in completed pistol with 250 rapid shots. If something was to give, 150 rapids in first day of use would have shown something or weakness signs at full strip and clean after both target tests. As for target shooting, the circular 0-9 target paper is a very good benchmark but for a layman as long as his/her pistol''s fired bullet can hit a head (a normal paint can size) from a good distance (75m is quite an SD distance) by not one but 2 (me and mrs), then this Stoeger is good enough and minimal/reduced risk to CC.', 1, 0, '223.29.236.33', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

And then the big importers of these specific weapons (people in real power - not the puppet governments - usually etc) come in play and they take a big chunk of their margin because people are willing to pay a premium to own such weapons.\nTurkish, CZ and Brazilian weapons are on import quota and come through normal channels where customs clearance charges (taxes and duties) AND bribes are added and usually a few importers take orders from normal dealers to place one large order. 1 order can be placed from one country at a time only so sometimes you see shortage of Turk guns or Taurus or CZ etc. Then the importer(s) delivers to dealers their orders. A normal dealer shop makes up to 8k max for a sub 100k pistol/shotgun. Dealers all claim to be importers but handful are actual but with low quantity, even in this channel the big guns are controlling and they don''t sell direct to public (unless you are a best buddy of one).\nSome or many of you know this already and I won''t post the link of the site ... from there you can source any (and I mean ANY) type of weapon and ammo and it is delivered to your doorstep without you doing anything other than paying and opening your door to collect the package, and to any part of the world. But price is minimum 3 times or more (than it would cost in their native manufacturing countries) and these guys only deal in gold as money!!!!

Now there is Zigana P9 (excellent finish but no accuracy tests so far) and after a bit of digging around, it has been in the market for a few years but it wasn''t successful due to high price and higher recoil (it weighs less) than Chinese/Russian TTs so dealers stopped importing them.', 1, 0, '223.29.225.15', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

For lower tech hardware & software, they need permissions too. Another company''s revolutionary software is not allowed to be sold to Pakistani owned companies. Obviously I can''t put names of these companies here as every forum is tracked by the powers who control the likes of google and so on. Heard of google being banned for a while in China and reasons? Heard of how much private data was stolen in europe by google vans that provide google map down to 360 street level images - and EU reacts with a gentle slap on the hand. And youtube ban in PK is benefiting who really - PK media owners and anchors are ecstatic because of youtube ban and so is the establishment along with many others. I digress.\n\nHowever a lot of banned hardware and goods do get in through indirect channels, especially routing through various ports (container changes etc etc) and countries around the globe hence making it very difficult for such goods to be tracked. This pushes the prices up a lot as there are a lot of cash-in-hand payments made in the process. There are serious players who do all this channelling work.\n\nBack to topic .... PX4: by professionals the range, accuracy and endurance/torture testing required (as a genuine 92FS has been through hence it is a highly respected pistol warranting a very high price due to very low supply). Until then, in my view, it''s just a fancy version of Stoeger with Beretta logo on it and a show off price tag of 350k+. Galaxy S4 and S3 are much better phones than iPhone5 in every department yet iPhone is 25%+ more expensive. Samsung 10.1 Note Tablet is better than current iPad and people continue to buy iPhone5 and iPad even when they are infested with issues that make them inferior products for the price tags, why .... status symbol! Same status syndrome applies to PX4 until it is really tried and tested - even then it wouldn''t be worth it''s current price tag. No offence to those who own PX4. Zigana T (LEA) is a way sexier pistol, and it is LEA designed to operate full auto and PX4 is not even LEA grade. Price difference ....', 1, 0, '180.178.191.85', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

They attempted to take off fingerprints from a number of items, but I felt it was flawed for a number of reasons:\n\n1. The original policeman I dealt with said I can use the house as i wish. I asked about fingerprints and they were like naaa, not going to be taken or something\n2. The assigned investigator however did bring in the fingerprinting guys, but by that time some of the items had already been handled by me\n3. They took a lot of fingerprints of items that can retain prints, ie glossy flat surface items etc. No idea what happened to those as they never came back with names of individuals and if I knew them or not. My follow up questions on the fingerprints leads me to believe its more of a formality, possibly helpful in a court case where someone is being prosecuted rather than in pulling up the identity from NADRA\n\nIf I were to venture into a guess, the theft wasnt committed by the worker themself, but by someone whom they provided detailed information about the house etc. We were going out of town, so it was obvious to 4-5 workers that we wont be around for a few days. The act of breaking a door is not something a normal houseworker is capable of doing, they dont have the nerves to do this without fear of a neighbor catching them from the noise wood breaking makes \n\nThis was a professional. He scaled a wall, then uses a crowbar to break open the door by first chipping into the middle part of the door to dislodge the first lock and then inserting the crowbar in the lower part of the door to act as a lever against the remaining door lock. I''m betting he was in within 10 minutes of scaling over the wall. And he scaled the wall back to leave since I had locked the gate and it was still locked when I came back.

PX4 is lovely weapon. Like a singer whose every song is not an ultimate hit, same goes for virtually every brand in every category possible out there. Every product has its own pros and cons. Most of the cons are re-worked after post trial usage at the hands of actual real world users. Hand guns are no exception. \n\nBefore I proceed further, please check out the following link:\n[/SIZE][URL]http://www.berettausa.com/products/stoeger-cougar-8000f/[/URL]\n\nOkay, now, as far as comparison goes, while working "mostly" on the same principals, PX4 and Stoeger Cougar are both different guns aimed at different markets. The Cougar has evolved. Quality control is also dictated by the brand or company responsible for overseeing their original product produced at the hands of a [SIZE=3]subsidiary company. In this case Beretta (Parent Company) and Stoeger (Subsidiary). Metallurgy DOES matter here (Italian vs Turkish) and while I fully support the fact that Stoeger Cougar passes and meets the stringent quality control tests laid down by Beretta while reducing the price tag just for marketing and sale purpose (blah blah) I can''t guarantee if both companies cut few corners in the manufacturing process. Still, in this case, the Cougar must be meeting the standards of Beretta if not exceeding like the PX4. Either way, its your budget and "want vs need" that matters while choosing both which are equally capable guns. Testimony needed? I''ve owned a PX4 and three S/Cougars. Never, ever encountered a single problem with either. Consistency wise (Not Accuracy which is debatable) both give you best bang for the buck. But one "has to be" slightly better than the other in any category, may it be finishing, mag capacity, accessories, customizable etc. Having said that, the PX4 has been intentionally priced higher to S/Cougar due to advanced design and few improvements. You may also consider this marketing tactics. Like a BMW 7 Series has to outperform BMW 5 Series. Both get the job done but you mostly get what you pay for.[/SIZE]', 1, 0, '119.157.245.240', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

I have been up to stuff, some of no importance but am always fiddling with guns, my guns specifically.  Sometimes I laugh about it as those few who know me have decided to label me as a thinker tinker; and that I can''t leave well enough alone.  I am of the firm belief that only God is perfect and everyone/thing else could use some sort of modification(s). \n \nI have always wanted to have this this way or that that way when it comes to firearms.  Once done, I get bored and since I am not rich, I have to dispose of that unique item and move to the new idea.  Take for example my previous project: convert the CZ 75 TS into a CzechMate BUT with the option of being able to use a compensator with a front sight. \n [URL]http://www.czforum.com/index.php?topic=1116.msg6666#msg6666[/URL]\n[URL]http://www.pakguns.com/showthread.php?8698-Evolution-Cz-75-ts&highlight=[/URL]\nHaving done that project, I again went back to the basics by purchasing another Tactical Sports.  I had just been shooting the TS and thinking about what is next.  Then one day, a friend was visiting from abroad, he has a bunch of AWESOME weapons; he bought them over to the Gun & Country Club for shooting.  In our region we do our range shooting mainly at 25 meters (27 yards) at ISSF targets - single handed in events.  Sounds easy right?  Ha!  I don''t care if one can lift 50 lbs dumbbells 50 times for shoulder presses... try to simply hold 1.5 KG dumbbell straight out like you are going to shoot for 1 minute and then see how bad your hand shakes.  At least mine does.  I shot the Sig Mastershop X6, 9mm, 25 rounds and not bad but the group could have been better.  It should be noted that prior to shooting this gun I had been shooting Air pistol for about two hours.  Having said that I then shot with my CZ TS, 9mm, 25 rounds, and I still shot a better group than the X6.  I also tried the same thing with a HK USP ELITE, 9mm, 25 rounds and wow an even better group.  Why?  Because the gun was lighter, trigger was crap compared to the X6 or TS but the gun was still manageable due to lighter weight.  There at that moment a new project came into being.\n\nLike all my projects, I tend to think of names to call that pistol.  I was suggested/adopted  ''Anubis'' for the previous project.  For this project the name suggested to me was ''StripTease''... lolz.  I can just hear the laughter everywhere.  I finally decided on ''LiteSpeed''.  So how to lighten?  Two options: A.  Build a new Slide & Frame in either (Titanium or 7075 T6 Alloy) - a slightly expensive option (maybe a surprise later in the year).  B.  Start shaving, slotting, and cutting everywhere.  For now, option B was the flavor.  So, how much do I shave and where?  How big and long do I mill the slots?  What portions are not needed; hence cut them off?  Lastly and MOST importantly who has done this before and would they be kind enough to help me?  The answer to the last question was YES... Yippee! \n \nI would like to thank the following for their help in assessing my thoughts and giving me the ''ok'':\nCZ CUSTOM - Rob Bagnato \nCajun Gun Works - David Milam\nCheely Custom Gunworks - Matt Cheely\n\nOff I went and bought Carbide and TiN coated 8mm (ball end), 5mm (ball end), 3mm (ball end), and other cutters (end mills) with the same dias..  Mind you - I never knew these things are EXPENSIVE.  We started off cautiously as I never really knew how much metal is hidden where.  So initially I shaved the slide by only .5mm.  Then put a bevel in it with the ball end going in by another 1mm.  I then proceeded to slot the guide rod housing with the 8mm end mill.  The first end mill broke and had to use the second one which also finally did give way but got the job done.  Whoa!  there is TOO much metal on this thing... its everywhere... this is a very MEATY gun.  I proceeded to chop the front end off as I had see on the CZ Custom CTS.  After that I removed the BS checkering and slotted the grip.  I went back to the slide more aggressively and slotted out the bevels.  Then I realized that I had changed the balance of this thing due to excessive lightening in the front.  Well why not the rear where there is at least 4mms worth of metal around the firing pin.  I started to shave the slide there and also bevel more aggressively.  Whilst at it, I decided that to further reduce the recoil, I will port it... and did so with 3mm ports.  I have a set of variable power recoil springs coming from Wolf.\nTo make a long story short I have reduced the weight by about 190 grams - take off another 60+ grams if you revert the following parts back to OEM: grips back to stock wood, plastic guide rod, plastic guide rod plug, plastic magwell, stock windage only adjustable sights.  I like it just fine like this so it also looks good.  Btw, did you all know that all the internals including the custom grips and stuff amounted to .5 KG?\n\nSo, why not a CZ SP01 Shadow?  It literally weighs the same and logically is less accurate due to a smaller barrel.\n\nOk, so why not a CZ P01 Phantom, its only 800 grams?!  It is an ideal gun again for carry because of the lesser length barrel; however, this thing still attracted me to where I wanted to do a marriage of the TS with Phantom till I saw that its frame has small rail sections rather than full rail.  So much for love.\n \nWhats next?  The firing report/result.  I am awaiting recoil springs; should be here in a few days.  What do I expect?  I am expecting a more tighter snappier recoil which feels less when shooting due to low reciprocating mass.  The subject of lighter verses heavier guns is debatable; but having already experienced excellent results from my Glock 34 I know this should be the same.  Here is something below I found on the internet and have copy/pasted below.\n \n[B]Effects of a lighter spring:[/B]\n- Recoil is transferred to the shooter in a shorter duration of time because the slide is moving at a higher velocity.  This is often perceived as less recoil and reduced muzzle flip.\n- With a lighter spring the shooter also has less force to counteract, or you don’t have to work as hard.  This usually reduces muzzle flip.\n- Less force to counteract reduces the odds of producing a limp wrist style jam.\n- A lighter spring will result is reduced muzzle dip when the slide closes keeping sights steadier and on target for a faster follow-up shot.\n- Light springs are particularly helpful to smaller shooters like children, women or anyone else having trouble keeping their wrists locked. \n \n[B]Effects of a Heavier spring:[/B]\n- Recoil is transferred to the shooter over a longer duration of time due to lower slide velocities.\n- Slower slides equal a longer recovery time for the shooter.\n- The shooter does more work, as there is more force to counteract.  This often causes and increase in muzzle flip.\n- The chances of a limp wrist style jam are increased, as there is more force working to unlock your wrists.\n- The chance of the slide short stroking and causing a feed jam is increased.\n- Increased muzzle dip when the slide closes for a slower follow-up shot. \n \nWhat?  You guys wanna see the pics?  You all will, I want you all read my blabbering first... also its taking too long to upload the photos into Photobucket.\n\n[COLOR=#000000][FONT=Verdana][SIZE=4][IMG]http://i1109.photobucket.com/albums/h427/pyramids99/CZ-Before.jpg[/IMG][/SIZE][/FONT][/COLOR]\n[COLOR=#000000][FONT=Verdana][SIZE=4][IMG]http://i1109.photobucket.com/albums/h427/pyramids99/CZ-After.jpg[/IMG]\n[IMG]http://i1109.photobucket.com/albums/h427/pyramids99/e316be69-1af7-4af3-aa0d-0217535058fb.jpg[/IMG]\n[IMG]http://i1109.photobucket.com/albums/h427/pyramids99/97f6b8fa-280a-4f83-ac27-57e69f6fd1a8.jpg[/IMG]\n[/SIZE][SIZE=4][IMG]http://i1109.photobucket.com/albums/h427/pyramids99/fdb4ead3-a8a6-406c-b29f-741c2397e0bc.jpg[/IMG][/SIZE]\n[IMG]http://i1109.photobucket.com/albums/h427/pyramids99/723e2863-497d-4a5e-aa3b-e70400df552d.jpg[/IMG]\n[IMG]http://i1109.photobucket.com/albums/h427/pyramids99/e3b2b46a-4b0f-470f-a003-aeecdd40f842.jpg[/IMG]\n[IMG]http://i1109.photobucket.com/albums/h427/pyramids99/9af5e30a-f605-4da9-a715-cf51c2d17c9b.jpg[/IMG]\n[IMG]http://i1109.photobucket.com/albums/h427/pyramids99/dec9d635-f33a-434d-8901-1ccd513f963e.jpg[/IMG]\n[IMG]http://i1109.photobucket.com/albums/h427/pyramids99/e4f814ec-52e3-4a94-bb22-7016bbb1dc7c.jpg[/IMG]\n[/FONT][/COLOR]', 1, 1, '203.82.58.122', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

It will take its time to evolve and re-evolve before it can be safely trusted. It has been designed positively but lacks quality control and most importantly extensive R&D. Anyone buying a Caracal now or IMHO 3-5 years down the road is to be considered an early adopter. You see, a gun takes much much more than just "fancy specs" like computer manufacturers who get everything (researched and tested) from Intel, AMD, WD, Seagate, Foxconn, Asus, Gigabyte etc etc etc.\nGun making involves a host of factors from the team of designers/engineers to the machinery/tools used in the process, from Research and Development as per todays standards/tomorrow''s requirements to metallurgy involved. So and so forth.\nNames like Glock, HK, Sig, Colt, Walther and Browning etc etc didn''t become instant hits overnight (though some were lucky right from the first step they took).

Not only regarding scope selection but also with that particular post of yours.\r\n\r\nYou answered because Leon bro asked you about scope selection for his CZ-455 standard. Leon needed it for the purpose of hunting. He also mentioned some scopes which he came across while searching and was not fully aware of their advantages and disadvantages for the purpose he intend to use it.\r\n\r\nYou took some time, contacted manufacturers and inquired them about those particular products. And then came out your advise for Leon. You gave some information mainly about their light transmission factor along with field of view and also compared those products in these catagories. In the end you simply went for better brand among them.\r\n\r\nMy concernes are,\r\n\r\n1-        Why didn''t you came out with some extra meaningful answer as Leon only required some hunting scope for his .22lr. You definitely narrowed Leon''s options for just sticking in only those three specific scopes. Although you knew for sure that Leon can get much better scope than those three.\r\n\r\n2-        You only went for specifications and points which are written in their brouchers and not touch those issues which company would not want to write like their disadvantages in the field. If brouchers are every thing then it is an easy job for everbody to obtain it and why ask experties.\r\n\r\n3-        Your post is written in formal way. I am sure there is plenty of material available on the internet on any issue. Purpose of this forum dies if we don''t share our personal views and experiences informally.  \r\n\r\nI know for sure in the field Leon would definitly experience lack of magnification. For example when he will be in a situation like this, He would want to take a shot on duck at 120yards landing just farther to the decoys and in this situation only about 30% of the body will be visible in the rivers of Pakistan. And at this point he would want a head shot but his scope magnification will prevent him from doing it.\r\n\r\nI also think that range adjustable scope with easy turret control would take him to the new heights of sport shooting with .22 Long Rifle. In doing that he would also need a Rangefinder along with .22lr, good scope and proper ammunition.\r\n\r\nI thing my post is also getting long and I don''t want to getting you bored more.

Took a while so went and bought a dremmel with polishers etc. Now the bullet moves very smooth into the barrel, even the HPs. And it fires the federal & American Eagle HP crap ammo too without any FTF & FTE. Will strip it again and completely remove the gap between slider and barrel (all with dremmel this time for precise and balanced finish) so it will be polished all the way as most barrels are. That should completely eliminate any future FTF(feed) due to this shortcoming on feed and barrel mouth design by German engineering. I am very surprised that they released a product with such issues - Germans, along with Japanese are best in engineering top quality products. They did, however, fix many things the older model required fixing (from P22 bible) though so left them as is.\n\nMade some other modifications too, specific ones being the trigger slider mechanism''s rectangular frame that has sharp edges and scratches the polymer (as it did within first 7 rounds), and rounding the hammer edges. One left to do is polishing the striker pin as .22lr is mostly black powder and a filthy round that clogs the striker pin slider over time, causing FT fire. Will do the pin polishing later to take very very fine layer off both flat sides.\n\nI''m assuming you''ve not done any internal mods?\n\nAnd why not a SS or hard chromed nut for the barrel as more and more bluing is coming off when removing it :tsk:\n\nOriginal laser to purchase now. Lahore buksh elahi have them but they are asking 4k than my local dealer can source - original is made in China. Peshawar dealers, I wonder, if any stock them.

Barrel bluing has already been removed, a long while back. So that will definitely need to be hard chromed to stop rust. Hard chroming is the best solution for scratch & permanent rust resistance, polishes to mirror shine and it will out last the life of the gun.\n\nDealer says not to as serial number markings will disappear and it will reduce the value. Value I''m not bothered about but legality I am, especially as its a daily CCW. Is it legal to change serial number placing on a gun in PK as I''d prefer to hide these numbers out of site for them not to be copied and used on another pistol for illegal purposes.

Handguns in particular are very, very restricted and difficult to own.\n\nThe laws over here are complex, but for rifles, we are allowed most calibers, but no automatics or semi automatics except .22LR and .22WMR. \n\nWe can also reload our own ammunition, again with some restrictions..\n\nWhen not in use, all firearms and ammunition must be stored in steel security cabinet.\n\nFor deer hunting (we call it stalking), we mostly use bolt action rifles in calibres like .243win, 6.5x55mm, .308win and .270win. \n\nThere are no additional licenses needed to hunt deer, you just need permission off the landowner who''s land the deer are on. There is commercial hunting, but many hunters form a small group and try to lease the hunting rights on a forest or farm ect as it works out cheaper that way.\n\nWe also have a small number of feral goats in the mountains and a small but growing population of Wild Boar..\n\nThere is also a lot of bird shooting using shotguns ie pheasants, grouse, pigeons ect but I do not do that.\n\nFinally we can hunt small game such as rabbits fox and hares. These are hunted with either rifles or shotguns, while some people hunt rabbits with airguns, by ferreting, or with dogs..\n\nRegards,\n\nPeter', 1, 0, '193.113.57.163', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

Took a while so went and bought a dremmel with polishers etc. Now the bullet moves very smooth into the barrel, even the HPs. And it fires the federal & American Eagle HP crap ammo too without any FTF & FTE. Will strip it again and completely remove the gap between slider and barrel (all with dremmel this time for precise and balanced finish) so it will be polished all the way as most barrels are. That should completely eliminate any future FTF(feed) due to this shortcoming on feed and barrel mouth design by German engineering. I am very surprised that they released a product with such issues - Germans, along with Japanese are best in engineering top quality products. They did, however, fix many things the older model required fixing (from P22 bible) though so left them as is.\n\nMade some other modifications too, specific ones being the trigger slider mechanism''s rectangular frame that has sharp edges and scratches the polymer (as it did within first 7 rounds), and rounding the hammer edges. One left to do is polishing the striker pin as .22lr is mostly black powder and a filthy round that clogs the striker pin slider over time, causing FT fire. Will do the pin polishing later to take very very fine layer off both flat sides.\n\nI''m assuming you''ve not done any internal mods?\n\nAnd why not a SS or hard chromed nut for the barrel as more and more bluing is coming off when removing it :tsk:\n\nOriginal laser to purchase now.

Can performance be improved with this combination?  The answer - yes . Assumption here is that your shooting skill does not vary from one shot to the next.  You ask - how ? Read on.\n \nWeight of 22LR ammunition can vary from one cartridge to the next cartridge coming out of the same box. This is due to manufacturing tolerances.  Inconsistency of weight may be due to the bullet, propellant (powder), brass cartridge, primer coating or combination of these parts. These variations can change the velocity from one cartridge to the next cartridge.  This velocity variation is the culprit of inconstant results from one shot to the next shot.\n \nTarget ammunition manufacturing processes customarily are held to closer tolerances than the ordinary garden-variety 22LR ammunition. Buying expensive target ammunition is no assurance that such ammunition will provide better accuracy over common variety of ammunition. See my prior post on this topic that is referenced below.\n \nSince bullet weight the heaviest part in a 22LR cartridge, it lends itself to biggest weight variation of all components that make up a cartridge. The design of the 22LR cartridge is such that we can not take out bullets from the cartridges in order to determine their weights and in turn sort them by weight. The next best thing is to weigh the cartridges and sort them by weight. Cartridges of same weight will tend to give similar and more consistent results.     \n                                                                                  \nSmall Chinese-made digital scales are ideal for sorting 22LR ammo. They are small enough to put in shirt pockets. At this end they cost about $10. They are readily available on eBay from sources in China and Taiwan. You can share the purchase with friend to cut down your out-pocket outlay.  \n \nRelated posts:\n#7 22LR - Sorting Ammo by Weight\n#19 22LR - Which 22LR Ammo is Best?\n#27 22LR - You Discovered Best 22LR Ammo - Really?\n#226 22LR - Cheap Ammo Beat Expensive Brands\n#233 22LR - Minimizing &#8220;Flyer&#8221; Shots\n#274 22LR - Ammunition Variability\n#294 22LR - Accuracy Really Elusive?\n#448 22LR - Exchanging Gifts & 22 Long Rifle Ammo\n#499 22LR - Improve Your Ammunition\n#525 22LR - Higher Price Ammo Assure Higher Accuracy?', 1, 1, '75.140.10.210', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

I used S&B magnum 12x76 (54 grams) in VEPR but for HD as  I used to load/unload quite often (sometimes not with very quick and hard bolting) thus after few times the round would get jammed during first loading; due to twisted front end of round (see pic right side 3 rounds). My experience suggests NOT to reload round say more than 2 to three times. One reason for bad front of round is due to the fact that S&B round does not has perfect circle shape and has relatively softer edges thus higher chances of causing it to jam while bolting thus causing the front end to become sort of damaged!\nI read somewhere (trying to find again the webpage) that use perfect circular shape round for VEPR and not like that of S&B! The S&B 12x7 (54grms) round to me has a shape of octagon and not a perfect circular shape! Today I bought LG/SG (extreme left white) of Shaheen, SG of UK (mid) and slug (turkish) at top most white.

I tried (loading & unloading operation without any fire) for the first time in my VEPR-12 Turkish Slug and SG (Shaheen and UK made). No jams encountered so far! Summary:\n1. In past I had jams during loading the first round into barrel (was using S&B, 12x76, 54 grms, Magnum). Slow loading (bolting) seems one reason that caused jam. One has to be cruel in loading :) i.e. load with great speed and force - Dr_Gilani do not forget it is the VEPR the beast - NO mercy! :)\n\n2. As discussed in previous post the shape of S&B Vs (Slug and SG). My honest opinion is that you can live without a perfect circular shape (like S&B) BUT probability of failure to jam during first loading would increase, especially if the same round is loaded for 2nd, 3rd or more time. However, the perfect round shapes like I showed for Slug and SG/LG are MUCH more better and very low probability of failure.\n\n3. \n(a) I first loaded one Mag with all 8 Turkish slug - did loading/unloading operation of ALL 8 without any issue at all - it was indeed like a breeze!\n(b) Then I loaded 2nd Mag with all 8 Shaheen LG/SG rounds- did loading/unloading operation of ALL 8 without any issue at all - it was indeed smooth!\n(c) Then I loaded empty Mag with all 8 UK SG rounds- did loading/unloading operation of ALL 8. There came an issue of JAM BUT ALL my fault as I again became soft hearted by not pulling all the way with great force!!! Apologies! re-did with 8 rounds at speed - it was indeed smooth!\n(d) Then I put mix of rounds with loading into Mag in following manner:\n 1st Slug, 2nd LG/SG, 3rd Slug, 4th SG, 5th Slug, 6th LG/SG, 7th Slug, 8th SG.\n8th is the top most round that will first go into chamber\n\nSlug = Turkish slug\nLG/SG = Shaheen LG/SG\nSG = UK SG\n\nAll of them in this mixed form were loaded and ejected without any issue at all.\n\n4. Future action: I will IA in few days would fire the above Mag loaded with mix of rounds (Slug, LG/SG & SG) and will come back with report.

This has a green LED and the advertising states it has a 300m beam that is allows shooting out to 200m to 250m. \n\nIn reality, I found out to 40m, it was about perfect, but between 40m and 75m, I found it "questionable" on rabbits at least. Beyond 100m, I don''t think it would be useable at all on anything as small as a rabbit. \n\nAs I want this for shooting rabbits with .22LR subsonics, its touch and go whether I will keep it. \n\nI like the green LED as it seems to work well and the mount to attach it to the scope is well thought out and fully adjustable...The main plus point for me is that the stock mounted switch is a proper "click on/click off" type, not a momentary switch which requires constant pressure to keep it on, which what you usually get on these type of torches over here.\n\nBelow is a few of last nights haul. I lost a couple in the darkness and the farmer kept a couple more back to bait his fox traps..All in all an enjoyable walk around...\n\n[IMG]http://i97.photobucket.com/albums/l237/PeteUK24/22lrrabbitting_zps3a3d926d.jpg[/IMG]', 1, 0, '109.158.60.158', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

Of course, the hunting was largely restricted to the sahibs and the upper class/wealth locals, and I agree that was not fair.\n\nHowever, if you knew what it was like in the UK at the time, the system was exactly the same. \n\nHunting and shooting were largely confined to the weathly and was not really available to working people like myself.\n\nI would venture that most of the wildlife in India and Pakistan that has became very scarce has done so in recent years, long after the British left, and that is because there was too much uncontrolled hunting and poaching.\n\nSo what is a fair system? \n\nPerhaps it is like the Americans have where game populations are conserved and monitored, and then each local State makes available a number of "tags"  at reasonable cost to hunt the surplus. \n\nFor a hunter to be able to hunt, he must pay a small fee and go in a "drawing" for a tag. If he is lucky, his name will be drawn and he can hunt for a deer or a bear or what have you. \n\nIf you wish to hunt a common game animal such as deer, these tags are often available to be bought at local sporting good stores, but the hunter is severely restricted how many he can buy so that lots of people get a chance to hunt.\n\nThe money from the tags goes back towards conserving the game animals and their habitat..\n\nTo me this seems a very fair system was it matters not whether you are rich or poor, or whether you are black or white, everybody has the same chance to hunt, but game populations are kept healthy..\n\nI hope this post does not offend, as it is not meant to, and I hope the moderators see this as a discussion on "game conservation" not politics..:):)\n\nRegards,\n\nPeter', 1, 0, '109.158.60.158', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0);

(380936, 11838, 0, 'zainulabdeen', 4926, 'The Sowing Season and the breach', 1375642468, 'This is the season of sowing the paddy crop. This season comes in the  time when the people of this agrarian society mostly are out of their  savings. They exhaust their savings they earn from the previous / last  year’s paddy crop up to this time and mostly they subsist on either  loans the take from their landlords or the merchants they know usually  from decades and in some cases, from generations. The traders /  merchants also know the tradition and lend them food articles, clothes  and even money in case of emergency as they get it back with interest,  when these poor farmers market the fresh crop of paddy in the end of  this year or in the start of New Year. The farmers used to transplant  their crop nearly 60 days earlier in good days (nearly 15 years ago) but  the acute and intensifying shortage of agricultural water has compelled  them to change their sowing timings. This radical change in sowing  schedule had profound effects on choices of the breeds of the seeds they  use to sow. The local / traditional, and low yield breeds of Rice,  which still remain un-surpassed in fragrance and taste could not compete  the genetically engineered hybrid breeds of rice and nearly have gone  extinct. My late grandfather often mentioned    local breeds of rice  called “ Kangro” and “Sugdasi” which are  nowhere to be seen now.   “Sugdasi” rice were phenomenal with regard to their taste and fragrance.  Many of the old timers tell that if only one house had ever cooked  “Sugdasi” Rice in their home, the fragrance was enough to tell entire  village that they are going to have Sugdasi in their meal today. The  qualities of proverbial/ legendry taste and fragrance were not enough to  keeps “Sugdasi” in the list of alive, vibrant and thriving breeds  in  the teeth of cruel competition of survival . Their slow growth and low  per acre yield average was over come by new and genetically engineered  breeds which possess the capability of rapid growth and high yield to  feed the increasing number mouths of growing population and their  fragrance lost the attraction of farmers before smell of fresh currency  notes. Resultantly they are now found only in the memories of old and  infirm people and the pages of history.   Sugdasi rice were succeeded by  famous “Basmati” rice , but those who ate “ Sugdasi” do not consider  “Basmati” to even near to them in any aspect\nThe new Hybrid breeds of rice need less time in getting ready to be  harvested, they also yield more and thus bring more money home but they  can not be used as seeds because they are genetically encoded not to  germinate again. In this way, farmers have to look at the seed supplying  agencies for growing new crop. By this way, the farmers are gradually  loosing their autonomy on their livelihood. It is a very dangerous  situation because there is no proper mechanism to ensure proper  procurement and provision of the seeds to farmers if something should go  wrong. I am one of very few  landlords who make a less beneficial  decision to allocate a considerable area to be sown by non-hybrid seeds  just to retain some of the traditional breeds and my ability to seed my  lands at my own will. But some times, the increasing pressure from the  tenants, owning to their needs and increasing inflation, tumbles my  stance for few moments too. Shall my son continue my legacy of  preservation of local breeds after my eyes are closed?. Who knows?.\nIn this season, the non perennial canals flow to provide water to the  fields. This is termed as the ideal season to take long due “Revenge”  also. The flowing canals solve the problem of disposing off the dead  body of slain enemy. The water also hastens the decomposition process  and identification marks are quickly lost with the additional help of  scavengers living in wet and dry atmosphere. Many featureless bodies  found their eternal abodes under the status of un-identified bodies  where no body comes to say prayers or shed tears ever. But some times to  kill is not the only way to vent the enmity. Some more cunning persons  choose the method of drying up the sources of earning of their opponents  and cause breaches of canals to let the water flow in the fields, farms  and houses of their adversaries to cause them damage they can’t recover  at least till the next crop. Such a mischief is usually followed by an  armed assault on financially broken enemy after few months on a suitable  time. Since my present assignment also include the rescue and relief  work, thus , few days back I was phoned by the locals of my jurisdiction  informing me about a breach in canal which they alleged to be caused by  their opponents. They also complained about the non-responsive attitude  from local irrigation authorities when they were requested to fill up  the breach to avert further loss. \nI immediately talked to higher irrigation authorities to reduce the  discharge to drop the water level and then contacted local the  irrigation authorities and they were reluctant to go to area being  volatile and residents having a history of assaulting the authorities,  yet I managed to get a contingent of Police to escort them to the scene  but they only dared to venture only when I accompanied them to the site   \n\n\nThe team of Irrigation used the traditional and time tested method to  fill up the breach. They advanced in the breach while making up a  structure of wood/ bamboos with ropes. This structure was subsequently  supported by sand / earth bags and in last the tractors were used to  fill-up the embankments.  \n\nThe width of breach\n[IMG]http://imageshack.us/a/img829/6565/0kpn.jpg[/IMG]\n \nThe evacuation \n\n[IMG]http://imageshack.us/a/img7/7589/l5xm.jpg[/IMG]\n\nThe damage to the transplanted crop\n\n[IMG]http://imageshack.us/a/img10/2893/fyu5.jpg[/IMG]\n\nThe work in progress\n\n[IMG]http://imageshack.us/a/img534/972/h9tx.jpg[/IMG]\n\n[IMG]http://imageshack.us/a/img547/9678/1gyh.jpg[/IMG]\n\n[IMG]http://imageshack.us/a/img11/7373/z1yr.jpg[/IMG]\n\n[IMG]http://imageshack.us/a/img11/7373/z1yr.jpg[/IMG]\n\n\nI was fasting during this exercise and temperature was above 45 degree centigrade .', 1, 0, '182.179.80.163', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

Therefore I require a Subcompact Pistol that would easily fit in an Ankle Holster. My budget is around 70-80k.

I could clearly see that this type of setup would definately cause some sort of resistance to HP rounds as they are not fully rounded from the tip. any edged bullet would definately get some sort of resistance as the bullet has to ride up the feed ramp and hop over the empty space then into the seperate barrel. if the feed ramp would be integrated it would definately be a one smooth (fluid) motion. but then again, in a rotating lock mechanism u just cant have an integrated feed ramp. so I took the gun apart and placed a HP bullet (courtesy of Dr. Zakir) on the feed ramp (mimicking a round feed) and slowly started pushing it towards the barrel. guess what? I clearly felt resistance as the sharp angle of the HP round would get sorta stuck in the space between the feed ramp and barrel.[/COLOR]\n\n[COLOR=#000000]went to a friend of mine who also own a CF98 and same thing happened in his gun as well. I guess that settles the argument that only my CF98 is incompatible with HP rounds.[/COLOR]\n\n[COLOR=#000000]now, after all this I thought of stoeger and upon seeing its pictures on internet I believe that a stoeger would also be incompatible with HP rounds as it also has a very similar design and feed ramp is also not integrated into the barrel. its feed ramp is also built into the rotating lock. the images clearly showed same space between the feed ramp and the barrel. I''m assuming that since everything from the design point looks the same I guess it would also pose similar reliability issues with HP. however stoeger owners/users can confirm on that.[/COLOR]\n\n[COLOR=#000000]now comming to the main point. what can we do to solve this issue. i''m thinking highly polishing the feed ramp to improve feeding. i''ll get back with results as soon as I get that donw. but i''m also thinking that there is nothing I can do with the two piece feed ramp and barrel design"[/COLOR][/I][/FONT][/SIZE]', 1, 0, '119.157.213.121', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

Yesterday I met up with Umair bhai and he opened up my 54, turned out it was already repaired at the point where the rod goes into the piston.\r\n\r\n3 holes had been drilled in the indents in the piston where the rod is fixed, and screws were hammered into the holes to hold the rod. maybe because of mis-handling on my part, one of the screws had loosened and caused the rod to jump out. thankfully the screw stayed inside the hole otherwise the cylinder would have been ''screwed''.\r\n\r\nthis was a major failure and I was looking at the prospect of ordering a new piston from USA and waiting for a month or so for it to arrive.\r\n\r\njust so happened that Umair bhai had a friend''s diana 54 piston with him, as he had replace it with a vortek kit. he put the almost new piston in my gun and viola............. I was in business just 2 hours after meeting a complete stranger. I got a new piston, lube/tune, and trigger setting, all from a few calls using this forum.\r\n\r\nMy only regret is that the seller should have informed that the gun had been thru a major failure and repaired. the repair work was really really bad. small marks all over the piston head, piston seal was  ''cooked'' because of improper lubing, breech seal needs replacing, and there was a small mark outside the cylinder which had caused a small raised portion inside the cylinder. Umair bhai polished it and says it will not cause any performance issue, but it speaks volumes about how the gun was mis-handled during repair work.\r\n\r\nBut alhamdulillah, alls well that ends well. I am deeply indebted to Umair, don''t have words to thank him. now i will have to learn to shoot it......................\r\n\r\nFinally some pics.[/QUOTE]\r\n\r\nThis is my hobby. Keep shooting for at least 100 pellets and then give me the feedback. The trigger of your gun has been adjusted just as its a match trigger with very predictable and crisp break of 2nd stage and the 2nd stage breaks very light to keep on the target.\r\nI just advise not to give this keeper gun to anyone for use. Also arrange spare spring, breech seal and piston seal as replacement parts so that if any such part goes south ever, you will have replacement part at hand.\r\nNever apply any oil or grease. Never fire without pellet.\r\nI am quite sure that the area of the chamber which I polished will not create any problem but if it created any problem, we can get it honed and the chamber will become just like its new.\r\nIt was a very nice meeting you Faraz Bhai.\r\nIt was just your luck that the replacement part was already with me and hence your gun came back to life in just a couple of hours. It''s been properly lube tuned, sled adjusted and trigger adjusted and the cocking rod adjusted.\r\n\r\nI hope you will enjoy and love this gun.\r\n\r\nHappy shooting.', 1, 0, '202.69.11.18', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

So when Corbett or others came across a tiger that appeared to be very brave or determined to attack them, it was likely to be the maneater. \n\nCorbett and others often found that Maneaters would not take baits such as cows which had been tied out and down often walk right by the baits prefering to look for a human. \n\nSo all these things, and many more, were clues that allowed Corbett to work out which tiger he should be after..\n\nRegards,\n\nPeter', 1, 0, '109.155.200.248', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

Back in the 1800s, this configuration was called a "Paradox gun."  The Wikipedia entry says it was invented by Holland & Holland for dangerous game riles, though I believe it predates that be a couple of decades.\n\n Also, note that ordinary smoothbore shotgun barrels can often give useful accuracy when shooting slugs.  There are many configurations of slugs, most of them of the "chunk of lead going down the barrel" type; others with elaborate plastic cups to center the slug and keep it straight while it goes down the barrel.\n\n Various vendors sell brass 12ga shells, but if there are no legal restrictions for you, you can use fireformed .50 BMG brass.  Many shotguns have enough extractor travel to grab the BMG case and pull it out of the chamber.  Some people turn the head of the BMG case down and glue or solder a brass shotgun shell rim on.\n\n The BMG brass is long enough you can use a proper bullet, depending on your chamber and barrel diameter.  For a century or so there were no real standards for shotgun shells and chambers.  Now there are standards, but nobody pays much attention to them, and nobody cares, as long as all shells will fit and fire in all shotguns.  But sometimes that winds up being a very sloppy fit. \n\n Shotgun shells get longer after they''re fired, so the breech is long enough for the fired shells to eject properly.  If you''re loading cast bullets into brass cases, you have to be careful not go get the overall length of the cartridge (once it''s a brass case with a bullet, it''s a "cartridge" to me...) get so long that it won''t feed up from the magazine.

It seems that as long as there have been firearms, the debate  on proper maintenance techniques has raged on.  Staunch believers on  both sides of the fence have strong opinions about which products are  the best to protect their investment and keep their guns in perfect  working condition.\n\n[URL="http://wd40.com/news/in-the-news/Brands/wd40.cfm"]WD-40[/URL]  has been used in the gun industry for many years.  It is not only safe  to use on your gun, but comes highly recommended by many experts in the  industry due to its cleaning, rust preventing, moisture displacing,  penetrating and lubricating properties.\n\nJoe Singleton, owner of Singleton’s Gun Shop in Dix, Neb., is a 20-year  veteran of the industry.  Singleton has been recommending WD-40 for as long as he can remember.  "I use WD-40  as a cleaner.  Its penetrating qualities help break down powder  residues and clean out the build-up that inevitably forms in a firearm  after use.  This build-up could lead to jamming or misfiring, so I use  the multi-purpose product to remove all traces."\n\nOther professionals swear by the product for use in firearms  restoration, cleaning and preventive maintenance.  Brodie Gratiot,  manager of Sievert’s Enterprises Ltd., in Pueblo, Co., the largest  stocking gun dealer in the eight Rocky Mountain states, finds many uses  for the product in restoring guns that come into his gun shop.\n\n"When faced with a rusted gun, we spray it down with WD-40,  let it sit for 24 hours, spray it again, and wipe off the rust  deposits," said Gratiot.  "This also works with deep pitted rust, we use  a toothbrush and WD-40 to remove the deep-set rust  deposits from the pitting without marring the finish."  After gun  handling and restoration, all surfaces are wiped with a rag sprayed with  WD-40 to prevent rust caused by skin oil and salt.\n\nDuring late elk and deer season, Gratiot recommends applying a light coating of WD-40 to the bolt, firing pin and trigger mechanism to displace moisture and prevent freezing in sub-zero temperatures.\n\nMaster gunsmith Jose Somarriba of Miami, Fla., uses WD-40  both on the equipment in his shop and to maintain firearms.  Somarriba  uses the product after the bluing process and on shop milling and  grinding machines.  After using a bore solvent agent to remove fouling  he applies WD-40 to prevent rust and to lubricate the barrel.\n\nIn addition to the professionals, avid outdoorsmen like Tim Karpf of Killingsworth, Conn., uses WD-40  to protect recreational equipment from the elements: salt water spray,  rain and snow.  Karpf uses the multi-purpose product to protect exposed  metal parts and to protect the bluing.\n\nAs for the weekend sportsman, everyone knows that the proper care and  upkeep of your expensive equipment makes all the difference in its  longevity and performance.  "After using a solvent to clean the barrel, I  always make a final pass with WD-40 to protect and preserve both the interior and exterior of the barrel," declared Karpf.\n\nIf you would like to share your professional tip for using WD-40 for gun maintenance, please write to:\n \n[LIST] The WD-40 Company \n    P.O.

I''ve reached a few conclusions which are purely my personal opinions about the Caracal (the company and weapon itself). While these points may not be the turning points for most of you, but I hope it will bear some effect in your decision making. Please bear with me.\n\n1. The gun owning and loving community has rapidly grown after 2001 specially after rise in crimes and disturbance in security situation in the country. But the the hot trend of reading reviews and researching over the internet for hours has sped up after 2005. As a result of which the average customer is now more aware of pros and cons of a product and in most of the cases is knowledgeable enough to decide himself. \n\n2. Customers who own a single piece have multiplied and so have the enthusiasts with reasonably large collections. More Security Companies have evolved and grown in size. By the way, the same has happened to computers in the IT field. The gun making industry which is booming since the beginning of time and will continue to do so is now aggressively battling for market shares. China too, has expanded beyond the good old TT to modern and yet affordable CF series, NP series reaching out to the masses. By the way, I remember CF-98 being sold for 24K in 2008. \n\n3. Now, please try to understand that as a whole gun market of Turkey and China has helped a lot in bringing down prices but particular models with a lesser price tag does not necessarily mean that the product is cheap because of labour and shipment and less bells and whistles and blah blah blah. No sir! The first corner the manufacturer will cut is with the Research & Development. Doing away with this department is almost reducing your overall costs into half. The S/Cougar is a perfect example. Produce a handgun where the labour is cheap, metallurgical process is cheap, own a subsidiary company, no R&D involved.

I''ll say, guides rods are not designed to take enormous amounts of pressure to begin with therefore there is no need for a heavy, solid metal guide rod. Baikal''s slim guide rod is designed (IMHO) in such a way to reduce the chances of spring buckling under load during cycling, possibly increasing reliability. which is a big time plus in my books.\r\n\r\nmoving on, Baikal''s trigger is the best in its class. no need to discuss it any further.\r\n\r\nmoving on again, Baikal''s chamber clearly speaks that its designed to fire something NASTY. barrel on the other hand is nothing out of the ordinary. infact, if you compare wall thicknesses of various 9mm handguns, you''ll find Baikal MP446s barrel to be quiet thin compared to others.\r\n\r\n[B]CZ 999 Scorpion:[/B]\r\n\r\na time proven design that has faced the most "hard to impress" consumers and lived to tell the tale, The U.S. consumers.\r\n\r\na design that has seen war/conflict. the hardest of any tests. undergone changes afterwards. stating that the product matured or incorporated the lessons learned.\r\n\r\nThe hammer forged barrel of the CZ 999 Scorpion is thicker than Baikal MP446 Viking. after measuring both with a vernier caliper, I welcome anybody to reject my statement. another plus, it is chrome-lined from inside and outside whereas Baikal''s barrel is chromed lined from inside only.\r\n\r\nThe rifling on CZ 999 Scorpion is deeper and more profound compared to Viking. I do not know what it means but I would rather have deep rifling. kinda gives an impression to me that such a barrel would have longer life. but thats only my guestimation. your mileage may vary.\r\n\r\nWhen it comes to handguns, barrel isn''t everything. frames are a big variable as well. Baikal''s frame is polymer reinforced with steel insert. so its steel on steel whereas on CZ 999 Scorpion, it is Steel slide on aluminum frame. not the strongest of setup as Steel on Steel will always be better than Steel on Aluminum. plus Polymer is maintenance free, where Aluminum is high maintenance.\r\n\r\nNow coming to controls, Baikal''s trigger is the best in its class but it ends here. there are other controls too. CZ-999 is supplied with an ambidextrous decocker, slide release and magazine release. this is a big time plus in my opinion. whereas baikal''s controls in my opinion are a major turn-off.\r\n\r\n[B]Bottom Line (just my humble opinion, I''m not insisting on anything):[/B]\r\n\r\nIn my humble opinion, Baikal is all about durability whereas CZ 999 scorpion takes into consideration comfort as well. in my opinion, comfort matters a lot. I''m not saying that durability doesn''t. all I''m saying when we go to a store to buy a pair of boots, we buy the ones that are strong and comfy. why don''t we all go and buy something made of all metal/steel? strong as hell but would rip out feet to shreds. so why should firearms be any different.? \r\n\r\nAny tool that we buy should be strong and comfortable as well. strength isn''t everything. otherwise we would all be wearing pants made of HDPE and boots made of fiber reinforced polymer or carbon steel instead of leather. a firearm is a complete package. you just cannot/should not focus on any two/three variables and forget the rest.\r\n\r\nHowever, your mileage may vary. this is just my personal opinion. if you desire durability to a point that comfort isn''t a necessary trait for you then by all means, Baikal is the way to go. there is no doubt about it. from durability standpoint, it is better than any CZ 999 at any given day of the week (no credible evidence, just popular view). however if you desire a more complete package, CZ 999 offers a lot more than just durability so do look into it.\r\n\r\nin my humble and personal opinion you can do a lot more with CZ 999 than what you can do with Baikal from customization/accessory/repair standpoint.\r\n\r\nyou can make your own guide rods, similarly you can replace all major springs with commonly available spring in the market (slight modification may be necessary). you can also get quality Kydex holsters that fit a CZ 999 whereas with a baikal you are limited to cheap nylon holsters. did I mention that you can easily convert inexpensive beretta/sig magazines to CZ 999 Scorpion compatible magazines?\r\n\r\nRegards.', 1, 1, '39.47.239.50', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

A bullet fired from such a barrel forces the projectile a twist motion, similar to that of a gyroscope.  This motion stabilizes the bullet, which in turn leads to better accuracy.\n \nGun enthusiasts often talk about velocities of ammunition. Hardly anyone discusses bullet spin rate. This is primarily due to lack of knowledge how bullet spin rate is computed.  Two factors determine the rate - bullet velocity and the rifling twist ratio. The twist ratio is a factor derived from the number of inches a bullet travels in barrel to complete one revolution. Modern day 22LR rifle manufacturers have adapted the 1:16 ratio. That is to say, a bullet will travel 16 inches in the barrel in order to complete one revolution. In the 22LR arena, twist ratios of 1:9, 1:12 and 1:14 are rare but not unheard of.  Faster twist rate are necessary to stabilize heavier bullets.\n \nAguila 22LR 30-grain Super Magnum has muzzle velocity of 1,750 feet per second. Due to manufacturing methods, manufacturing tolerances and the length of the barrels, we may or may not attain this velocity. For this discussion we will assume that the rated velocity is attained at the muzzle. A velocity of 1,750 feet per second equates to [1,750X12] 21,000 inches per second. At this distance the bullet makes [21,000/16] 1,312.5 revolutions in one second. In one minute the bullet completes [1,312.5X60]78,750 rpm or revolutions per minute. \n \nBear in mind that the spin rate will change as the bullet travels down range with ever decreasing velocity. In dry air [temp 20C] the speed of sound is 1,125 feet per second or [1,125*12] or 13,5000 inches per second . At a distance of 120 yards the Aguila bullet still retain the speed of sound. At this distance the bullet makes [13,500/16] 843.75 revolutions in one second or [843.75*60] 50,625 rpm or revolutions per minute.\n \nStill father downrange, at a distance of 135 yards Aguila&#8217;s bullet velocity is reduced to 1,080 feet per second or [1,080*12] 12,960 inches per second - the same velocity that a standard velocity 22LR cartridge delivers at the muzzle. At this distance the bullet makes [12,960/16]810 revolutions in one second. In one minute the bullet completes [810*60] 48,600 rpm or revolutions per minute.\n   \n \nRelated Post: \n#15 You & Your Friend Have Two Different Rifles', 1, 1, '75.140.10.210', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

In fact he can save the amount he''ll be flushing down for "trade-in" for ammo and stuff. That way he can enjoy the heck out of it and still be able to sell at a reasonable price later.\n\nI strongly suggest buyers to do their research first, search the Pak Guns site forums for what they are looking for, ask questions here and when satisfied should go and purchase a weapon. But once purchased, I''d request the buyer not to look back unless he meets persistent malfunction(s) / issues AND other members not to comment like "You should have bought that, That one is better than this one and blah blah". Guys please don''t hate me for this, I know, its a public forum open to views (of course within the guidelines of the site) but trust me a lot of us go back, trade-in a recently purchased weapon with the one that''s touted about and in the process lose quite some $$$$$ (please note the number of $).

If the tow trolley is to remain standing for days in field or in garage, then I would suggest adding two jacks say 1-ton each which are very cheap so that you can lift up the trolley say an inch above ground to save tyres. Tyres will get weak quickly if they remain idle.\n2. Any thoughts to all removable canopy of inexpensive cloth?\n3. Will you paint to protect against rust? I will suggest if no plans.\n4.  I strongly suggest to put brake lights in syn with you Jeep''s brake light, this will be great for your and others safety.\n5. Using tubeless tyres (may be old but not too old) can be good options as they to do not get deflated if punctured.\n6. Put illumination for safety at night that can be hid once in field.\n7. Welds at axle end with wheels must be properly welded. We call it to have it STRUCTURAL WELD not ordinary spot type weld that I see right now in your picture.\n8. A bit of very strong advice!! PLEASE travel very, very slow when towing this trolley at the back of your vehicle. WHY? because it is custom built using least engineering design calculations therefore reliability would be questioned (at least by me :)). It may topple on higher speed, it might loose axle joint under dynamic loading, it may get loose from the connection where it is towed with your jeep, it might slip on turns, it might go out of main direction in transverse direction on bend of roads, it might jump on bumps. Dear bro with no offence at all, these issues that I am hi-lighting only for yours and others safety and NOT for just one or few trips but say over next 10 years or more! Forgive me for being too critical, I hope you will not mind!\n9. Can you post connection details between jeep and this trolley.

I mean, it was my friend&#8217;s old rusted Walther 9mm that I shot for the first time in 1996. Thereafter, came across few opportunities like catching up with friends for some gun time get togethers. Firing any handgun (readied by someone else of course) used to be like a big deal back then, something to brag about in school/college. All handguns felt the same, fired the same, heck, even looked the same. It was in 2003, when I was encouraged by an elder to keep a handgun for SD keeping in view, our traveling to the village and etc. Didn&#8217;t quite pay any heed to the advice to be honest. Many friends and family members would brandish their TTs, 12 bore rifles and AKs endorsing their manhood but I never quite got past the point of keeping a handgun or for that matter anything else that fires a bullet. In other words, guns never impressed me.\nI was more into computers, gadgets and stuff. Yeah people did call me a freaky, burger-type geek. Back in those days, there weren&#8217;t shiny iPhones, iPads and other iStuff to show off and grab attention with.[/FONT][/FONT][FONT=Helvetica Neue Light][FONT=microsoft sans serif]As I correctly recall, on a cool and beautiful overcast day in 2006, having some tea in the lawn when my gun crazy cousin showed up at my doorstep and asked me to accompany him. Well, not having a girlfriend or even a car to take her out on a long drive, going out with this nut was my best bet. We drove to his favourite dealer, Mazhar Alam at Fakhr-e-Alam Arms in Peshawar. An entirely unimpressive cramped shop in the city. I was being tested for my patience at the store as people from all walks of life would come in and go. The terminologies spoken seemed like greek to me. Somehow, I sensed slightly higher degree of respect exhibited by Mazhar Alam towards my cousin. &#8220;Oh well, probably they are good buddies&#8221; is what I thought. We had two cups of Qahva (Green Tea) before my friend&#8217;s handgun was put in front of us. A black plastic box with a handle and a weird logo I couldn&#8217;t make out initially.\nThe box was snapped open and that was the time that I experienced love at first sight. It was a Glock 19. Even despite the fact that I was not even aware of what a Glock was, that gun caught my attention amidst numerous shiny and fancy-to-weird-looking pieces including Taurus and Beretta that were being checked out by other customers.\n[/FONT][/FONT][FONT=Helvetica Neue Light][FONT=microsoft sans serif]We hopped into his car and I immediately grabbed the box from him and started examining the Glock as if a caveman would do with a Zippo lighter. My cousin jokingly warned me &#8220;Careful, thats not for kids AND NERDS to play with&#8221;. I don&#8217;t even remember lifting my head for the rest of our drive back home. The price my cousin revealed was, well, something I thought he was insanely exaggerating. He literally begged me not to tell the price of the handgun to his wife or family. Well, that was something I was good at, &#8220;keeping secrets&#8221;. Few days into the purchase, at home, my computers started catching up dust, the keyboard started getting banged by my kids all over the house and the mouse became a fun toy at my neighbor''s kids room. I started to &#8220;turn&#8221;, bitten by a vampire named [FONT=tahoma][I][B]Glock-ula[/B][/I][/FONT]. And trust me, I was not in love the Glock due to its reputation or brand name. Hell, I had never even heard of it before. Its simplicity, straight lines and different design started to pound my head for many hours during the day before I couldn&#8217;t take it any more.\nSo I decided to go and get a Glock and get over with it. Little did I understand that I&#8217;ll wind up getting a gun rather than getting a Glock (budget woes). Well, it was fine to scratch that itch so long as it was a gun. But my hopes were shattered when the CF-98 was opened up in front of me NIB for a whopping Rupees 24,000/-. Damn, whats all that grease, slush and oil? Mazhar Alam, with his one eye brow raised gave me that look and asked his helper to get it cleaned up and ready. I could even hear him swearing at me in his heart. After many minutes of wait and only one Qahva (no complaint, I was a CF-98 customer and its natural), the CF-98 was brought in cleaned and I quickly got over the dejection of not being able to afford a Glock. And before any customer walked in asking for a Glock, I thought it was best to get the hell outa there.\nBut I was happy, after all, this was my very own gun, Norinco CF-98. It stayed with me for a year before that itch came up again and I traded it in for a Stoeger Cougar. And so the itch continues till this very day.

I mean, it was my friend&#8217;s old rusted Walther 9mm that I shot for the first time in 1996. Thereafter, came across few opportunities like catching up with friends for some gun time get togethers. Firing any handgun (readied by someone else of course) used to be like a big deal back then, something to brag about in school/college. All handguns felt the same, fired the same, heck, even looked the same. It was in 2003, when I was encouraged by an elder to keep a handgun for SD keeping in view, our traveling to the village and etc. Didn&#8217;t quite pay any heed to the advice to be honest. Many friends and family members would brandish their TTs, 12 bore rifles and AKs endorsing their manhood but I never quite got past the point of keeping a handgun or for that matter anything else that fires a bullet. In other words, guns never impressed me.\nI was more into computers, gadgets and stuff. Yeah people did call me a freaky, burger-type geek. Back in those days, there weren&#8217;t shiny iPhones, iPads and other iStuff to show off and grab attention with.[/FONT][/FONT][FONT=Helvetica Neue Light][FONT=microsoft sans serif]As I correctly recall, on a cool and beautiful overcast day in 2006, having some tea in the lawn when my gun crazy cousin showed up at my doorstep and asked me to accompany him. Well, not having a girlfriend or even a car to take her out on a long drive, going out with this nut was my best bet. We drove to his favourite dealer, Mazhar Alam at Fakhr-e-Alam Arms in Peshawar. An entirely unimpressive cramped shop in the city. I was being tested for my patience at the store as people from all walks of life would come in and go. The terminologies spoken seemed like greek to me. Somehow, I sensed slightly higher degree of respect exhibited by Mazhar Alam towards my cousin. &#8220;Oh well, probably they are good buddies&#8221; is what I thought. We had two cups of Qahva (Green Tea) before my friend&#8217;s handgun was put in front of us. A black plastic box with a handle and a weird logo I couldn&#8217;t make out initially.\nThe box was snapped open and that was the time that I experienced love at first sight. It was a Glock 19. Even despite the fact that I was not even aware of what a Glock was, that gun caught my attention amidst numerous shiny and fancy-to-weird-looking pieces including Taurus and Beretta that were being checked out by other customers.\n[/FONT][/FONT][FONT=Helvetica Neue Light][FONT=microsoft sans serif]We hopped into his car and I immediately grabbed the box from him and started examining the Glock as if a caveman would do with a Zippo lighter. My cousin jokingly warned me &#8220;Careful, thats not for kids AND NERDS to play with&#8221;. I don&#8217;t even remember lifting my head for the rest of our drive back home. The price my cousin revealed was, well, something I thought he was insanely exaggerating. He literally begged me not to tell the price of the handgun to his wife or family. Well, that was something I was good at, &#8220;keeping secrets&#8221;. Few days into the purchase, at home, my computers started catching up dust, the keyboard started getting banged by my kids all over the house and the mouse became a fun toy at my neighbor''s kids room. I started to &#8220;turn&#8221;, bitten by a vampire named [FONT=tahoma][I][B]Glock-ula[/B][/I][/FONT]. And trust me, I was not in love the Glock due to its reputation or brand name. Hell, I had never even heard of it before. Its simplicity, straight lines and different design started to pound my head for many hours during the day before I couldn&#8217;t take it any more.\nSo I decided to go and get a Glock and get over with it. Little did I understand that I&#8217;ll wind up getting a gun rather than getting a Glock (budget woes). Well, it was fine to scratch that itch so long as it was a gun. But my hopes were shattered when the CF-98 was opened up in front of me NIB for a whopping Rupees 24,000/-. Damn, whats all that grease, slush and oil? Mazhar Alam, with his one eye brow raised gave me that look and asked his helper to get it cleaned up and ready. I could even hear him swearing at me in his heart. After many minutes of wait and only one Qahva (no complaint, I was a CF-98 customer and its natural), the CF-98 was brought in cleaned and I quickly got over the dejection of not being able to afford a Glock. And before any customer walked in asking for a Glock, I thought it was best to get the hell outa there.\nBut I was happy, after all, this was my very own gun, Norinco CF-98. It stayed with me for a year before that itch came up again and I traded it in for a Stoeger Cougar. And so the itch continues till this very day. By the Grace of Almighty Allah, I have a Glock 17 Gen 4 now. I consider it another blessing from Allah during this month of Ramazan.\n[FONT=tahoma][B][I]I strongly believe Allah grants you what you honestly wish for from the depth of your heart, its just a matter of time.[/I][/B][/FONT][/FONT][/FONT][/SIZE][/COLOR]\n[/LEFT]\n[/QUOTE]', 1, 0, '83.244.186.20', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

For example, People from KPK might not like prawns on their first encounter and people from Karachi might night like Dumba''s laat (fat) on their first experience. But it is some thing developing a taste. People who made them comfortable with suzuki''s cannot see it as a big issue. And this little pain or burden later give them an edge over other 4x4''s in field.\n\nThanks\nThanks.[/QUOTE]\n\n\nhow would 3-6 people be accommodated in a suzuki ?', 1, 1, '39.47.102.170', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

If the tow trolley is to remain standing for days in field or in garage, then I would suggest adding two jacks say 1-ton each which are very cheap so that you can lift up the trolley say an inch above ground to save tyres. Tyres will get weak quickly if they remain idle.\r\n2. Any thoughts to all removable canopy of inexpensive cloth?\r\n3. Will you paint to protect against rust? I will suggest if no plans.\r\n4.  I strongly suggest to put brake lights in syn with you Jeep''s brake light, this will be great for your and others safety.\r\n5. Using tubeless tyres (may be old but not too old) can be good options as they to do not get deflated if punctured.\r\n6. Put illumination for safety at night that can be hid once in field.\r\n7. Welds at axle end with wheels must be properly welded. We call it to have it STRUCTURAL WELD not ordinary spot type weld that I see right now in your picture.\r\n8. A bit of very strong advice!! PLEASE travel very, very slow when towing this trolley at the back of your vehicle. WHY? because it is custom built using least engineering design calculations therefore reliability would be questioned (at least by me :)). It may topple on higher speed, it might loose axle joint under dynamic loading, it may get loose from the connection where it is towed with your jeep, it might slip on turns, it might go out of main direction in transverse direction on bend of roads, it might jump on bumps. Dear bro with no offence at all, these issues that I am hi-lighting only for yours and others safety and NOT for just one or few trips but say over next 10 years or more! Forgive me for being too critical, I hope you will not mind!\r\n9. Can you post connection details between jeep and this trolley. Please also send some more pics of ther joints such as axle to wheel, body to axle and springs etc.\r\nHappy hunting and safe hunting!\r\nRegards[/QUOTE]\r\n\r\nDear Dr Sb.\r\n\r\nThanks for suggestions\r\n\r\ni will follow all suggestions mentioned above, which are realy helpful....tomorrow i will share more picture clear one...\r\n\r\nKind Regards\r\n\r\nKeep in touch..\r\n\r\nOmer', 1, 0, '175.107.58.251', 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

If one is going to compare PT92/99, then compare it with Beretta 92FS that it is a clone of and make the bold statement that it is a better gun than Beretta M9 (military version) or 92FS for that matter. Stoeger is a wholly owned subsidiary of Beretta with Cougar manufacturing unit itself moved from Italy to Turkey whereas Beretta sold the rights, the blueprint and manufacturing equipment of it''s 92FS to Taurus hence PT92/99 were born. Stoeger''s magazines are still manufactured in Italy .... Steoger IS Beretta, and I doubt that Beretta would cut more corners than they do in their parent label guns so metallurgy of SC should be as good as any Beretta out there.

It is my daily CC too, and with a belt holster from Shams Saddlers, I have no issues driving with it on and walked in to many places wearing a t-shirt without guards etc noticing or even stopping for a check so I don''t consider it to be a non-CC for me at least (whereas PT92 is non-CC for me, unless it is tucked in the middle back of the jeans on the inside - [/COLOR][I]odd [/I][I]place for that long frame to be). Yes, SC is on the heavier side compared to any TT for example but it doesn''t take long to get used to CC it.\n\nAs mentioned above about PT92 being a HD (and range) gun, I totally agree hence in the process of replacing it with a 1911 or a .45 as that would be a better HD weapon than a PT92, heck a 30 Cal would be more lethal HD round than a 9mm. As for range, that''s for me to improve on faster draw, faster aim and rapid firing skills for SD purposes only. The PT92 has been in the box since new (test fired a few rounds when purchasing, cleaned and boxed) and I don''t see any reason keeping it anymore especially as I am not into friendly competition range shootings.

My family are originally from Kashmir and so upon a visit there I met with a relative who has a gun shop.  \n\nWhen discussing the issue with him he informed me that it was possible to get me a license in Kashmir for a 9mm. \n\nI paid him 3500 PKR and within about a week and a half I had my license.\n\nI then started looking for a gun I really wanted the CZ P07 Duty in OD Green from Lahore (that was offered here on [url]www.pakguns.com[/url]) but due to time constraints and not having the legal paperwork as I was only on a visit for exactly 1 month this was no longer an option.\n\nSo off I went to visit another dealer through a friend to find a potential gun.  \n\nHe showed me a gun that I had never paid attention to and informed me that if I really had my heart on the CZ then he could not do anything to change my mind.  But, if I was willing to try something else, then maybe he could help!  \n\nSo out came a [B]2012 Baikal MP-446[/B] [B]9mm with two original magazines [/B]that come in the box.  Being new to handguns I noticed that the serial number of the guns was visible on the slide of and on the underside of the gun below the trigger and on each of the two magazine.\n\nWe took it out to a desolate piece of land and the dealer asked me how many bullets I wanted to test through the gun.  \n\nMy friend made it clear to the dealer (his friend) that if we had any problems with the gun over the next year we would being it back to him.  He assured us that if we took care of the gun and maintained it properly, if the gun didn''t function correctly.  He would replace it with another gun (can''t get better than that)\n\nI didn''t have a clue about how many bullets to use as I had never fired anything other than double barrel shotgun.  So I said 10.\n\nHe loaded the bullets in the magazine.  The spring of the magazine was very tough as it had not been fired previously.  \n\nI wanted an CZ and he was convincing me that due to the time that I had left being limited he would not be able to get me the gun of my dreams.\n\nSo here we go.  In to the valley.  We load upon the magazine.  It has a manual safety which can be switched to either side and is has a magazine release which can be switched to either side.  \n\nThe magazines both of them hold 18 bullet in a double stack formation and a raised  raised red loaded chamber indicator.\n\nI let off the first bullet was very surprised at the almost non-existent recoil.  I let off the other 8 bullets slowly and was very suprised at the feel of the gun.\n\nI bought the gun, it cost me 80,000 PKR.  Some may say a little pricey but I really think it is worth it.  Had I been in Pashawar or Lahore or even Karachi I may have paid less.\n\nI will post some photos soon in shaa Allaah.\n\nI the 1 week that I had the gun.  I put no less than 500 bullets through it with not one single misfire.\n\nWhat I did first before taking the gun home was to understand how it was to be cleaned (thoroughly).  And I guess in my very, very limited knowledge this has a lot to do with the gun performing so well.\n\nI only wish my stay had been longer and I could have spent time with my second love (my wife being the first, of course).\n\nBut I look forward to us meeting up again very soon.\n\nP.S.  What did I learn:  "Guns are not a toy so always treat it as if it is loaded and do no point it at anything that you are not prepared to kill!!"\n\nP.P.S. How am I doing with the fun terminology.

The portion of barrel which has an attached ring for assembly with rest of the gun.\n\nEven with my very limited knowledge about firearms it was impossible for me to digest that barrel of shotgun has an ill defined crack. I contacted the dealer and he showed me many other semiautos of Hatsan and everyone of them has this fault more or less.\n\nEven the dealer admitted that barrels are faulty & it was due to strongly attached external metalic ring to the barrel. And they have reported this issue but Hatsan do not care as long as their shotguns are on good sale.\n\nNow gentlemen lets see from this angle, if something external attached to outside of the barrel is causing such a crack on the inside!!!\nwhat does that mean BARREL IS VERY WEAK AT THAT PARTICULAR POINT. plain and simple.\n\nI never gave a second thought and sold the shotgun at 60% price ( just fired 25 shells and bought about one and a half month back ) & purchased Hatsan Aimguard Pump Action. I thoroughly examined the barrels of at least 3 PA Aimguard and they had crystal clear barrels ( as it should be ).\n\nPlz I request you all gentlemen to check the barrels of Hatsan Semiautos particularly if you own one or if you are planning to get one to make sure you do not have a faulty / cracked barrel.\nIn my humble opinion it is not safe to shot even a birdshot from such shotguns.\n\nFeel free to share your thoughts and give your valueable expert opinion\nSeniors are requested to address the issue.\n\nRegards.', 1, 0, '182.189.126.136', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

If you don’t know what a 22LR is, please join the discussion and get in the grove. I have written more than 50 thousand words on this topic on this web site. \n\nThe 22LR [22 Long Rifle] is a rim-fire brass cartridge designed for use in small arms - pistols, revolvers and rifles.  It was invented well over a century ago - in 1887. The utility of the 22LR has stood the test of time. It is the most popular cartridge on earth. More 22LR cartridges are manufactured than all other combined. Best of all, it is the cheapest brass cartridge on the markets everywhere.  Don’t worry about the recoil of the 22LR - it will not kick you like a mule. It is milder than an air rifle. You will be pleasantly surprised to learn that the recoil is barely noticeable.  It is the ideal cartridge for beginners - men women and young adults. I joined the 22LR hobby over sixty years ago. I am still intrigued by this marvel. In this hobby there are two polite words for everyone, including me - safety first. \n\nIf you are interested in target shooting - this cartridge is for you.  You can shoot all day long and not worry about going broke. The 22LR is very popular cartridge on the range. Go to your local gun range and have a practice session.  Rangemasters are friendly folks. Feel free to ask for pointers and guidance. With practice your scores will improve. Don’t be surprised if one day you find yourself entering and winning in shooting competitions.  \n\nIf you are interested in small game hunting, there is no better way than to start with the 22LR. Games like rabbits are not out of reach for distances of 75 yards or more. Get to know the ballistics of this cartridge and you can get an even longer reach.

Everyone just seems to be hell bent on defaming the guns, i would humbly disagree with the common opinion. Most of us have grown up playing with toy guns as kids playing the same chor police game (at least all my friends, cousins etc etc) none of us ended up as a gun brandishing  terrorist or psycho killer or target killer, but some of them did end up in the armed forces. So i think its all about the perspective with which you look at a thing, i would say it was a good game. The writer has also referred to the NGO which believes that guns are the reason of terrorism in the region, believe me its not true. Its the lack of control by the government and involvement of different foreign intelligence agencies in our dear Country. As far is the naming of this particular gun as "Osama Gun" is concerned, the reason is that this gun was seen in Osama''s hands or with him in various pictures and videos. Weapons have been declared as a jewelry for Muslims, its the west which is polluting our minds against it, all we need is proper grooming of our children and that''s about it. We as a nation don''t want to take responsibility of our children''s grooming, we just want to shift the blame on guns. The USA has the most liberal gun laws of the world, why is there no actual terrorism over there ? Why the Pakistani Armed Forces are under attack and why not the US Forces in America?

I zeroed my 54 at 15 meters so that if i keep the target just above the front sight, it hits the target (good advice from Umair bhai).I think i made the peep hole a bit large, but could not properly see thru a smaller hole i had tried at first as the front sight is a bit wide.pics are in the following order:1. the original sight which came out along with the improvised peep sight.2. the target at 15 meters.3. target thru peep sight.4. first 5 shots, 3 landed outside the circle.5. next 5 shots, only 1 landed outside the circle.all shots made from a rest.i have shot ~200 pellets after Umair bhai''s piston change and alhamdulillah things going very smoothly. i just need to take some more time out to smoothen out the fliers inshaAllah.Seniors, please comment whether i should continue with the peep or go back to the original open sight, also whether the peep sight hole size is ok or should a new one be made with a smaller aperture?[/QUOTE]Peep sight is an amazing thing which has always been under estimated. In your case you replaced the rear sight''s plate with a peep hole which is not correct.I suggest you to continue using Diana''s original open sights and these sights will give you less than 1" group at 20 yards.You should achieve this much accuracy before moving any further.I appreciate your effort to make peep. But in order to use peep it should be installed on the scope rail and the original Diana rear sight should be removed by unscrewing the two screws which hold the rear sight otherwise this rear sight will come in between the peep sight and front sight.So conceptually your effort is appreciable but is in the wrong direction.Just forget using the peep sight for the time being and practice with open sights.Your gun is well broken in that means that more than 1500 pellets have passed through it and thus it has settled and I don''t think it will settle much more.When you last visited me, neither of us had that much time which was due.I suggest you to come to my place once more so that I myself could use your gun and judge its accuracy with open sights.Also some other things may need some time.

It is kind of (well not really but just as an example) like buying iPhone5, I personally would never buy any product upon it''s release, wait for all the bugs to be fixed first (although I would never buy an iPhone5 or iPad for that matter as Samsung is better, imho of course), read as many reviews and then only make the purchase if I am satisfied and sure. But in case of guns, especially a new entrant in the market, the wait needs to be longer for it to become a long established company known for quality and safety, for owner to be totally comfortable carrying and using, otherwise it''s guns could kill &/or seriously harm one. This is not an iPhone or S4, it is a gun that''s primary purpose is SD, to kill or seriously injure.\n\nCaracal''s initial responses (or customer service ''per se'') by ''I am so and so'' on this forum was abysmal and darn right rude to say the least (and that could be due to various reasons, arrogance, political, to bury the matter before it reaches the HQ and WW audience etc etc) flamed the anti-Caracal customer service and products sentiment and responses from members (rightly so!) but their later responses from HQ have been mixed bag but polite at least. Gut feeling is that they are going to take a very looooooooong time for replacements to reach PK customers of faulty production batches or drag it for so long that they will ultimately stop the supply to PK. \n\nAs for muslim brotherhood another member mentioned, we all know how well PK labour class and our Green Passport holders are treated in UAE by locals and what they think of us, so don''t expect a red carpet treatment from them when it comes to PK. Pakistan is a tiny market for them (locally made guns far exceed foreign imports) that they could stop supply to, as it won''t make much different to their Bottom Line Profits. It is all about making PROFITS and no-brainer  closing operations/supply to countries that can hurt their reputation in their major profit markets, especially where 1 incident (in a very low margin country) prompts a major recall. And they won''t even name Pakistan in their recall announcement on their site, where the incident actually took place. That says a lot!\n\nAs for Customer Service and how it should be, it reminds me of Johnson''s & Johnson''s recall of one their products. The moment the CEO found out of the QC/manufacturing issue with one of the creams, he sent an immediate announcement WW and pulled the product off the shelves within days, bearing company millions of dollars in losses but he saved the company. Caracal owners should not be expecting such a treatment, especially as reports are already in this thread that dealers are either oblivious of the recall or are simply ignoring it and selling to buyers who don''t know of the recall. Caracal could put an immediate full stop of faulty C''s and recall every pistol shipped to Pakistan in a very short time frame but they won''t, it''s just like dealing with a bad dealer who sold you a faulty gun, will ignore your calls, make excuses and not be at shop when you visit. \n\nAnd ALL Product Recalls have a timeline .... so less customers know, less products to replace in the timeframe.

What if no CCTV footage, or witnesses, were there at the time of the shooting i.e no way to validate whether you had "indeed" been mugged. How does law enforcement tackle such issues. \n\n2. A friend mentioned that (and this makes absolutely no sense to me) it may be illegal to shoot someone if their intention is to steal (not kill or seriously injure you). Is the use of lethal force justified if...say...muggers attempt to steal my cellphone at gunpoint?[/QUOTE]\n\nVery valid points.....I''m no legal expert but owing to the post-incident experience that I had, I can just tell you that:\n1. Eye witnesses (the guards in this case), the Police already know gangs operating in the areas if not exactly when, my credentials, cellphone in his pocket (nothing removed from the scene) and his own weapon. Rest, you know if someone wants to implicate you, its very easy to do so if you are just a commoner.\n2. If a bad guy wants to steal something from me with no intent to kill, he could bring along his friends, forcibly pull me out of the car, slap and punch me, not use any weapon and run away with all my valuables. But the gun obviously means something and in a number of incidents, BGs have used weapons against non-cooperating brave men.', 1, 0, '119.157.180.191', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

Limited mag capacity: This is somewhat offset by the potent caliber itself and the ability to easily carry extra slim, single stack mags.\n\n2. Lack of safety: There are only two ways to effectively carry a TT - Condition 3 carry and half cock. Condition 3 carry involves chambering a round before the gun can be fired.

My choice of holsters is based mostly on nylon (military grade if available). Second choice and perhaps the last is Kydex ones. I for some reasons DO NOT like or prefer the leather. Sure the leather one looks cool. The strange choice in selecting holsters with regards to the material will be covered later. Just a quick review of this one which I loved and instantly picked up.\n\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]23787[/ATTACH][ATTACH=CONFIG]23788[/ATTACH]\n[COLOR=#ff0000][B]MAIN CONSIDERATIONS:[/B][/COLOR] This is a OC holster for pants etc and can be used in CC mode while in Shalwar Qameez. By and large the shape remains like the rest of the ones out there. Its not large in size but covers my Glock very adequately including the trigger guard and pretty much everything else except for the grip. A holster does NOT necessarily have to be too expensive or carrying a premium brand name with all the bells and whistles to perform as you want. My prime concerns are that [B]a holster should be able to [COLOR=#ff0000]cover the gun[/COLOR] from all the dirt and debris, have soft inner lining/padding to almost [COLOR=#ff0000]nullify the chances of wear[/COLOR] for many years, [COLOR=#ff0000]comfortable[/COLOR] and above all [COLOR=#ff0000]fast to draw[/COLOR][/B] a weapon from. Yes, I know, I''ve asked everything from one poor holster. But there are still few points I left out. Go figure them out.\n\n[FONT=arial][B]This is a fixed paddle holster for the right hand. The holster offers a thumb-break system (the way I like it) for securing the Glock and from being unsuspectedly drawn by someone else. In the following picture you can see the thumb-break and the soft padded lining that runs all along the inside to protect from holster wear.[/B][/FONT]\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]23793[/ATTACH][ATTACH=CONFIG]23794[/ATTACH]\nSo far, I''ve worn the holster for a few days for almost 5-6 hours continuously per day. Its comfortable. The holster itself does not weigh anything but obviously with a G17 with two magazines housing 16 rounds each, is bound to keep reminding you of the bad boy on you. So I figured out a way. I had an old cellphone pouch of generally same material and colour, which I have on the left side of the waist. It can take the second magazine (total capacity of three magazines). This distributes the weight to a great degree. \nSo this is how it fits and looks.

My experiences/review of the Baikal is as follows...\n\n>You guys ready for another long post by Fudgie? :D\n\n I was saving up for a target rifle to show off with at the range, that is, something that could put multiple bullets through the same hole at 200m (the furthest target at my club). I was browsing through some websites when the price of the Baikal caught my attention (yeah I''m a cheap bastard :)). I had heard of Baikal but never considered one before. But $250 for pretty much any caliber I wanted from 223 to 30-06, and a  break action that only has a hinge and the fire control group as the only moving parts meant it had to be accurate, I was getting more interested by the second. So without further delay, I hit the buy button on a Baikal IZH- 18MH in 270Win. I was thrilled at the thought of building a target rifle for 1/4 the cost of a nice bolt action. But my dream wasn''t to be. \n \nWhen the gun arrived, I went  out to shoot it that same day and got 2" groups at 100m. Ok for a starting point I thought. Then with optics, the groups shrank to 1 1/2". I then had the trigger worked on (around 4 lb break with no creep and over travel stop), got fancy scope mounts with matching rings, experimented with countless load recipes, and the best I ever got out of that rifle was 1 1/16". That isn''t bad, but its far from good since all my AR''s shoot MOA straight out of the box. Unable to get the accuracy I wanted (for a target rifle, I was expecting at least 1/2 MOA), I did more research, spoke to a few gunsmiths, and came to the realization that break actions work fine for shotguns, but as a rifle,  they leave much to be desired, being an inherently inaccurate design. All things being equal, they are actually the least accurate type of action, with bolt guns being on top. \n\nThere are several reasons why, here''s what I learned... first they have two piece stocks. So depending on if you''re resting the gun on a bench, on shooting sticks, holding it, how you''re holding it, pressure and contact on the barrel is never consistent. Consistency is accuracy. Compare that to a bolt action where the barrel can be completely free floated, meaning nothing touches the barrel, thereby alleviating any interference with it''s harmonics and thereby it''s consistency.  Furthermore, when the action is a completely separate component from the barrel, tight, solid lockup largely affects consistency. All metal parts wear, notice how a break action will loosen up after a couple hundred shots. On most guns a little wear is of little consequence, but where the action meets the barrel, a little deviation could mean being way off target at 100m. So the nature of a break action is such, that a little wiggle means a lot of inconsistency. Again compare that to a bolt gun, where the action can be bedded to the stock, ensuring a consistently solid alignment with the barrel (and the rest of the gun) for every shot. Next, when talking about extreme accuracy, extractor design may have an effect to a lesser degree, but an effect nonetheless. That is, the extractor on a break action is merely a section of the chamber face that pushes up the spent case. A good comparison with a bolt action is the claw extractor, of Mauser design, that actually takes a firm hold of the cartridge, keeping it in a secure position throughout the firing sequence, thereby aiding accuracy. Finally, most single shots are budget oriented guns, so match grade accuracy is not an aspect of their design.\n\nI ended up selling mine, but all that is not to say the Baikal is a bad gun, on the contrary. It''s not a target gun by any means, yet it never claims to be. So don''t expect very very good accuracy from it. Having to break the gun open to manually load a cartridge after every shot gets to be tedious in little time. So don''t expect a fun plinking gun.  But the single shot rifle excels at what it was meant for, and that is an inexpensive gun to take hunting. One that you won''t mind dragging through dirt, dropping in a river, and getting banged up. It''s more than accurate enough to take down game, is shot after shot reliable, and it''s light weight is a major virtue for a day in the fields. Another huge plus is its ability to change caliber with a simple barrel swap. So my verdict is: you have a great rifle in the Baikal single shot, a gun that is hard to top, just buy it for the right reasons :)', 1, 1, '24.85.141.11', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

Maybe the Caracal pistol was not ready by then and the Army had already signed an agreement with Sarsilmaz. Or perhaps, the Turkish metallurgy was more reliable if not superior to Caracal (UAE). Could it be the lack of external safety as a standard requirement? There must be something that made the army opt for Sarsilmaz.[/QUOTE]\n\nGlock bro, I have had first hand experience of dealing directly with Turkish manufacturers including Stoeger and XNARMS. Very friendly and fast response times, they answer the calls on their website advertised number and put you through to the right person immediately. I wanted some extra mags ordered as a friend was visiting Istanbul, and these guys emailed me a list of all their stockists near his hotel (along with expected retail price to pay per mag, US$25 for a Stoeger mag), but at the same time both advised to get permit to export the mags. Sourcing the mags was not an issue (contacts there know a few LEA officers) but cancelled the purchase to avoid any complications at the airports. \n\nCustomer service matters a lot, both Stoeger and XNARMS went out of their way to assist, after just one phone call conversation and exchange of few emails. And I don''t think our brothers here have had any major issues with Turkish made guns so far either. Knowing all too well that I was calling from PK, they treated me well, and Turks have a soft spot for Pakistanis in general as well. They are educated and very well mannered nation and proud of their heritage, and do not forget who supported them in difficult times. When an airport Taxi driver finds out that you are from Pakistan, they genuinely treat you with respect and are very friendly indeed and that''s not just to get a tip etc. \n\nPerhaps this is why the Pak Army went with Sarsilmaz instead of Caracal and Turks have multiple manufacturers of reliable weapons compared to the only one Caracal of UAE. If Turks treat an over the phone Pakistani customer that well (as far as my personal experience goes), they would surely be treating the Pak Army even better in customer services.', 1, 0, '223.29.235.52', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

They excel in what they''re meant for, and are going by fixed standards to keep up to the mark. \nPakistanis don''t take care of animals, they just want money. They interbreed good breeds with mutts and ruin the breeds.\nThey grow the trait of dog aggression in BULLY KUTTA to earn HARAM bucks, they make the dogs fight for what they lack themselves (manhood). Therefore I believe it would take long before a breed standard is created. The dogs is mostly sleepy apart from fights, and eats a lot and requires vigorous exercise which is a task in city area.\n\nI wouldn''t mind keeping a true GAME BULLY KUTTA (which is muscular and quite frisky, alert) unlike the ones we have today which are only good for sh*t (dog fighting); a ''sport'' of the losers.\n\nA well bred, true standard bully kutta is a very nice dog, one of my favorites.

My dogs are awake and alert 24/7 and are great companions. I believe it is a misunderstood breed and many losers keep this breed for dog fighting.

And I can''t sleep ... it''s a wife free weekend :rockon:\n\n1 - Are you trained in any martial arts?\n2 - If not trained in any, which interests you the most?\n\n\nI started training at 13 in school and stopped after completing 2nd Dan in WTF Taekwondo. Then much later a friend, master in Jiu-Jitsu, taught a group of us close friends the Jiu-Jitsu and Krav Maga fusion version - specifically for very close range (clubbing and group fights). \n\nTaekwondo is not a soft art/sport but more on defensive and long range offensive side and requires space (for example, a 1-1 fight on the street etc), but the Jiu-Jitsu and Krav-Maga fusion is lethal. My friend, about 5ft 4" and slim, took on 5 large body builder type British African guys and in less than a minute all 5 were out cold on the dance floor. The brute speed of fists and elbows with head and neck being the targets, I find it frightening the damage a trained person can do in such a very very short timeframe. \n\nI personally avoid and dislike starting or getting involved in fights and always give warning to others to ''let''s cool down and we all walk away unhurt before someone ends up in hospital with permanent damages'' and it diffused many fights. A few where it didn''t work, I won''t divulge into details as to what happened to them. I don''t drink so muting an intoxicated person is easier as they think they are moving fast but infact they are slower.\n\n\n\nBut it is different here in PK, too many illegal gun carriers so for SD a gun is a necessity where a warning shot or more can diffuse a situation. I don''t look forward to such a situation hence avoid travelling late in known ''dakoo'' areas. Last year Ramzan, on the way to ISB, M2 was blocked by protesters so had to get off before Sial services to rejoin the M2 at Bhera Toll - asked directions from a farmer and his son came up and said ''aap ne bus rukna nahi hai, tayz garri'' and I was '':doh:, this is dakoo territory'' and called my brother to confirm and received the bollocking :rant: ''why the **** did you get off the motorway, did you not know that majority of the areas around the motorway are dangerous for night travel? leave the phone call running, and get the **** out of there before sunset*. I killed the suspension of my car that day, unknown roads and area, so it was pedal to metal - window down, Cougar chambered sitting in the lap and shotgun chambered on passenger floor pan & seat. Thanks Allah I got to Bhera Toll just around sunset, as a day later shootings were reported with some cars looted on the same roads after sunset. And a suspension check and complete overhaul the next day, with everything replaced from track-rods, track rod ends, anti-roll bar links, every bushing, engine mounts and full set of new shocks and springs - 2 bent shocks!! :mad2: ... never driven a stock vti (and that too a SOHC one instead of DOHC) that hard other than only track prepared cars on race tracks before.

Saw this sad incident reporting and YouTube clips. Feeling sad and bad for whatever happening due to incompetence, negligence and continuous stupidity of persons responsible for administration and security in homeland. It is result of decades of institutional malpractices & deterioration in discipline, training, brainstorming, research, merit as well as brain drain of capable and intelligence capital from country.\r\n\r\nFollowing are my two cents on situation and recommendations.\r\n\r\nHandling of an incident such like this (God forbid, he would be a real terrorist with some hostages in a lorry or wagon??? or wearing explosive belt?) requires special handlings. There should be an agency or teams deployed in every region with members consisting very well trained management, administration, legal, commandos, negotiators, doctors, psychiatrists, intelligence (humint & cyber) as well as resources including lethal (Sniper Systems with coordination interfaces, Target Pistols, SMGs) as well as less than \r\nlethal (Tasers & stuns - our ASF Martials/commandos have these, Pepper Spray, Stun Batons, Rubber Bullets, Stun Grenades, Water Canons, Focused energy weapons, tranquilizer guns), Enabling Technologies like coordinated camera systems and thermal/IR imagers and spotting scopes for situational awareness and decision support. \r\n\r\nALso they should have proper trainings, use cases & scenarios exercised and well planned/sorted out to tackle most of such situations.\r\n\r\nThis incident is evident of at least following shortcomings;\r\n\r\n1. Police Check posts :- Usually their main job is deterrence and avoidance. They are not proper planned and manned. Due to rush or improper handing a lot of vehicles gather there and increase potentially causalities chances God forbid if any blast occur.\r\n2. There must be explosive and drug scanners available at all check posts. Only suspicious vehicle should be removed from column to a designed secure area for further investigation. Proper manning will help check further vehicles after one is removed from lane.\r\n3. Remote observation cameras must be installed to check incident in anticipation and also for performance checks.\r\n4. A rapid action SWAT team should be ready with ground and areal \r\nsupport for quick deployment/follow-up.\r\n5. Arial monitoring drones should be acquired and every team should have one. At least in large cities like Islamabad, Karachi, Lahore, Peshawar, Quetta & Multan.\r\n6. An emergency advisory board with members from Management, Administration, Forces, Intelligence, Academia & Civil with adequate Knowledge, trainings and interest should be formed for policy, guidelines & standards reforms as well as should be available at zero time notice to meet and advise on any emergency situation.   special \r\ninterest groups must be formed for research and advice on policy & law making. Suggestions and expert advice must be sought after from armed civilians community-civil society and retired LEA personnel with excellent track record. (This will avoid a firearms law formation mentioning allowed caliber of 45 inches or less, ridiculously large enough that no canon in world or even in fiction can compare.\r\n\r\nComing to incident, any civilian should not be allowed to go to suspect for negations. Proper planning and simulation could result in coordinated negotiation cum stunning/temp disorientation cum commando action could result in a less than 15 second operation with least risk involved for LEA, Family, Suspect & spectators.

Now kindly understand that I am not insisting that you are wrong. in fact, you could be very right but crack inside barrel just doesn''t make any sense.\n\nhere is why:\n\n1. if the crack is in the barrel then the barrel should blow up the moment one pulls the trigger.\n2. if the crack is in the barrel then one should not be able to physically see it as the crack should be covered with hard chrome plating because hatsan barrels are chrome plated from inside.\n3. if the crack is in chrome plating then again one should not be able to see it with naked eye and would require proper viewing apparatus such as a bore scope.\n\n\nRegards.[/QUOTE] \n\nSir, crack/ groove is visible from inside. dimensions i already mentioned in my first post besides if you put a long cotton bud and try to feel the groove / crack it is good 2 mm deep ( Yes you are right 12G bro it is easy to palpate with cotton bud but relatively easy to ignore on superficial inspection ) which without any doubt weakens the barrel.\nProblem is with Semiautos only, I got Aimguard and its barrels interior shines like glass with not even a hair sized scratch as the shotgun barrel is supposed to be.\n\nThere is no way one can justify these cracked / deeply grooved barrels.

The reason being that this will shoot even the 10 grain pellet (which is considered heavy in this cal) at over 1000 fps and due to the lower pellet weight and high velocity, the accuracy is most likely to suffer, especially over longer distances.\n\nIf only cal you can shoot is .177, I''d strongly suggest you look for a Diana (Mod 31, 34,35 etc) or a Weihrauch airgun which shoots in the range of 15-18 fpe at the muzzle. Those should serve you a lot better esp as far a the accuracy is concerned. There is no point in having whopping velocities when you''re not able to hit what you aim at, it''ll only frustrate you :).', 1, 0, '202.61.45.12', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

Could you clear it up for us?[/B][/QUOTE]\nRegarding magazine cocktails and Dutch loads, there are many reasons why modern tactitions recommend against them. First, consistency. Consistency of the firearm as it pertains to reliable functioning and consistency of the shooter as it pertains to accuracy. Every different brand of bullet will have different points of impact, and different recoil signatures, let alone different types. That is also why you should train with with the gun and the ammo you carry. Second, analysis data collected from LEA''s, shows that in confrontations involving deadly force, only 1/3 of the bullets they fire hit their target. With civilians that ratio diminishes. Also, in civilian self defense shootings the average number of shots fired is 3 within three to seven feet. Which means its most likely that only one of those shots will find its target. Therefore, that totally negates the theoretical advantage of having alternating types of bullets. Furthermore, with the 2 missed shots, at least one of them will be an FMJ if coming from a Dutch loaded magazine, and that greatly increases the risk to innocents. Remember, President Ronald Regan was almost assassinated by the ricochet from a 22lr! Third, modern JHP rounds have enough penetration performance for just about any self defense situation. For example, they have more than enough power to go through layered heavy winter clothing, shooting through windshields will take several shots from any hand gun caliber regardless of bullet type, and if you find your target behind a car door or a wall, you probably should cease fire anyways since most likely he no longer poses a threat to your life at that point, or is already retreating but that gets into legal and moral issues which are whole other issues. \n\nThere is further reasoning based on statistal analysis of angles, distances, and ballistics, but the above mentioned are the most important and most relevant. To summarize, based on what Ive been taught, I believe the best solution is a magazine full of high quality modern self defense rounds because they have good barrier penetration, excellent expansion performance, and highly reduces instances of over penetration and ricochet, and to ensure accuracy. That''s my opinion at this point in time, but that''s subject to change as equipment and ammo evolves. But most importantly, you have to be confident in your gear choices for your individual situation, so just beware of false confidence, and do what you are comfortable with.', 1, 0, '24.114.40.146', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

Its all a matter of personal preference. \n\nI, personally, prefer Sigs because they (in my opinion) look better, feel better, have a decocker, and are (mostly) made of metal and have an external hammer. This is not to say that a Glock (especially the Glock 17) is a bad gun, far from it actually. The Glock is reliable, dependable, and an extremely serviceable firearm. \n\nNow, coming to the Sig P250 vs Glock 17 debate. No, just...no. The Glock that you have is a far superior weapon in almost every aspect (not including fit and feel, which is completely subjective anyway). If it were a P226 or something along those lines, I''m afraid I''d have to side with your friend. :p O, and regarding accuracy, Glocks often outshoot their owners - nothing wrong with them if the shooter does his/her part. \n\n@Glock 17: Since you''ve already searched the market for Sigs, what kind of variety are we looking at over here?

And yes, the debate is never ending specially once you aren''t siding either and being truly neutral. I had an option of a P250 and a P226. The P226 is Made in Germany and without a picatinny rail which is a "deal breaker" for me despite the fact I like how it looks. Hammer or striker, I''m more into the striker ones if its a Glock not Taurus. I don''t mind if a gun is based on a full sized frame or a compact, it has to be light weight.

Pistol', 1377151385, 'Here is my take on the age old debate after carrying both as my EDC. \n\n[B]Reliability:[/B]\n\nHands down the innate simplicity of the revolver design makes it vastly superior to the pistol in the reliability department.  \nNo worries about faulty magazines, followers, spring pressure. No FTE issues or feeding problems. Broken ejectors or worries about which ammo the pistol &#8216;likes&#8217; FMJ or JHP or any specific brand. \nWith a wheel gun &#8220;you&#8221; decide what ammo type U like not the gun! You may load semi-wadcutters and she will not complain. \nEven if there is a failure to fire the shooter does not have to take &#8216;time out&#8217; in a gun fight and clear the dud round manually. With a revolver he simply continues shooting.\n\n[B]Simplicity[/B]\n\nFor a newbie to the fire arms world i almost always recommond a wheel gun over a pistol. its far more simpler to operate then a pistol \n\n[B]Choice:[/B] \n\nThe .357magnum can also fire the .38 spacial. My .32 S&W long can do .32 s&w short and in a pinch even .32 acp ( A pistol round)  However I can just imagine stuffing my  .32 revolver round in the .32 pistol! Boom if I ever were able to stuff it inside the gun!\n\n[B]Safety:[/B]\n\nIMHO one of the most crucial differences between the wheel gun and the pistol is that the pistol cycles a fresh round &#8220;after&#8221; it has been fired. While the revolver completes its cycle &#8220;before&#8221; discharge.\nHow does it affect the safety of the weapon?\n\nWell. The safest way to carry a firarm is condition 3 or chamber empty. Unfortunately if the stuff hits the fan. All you have to pull the trigger on a pistol suddenly all u get is a click.. U can go on clicking ad infinitum. Untill you charge the weapon manually u wont get anywhere. \nHowever, with a wheel gun even when there is an empty chamber under the hammer when you squeeze the trigger the piece will fire. The rotary mechanism will ensure there is a fresh round whenever the trigger is pulled.\n\n[B]Quantity vs. size:[/B]\n\nThe size of a pistol round is limited to the size of the grip. It is possible to stuff a .357magnum round in a desert eagle, but you would have to be a giant to conceal it let alone fire it comfortably.. if u have normal sized hands that is. It is a huge, heavy chunk of metal.  \nA titanium 7 shot .357 magnum Taurus snubbie can easily be dropped in an ankle holster and the owner will barely feel it is there!\nBesides, the chances are if you cant do something with 7 or 8 .357 magnum rounds, you probably wont get a chance to do with 17 9mm rounds either. \n\n[B]Ease of handling:[/B]\n\nI have used both as my EDC. But I found the task of unloading the chamber every time I came back home and then re-stuffing the 17th round back in the magazine, odious at best.  I stopped abusing my thumb nail and simply shifted to my revolver.  I also don&#8217;t have to worry about spring fatigue anymore. \n\n[B]More tolerance for different gripping styles[/B]\n\ni have yet to see a wheel gun fail to fire/extract due to limp wristing or injuring a thumb or fingers  because the shooter allowed it to hover close to the slide. \n\n(I made such an error once and am lucky my thumb is intact) \n\n[B]Security[/B]\n\nIt also does not leave ''calling'' cards behind on the scene of an incident. I like my brass with me not strewn all over the road. \n\n[B]you get what u are promised[/B]\n\none more edge a revolver has over pistol, in revolvers you get exact barrel length you are promised with same length of rifling not like pistols where length of chamber (a feed ramp as well in CZ''s case) is deducted from advertised barrel length \n\nThere was an incident when me and my friends were coming back from French beach and on the way back on the Mauripur road we saw a bunch of moter bikers crusing slowly.  I immediately charged my 9mm pistol&#8230; Or tried to at any rate. I fumbled and the slide got stuck half way. It took me a good 10 minutes to clear the jam. Luckily for me my friend and his wife. The bikers were just a bunch of kids coming back from the beach. But I learnt my lesson that day.  \nAnd shifted to the wheel gun for serious SD work.', 1, 1, '61.5.135.163', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

It''s a looped piece of metal the size of a paper clip under the right side grip. Second, the new ones have machined slides vs stamped. Not everything milled is better, but in this case I believe it is, for the sake of rigidity. \n\nThat reminds me of an article I once read about an analysis of AKs with stamped vs milled receivers. In America, milled AKs command quite a premium, not only due to their increased cost to produce, but  for their (perceived) superior quality. However in testing, the stamped versions proved to be more accurate and reliable. It was due to the fact that the original design incorporated the flex afforded by a stamped sheet metal receiver.

I CC a large frame gun (complete with 16 rounds loaded in it) and, although certainly heavier than a revolver, it''s still (in profile) thinner than a wheel gun. The reason I bring this up is because this gives you, IMHO, more carry options. Also, there are certain variants of TT''s out there with a manual safety, or you could get a 1911.\n\nHowever, in practice, the ability to quickly recharge your gun in the middle of a bad situation should not be discounted, and this is strictly a pistol''s personal domain.[/QUOTE]\n\n\nIMHO I have yet to see a single incident in which the the armed GG (Good guy as opposed to LEA) had to reload. Most people I know carry TTs \n\nAs regards the wheel sticking out. In my case when i use an IWB it nestled in the holster and n the pants directly behind the pocket which is rarely ever empty. So it does not show\n\nI will take pictures of both my holstered firearms to show u what i mean. \n\nIts the grip that sticks out conspicuously like a  sore thumb and the grip I can change when ever I  like. \n\nBoth the TT and the 1911 are strictly SA weapons combat.

On the other hand if you come from a big and known family, more firepower may be beneficial as you may be a target, And other unusual circumstances like that. But most and everyday situations a revolver is best, very safe yet all you need to do is pull it out and squeeze the trigger. Pistols dont offer that, for the common man here who doesnt wanna get robbed of his valuables, all he needs is a few rounds at the ready, as ED said [B]"[COLOR=#333333]Generally if the threat is not neutralised in the 1st 7-8 shots. the chances are the GG is. neutralised that is."

Like i said, if circumstances are different and you have reason to believe you need more firepower then yes a wheelie will surely not be beneficial.[/COLOR][/QUOTE]\n\nSA is single action. I.e u have to pull the hammer back before u fire. The TT is an SA pistol. For the first round u have to pull back the hammer and for subsequent rounds the hammer is pulled back hte the force of the recoil. So its always SA. \n\nIn an SA revolver u have to manualy pull back the hammer before every round is fired. But there are almost combat SA revolvers aropund. \n\nmost are DA. I.e U pull the hammer and simply ''touch'' the trigger. or u keep the hammer down and have to pull the trigger all the way back.\n\nSA means the trigger simply releases the hammer while double action means the trigger has to both pull back the hammer and  release it as well. \n\nSAO is single action only and DAO is double action only.

Since NATO nations decided not to replace the 9mm with the 5.7 as standard issue, ammo is scarce and expensive, and also because the ammo available to civilians is not armor piercing (nullifying any significant ballistic advantage it may have had, making it kind of a different just for the sake of being different cartridge), demand for the gun is consequently low.

Firearms is one dept. women in our society would hesitate to adopt and even if we did try to teach them it can never be second nature for them, because since childhood we see "toy guns for boys barbies for girls" . Moreover, I feel that the majority of women (not all) are more prone to panic attacks in scenarios such as robbery or street crime and emotional outbursts (while CCing a weapon getting into an argument, fight etc.), this can cause more harm than good when handling firearms, while for us loading a magazine, chambering and deactivating a safety, fixing a jam may seem trivial but for them its not so easy to pull this off smoothly in an emergency situation, unless they are fully trained by professionals in line of work (Police force, FBI, army etc.). For guys we have been playing with toy guns, then BB guns, men also tend to watch more action films then women so some basic knowledge gets transferred to us every now and then even if we own firearms or not.\n\nNot trying to sound chauvinist here, but its a sad fact about our culture, granted there may be 1-5% women who may become proficient at handling firearms, but for the rest its just a lump of metal lying in a purse like jewellery if they have it, I wouldn''t be surprised if I saw a Hello Kitty sticker on a Walther PPK, or may be pink glitter decorating on a Taurus Slim in a woman''s handbag or worse nail polish and perfume spilled into the guns. \n\nAgain these are just my personal opinions, not meant to offend anyone, for all I know, a lot of guys may be even worse in self defense situations, and definitely a lot of men who shouldn''t be owning weapons have them ( exapmle Mr. Sikandar of Islamabad in this regard).\n\nIf you feel your better half/sister/mother is 100% capable of handling herself in SD and can maintain her composure then by all means buy her the best gun you can, otherwise its not recommended.', 1, 0, '115.186.111.29', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

Firearms is one dept. women in our society would hesitate to adopt and even if we did try to teach them it can never be second nature for them, because since childhood we see "toy guns for boys barbies for girls" . Moreover, I feel that the majority of women (not all) are more prone to panic attacks in scenarios such as robbery or street crime and emotional outbursts (while CCing a weapon getting into an argument, fight etc.), this can cause more harm than good when handling firearms, while for us loading a magazine, chambering and deactivating a safety, fixing a jam may seem trivial but for them its not so easy to pull this off smoothly in an emergency situation, unless they are fully trained by professionals in line of work (Police force, FBI, army etc.). For guys we have been playing with toy guns, then BB guns, men also tend to watch more action films then women so some basic knowledge gets transferred to us every now and then even if we own firearms or not.\n\nNot trying to sound chauvinist here, but its a sad fact about our culture, granted there may be 1-5% women who may become proficient at handling firearms, but for the rest its just a lump of metal lying in a purse like jewellery if they have it, I wouldn''t be surprised if I saw a Hello Kitty sticker on a Walther PPK, or may be pink glitter decorating on a Taurus Slim in a woman''s handbag or worse nail polish and perfume spilled into the guns. \n\nAgain these are just my personal opinions, not meant to offend anyone, for all I know, a lot of guys may be even worse in self defense situations, and definitely a lot of men who shouldn''t be owning weapons have them ( exapmle Mr. Sikandar of Islamabad in this regard).\n\nIf you feel your better half/sister/mother is 100% capable of handling herself in SD and can maintain her composure then by all means buy her the best gun you can, otherwise its not recommended.[/QUOTE]\n\nBrother as everyone knows the most orthodox people considered in our society our most probably the Pathans (not the one''s living in the sub-urbs) and I know this for a fact that their women are more than able in handling arms as more than once I have heard from my Pathan help they always teach their women how to handle arms and always keep arms at their residences.\n\nBut your observation is quite correct in regards to our forward minded and educated class, it certainly is somewhat a taboo but times a changing and now a lot of the female populace deems it necessary to know how to handle a firearm.', 1, 1, '115.167.70.25', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

I am not comfortable with C&L position while carrying, therefore I chose P01 for carry over Compact & Glock19.\nIn shooting I prefer to shoot 75 compact over P01 because of its weight, I got back on target much quicker than with P01.\n\nIn the end I will say both are great carry guns.. not just carry but range guns as well.. its one own preference of choosing one over other..

I''ll try to get hold of it to post. I wanted all of you peoples opinion whether it is Chinese or local.
