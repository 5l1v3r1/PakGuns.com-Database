Hmmm! I love Japanese imported cars due to high quality. Can you please elaborate on your experience on issues that you faced or seen in imported cars? I own a TOYOTA FIELDER X 2006 which is wonderful!!! But the issue I face is ground clearance when on high speed breakers and rough road when having an extra person!!! I also did eyed on TERIOS and not TERIOS KID - the kid version is small!!! But someone told that it is PAK assembled and not as good as RUSH??? I have no idea! Please guide me on comparing both.\n\nDo you have idea what 2013 brand new Terios (full SUV) will cost? The link below suggests around 2.5 mil!\n\nWhat if someone in Japan books a car for me? Is it so simple? MY cousin lives in Japan and exporting cars to Africa etc. Can that be of help? I worry in-transit accident during transportation via sea etc.\n\nBudget - a difficult question to answer! Let me try what I have in my mind. I wish if I can have a reasonable high ground clearance car/SUV like RUSH or TERIOS around 2 mil. BUT if the choice is TOO attractive I would go up around say 2.4 to 2.5 mil.\nI want to have the car engine around 1500 CC what RUSH has, and I think TERIOS is also 1500 CC. I do not wish to install a CNG so want the engine to be small so that I can afford petrol on day to day drive basis! (I generally keep a local small car also for intra-city drive, I dont know if I will keep that after having this SUV).\n[URL]http://www.toyotaravi.com/terios.htm[/URL]\n\nSincerely', ''),

Well i alway wanted to buy a Makarov. Firstly i love Russian weapons. Love the simple and reliable design of the MAks. They are small, light and very very durable. The 9*18 Mak round is slightly less powerful than 9mm Lugar(9*19) round, which is commonly 115-147Gr. The Mak''s 9*18 is commonly 94-100Gr, which makes less noise and lesser recoil. So follow up shots can be quicker. Because of it less recoil the 9*18 is slightly more accurate then 9*18. These all factors make Maks a very good CC gun. The price of Mak rounds are almost the same as 9*19, if not slightly higher.', ''),

Dennis Hiller&#8217;s Airgun Collectors book indicates that 3 pumps can give around 428fps, 6 pumps 567fps and 10 pumps 637fps in .177 pellet.\n\n\nThe rifle takes either .177 pellets as a single shot, or up to 100 BB&#8217;s can be loaded into the reservoir within the stock.\n.177 pellets are loaded directly into the breach by pulling back the cocking lever on the right hand side and seating the pellet in the channel. When the cocking lever is returned the pellet is pushed forwards by a rod.\nBB&#8217;s can be poured into the reservoir via an aperture in the butt of the pistol grip. The black cover on this can be slid backwards to expose the hole. With the BB&#8217;s in the reservoir the repeater tube on the left hand side can be cocked by pulling back the lever and locating it to compress the spring. If you then tip the gun forwards and rotate it a stream of BB&#8217;s will roll forward into the tube"', ''),

(568235, ' Can''t comment on the Toyota Rush model but used to import sports cars from Japan to Uk and sell them as a side business. We started with a reputable auction site and after getting good cars, my business partner went to Japan to meet these huge scrap yards where the auction cars go to before hitting the auction and buying direct from them instead of going via auction route that was more expensive - forged a good relationship with 1 scrap yard and we imported at least 30+ of just RX7''s from him let alone Subaru''s, Integra Type R''s etc as well. He would send us all his individual tests reports and 15+ pics per car for us to decide, and when the cars arrive and clear the port, we would simply service, get the MOT, and put up for sale straight away knowing they are in a good condition to go. If anything needed changing, he would do it for us so we didn''t need to get under the cars ourselves to fix any bushings etc.\n\nThere are some big and live auction houses, but you will need to have an account with them and the money in the account to bid live on the internet. Those auction houses can''t rip you off as they sell what the government inspectors give the rating of the car (the detailed report that is online to view and print) but beware that sometimes high end stereos and easily removable high-end accessories are taken off by ship crews if shipping in open space amongst other cars (all cars are unlocked with keys in them and batteries disconnected once on the ship). If you book a dedicated container for your car(s) then chances of theft by ship crew are minimised as each container is locked until it reaches it''s destination and opened by the customs.

That way, when at range, it would be easier to spot a member and strike a conversation. Something like a 100 or 200 bullets capacity box. \n\nOr one size box fits all type, but replaceable capacity bullets plastic slots due to the different Cal for that box - the capacity will change of course. If you know what I mean, that the inner bullet holder for each Cal is the same size and replaceable as the box remains the same but capacity will vary depending on the bullets holder inside? .22LR comes in similar(ish) boxes but those are slide types, the PG one to be like the other off the shelf types with click open the top (like our gun cases). \n\nOR perhaps, one size fits all Box and Cals inner holder as well, where 30Cal will sit in deeper and .45acp will sit higher up. A 200 bullet box would be ideal .... one can mix and match how many bullets of each Cal wants to carry in one box.

And she was consistently hitting the plates with a lot less hammer/magazine safety issues after she went through the initial 2 trial mags with guidance from Moeen bhai to get her stance and aim correct.\n\nMagazine safety system is now going to be removed to stop this annoying issue of hammer not cocking for next shot, before the next visit to the range. \n\nOverall I think this [I]could[/I] be an ideal SD pistol (for me and the Mrs) but Out of the Box it has issues like most P22s did/do thus it requires work on the feed ramp, trigger mechanism (shortened the trigger pull to fire), extractor and the possible magazine safety mechanism to get it right (unless your P22 and P22Q have no such issues). An original Walther P22Q laser imho should be a must for this if using for SD.\n\n[I][U]Edit:[/U][/I] Upon first disassembly and reassembly, I had got the sears spring installed wrong way around :crazy:... spent 40 minutes taking every bit apart, cleaning and putting it back the way it should''ve been and the hammer half cocks and full cocks with both thumb and trigger as it should (irrespective of mag in or not), whereas before it was not cocking at all unless slide pulled all the way back with mag in.

Rear sites were set as per the factory mark in front of the sites. As 30cal is a powerful round with a kick, small grip in large hands makes it a tough one to keep a tight group. Then it was a move to the plates. Grip on the TT is small for my hands and overall 50 shots were fired out of it. No FTE/FTF. Last 18 shots were fired wearing gloves and 16 were on the plates. \n\n4 out of 9 within 9s is not bad at all I think but I wish this gun had a longer grip like the Zastava!

We started with a reputable auction site and after getting good cars, my business partner went to Japan to meet these huge scrap yards where the auction cars go to before hitting the auction and buying direct from them instead of going via auction route that was more expensive - forged a good relationship with 1 scrap yard and we imported at least 30+ of just RX7''s from him let alone Subaru''s, Integra Type R''s etc as well. He would send us all his individual tests reports and 15+ pics per car for us to decide, and when the cars arrive and clear the port, we would simply service, get the MOT, and put up for sale straight away knowing they are in a good condition to go. If anything needed changing, he would do it for us so we didn''t need to get under the cars ourselves to fix any bushings etc.\n\nThere are some big and live auction houses, but you will need to have an account with them and the money in the account to bid live on the internet. Those auction houses can''t rip you off as they sell what the government inspectors give the rating of the car (the detailed report that is online to view and print) but beware that sometimes high end stereos and easily removable high-end accessories are taken off by ship crews if shipping in open space amongst other cars (all cars are unlocked with keys in them and batteries disconnected once on the ship). If you book a dedicated container for your car(s) then chances of theft by ship crew are minimised as each container is locked until it reaches it''s destination and opened by the customs. Your shipping agent there will have to make sure that nothing is stolen or removed from the car before it goes in the container and it is locked in front of him.[/QUOTE]\n\nDear VERVE - very helpful information and insight.

Trying to put the last 12 rounds into a Sten magazine without a loading tool is a frustrating exercise that will surely reduce your time on the range, and increase your ibuprofen dosage.\n\nAt least 3 different Sten magazine loader designs exist, each having their own unique method of making the loading task easier.\n\nPictured below is a British Sten Magazine Loader, of steel and brass construction. This seems to be the most commonly encountered design, and its official designation is "Filler, Magazine, 9mm Machine Carbine, Mk2," which was requisitioned via Catalog No. BE 8322. It is not the most intuitive device, so the following pictures are offered to help with instruction on this subject.\n[IMG]http://www.sturmgewehr.com/dalbert/MGBoards/StenLoader1.JPG[/IMG]\n\nThe loader is placed on top of a Sten magazine. It only fits one way, and has a piece of spring steel with a detent that holds it on the magazine.\n[IMG]http://www.sturmgewehr.com/dalbert/MGBoards/StenLoader2.JPG[/IMG]\n\nThe brass piece is pulled down with a finger to depress the magazine spring, and presents an opening into which a cartridge is inserted.\n[IMG]http://www.sturmgewehr.com/dalbert/MGBoards/StenLoader3.JPG[/IMG]\n\nThe brass piece is then lifted, and starts to push the cartridge into the opening in the magazine.\n[IMG]http://www.sturmgewehr.com/dalbert/MGBoards/StenLoader4.JPG[/IMG]\n\nThe brass piece is lifted to full height, and the cartridge becomes fully seated into the magazine.\n[IMG]http://www.sturmgewehr.com/dalbert/MGBoards/StenLoader5.JPG[/IMG]\n\nThe process is repeated, depressing the previous cartridge down into the magazine, while presenting the opportunity to load another cartridge, until the magazine is full.\n[IMG]http://www.sturmgewehr.com/dalbert/MGBoards/StenLoader6.JPG[/IMG]\n\n\nHere is another style of Sten magazine loader, officially known as "Filler, Magazine, 9mm Machine Carbine, Mk4." It attaches to the back of the magazine, with a small finger that holds under the lip of the back of the squared portion of the magazine top, and a spring tab that locks into the magazine locking slot. The lever is manipulated, pushing down the top cartridge, until there is sufficient room to insert another cartridge.\n\n[IMG]http://www.sturmgewehr.com/dalbert/MGBoards/Loader2-1_Web.JPG[/IMG]', ''),

If you have a reliable resource in Japan who can purchase the vehicle from Japan and ship it for you then it will be a good option. But be aware that the genuine good condition vehicles with low mileage are a bit expensive in Japan since we can only import cars that are 3 years or less old.\n\nFor example i have a friend who is in Japan and is in the business of exporting cars from Japan. I have recently got a 2010 Prius from him. I catagorically told him to get a good grade and low mileage car for me. It took him almost 1 month to get such a car as all the 2, 3 years old good cars are bought by Japanese themselves in auctions. They place higher bids which are hard to match by a person who has to cater for the duties and taxes as well. My car costed my around 2.5 million (1560000 for the car and 935000 for freight duties taxes) but it is a totall genuine low mileage car. a coleague also got one in 2.2 million and his cars traction controll sensor has already started to malfunction and give error.\n\nIf you need any further help do let me know', ''),

(568361, ' [QUOTE=Anaglyphical;403916]Salam bhai. I can''t tell you anything regarding the problem with perspective of a property expert. But I can share following things hope they are of some help:\n\n1) The Thatta and adjoining areas have great deal of issues, i.e. of course influential people.\n2) Secondly the same area is also not free from the negative elements of the society, in fact if I must say it''s a bit more affected.\n3) You have mentioned that irrigation is no issue due to a canal running on the side of the said land, but of course you also being from an agrarian background must know how many twists and turns (literally and metaphorically) lie between the lines of just having a neher besides your land and it being of any use to you.\n4) If the neher is really near the land, and the land isn''t being cultivated for sometime now, then I am sure of the damage that neher might have caused to the land in this period of time through seepage and ultimately resulting maybe say water-logging. \n5) If you want to buy the land for agricultural purposes than I think you have asked the most difficult question.(Referring to your last question). As mostly the lands of Sindh have following properties:\n\na) Alkaline in nature have high Ph.\nb) We have Saline lands here, unlike Sodiac soils they cannot be chemically amended. Meaning you will have to take the natural course of flushing the salts on the surface of the land to leach away below the root levels. And ofcourse this method is most efficient with soils that have a good drainage. But unfortunately water-logged soils don''t have a good drainage. So in that case our best bet would be to go for artificial drainage (Tile,pipe or surface). Again to make these drains maybe you might end up spending more than the per acre cost of the land itself.\n\nc) Water-logging issues can be addressed to by bringing the water table down to safe level. Now to that either you will have install I don''t know how many tube wells in the area that keep pumping the water forever until the water table reaches a safer level. However the other option that might be handy would be to plant a high density plantation of trees that are salt tolerant, and can withstand the water-logging i.e. babool for example. And that plantation would cost you 2 to 5 years until you can do something with the land. \n\nd) But lets say if we are lucky enough to have a negligible water logging issue but still our land is sodiac then it can be chemically amended by applying gypsum. Gypsum works wonders on such lands. \n\nSo there are many issues and variations in your one line question. An agrarian might be able to draw a win-win plan only once he gets correct facts and figures regarding the land conditions and its fertility. Its not rocket science its just about doing things efficiently in terms of time, money and HR.\n\nBest Regards[/QUOTE]\n\nPlease shot me an email @ [email]sultan.qureshi78@gmail.com[/email]', ''),

(568483, ' [QUOTE=hsnmz;406219]It is very true that dealers here get bad condition vehicles from Japan and sell those after repairing. If you have a reliable resource in Japan who can purchase the vehicle from Japan and ship it for you then it will be a good option. But be aware that the genuine good condition vehicles with low mileage are a bit expensive in Japan since we can only import cars that are 3 years or less old.\n\nFor example i have a friend who is in Japan and is in the business of exporting cars from Japan. I have recently got a 2010 Prius from him. I catagorically told him to get a good grade and low mileage car for me. It took him almost 1 month to get such a car as all the 2, 3 years old good cars are bought by Japanese themselves in auctions. They place higher bids which are hard to match by a person who has to cater for the duties and taxes as well. My car costed my around 2.5 million (1560000 for the car and 935000 for freight duties taxes) but it is a totall genuine low mileage car. a coleague also got one in 2.2 million and his cars traction controll sensor has already started to malfunction and give error.\n\nIf you need any further help do let me know[/QUOTE]\n\nDear hsnmz; thank you so much for a detailed note. I need a word from you sir and also from expert PG members on my scenario:\nI LOVE the JDMs due to high quality; but as demand is increasing and profits are narrowing, it is understandable that some sellers might try to repair and send cars for high profit. Plus the botheration you mentioned and price is also not that cheap for good car (Rs2.5 mil).\n\nI am thinking to shift from my TOYOTA FIELDER X (2006) only for one reason - the clearance is too low. When more than 3 person with some luggage sit then on typical speed breaker it hits it (I do not want to put spacer to lift car).\n\n\nNow WHAT if I shift to say TOYOTA ALTIS 1.6 Cruisetronic? Is it worth the money. Zero meter is Rs.2.1 mil. It as Cruise Control and is automatic (I love automatic). The hassle in getting JDM seems to be little more effort than required for me at least due to my hectic schedule! Although I am some how not a really fan of Pak assembled cars! But may be a zero meter car will serve better and re-sale will not be an issue. I am a over-cautious guy in terms of car maintenance - if car has small issues I can not tolerate that and rush to mechanic!\nPlease say what you think :) I am interested to read your mind to firm up my mind on something!\nRegards', ''),

I think I tend to be like you!!! I get tough time to digest the issues that local cars have!! Even finish is also not good. Yesterday I went to Toyota showroom (Toyota Frontier) and saw the Altis - its just OK! Not to my standard :) (sorry no offence to anyone), today they called me to inform the clearance and it is 180 mm (Fielder is around 160 mm or 155 mm). A friends told that no issue generally but he still installed spacers!!! I have to test drive his Altis today. He says he get around +18 km/ltr on highway in his Altis 1.6.\n\nToday also visited Honda North - saw the Oriel - not impressive if price is brought in!!! They also did not know the clearance and factory is closed they can tell me on Monday the clearance - WHAT AN EXPERTISE!!!!\n\nCan you please share how much was your spacer? I mean 1 inch or 1/2 inch etc. ?? Did you drove on highway at 120 km/hr or more? Were you still satisfied with it?\n\nOne last question - how do you compare my 2006 Fielder with 2013 Altis in terms of its age? Devaluation etc? I just need insight on that aspect as well!\nGod Bless you,\nRegards', ''),

Today the Honda North people were claiming that they have risen the Reborn! How much? Answer is awaited from the factory Tech on Monday! I agree to you here as buyer you do not even get complete specs of you car!!! Forget about quality. Let me quote an incident - where I work, under my control I have lot of specialized equipment and for lifting we have 5 ton fork lift.  Some students had an accident of their 2012 or 2013 Honda reborn (head on with a tree) and police requested me to provide them the lifter. My technicians latter informed me that the air bags of the Honda did not OPEN!!!!!! Ohhhh boy!!!! Then why someone paid the huge price of two SRS bags installed at front??? Corolla Altis has one driver side SRS air bag - no idea what to expect God for bid if an accident is to occur! Space - yes they have huge space!\n\nConclusion!!! Honestly I am confused :) \n1. Should I stick to my Corolla Fielder 2006? \n2. Should I go to PAK car? Due to the reason that 2006 is getting old now (apart from low ground clearance)?', ''),

If you want to check the verification get a photo copy of your licence. I will let you know how to get it verified. This verification I am suggesting only due to that you said you have made it directly by yourself. \n\n@ Ajmal bro good suggestion . But there is a second way to get Lic verified. Every dealer has a performa which they have made for the verification purpose. They just write on their letter pad to the arms branch that the Lic holder wants to purchase a new arms so just verified us that the Lic and the details are genuine. Then the arms branch check there record and if the Lic is original and genuine they put a verified stamp on the photo copy and return back to dealer. This is a easy way to check the license.

You need to order the following to avoid road bumps with full load car:\n\n1: Genuine Standard Height Springs made by KYB Japan\n2: Genuine Dampness Adjustable Shock Absorber made by KYB Japan\n\nYour car springs seem to have become softer and the shock absorbers are also getting weak. Cars like Corolla, Honda, Nissan etc are designed for 5 years before replacements are required (unlike high end cars like S class Merc, Lexus etc are meant to last 8-10yrs or so before problems start, hence the big price differences).\n\nFresh springs and adjustable damping shocks should fix your issue of fully loaded car clearence. When fully loaded, you will need to set the damping to higher stiffness (adjustabililty nut will be on top of the shocks and will range from 1-8 clicks usually and it may even have dial showing numbers) plus increase in tyre pressure is a must for a fully loaded car. Once its not fully loaded, then adjust back to your normal driving dampness and tyre pressures. But one thing you must be aware that increasing the stiffness of dampness will make it a bumpier ride but you will avoid hitting the bottom of the car.\n\nI would strongly advise against putting spacers on a tiring 7yrs old suspension let alone a brand new one. This is not a ride height adjustable hydraulic suspension system that is designed for ride height increase by press of a button. Suspension dynamics are very different on non-ride height adjustable (most cars). Ride height adjustable hydraulic suspension have so many components designed as such that there is no adverse effect on rest of the suspension. Whereas increasing ride height by spacers for non hydraulic suspension, it will start ruining the rest of the suspension. \n\nI''m not talking out of my *** as I''ve built track race cars and getting the balance and alignment (toe, camber, caster) of the car needs adjusting for each type of track.\n\nSpacers on suspension and wheel spacers for those who want the wheels to stick out more for show off purposes ruins the handling and puts extreme stresses on rest of the system. Chassis engineering including suspension design are the toughest part in designing a car, and most major manufacturers are not stupid to roll out a car that has poor chassis and suspension design, especially JDM imports.\n\nJust get the full set of 4 dampness adjustable shocks and new springs and that should resolve your issue.

What to use apart from diesel/oil under body for safe lubrication ?[/QUOTE]\n\nDear @ THEGAME787 - you do not need to spray diesel/oil spray - NO LUBRICATION required for underside. It is bad myth that people have carried for so many years now! I use cleaning agent such surf/shampoo for cleaning the underside of the car. The ONLY big advantage for which I take my car to typical service stations is high pressure water and pneumatic jack that lifts the car for underside cleaning with high pressure water - THAT''S ALL!\n\n2ndly engine does not require ANY cleaning washing at ALL! WHY to wash it? Almost every new car has a dirt/water sheet installed below. In heavy rain even; it will stop the mud to fly in!!!! I 95% time use air to blow of any dust etc. I remember only once in 2yrs plus time to spray water in only 10% of engine area close to radiator for cleaning. Please remember our typical car engines are WATER RESISTANT to some extent (indeed nothing happens very quickly) BUT not WATER PROOF. Military vehicles usually have WATER PROOF engines which can be even submerged. So my suggestion to avoid direct water spray on to engine - if by any chance you get into trouble then you will be consumed to fix it!!!! I have seen few EFI cars of friends tackling the aftermath of cleaning engine with water :)\n\nNo lubrication needed for the chassis NOR for engine for cleaning etc! \n\n[B][U][COLOR=#ff0000][SIZE=5]ANOTHER IMP Fact[/SIZE][/COLOR][/U]:[/B] Please remember parts made up of rubber such as rubber bush; seals, cables etc. installed in engine or chassis can only be dissolved by organic material such as oil/diesel and NOT by water. The life of such rubber parts will reduce significantly if you use very often the diesel/oil spray on to your car. Our Hon.

(569002, ' [QUOTE=Dr_Gilani;406810]\nFew points/questions that I request you for my better understanding.\n1. You said the dampers can be adjusted manually - will the knobe/screw be accessible in an installed car to change/adjust it easily?\n2. Any idea if those are available in PAK? I will surely try to locate myself also.\n3. Any idea of cost for springs and dampers if imported? And a guess of price if available in PAK?\n\nRegards[/QUOTE]\n\n1. Front shocks damping can be adjusted right at the top of the schock rod, at the shock mount under the front hood. Rear shocks are sometimes top adjustable (in the boot of the car at shock mounts) or just behind the wheel (a black knob). It will take no more than 10 minutes and you dont need to to do this on a ramp or remove the rear wheels.\n\n2. KYB AGX are the type you want. When I was looking for my vti, no one I know stocked them locally and needed to be imported.\n\n3. In UK, a set of 4 AGX shocks my Honda Accord Type R were around £350 for the set, and another £120 or thereabouts for the stock ride (not lowering) springs/coils. \n\n[url]http://www.kyb-europe.com/catalogue.asp[/url] you can search for parts by putting in the full chassis number.\n\nIf you don''t get any luck, please post your cars manufacturing year and chassis code, exluding the build number which is usually digits (such as 0004567 etc) after the chassis/model code then I can ask my cousin in UK to call KYB in UK and get you prices provided AGX is made for your car chassis. Does it start by E14 by any chance? To get the exact shocks and springs, KYB will usually ask for the full chassis number to get the exact parts for you.\n\nFor reference, almost all Japanese cars shocks and coils/springs are KYB manufactured (just as most parts like brakes, radiators, alternators etc are outsourced) but they are sold white labelled for car manufacturers to have their own colours, logos and part numbers on them. And cost 60% less to buy from KYB than buying from the manufacturer. \n\nIf KYB doesn''t make the AGX shocks then it will be to the coilovers setup (height and damping both adjustable) such as Tien and some others. But those are usually for fast road and race cars use.', ''),

First, I have LOG of each refuel that I do with KM noted and liters put-in and route that I traveled. Since I use this car for highway long drives so not a big hassle to note this in my cars LOG BOOK that I have prepared my self. Since, above figures were memory based NOW what I will do is on Monday will instruct my assistant to type-in ALL the 2 years record into MS-Excel and will do the exact number crunching for each trip and average of average etc. :) No worries not too many entries and a person to assist me :). \n\nI hope we are considering the same engine size also. My fielder is 1498 cc!!\n\nSecondly, I am using the manufacturer''s recommended tyre size 185/70/R14 so issue of distance and/or speed due to PLUS sizing is at least ruled out!!!. \n\nThird, I do recall 2 years back I also used a GPS to check my speed - I do not recall any issue. Also on motorway I some times tend to drive to permissible speeds above 120km/hr which is around or lil less to 130 km/hr (as you said also). ALHUMDULLIAH I have never been stopped by motorway police :).\n\nMy friend in Lahore had GLI (I guess 2010) informed me that he gets hardly 12 km/lit (in agreement to your figures), I know he is telling me rough values. I have spoken with many who own PASSO which is 1000 CC they also report around 15 km/lit on highway. I have spoken to many who own Fielder they give the same range as I am telling that is 16-17km/lit (say an overall avg) few have told me that it was 18+.\n\nOne difference that I have noticed and have already said is the RPM. The corolla JDM has 3000 rpm at 120km/hr, whereas Pak corolla has 4000 rpm at around 120 km/hr. you can imagine the difference!\n\nBTW the Toyota Frontier guys few days back told me that their new Dual VVTI Altis 1.6 has 14 km/lt. To which I said too LOW!!! Then after good long discussion they revealed that in some of their tests it went up to 18 km/lt. They do not tell ppl becoz Then every one will come and hold them for 14 or 15 km/lt so they keep them self on safe side. My friend who owns an Altis 1.6 also reported 17-18 km/lit on his new Altis 2013. So point is the PAK coroall is also struggling to bring up their mileage. It was not true for old model of corolla like of your parents. Well as you know mileage depends on many many factors!!!\n\n40 PSI :) lol', ''),

Also very accurate, I''ve shot over 4000 pellets through mine and killed several larger pest animals (and i mean 4 legged creatures) with it (between 25-40 yards).

(569188, 'Baikal MP-513m  Lube tune and Installation of Picatinny Scope Rail I wanted to have an air rifle in .177 cal. It was about two months back when I started to search for something different. Out of few options, this Russian exotic looking airgun caught my eye. Some information available on net was mixed reviews and strange comments. After Few days I bought it home from Orient Traders.\n\nIt looked smart, was amazingly light weight, and shot like hell.\nYes, some one wrote in his comments that it shoots like a car crash, and it does.\nThings I liked instantly after few shots was that it was light weight, shot quite accurately and gave a real punch (not only to the target but to my right shoulder as well). So the first modification I did was to give a soft padding to hard plastic butt pad. \n\nMost of it is made of Aluminium, Stock is wood and very fine quality wood, I liked it. In .177 cal it shoots very fast indeed. There was little bit of dieseling in first dozen shots or so, and they went supersonic with a loud TOOONG, then it settled down close to its advertised velocity of about 1000 fps.\n\nIt liked an absolute light artillery hold. As it was shooting quite accurately with open sights, so after about 6-7 hundred shots I decided to mount a scope. and then after some more shootin I felt that there is movement in the scope rail. Why, scope rail was not properly fixed, whatever, but it was not acceptable.\nI removed the scope rail, it was difficult but some effort and scope rail was off. It was straight and in good condition, could be reused, but I decided to completely de-assemble it, clean up all the internals and give it proper lubing and install picatinny rail for scope.\n\nFinally today that project is completed, it is again shooting with the same vigor and the scope rail is solidly in place (at least so far, I hope it will stay).\n\nThis is gun with the old scope rail.\n\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]26441[/ATTACH]\n\nScrews attaching the wooden stock to action were very tight, so it took some effort to un-screw these. there are three screws, two on sides and one on back of trigger guard.\n\nNext step is to separate trigger assembly from action. Before doing it pull the trigger and hold it there with some thread or rubber band, I learned it the hard way.\n\nThen barrel pivot screw is removed to separate barrel from action.\n\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]26442[/ATTACH]\n\nBarrel kept aside, I had no spring compressor, so some make shift compressor arrangement done, I was careful, but it proved to be easy, done in few minutes.\n\nHere is the picture after getting the spring out.\n\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]26443[/ATTACH]\n\nAll lube was removed from piston spring and outer spring housing. \nScope rail is attached using same holes on the action, I had to drill and taper new holes on the rail. Araldite delayed settin type was used to attach the rail and new screws were tightened from inside as originally done.\n\nI gave it two days to dry up and bond strongly and it did well, screws too made tight grip and I hope it will not move now.\n\nHere the new rail is installed.\n\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]26444[/ATTACH]\n\nEnds of spring were rough and needed buffing, so did it.\n\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]26445[/ATTACH]\n\nAfter proper lubing of spring and piston and playing with two tiny metal balls to re insert them where they originally came from every thing is ready to be done.\n\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]26446[/ATTACH]\n\nHere is the spring compressor set up, I took care and all went well.\n\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]26447[/ATTACH]\n\nBarrel needed some lubing of washers.\n\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]26448[/ATTACH]\n\nMost of the work done now.\n\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]26449[/ATTACH]\n\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]26450[/ATTACH]\n\nTrigger assembly was washed , lubed and reattached.

(569238, ' Thanks Jibz brother,regarding One Piece Mount, It definitely improves accuracy, especially in magnum air rifles with violent recoil and vibration. I have one piece mounts on my two other air guns, and it does make a difference.\nAfter installing the scope base and scope I shot only 6 pellets, purpose was to check that gun is working properly, scope is not way out of alignment, that it cant be zeroed, and scope base stays in place. I was not concentrating much on accuracy.\nI optically zeroed the scope first. After mounting, first shot was few inches low and to left, but playing with windage and elevation turrents, I was able to bring point of aim to point of impact. It means that with some shimming of the scope, I will need even less turrent adjustment and this set up will work fine. Gun was not rested on any thing solid, just my hand.\n\nIn fact on a powerful air gun, no screws can firmly hold the scope base, however tight they are. we have to create a bond, a chemical weld in fact. Araldite, delayed setting variety was the strongest I could find locally. I still want to give it 2-3 more days to bond strongly. I hope scope base will not move then. Welding (electrical or silver weld) was possible but it has its own flaws, so I preferred this Epoxy Glue for this purpose.\n\nAfter few days I will shim the scope, re-zero it on the gun and then go for accuracy potential. Previously with open sights, it had above average accuracy. The key point in hold is, Dont Pull it at all to your shoulder, it should just lightly touch your shoulder.\n\nIn this set up, I have used two piece mount, but it is a four screw mount on each piece, it also gives better contact and relatively solid grip.', ''),

(569335, ' The Nevada upside-down holster came in today. It''s this one: Upside Down Shoulder Holster\n\nSo far I like it a lot. It took a bit of adjustment to get it to hang properly. The cylinder and butt tuck right in, and there is only slight movement if I bend over and pick something up, raise my arms over my head, etc. \n\nThe holster rides much further toward my back than the picture indicates. This is likely due to my "rotund" physique. Even though it''s a left-hand holster, it''s not easy to draw the gun left-handed; if I don''t want to spin around like a dog chasing its tail, I have to use my right hand to keep the holster from moving backwards away from my hand when I''m reaching for it. On the other hand, it''s very easy to pull the gun with my *right* hand. It sounds unlikely, but I just stick my elbow out, curl my palm up, and pull. Fortunately I don''t have any problem shooting right-handed at self-defense range.\n\nThe gun is a 2" revolver. The holster wraps around between the grip and the trigger guard, with a solid leather insert to hold the weight. The top of the holster, along the backstrap, is split like a clamshell holster, except the gap has elastic sewn into it. When you push the gun into the holster, the elastic stretches until the guard clears the leather insert. You can just yank the gun out, but a slight tilt will let it slide out easily. My wife wants me to wait a while before modifying the holster by adding a strap, so I''ll carry the gun with an empty chamber under the hammer until I see how the retention system fares against chair arms, guard rails, etc. The Taurus has a transfer bar, but I''m just a bit leery about looking down my own muzzle as the back of the gun hits concrete...\n\nIt takes both hands to holster the gun with this rig; a firm grip on both the gun and the holster while you work the trigger guard around into the pocket against the elastic and the stiff sides against the cylinder. I had figured as much before I ordered it, so it was no surprise.', '');

(569336, ' I''ve only had a chance to wear the Nevada holster a few times when out and about, but I''m generally happy with it. The wide part of the harness over my collarbone tends to pucker up a bit, probably due to my shape. \r\n\r\nThe only real annoyance is fastening the seat belt. One of my cars has the newer-style belt with the buckle more or less underneath my right buttcheek, which is hard to manipulate even with just a T-shirt. With a coat, it''s much harder, and with the holster, harder yet. I managed to dislodge the gun from the holster while fighting the buckle. Getting the gun back in required some youtube-worthy contortions; it''s an awkward process while you''re wearing the holster, made more so by being buckled into the seat. Any bystanders would have wondered if I was having some kind of seizure.\r\n\r\nTwo of my other vehicles have seat belt extenders. I think I''m going to order one for this vehicle too. The belt is plenty long enough from the factory, but moving the buckle up where I can reach it would really be nice.\r\n\r\n\r\nAn unforseen feature of the upside-down holster is that it is immune to what I call the "Chee-To Effect." Back when I wore a belt holster on the job, the holster seemed to collect lint, dust bunnies, bits of food, and food-like substances such as chee-tos. Since the Nevada holster is upside-down, the only thing that can fall out is the gun... I''m still leery about that, and will report back later on how that works out.', ''),

Electric start, enough storage space to be useful, light and easy to handle around town.\n\n Before arthritis forced me to hang up my helmet, I had a 1200cc bike.  Oh, yes, it was great being able to hoon around on the highway, but it sucked to ride in town.  It was heavy, cranky at low throttle settings, and had no storage space.  Well, I could take the seat off, and there was a spot in the tail housing you could jam something the size of a pack of cigarettes into, though you might have to crush it a little first.  A lot of times I''d take the car into town, because I needed to pick something up that wouldn''t fit into the tailbag that rode strapped across the seat most of the time.\n\n Many times, I would be sitting in traffic, trying not to get cramps in my left arm from the stiff clutch, wishing I still had the Kawasaki 90 that was my first bike, or the Kawasaki 175 I had after that.  Sure, not much good for the kind of thousand-mile road trips I could make on the big bike, but most of my miles were in town.  I don''t remember how many miles I put on the 90, but I put 32,000 miles on the 175 in a year and a half, which was probably more than I put on any other vehicle I''ve owned since.\n\n I''m never going to be able to do long rides on a big bike again, but I sure could rack up some miles on a little Suzuki like that.  Except they don''t sell anything like that in my country.\n\n I think I''m jealous.', ''),

A lot of times I''d take the car into town, because I needed to pick something up that wouldn''t fit into the tailbag that rode strapped across the seat most of the time.\n\n Many times, I would be sitting in traffic, trying not to get cramps in my left arm from the stiff clutch, wishing I still had the Kawasaki 90 that was my first bike, or the Kawasaki 175 I had after that.  Sure, not much good for the kind of thousand-mile road trips I could make on the big bike, but most of my miles were in town.  I don''t remember how many miles I put on the 90, but I put 32,000 miles on the 175 in a year and a half, which was probably more than I put on any other vehicle I''ve owned since.\n\n I''m never going to be able to do long rides on a big bike again, but I sure could rack up some miles on a little Suzuki like that.

Caracal owners are by far the most important for us. The only reason your question might have been over looked because it was answered before here at the same forum. Caracal USA is totally a different entity. It has been established through the research that there might been some potential fault in the Pistols which were sent to the USA. However, the research department still didn''t find any trace that any of those potential pistols were shipped to pakistan. Still, as per the order of the Board the trained has traveled to pakistan and inspecting randomly some pistols which have been sent to Pakistan. Even if there is no trace still our majority of the board is in favor to replace the part on all pistols delivered in pakistan to make sure that all Caracal customers can sleep with peace. Apart from the replacement of the parts, the Caracal pisyol owners will also be given a free magazine, Caracal T - shirt , Caracal Cap and thank you letter from Caracal. We assure you that our team will not sleep in peace till they provide you complete satisfaction. Regards, Dr. Kaiser Rafiq - Managing Director Royal Emirates Group.

Review this video which we shot in Shakar Parian (Islamabad) a couple of years ago. First shot was not well placed, but second shot was placed at only a few feet, when the boar was charging on us for a head on attack, still we could not let the animal suffer for long, and had to finish off with a No. 4 followed by a No.6 in the head at point blank range.

And with a russian make, it means you can trust it will be hard and reliable unlike some of the europe/america made guns.\n\nNow that I was already thinking about getting a .22 rifle, this is definitely the thing I would purchase. The handgun would have to wait :p. I can''t wait to lay my hands on this lady as soon as I get my wheat harvest money. Going to read it''s details (magazine capacity, range, recoil, weight and error frequency) online. With a baikal make, I think I wouldn''t be disappointed with it.\n\nThank youuu.', ''),

(569833, 'Building an off-roader Jeep Salam All\n\nAfter a few trips to the farmhouse, Mrs and I have come to a conclusion that we need a 4WD jeep not only for rough roads but to go exploring the country. We both like the one 2 seater CJ7 model, CJ5 is ok too but not sure if it can take a 3000cc petrol engine and transmission with aircon and heater fitment.\n\nMajority have advised to get one from army auction but ISB plate is a must as we live in ISB. And the same have suggested to take it to Peshawar to get everything including engine, interior and full suspension and 4WD system fitted - a coaster and pajero parts. Been told that someone in Pindi also prepares these jeeps. \n\nSourcing the chassis (an original jeep) and the right parts is the main issue (from very reliable and not conmen) that fit are main issues for me. Once the right parts including a solid engine and 4WD system including full suspension are in hand, getting it all fitted with excellent work is something I can manage with a right mechanic, denter, electrician and painter and have no issues getting my hands dirty in the process too, in fact prefer to be fully involved in the build it so I know it is done properly without cutting any corners, and to do it right first time around instead of fixing all sorts of problems later.\n\nWould really appreciate some pointers and pitfalls to avoid. And if anyone can help direct in sourcing a a straigh chassis jeep and parts from highly recommended source that would be great help.\n\nWe want the following:\n- Powerful Petrol engine (3000CC+ will be fine too), 4WD transmission and suspension that can handle the output of the engine without any hiccups\n- Airconditioner - a must\n- Heater - a must\n- most are fitted with Pajero dashboards so that or some other option if available?\n- chassis strengthening and roll bars\n- front seats (off any new''ish 4x4 like Cygnus etc) with custom doors, and waterproof zip up top covering full rear.\n\nI''m sure some of our hunting PG brothers own or have driven such custom jeeps.\n\nAny direction and advice is appreciated as this project will start as soon as our second car (barely used Nissan March) is sold.', ''),

(569918, ' Membership card will cause legal issues as the club will need to become a legal entity to issue membership cards. And selling mechandise would require sole trader/company registration, an e-shop, GST filling etc .... everything has to be done legally to avoid a closure of the forum and forum is far more important as it is full of invaluable information for local and international users/viewers.\n\nFor an e-shop, a new separate website setup will be required. Technical support, customer service ... we are talking of a business then and these resources cost.\n\nStickers for cars, caps, and badges (to be sown on jackets or bags) are something that may just be exempt from forming a legal entity. I know that free stickers for cars and for gun packaging plastic boxes will be fine. But to be on the safe side, this should be outsourced to an approved supplier to sell (for a price) so that no money goes in and out of the club and that club is not making any profit out of it. That way, club authorises the use of its logo to only one of few suppliers on selected and approved products, most importantly makes no money with no financial transactions whatsoever. That the onus/liability of taxes and GST filling falls on the supplier/seller instead of the club.\n\nAs its a free for all to join club, it is not a legal entity. So the moment club starts selling anything directly, it all has to change. And we shouldnt expect Abbbas bhai to fork out all the administrative manpower and costs associated with running an e-shop.

Either of the two can lead to destruction of the weapon and injury or death of the shooter.\nBoth rounds are interchangeable, I have been shooting both civil and military rounds in both military and sporting rifles for nearly 50 years.\nThe military rounds have stronger cases for automatic operation in machine guns and are loaded down when compared with hunting rounds which are much hotter. \nSome authorities just want to fling their mystical knowledge by splitting hairs.\nA G3  fires 6000 rds of mil ammo to pass the wear test. I dont think it will go beyond 5000 in case of sporting ammo as it is about 8 to 10 % hotter. The Military ammo is safe in sporting rifles.

Trust is the main factor here.\n\nI and others used to do this for a Honda forum in UK when importing modification parts from USA/Japan. And it didn''t make me a trader in the eyes of the law as it was a group purchase where I made no profit.\n\nI like Group Buy approach.

We both like the one 2 seater CJ7 model, CJ5 is ok too but not sure if it can take a 3000cc petrol engine and transmission with aircon and heater fitment.\n\nMajority have advised to get one from army auction but ISB plate is a must as we live in ISB. And the same have suggested to take it to Peshawar to get everything including engine, interior and full suspension and 4WD system fitted - a coaster and pajero parts. Been told that someone in Pindi also prepares these jeeps. \n\nSourcing the chassis (an original jeep) and the right parts is the main issue (from very reliable and not conmen) that fit are main issues for me. Once the right parts including a solid engine and 4WD system including full suspension are in hand, getting it all fitted with excellent work is something I can manage with a right mechanic, denter, electrician and painter and have no issues getting my hands dirty in the process too, in fact prefer to be fully involved in the build it so I know it is done properly without cutting any corners, and to do it right first time around instead of fixing all sorts of problems later.\n\nWould really appreciate some pointers and pitfalls to avoid. And if anyone can help direct in sourcing a a straigh chassis jeep and parts from highly recommended source that would be great help.\n\nWe want the following:\n- Powerful Petrol engine (3000CC+ will be fine too), 4WD transmission and suspension that can handle the output of the engine without any hiccups\n- Airconditioner - a must\n- Heater - a must\n- most are fitted with Pajero dashboards so that or some other option if available?\n- chassis strengthening and roll bars\n- front seats (off any new''ish 4x4 like Cygnus etc) with custom doors, and waterproof zip up top covering full rear.\n\nI''m sure some of our hunting PG brothers own or have driven such custom jeeps.\n\nAny direction and advice is appreciated as this project will start as soon as our second car (barely used Nissan March) is sold.[/QUOTE]\nPak Wheels has dozens n dozens of restoration threads covering all these aspects, i would one day go for a 4X4 project whenever i get the funds :) .... but if u intend to keep it and use it as a 4x4, u shud get it restored urself.', ''),

And therein lies the crux of the matter, beneath the boring, bland and frankly ugly exterior of the glock lies a raging monster that rewards patient students with a sound ferocity and deadlines equal to many if not all of its competitors. Its not a forgiving handgun and any mistake on your part is sure to disappoint and frustrate you but get it all right grip, breathing, trigger control, follow through and man oh man does the gun reward you by punching holes  within holes.  Is it for everyone no, is it the only gun I like hell no, I love my CZs I love shooting my friends SIG and i find the Beretta 92fs down right gorgeous but there is no other gun that surprises or rewards you like a Glock, I can attest to that it surprises me every time I shoot it.\n\nOh also before I put it away\n\n[IMG]http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7292/10944965495_d8dc326d52_c.jpg[/IMG]\n\nThe advantage arms conversion kit, ammo limits aren''t an issue here like in Pakistan (boooooooooooo) but ammo and its costs are a bane on shooters everywhere. If you like Glocks you know how important trigger time is as the trigger is very different from anything else. The advantage arms kit lets you practice trigger control for cheap and has greatly improved my shooting with centre-fire ammo. Anyway thanks for reading Salaam', ''),

(570245, ' I''d contact the Pakistan Embassy in the USA, explain what I wanted to do, and ask them what procedure needs to be followed.\n\n As usual, write down the name of each person you talk to, when you spoke to them, and what they tell you.  Many cellphones and MP3 players have recording functions which can be helpful when trying to write after the conversation is over.\n\n Be clear, ask specific questions, get definite answers.  Be respectful, but firm if you need to.  \n\n Dealing with any government, anywhere, paper RULES.  Print each page of any relevant regulations you find, and organize them into a notebook with an index and a table of contents.  No bureaucrat wants to get reprimanded, many don''t want to ask questions of their superiors, and most will deny anything by default.  I''d print out the entire paper trail from beginning to end, whether it''s directly relevant or not.  There''s no such thing as "too much paper" when dealing with officialdom.\n\n The ATF also has some export paperwork; I''m not sure if it applies to private individuals or just business exporters, but they have a searchable web site.\n\n Actually shipping the gun involves only following TSA regulations and sending it as checked luggage instead of carry-on.  The gun is "in transit" until it clears Pakistan customs, at which point Pakistan laws take over.\n\n If you intend to bring the gun back into the United States later, you need to check on things before you leave.

(570249, 'on slings I have a rifle that I might want to carry on a two or three day hike.  To do that, I figured I needed a sling.  So I went off looking at slings, and as so often happens, wandered off into the Land of Confusion.\r\n\r\n First off, what is now called a sling is what used to be called a "shooting sling"; often a three-strap arrangement designed to stabilize the rifle for shooting, as opposed to carrying.  What I knew as a "sling" is now a "carry strap."\r\n\r\n All that would be fine, except no two manufacturers seem to agree which is which, and they may sell apparently-identical products as one or the other.\r\n\r\n I was wondering where I should put the sling swivels.  If there are any instructions at all, they are like "decide where the swivel needs to go, then dri..."  Well, the "where" is what I''m trying to find out...\r\n\r\n The rifle I''m working with is a sporterized SMLE.  I could duplicate its sling, er, strap mounts... but I haven''t figured out whether the factory setup was optimized for carrying the rifle or for shooting it; the British rifleman''s manual shows wrapping an arm through the sling to steady the rifle, but you can do that with any sort of strap.\r\n\r\n I haven''t even found anything about how long the sling has to be; most pictures show the strap rigged tightly, but it looks like you''d want the sling to arch over your shoulder so the rifle is hanging, as opposed to a shorter strap, which would pinch the barrel against your shoulder.\r\n\r\n I can figure it out eventually, and the ugly stock won''t be damaged by a few trial-fit holes, but it''s strange that there''s so little information on mounting and rigging a sling.  As many soldiers and hunters who have dragging a heavy rifle around for weeks or months, you''d expect they''d all have definite and loud opinions on the matter.', ''),

Submit Fee: Come down again and go towards the area where all the agents sit. there is this UBL OMNI person. he charges PKR 100 extra. his justification for the extra charge is that he is facilitating us by coming all the way there. \r\n\r\nStep 3. Obtain Form: Go back to the first floor of the DCO office again and obtain the form. The person there will make an entry in his register of the form number against your CNIC.\r\n\r\nStep 4. Fill in the form with black ink. (the instructions are on the back of the form) get all the required documents attested and attach with the form. (to save mutiple trips you can get the documents attested from the same area where the UBL Omni fee was paid. they charge somehwere between PKR 100 - 150.  \r\n\r\nStep 5.

The difference was, one had the original standard length barrel, and the other had an extended barrel. Both were the same price, but I preferred the long barrel. However, only the original (short) barrel was chrome lined. Now I won''t lie and say it made no difference at all. The chrome was appealing, for does have it''s merits. So I thought about it for half a minute, bought the one I wanted... the one with no chrome, and I shoot corrosive ammo through it regularly, without a second thought, I scrub it out after each use, it still looks good as new after 2000+ rounds, and I have no regrets. When I look at that gun, I NEVER think "I should have got the chrome lined barrel". But, if I got the other one, I know I''d be thinking "I should have got the long barrel" EVERYTIME I looked at it.

Because, it shall cause just waste of time due to the staff sitting on benches of such departments need serious competencies to maintain and manage inquiries. Further, please note, they also are out of their respective  documentary stocks. Even  though they are unaware of many aspects of the  procedures and just misleading and bothering to law abiding and tax payer citizens. Thus,punishment of law keeping in the beloved country.\n\nOn the other hand, just keep in view that, this is just only for generating revenue / kick backs and to control inflation beside dishearten law abiding citizens and to divert  them to other means!!!!!!!!!!.\n\nIn the light of the above, if MOI is serious to really computerize and issue Cards in my opinion this is the only way they they must obtain data of all required arms licenses from their renewal spots / banks / post offices etc., ''while every year tax is already receiving to the government in such manner'' and they must issue and post/provide cards at their end  to all respective authorities  they obtained data and at the time of their renewal the such authority may deliver the card to the license holder on receipt of their service charges including Original Booklet and duly acknowledge for their satisfactory.\n\nThe above procedure shall not even be simplest for the common man/citizen of the beloved country but shall prevent any kick back/misleading to the license holder.\n\n \n\n\n\n[QUOTE=BUKHARI;408464]Brothers,\nWhen Mr.Rehman Malik started the validation process of MOI licenses in 2011, i complied with it and submitted all the requirements with the fee accordingly at the NADRA office.

Since I being very SKEPTIC person from stand point of technical issues ...... feel 100% satisfied with P01; this is my first response. WHY for following reasons:\n\n1. Your comments are very helpful and encouraging in terms of FTE and has further strengthened my personal understanding.\n\nThe FTE was not the one in which the case remained sitting in chamber - it moved - it came close to partial ejection - the SLIDER moved about 1/2 inch - case was visible in EJECTION PORT. I removed the magazine and as soon as I moved the slider backward the case fell out.\n\n2. I have three videos. The first one with FTE, the only part that my partner captured was SLIDER in 1/2 inch backward state. Videos were essentially to show the rapid fire. But anyways I will try to load this movie also.\n\n3. I am going to make sure to fire 300 rounds in near future now - to get over the break in phase.\n\n4. From field performance, being first hand observer, discussion feel like that OIL was the main culprit. So this will be always now be my point of concern.\n\n5. Any comment in the use of 16 bullet magazine of CZ 75B?\n\nRegards', ''),

Baikal viking Mp446 is the best gun in the market in 55-60k price bracket. But if you really want a good CC gun, then i think in the budget of 45k you can get a Baikal Mp442 Makarov. Both in Double stack and single stack mag. Mak is a awesome gun to shoot and very reliable and accurate and also small, light and compact. On the other hand this is the exact price range of NP42 gen2. Which is slightly bigger but also a proper 9mm with 15 round mag capacity compared to Maks 12 round in double stack and 8 shots in single. But maks got history and class that no other gun has.

No more words to agree more than 100% to B-King. I have been always writing on PG Forums that in REAL world when it comes to engineering products (any thing) - there is NO such thing as FAIL PROOF; UN-BREAKABLE; etc. etc. In real world all what is real is the [B]PROBABILITY[/B]. Everything revolves around probability; chances of occurrence of something. BUT this does not inherently means that ALL engineering products (guns, cars, machines etc.) have SAME PROBABILITY OF FAILURE. [U]NO this is not true[/U]. BEST engineered products would have the LEAST Probability of failure and badly engineered or poorly engineered or non-engineered products would have very high rates of failures.  Comparisons should always be made under SIMILAR conditions.\nFollowing parameters would ensure least probability of failure:\n\n1. Good design (Designer''s responsibility)\n2. Good craftsmanship (manufacturer''s responsibility)\n3. Good habits of using it (User''s responsibility; ensuring that user is operating it under the parameters of designer)\n4. Good maintenance (user''s responsibility and to some extent seller''s/supplier support in providing good support of their product)\n\nAny thing wrong in above - disaster SHOULD be expected ANY time - like B-King has shared with us!\n\nI have already spoken a great deal on TOLERANCE in some of the post. I 100% agree to B-King that if you do not use good ammo (you are violating the requirements set in DESIGN - be ready for disaster)..\n\nRegards', ''),

This is designed to ensure the dirtiest and some what oversized round to feed without a hiccup. This contributes to its legendry functional  reliability.\nYet this strictly precludes the use of reloads  as a case when fired a number of times is weakened in this area and if the weakened area falls in the unsupported area of the chamber it will blow and the down wards escape of gas will blow the frame to pieces and the resultant upward force will split the chamber in exactly this way.\nPlease DO NOT use reloads in a Glock and also Never Never use Local ammo with improper cases.\nIf you must reload then buy a barrel with supported chamber available from USD 70 to 150. And locally from 40,000/- to 70000/-\nAlso never use lead bullets as its Rifling Profile accumalates lead causing very high pressures.  \nWell putting petrol in your favourite diesel land cruiser will blow up its fuel pump.\nGlocks with a small proof mark showing a pentagon with a small dot in it on the barrel means it has more support but I will never recommend any one to use handloads or lead bullets in any Glock.

Imagine an airline that has only first class seats and provides first class service, but, they charge economy prices. How popular would they be? Now if they did everything the same, but increased the price five times, what makes them any different from other companies offering first class accommodation for first class prices?\nPakistan''s market is unique, but if Glocks cost $1500 elsewhere (or imagine them selling for 1,000,000rupees in Pak) that throws the whole equation out the window, and they would not enjoy a fraction of the popularity they do today. At that point, they would no longer possess a clear advantage in any one area, since other guns in that range (HK, Sig, FN) can, and do, offer just as much if not more. \nAt least thats how I see it. My favorite combat pistols are Sig P22x''s. However, I still have Glocks since they are so affordable, and theyre reliable, and everyone else has one, and so on and so forth.

Not “game” as in the classic sense of an elegantly understated British side-by-side, but something resembling what a Civil War-era press agent — in describing the Spencer Carbine — referred to as a “horizontal shot tower.” In other words, a delivery system for quickly putting as much birdshot, buckshot or slugs downrange to allow you to smack stuff down faster than the other guys.\n\n\nNow we have the Beretta 1301 Competition. And make no mistake about it, in terms of dealing with plates or steel silhouette targets — or even aerial ones — this competition/tactical smoothbore might be the optimum tool for the job. It’s fast indeed, featuring a rotating bolt and revamped — and simplified — gas operation comprising the Blink system (which premiered on the A400 a couple of years back). Beretta claims that you can fire four shots in a second with it (I came kinda close to that but didn’t have a timer to verify).\n\n\nThe specimen we got in featured a 21-inch barrel with a full-length extended magazine tube. A 24-inch-barrel version is available for those who prefer, but if we had our druthers, we’d stick with the shorter one.\n\n\nThe most noticeable aspects of the 1301 are the oversize controls — bolt handle, bolt release and crossbolt safety button (reversible for lefties). The bolt release consists of a large, serrated tab right below the ejection port. It’s very quick to access from under the receiver with your support hand (assuming you’re right-handed). One caveat: If you’re carrying the gun with the bolt locked back, do not grasp the receiver over the top. You may get a nasty surprise if an errant finger trips that oversize release (yes, I did discover that the hard way).\n\n\nThe “oversize theme” of the 1301 is continued in the large ejection and loading ports. In competition, reloading speed is as important as “hitting the target” speed. And anything that helps out there, and saves your thumb from abuse in the process, is a good thing, as anyone who has ever been on a dove hunt in Argentina can tell you.\n\n\nThe synthetic stock is short, but has an adjustable length of pull (13 to 141/2 inches). The texturing is more than aggressive enough for a nonslip grip. The 1301 does not come with ghost-ring or open, rifle-type sights, just a large, red, fiber optic front and a midbead on a wide, sporting-type rib. The receiver is drilled and tapped for a rail mount, as some 3-Gun guys may want to modify the gun for Unlimited and put an Aimpoint Micro or something similar on it.\n\n\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]26650[/ATTACH]\n\n[COLOR=#000000][FONT=georgia]The 1301, incidentally, handles [URL="http://www.a400xcel.com/optima-bore-hp-a400-xcel/index.aspx?m=53&did=158"]Beretta’s Optima Bore HP [/URL]choke system, although only one tube — a flush-fit Cylinder bore — was included. We did have another Cylinder-bore tube — an extended one threaded to accept Beretta’s Breacher attachment, which adds a certain “tacti-cool” intimidation factor (and could come in handy if you inadvertently lock yourself out of the house).[/FONT][/COLOR]\n[COLOR=#000000][FONT=georgia]The first order of business with the gun was to shoot a couple of rounds of skeet with it. So [I]“[URL="http://www.wildfowlmag.com/"]Wildfowl[/URL]” [/I]editor Skip Knowles and I took it out to the nearest clay target venue (Peoria Trap and Skeet) and were very impressed with the gun. Recoil — as to be expected with 23/4-inch target loads — was very gentle, thanks to the gas system, generous recoil pad and seven (well-distributed) pounds of weight. Our scores ran from 24 to 21. And since neither of us would be much of a threat on the local skeet circuit, we were pretty pleased.[/FONT][/COLOR]\n[COLOR=#000000][FONT=georgia]I’d done a bit of shooting with slugs out of rifle-sighted (ghost ring and open) smoothbores and was pretty curious as to how I’d fare with that large fiber optic front bead. I put up a large Shoot-N-C target at 25 meters and settled down at the bench. Since shooting slugs from a bench can be less than pleasant, I was a bit apprehensive, as always. I had on hand some 11/8-inch [URL="http://ddupleks.com/index.php/en/1270-cal/hexolit-32.html"]Dupleks Hexolit32[/URL] slugs, along with some 11/8-ounce [URL="http://www.winchester.com/products/rifle-ammunition/Advanced/Razorback-XT/Pages/default.aspx"]Winchester Razorbacks[/URL]. Both were 23/4-inch loads (the rationale for a three-inch slug load is totally beyond my understanding). I used the big front bead to make a figure 8 with the target and started shooting. I was gratified by the very manageable level of felt recoil — significantly less jarring than an inertia gun and infinitely less so than any pump.[/FONT][/COLOR]\n[COLOR=#000000][FONT=georgia]I was even more surprised by the groups. The Winchester stuff gave me a three-shot cluster just under an inch and a half and only slightly left of my point of aim. The exotic-looking Hexolit32 stuff came in at about an inch more, also shading to the left. One contributing factor may have been the 1301’s nice trigger, which broke at a crisp four pounds. I tried some [URL="http://www.hornady.com/ammunition"]Hornady[/URL] NobelSport Law Enforcement 00 buck (12 pellets) at 12 yards and managed to keep all of them in a fairly well-distributed 10-inch circle. Before I’d settle on any buckshot load, though, I think I’d want to try some other choke tubes — and other buckshot sizes — for a bit of mixing and matching. Buckshot’s kind of funny that way, particularly when you start stretching the envelope range-wise.[/FONT][/COLOR]\n[COLOR=#000000][FONT=georgia]Beretta’s 1301 Competition appears to be just what its name implies, although it would make an awesome defensive tool in less regimented circumstances. And I happen to think it’s a pretty good skeet gun as well.[/FONT][/COLOR]\n[COLOR=#000000][FONT=Helvetica Nueue]\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]26651[/ATTACH][/FONT][/COLOR][/quote]', ''),

(571364, ' [QUOTE=Aquarius;409161]@Fudgepacker:\n\nWhat you written is absolutely correct & no arguments on that.. unfortunately Mangoes in UK cost well over a pound for a good piece of a good Pakistani brand.. here you can get a couple of kilos in the same price, so should the people of UK stop buying mangoes, becoz they are cheaper in Pakistan.. does it being cheaper in Pakistan make it an average fruit ?? well its all about demand and market dynamics.. mangoes being a good fruit they are, full of taste and fleshy, juicy matter, just what a good fruit must be, are in demand the world over.. so are Glocks.\n\nFurther Glocks are very very good weapons.. they are not cheap due to low quality "NO".. they are cheaper due to modern (& cost effective) manufacturing techniques, simple design with minimal parts, as well as bulk production resulting in economics of scale.\nGlock is not worth $3500, but that is the value buyers see it in Pakistan & pay the price to own one.\n\nI admire your love for Sigs.. I also love Sigs even more than you.\n\nRegards.[/QUOTE]\nI understand what you mean, but it''s different when you talk about a natural resource, compared to a man made product. There''s no replacement for mangoes, and if they can''t grow in England, they have to pay for them to come from afar. The thing with Glocks however, is that they are not a unique item. There are replacements for them, in other quality guns, that sell for reasonable prices. Another thing with manufactured products is that there is a fixed cost to produce, and accordingly a fair price to retail. That''s why there are MSRP''s in any regular market around the world where Glock does business.  Because they know, that consumers know, what a fair price is, and inflating it unreasonably would detract from the image, ethics, and culture that Glock promotes, as a responsible corporation in the firearms industry. Normally a gun store makes a decent profit charging the equivalent of around $500 for a new Glock. So even if we grossly exaggerate, and say in Pakistan dealers charge $500 for the gun with profit, $500 for shipping with profit, and $500 for duty with profit, that still leaves $1000 of pure profit, just for the hype! It obviously makes no difference to me, but I take issue because it''s disconcerting in a moral sense, knowing these exorbitant prices are being charged. What''s worse, the very people who are being ripped off have been conditioned to think that those costs make sense and are fair market value, to the point of actually defending the pricing strategy of the dealers/scammers.  \nBut the bottom line is, I''m an outsider looking in.  How do you guys feel? What do you think? Am I wrong?', ''),
(571365, ' @ Fudgepacker,\n\nBro, \nAgreed! I will look the same if you look either from outside or inside. It is the only reason that dealers are charging hefty price because people here are ready to pay what they demand. Currently, the prices of Glocks are all time low in Pakistan. Why? It is not demand and supply but because an importer & dealer wants to make his place in the market. The situation will remain the same till we stop paying extra price.', ''),

(571371, ' My take on this very interesting and informative debate is here too :). First of all I am very happy to read a very, very positive discussion on PROS and CONS; ones like vs others contrary opinions - I congratulate ALL the PG members - this is what we need. This broadens the thinking of others as well - we can judge both sides on a very technical issue in a fierce technical debate. :)\n\n2ndly my personal opinion is based on a technical FACT. If one product is costing some company say US500 then it&#8217;s worth is no more than $500! I do consider the argument that mass production and intelligent techniques of production of one company may bring the price down while keeping no compromise on quality BUT question is DO others don&#8217;t have those? How can we prove that Mercedes Benz is not better than a similar BMW? Not possible to prove! One will have a feature better than other BUT the other will have another feature better than the first!!! Now the question would be answered by the BUYERS only!\nWell, certainly Glock&#8217;s are nice products! If two comparable pistols are taken say $500  Glock and any other &#8211; then same debate of Benz and BMW is applicable!\n\nFinally the question is PRICE!!!! Now to me right now we have two schools of thought &#8211; [B]one taking into account the Price[/B] and [B]other not paying attention to price at ALL[/B]. Well for this particular issue of Glock I belong to first school of thought who does not want to pay 6-7 times the actual price with NO [U][B]substantial[/B][/U] technical gain :) I feel like that my CZ P01 is BEST due to PRICE to TECHNICAL ratio and to me Glock has worst ratio for that. AND this debate can never end otherwise :)\n\nGod bless you ALL', ''),

When they were leaving i was so confused despite of taking my weapon out i ran inside Shell''s select store. It was 7:00 am. Rush hour. The store was filled with school kids and parents. I was in such a shock. I was like if the bike stops due to chor switch all those pissed off men will come back for revenge. I took my .30 out and chambered a round. The manager at select knew me and helped me out as i usually stop there for food. But everyone else inside got scared. I remained inside for 30 mins. After that police showed up. Bike was long gone.

(571685, 'Lucky Star Arms Market (Karachi) Survey XIII With the market in flux and all manners of news coming in from people selling their weapons at dirt cheap prices due to the ongoing operation to a steep hike in prices thanks to the rising dollar and increased taxes.   There is a lot of uncertainty regarding prices. \nI thought a review of the arms market should give a clearer picture.  I went to the market and fellow members Skywatcher, Lunatix and Civilian Gunner joined me later on. \n\nSkywatcher wanted a 9mm (preferably an NP 22/34) and I seized on the chance of a review.\n\n[B]HM Traders[/B]\n\nI started the review at HM Traders.  The dealer of choice for a number of Karachi members.  \n\nHe had an Adler .22lr Ak shaped rifle (made in Italy) that he was asking for 40k\n\nHe also had:\n\nA virtually NIB Sig Masquito for 55k Asking and \na titanium frame matt silver  Taurus .357 Model 617 7 shot 2 inch snub nosed revolver  with ribbed rubber grips in 90% condition asking 75k\n\nReview of the 617 by Verve\n[url]http://www.pakguns.com/showthread.php?12335-Target-Shooting-Review-Taurus-PT617-Titanium-357-Magnum&p=407955#post407955[/url]\n\nCF 98 44k \nNP 22 without rails 47k \nNP 42 46k\nChinese red box ammo 9mm 35 a pop and .357 S&B FMJ  120 a pop and .32 acp (Chinese) 55 a pop. (asking rates)\n\nConclusion: Abbas himself is flexible. But if he is not in the shop, its pointless to even enter. \n\n[I]Hint: Take a look and see if the gentle man behind the counter has a white or black beard. If U see no black beard. Dont bother to go in\n[/I]\n\n[B]Famous Arms[/B]\n\nMeanwhile fellow member Skywatcher had already been to Famous arms (Mehmood Bhai) and he informed me that Famous had a used \nHP 77B 34.5k final,  The HP does not have rails\na used NP 34 for 38k (without rail) and \na 27/7 Gen I for 55k asking\n\n[B]Saddar Armoury[/B]\n\nShafi  Bhai at Saddar Armoury always has a nice collection.  \nThe Usual  HP 77B was  47k \nThe NP  42 was 47k. He also had the \nNP 17 (9mm TT with manual safety) for 35k as well as another \nHP 77b 48k\n9mm Norinco tt with single column mag whose name I forgot. \nTaurus Mags for 9k \nAnd the long barreled Vepr 12 for 150k. Which is an excellent rate compared to the Karachi Market. \nHe also had a Kanuni (85%) 9mm with 1 mag that he absolutely refused to let go below 40k. When we whined and begged he offered us tea but strictly no discount. \n\nSo we left promising to come back after taking a look at Mega Armoury. As a gesture of good will we left Civilian Gunner as a hostage. \n\nConclusion: His Vepr prices are really good.  150k is the lowest I have seen in Karachi.  For the long barreled version.\n\n[I]Hint: Bargain and haggle over prices.. Only if U like tea.  But that&#8217;s it![/I]', ''),

(Shafi bhai had said he &#8216;might&#8217; be able to arrange an extra mag for 10k but no guarantees.)\n\nI was a bit mystified that the market was much higher and how come he was offering the NP 22 at these rates. He said they had not had a sale for a week. Thanks to the operation and ban on licenses. \n\nI thought it might be a used piece that he was trying to sell as NIB. But he offered me multiple NP 22s for the same rate.\n\nDuly inspired lunatix was kind enough to write down most of his inventory\n\nBaikal Viking (polymer frame) 67k\n\nCF 98 40k\n\nNP 42 44k\n\nNP 22 both with and without rail 42k (He said that it won&#8217;t be possible to sell at 40k from now onwards but he does respond to bargaining)\n\nNP 34 42k \n\nSalsimarz CM 9  68k\n\nKlinic 2000 65k\n\nZigana Sports 80k\n\nHe had a shooting gallery and we all took turns firing the weapon on both DA and SA modes. \n\nOur &#8216;hostage&#8217; had slipped away from Saddar Armoury now joined us at Mega armory. \n\nCaniks Shark C and full sized and Pirhana & C 100 (all for 68 to 72k approx) \n\nTauruses.  All popular models 78 to 82k Approx\n\nCZ Rami 118k Approx NIB\n\nCz Duty 92k (Negotiable)\n\nOther CZs available whose prices I forgot\n\nStoeger Cougar black without rails 72k \nStoeger Cougar Black used 80% 55k\n\n605 5 shot ss unported barrel .357 2 inch Taurus revolver (forgot price) \n\nLocal  TTs in AK shape asking 17k \n\nChinese Red box (on forum reference) 34 a pop\n\nS&B FMJ 9mm 58 a pop. No JHPs available as yet. \n\nNo .32 calibre ammo available\n\nThey also had some switch blades whose price I forgot to ask\n\nSkywatcher had only 39k on him and they handed the weapon over on the assumption that he will give the extra K next week. Which (God bless his soul) he did.\n\nDanial showed us printouts photos of the exploded Caracal along with the damage they had wrecked which he had downloaded from Pakguns. He said that he shows em to anyone who comes around asking for a caracal.\n\n(sigh) a fellow Caracal hater.... \n\nConclusion: If these guys continue to give me below market rates I won&#8217;t even &#8220;need&#8221; to do any more surveys. They also have their own sound proof firing room that they allow u to use before u make a purchase.  \n\n\n[I]Hint:  Dont leave hostages behind if U dont intend to buy from that shop [/I]\n\nP.S my sincere apologies to Members Lunatix, Skywather & Civilian Gunner if I have missed out anything. kindly fill in any details that I have left', ''),

At around 8pm he entered the Lyari Express Way from the Hassan Square/Milk plant grave yard side. He had gone hardly a kilo meter when Six men had blocked the road and forced them to stop. While four stood outside two of them sat in the car and looted anything which was valuable. After they were done they crossed the side barriers and disappeared in to the adjoining area.\nPlease take care and avoid this route in the night.

I know you are feeling insulted and trampled upon right now, but see if you can still read this message you came out of the situation a winner. I speak from experience, so let me tell you this that you will laugh at this story a few days from now. Time is a good healer. Also consider it sadqa for your life and safety. What would your dad rather have, you or your bike? Ask yourself the same question. You got a long way to go you will earn and ride 20 better vehicles in your life. Learn from your mistake, when I used to live in Karachi, we never displayed brand new motorcycles, we used to dab grease on mudguards and wrap the fuel tank with a cloth. No showing off. [COLOR=#ff0000][U][B]My best friend was a hitman for a political party,[/B][/U][/COLOR] even his CG 125 got snatched. His ego was shattered for a few days, but that is Karachi my friend! Don''t take it too seriously, just take good precautions. Also using a firearm in such a situation can have devastating results. A smart guy knows when NOT TO USE FORCE. I personally have been robbed at gun point, I did not do anything silly because although I had a chance, it was a chance, it could have gone either way, but on the same note I have brought guys down to the ground when there was an imminent death threat to me and my loved ones. I am no champ, but I am still alive and that tells me that my decisions were right. With six robbers you were terribly out numbered and out gunned, I am glad that you were confused and it ended up saving your life. Also the TT round is high velocity and usually goes out the other side, hence does not have much knockdown power in my opinion, unless you hit a vital organ.\nPlease thank Allah for this chance and be a thankful person, trust me Allah will shower his blessings on you in return. I know all this probably sounds nonsense (it did to me when I was 23, and still does when I am hurt), and I hope what happened makes you stronger and a better person.

(572656, ' [QUOTE=ehalin;331859]Good thoughts, brother. You have rightly pointed out the drawbacks. And these can be generalized to all high power air guns. I have been using air guns since my child hood. It''s been now more than 30 years. And from my personal experience I can second your observations. We should not expect power of a firearm from an air gun. Every technology has a limit. And these higher powered air guns are at upper end of the limit of this technology. To enjoy air gunning one should buy low or medium powered air guns like Diana 28 or 27. I prefer even Diana 24. They are light, easy to shoot, accurate, last longer, good for scope use, easy to maintain, have low noise, and safe. The above advantages of medium/low powered air guns are the very reasons one should opt for air gunning. If you want more energy then go for .22 rimfire rifles. People buy air guns and expect to kill deers or wild boars with them which is not the reality.[/QUOTE]\n\nbro ehalin, \nsearch for "hog hunting with Gamo hunter extreme" on youtube and you''ll see that the expectation has become reality..... :)\nI''m looking around for a D54AK if anyone has one for sale let me know....

(572697, ' [QUOTE=Verve;407759]Salam All\n\nAfter a few trips to the farmhouse, Mrs and I have come to a conclusion that we need a 4WD jeep not only for rough roads but to go exploring the country. We both like the one 2 seater CJ7 model, CJ5 is ok too but not sure if it can take a 3000cc petrol engine and transmission with aircon and heater fitment.\n\nMajority have advised to get one from army auction but ISB plate is a must as we live in ISB. And the same have suggested to take it to Peshawar to get everything including engine, interior and full suspension and 4WD system fitted - a coaster and pajero parts. Been told that someone in Pindi also prepares these jeeps. \n\nSourcing the chassis (an original jeep) and the right parts is the main issue (from very reliable and not conmen) that fit are main issues for me. Once the right parts including a solid engine and 4WD system including full suspension are in hand, getting it all fitted with excellent work is something I can manage with a right mechanic, denter, electrician and painter and have no issues getting my hands dirty in the process too, in fact prefer to be fully involved in the build it so I know it is done properly without cutting any corners, and to do it right first time around instead of fixing all sorts of problems later.\n\nWould really appreciate some pointers and pitfalls to avoid. And if anyone can help direct in sourcing a a straigh chassis jeep and parts from highly recommended source that would be great help.\n\nWe want the following:\n- Powerful Petrol engine (3000CC+ will be fine too), 4WD transmission and suspension that can handle the output of the engine without any hiccups\n- Airconditioner - a must\n- Heater - a must\n- most are fitted with Pajero dashboards so that or some other option if available?\n- chassis strengthening and roll bars\n- front seats (off any new''ish 4x4 like Cygnus etc) with custom doors, and waterproof zip up top covering full rear.\n\nI''m sure some of our hunting PG brothers own or have driven such custom jeeps.\n\nAny direction and advice is appreciated as this project will start as soon as our second car (barely used Nissan March) is sold.[/QUOTE]\n\nDear VERVE - the fact is every decision will have PROS and CONS. If you need to build your own jeep it will be the best options BUT as many dear PG members already said it will TAKE HUGE amount of time and efforts! But surely at the end of few days or week(s) you will get your desired jeep. One thing is for sure it will be very difficult to get a already built jeep 100% of your choice – so now depends if you are ready to live with that.\n \nI would suggest taking out time to visit Pinidi market and then Peshawar (you are welcome) – survey at both places and decide.  My feeling is some of things can be done best in Peshawar and some things might be required from Pindi. A very dear friend in army did the same. He bought a jeep from army auction, restored it here in Peshawar. He used the same engine so was difficult to find rings for the piston – best bet is to get a new engine as you are planning.\n \nOne big advantage of Peshawar would be lot of stuff coming from neighbor country thus easy to find at low cost. I know some good mechanics also. Let me know if you need to contact them.\n \nRegards', ''),

(572771, 'A Horrible Incident of my life.. First of all, I really sorry to post this thread so late due to some reasons I couldn''t post it earlier. This incident took place on 29 November 2012. I live in North Nazimabad block L and didnt have any guard system in our street that time, the street was opened from both side and had 5 to 6 snatching during tht month. It was a very soft target for muggers those days.  \n\n\nThe day was just not good for me I had very bad feelings for unknown reason since the day started, at around 9 pm my wife and I went to visit a doctor as my son was having fever. I accidentally dropped my cell fone out my pocket when i stopped my car at a nearby store to buy something. and of course could not find it again more time was wasted in blocking the sim card and we came back from the clinic around 11 30, still there was strange feeling in my mind like that some thing''s gonna happen soon. I parked my car in Porch and went inside to drop some shoppers and bag of my son''s stuff and leave my gun on the table inside our my home. In the frustration of my cell fone I forgot my car key in the car and door were all locked. In the mean time my brother in law and sister came home and I tried to recover my car''s key with my brother in law. Suddenly I heard a gunshot I just take my head out of car and then heard some one is shouting and bang bang, two more shots fired, I told my brother in law to go inside and also ran inside my lounge, I took my handgun which was chambered and came out of my house (from the sound of shots I realize that they r not infront of my house they were at the other end of street, when I was running down the street I saw three men were firing aerial shots and were shouting too. and then I saw my father who was walking down the street towards me shouting (Maar diya, maar diya tum kahan ja rahey ho) when I asked he told me that he has been shot (my father) It really just made me out of mind I ran again towards them and fired multiple aerial shot to just scare them they escaped quickly, I came back to my father and checked him, he was shot in the GROIN area and was not feeling anything tht time may be due to the shock. we rushed him to Zia uddin hospital where doctors gave him treatment and we came back home the same night AL HAMDULILLAH he recovered quickly and the shot did not prove lethal. My father was not happy with decision of buying gun those days but after this incident he''s become softer about guns.. The next day a shop keeper at the end of street told me that there were 6 people on two bikes, one was inside your street and the other was covering them on main road, they looking for their pray and my father who was just having a walk after diner appealed them, when they were harassing him to handover his money or mobile, one them accidentally shot my father and after that they fire multiple rounds to eliminate their mistake but my father was lucky enough to jump in the garden of another house,  when I opened fire they all ran away insanely and nearly to slipped their bike and at the end of the main road near Mateen foods restaurant where they were stopped by police and had an encounter with the police and got arrested, my father did not see their faces so it was useless to go to police station.. \nAnd one more thing tht my father used to walk there along with my one and half year old son but because he was with us ALLAH SWT saved him that time other wise the gunshot to my father was barely of my son''s over all height..\nMay ALLAH keep all of us safe from such incidents.....\n(I am not a very good writer like ED bro and others so there would be some mistakes, sorry for that)', ''),

Remember the thin line between heroism and stupidity? Here are a few reasons\n1. Use of lethal force or display of a firearm is highly probable to get someone killed.\n2. When they come for you, they seldom come alone.\n3. In a highly populated area, such as a traffic jam, who is behind your target? Innocent by standers, you hit one of them and you just became a villain.\n4. If you have your loved ones with you, you are putting them in jeopardy, what if you kill all the bad guys but just one of yours gets hit too?\n  Also wanted to remind "do unto others what you like done unto you".Imagine  a bus driver treating you like you treat the bikers.[/QUOTE]\n\nAnyone who is living in karachi and has faced these situations knows well about how it actually initiates, and at least I can say now finally I am able to find out the actual intentions of guys around me exactly few moments before its actually "ignited". Also these guys don''t come waving guns in their hands. First they try to get a hold of you by stopping you or knocking window of your car. This is when a chambered gun comes really handy. Also BGs don''t actually have holsters, they usually have there "narra" tied quite tightly for the purpose. So they usually don''t come with chambered gun either (well this may vary ofcourse depending on type/race of BG we are facing).\n\nNow about the points you have raised, you seem to be right but how about these:\n\n1. Buy and carry a reliable gun ONLY. Don''t pick any cheap one which will fail you at the time you really need to use it. OR the worst that it will make you regret for the rest of your life (we''ve heard about few desi clones which fire on their own sometimes without trigger pulling!!!)\n\n2. If somebody can''t control his nerves, he shouldn''t be carrying a gun at all.\n\nWe have also heard about few stories like where a Good guy didn''t even need a gun, he just "pulled" the bad guy inside from car window and raced the car then BG getting hit from side and then finally slipping on the road with great momentum that he will remember for rest of his life!

(573006, 'BT65 Elite: Hatsan''s PCP (Jibz Review) So here it is at last. Yes when I say AT LAST, it has a history to it. It all started almost 6 months back when I started looking for a PCP and after a lot of tamaktoyan, I decided upon Hatsan BT65 Elite (I am only kidding myself, the list is long, but all in good time, InshAllah. ). Now the challenge was, where to get one from?? Hmm a million dollar question. Well believe me, no stones were left unturned and almost all of relatives living abroad; every friend either coming to Pakistan or leaving; about half a dozen Customs officials; a sibling in Dubai; a PIA steward; several dealers of fire and not-so-fire arms; in short, for me it was like requesting a hefty portion of our country&#8217;s populace to help me out in this regard but all in vain. In between all this time there was one door which still needed knocking and that was Hira Arms Lahore, an importer of Hatsan in Pakistan. \n\nMr Nafees Malik, the owner was contacted and he informed me that his consignment will be reaching in two weeks&#8217; time. Frankly speaking, after that for another 6 months those &#8220;Two weeks&#8221; never came. But at the same time, I have to acknowledge the fact that the stated [I]wait-period [/I]decreased from weeks to days and then simply to hours. lol. To some of my partners in crime (identity will be disclosed later), I used to refer to Mr. Malik as [I]Mr. Dou-haftoon-main-a-jay-gi [/I]and a few more hyphenated names (nothing inappropriate :) ). Malik sb has a certain way of keeping his clients hooked, which from business POV may be a good idea but at the same time the strategy may backfire while dealing with hotheads like myself. Hahah. (I had to keep my cool as an Elite was at stake ;) ). So as it is said, &#8220;all is well that ends well&#8221; and yes, AT LAST in a state of WELL the whole waiting episode ended. The Elite reached Hira Arms and I heard the sweet symphony of Aap-ki-call-ka-intizar-tha. :D\n\nAt the moment, the gun is still in Lahore and is expected to reach me by the mid of the coming week so a pictorial review is in place, inshAllah. The identity of my partners in crime will be disclosed along with the detailed review, with their permission. The details about price etc will also be shared accordingly. \n\nThe rifle&#8217;s package includes the following items;\n·         3 Mags\n·         255cc cylinder (removable) with pressure gauge\n·         Mounted sling swivels\n·         An excuse for a Bipod. (Hatsan can do better than that, I am sure).\n·         A hard case. Its quality I am presuming to be very low. (Waiting till I see it in person).\n·         A sling\n·         A torch which can be installed on the picatinny rail. (Hatsan BT65 has three rails in its synthetic stock). Did I mention that I got the Synthetic stock with Thumbhole? No? Really? I guess that info fell through the cracks :).\n·         Optima 3-12x44 AO scope along with two piece mount.  (I may or may not change this scope but only after the Optima has been put to test).\n\nI also got myself a Hill Pump. The pump for the Hatsan will be reaching Hira Arms in the mid of the current month and I am sure it must be of good quality but I wanted to buy a reliable pump which can be used with any and almost all (with some alteration) the PCPs which are yet to land in my collection, InshAllah. So stay tuned and the range review will be posted very soon. For the time being please be content with the low resolution cellphone pics of the beast. \n\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]26795[/ATTACH]\n\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]26796[/ATTACH]\n\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]26797[/ATTACH]\n\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]26798[/ATTACH]\n\nRegards and Ciao', ''),

I live in North Nazimabad block L and didn''t have any guard system in our street that time, the street was opened from both side and had 5 to 6 snatching during tht month. It was a very soft target for muggers those days.  \n\n\nThe day was just not good for me I had very bad feelings for unknown reason since the day started, at around 9 pm my wife and I went to visit a doctor as my son was having fever. I accidentally dropped my cell fone out my pocket when i stopped my car at a nearby store to buy something. and of course could not find it again more time was wasted in blocking the sim card and we came back from the clinic around 11 30, still there was strange feeling in my mind like that some thing''s gonna happen soon. I parked my car in Porch and went inside to drop some shoppers and bag of my son''s stuff and leave my gun on the table inside our my home. In the frustration of my cell fone I forgot my car key in the car and door were all locked. In the mean time my brother in law and sister came home and I tried to recover my car''s key with my brother in law. Suddenly I heard a gunshot I just take my head out of car and then heard some one is shouting and bang bang, two more shots fired, I told my brother in law to go inside and also ran inside my lounge, I took my handgun which was chambered and came out of my house (from the sound of shots I realize that they r not infront of my house they were at the other end of street, when I was running down the street I saw three men were firing aerial shots and were shouting too. and then I saw my father who was walking down the street towards me shouting (Maar diya, maar diya tum kahan ja rahey ho) when I asked he told me that he has been shot (my father) It really just made me out of mind I ran again towards them and fired multiple aerial shot to just scare them they escaped quickly, I came back to my father and checked him, he was shot in the GROIN area and was not feeling anything tht time may be due to the shock. we rushed him to Zia uddin hospital where doctors gave him treatment and we came back home the same night AL HAMDULILLAH he recovered quickly and the shot did not prove lethal. My father was not happy with decision of buying gun those days but after this incident he''s become softer about guns.. The next day a shop keeper at the end of street told me that there were 6 people on two bikes, one was inside your street and the other was covering them on main road, they looking for their pray and my father who was just having a walk after diner appealed them, when they were harassing him to handover his money or mobile, one them accidentally shot my father and after that they fire multiple rounds to eliminate their mistake but my father was lucky enough to jump in the garden of another house,  when I opened fire they all ran away insanely and nearly to slipped their bike and at the end of the main road near Mateen foods restaurant where they were stopped by police and had an encounter with the police and got arrested, my father did not see their faces so it was useless to go to police station.. \nAnd one more thing tht my father used to walk there along with my one and half year old son but because he was with us ALLAH SWT saved him that time other wise the gunshot to my father was barely of my son''s over all height..\nMay ALLAH keep all of us safe from such incidents.....\n(I am not a very good writer like ED bro and others so there would be some mistakes, sorry for that)[/QUOTE]\n\nLunatix brother i pray to Allah to protect you, your family and neighborhood from further mishaps and man you are a really braveman"Nar admai" with a kind heart.

Suspension gets the most hammering in every car so best to stick with OEM spec offset for any aftermarket wheels. Lots of chinese rims being sold in PK, and resellers are oblivious of Offset and majority buyers fall in the same bracket too - as long as wheels fit (i.e. PCD matches), the purchase is made.

(573471, ' I''ve had every generation of Glock, and my favourites are actually the Gen 3''s with SF frames, followed by the Gen 4''s. Here''s why...\n Even though I''m a lefty, and the third gens only have right handed mag releases, I prefer that style of button over the wider and flatter gen4''s. Another thing is the grip texturing, although neither is perfect, with the gen4''s being too aggressive and the Gen 3''s not aggressive enough, my money still goes to the 3rd Gen for being more comfortable overall. Another thing with the grip is that the 3rd Gen SF is a perfect fit. Even though the 4th Gens have multiple back straps, I can''t seem to get it just right for my hands. Lastly i''m not a huge fan of the dual captured recoil spring. Irrespective of reliability, the ejection pattern with it is just not consistent enough in terms of distance and direction. Besides, Glock made their rise to fame using the original spring, and there was no need to change it!

Needless to say we came back..  We felt a bit guilty about leaving our ‘hostage’ at Saddar Armoury. But an NIB  Np 22 with rail for 40k was a much much better option then a boxless, extra magazine less used Kanuni. (Shafi bhai had said he ‘might’ be able to arrange an extra mag for 10k but no guarantees.)\r\n\r\nI was a bit mystified that the market was much higher and how come he was offering the NP 22 at these rates. He said they had not had a sale for a week. Thanks to the operation and ban on licenses. \r\n\r\nI thought it might be a used piece that he was trying to sell as NIB. But he offered me multiple NP 22s for the same rate.\r\n\r\nDuly inspired lunatix was kind enough to write down most of his inventory\r\n\r\nBaikal Viking (polymer frame) 67k\r\n\r\nCF 98 40k\r\n\r\nNP 42 44k\r\n\r\nNP 22 both with and without rail 42k (He said that it won’t be possible to sell at 40k from now onwards but he does respond to bargaining)\r\n\r\nNP 34 42k \r\n\r\nSalsimarz CM 9  68k\r\n\r\nKlinic 2000 65k\r\n\r\nZigana Sports 80k\r\n\r\nHe had a shooting gallery and we all took turns firing the weapon on both DA and SA modes. \r\n\r\nOur ‘hostage’ had slipped away from Saddar Armoury now joined us at Mega armory. \r\n\r\nCaniks Shark C and full sized and Pirhana & C 100 (all for 68 to 72k approx) \r\n\r\nTauruses.  All popular models 78 to 82k Approx\r\n\r\nCZ Rami 118k Approx NIB\r\n\r\nCz Duty 92k (Negotiable)\r\n\r\nOther CZs available whose prices I forgot\r\n\r\nStoeger Cougar black without rails 72k \r\nStoeger Cougar Black used 80% 55k\r\n\r\n605 5 shot ss unported barrel .357 2 inch Taurus revolver (forgot price) \r\n\r\nLocal  TTs in AK shape asking 17k \r\n\r\nChinese Red box (on forum reference) 34 a pop\r\n\r\nS&B FMJ 9mm 58 a pop. No JHPs available as yet. \r\n\r\nNo .32 calibre ammo available\r\n\r\nThey also had some switch blades whose price I forgot to ask\r\n\r\nSkywatcher had only 39k on him and they handed the weapon over on the assumption that he will give the extra K next week. Which (God bless his soul) he did.\r\n\r\nDanial showed us printouts photos of the exploded Caracal along with the damage they had wrecked which he had downloaded from Pakguns. He said that he shows em to anyone who comes around asking for a caracal.\r\n\r\n(sigh) a fellow Caracal hater.... \r\n\r\nConclusion: If these guys continue to give me below market rates I won’t even “need” to do any more surveys. They also have their own sound proof firing room that they allow u to use before u make a purchase.  \r\n\r\n\r\n[I]Hint:  Dont leave hostages behind if U dont intend to buy from that shop [/I]\r\n\r\nP.S my sincere apologies to Members Lunatix, Skywather & Civilian Gunner if I have missed out anything. kindly fill in any details that I have left[/QUOTE]\r\n\r\n\r\nED bro very nice and beautifully written review..

(608441, ' [QUOTE=TRX;446273]...and the USA.  \n\n TTs are (relatively) common and inexpensive in Pakistan, and I think you guys lose track of what a nice firearm it is.\n\n Back in the 1960s, most Americans felt the same way about the 1911.  Who''d want that old, clunky thing when he could buy a modern gun?  Nobody cared about the 1911, and there were no aftermarket parts or clone guns until the "service pistol" shooting matches suddenly became popular.  Suddenly there was a big market to the shooters, and then it took off.  Right now we''re seeing the same sort of thing with the "cowboy action shooter" people, who are now a large enough market that Italian, Brazilian, and Chinese companies are importing replicas of the antique firearms used in that type of competition.  \n\n Now 1911s are considered "high end" guns, but it wasn''t that long ago that people would look at you funny and ask, "What are you dragging *that* around for?"\n\n\n The .30-bore''s only real problem is the old-style round nose full metal jacket bullet.  That''s standard military stuff.  No, performance isn''t that great compared to modern ammunition... but old-school "ball" 9mm and .45 don''t do all that good either.  Bullet design has come a long way in the last 20 or 30 years.\n\n Reloading isn''t popular in Pakistan, but with some 100-grain Speer .32 ACP hollowpoint bullets, I''d put the x25 up against the latest "Rabid Fang Zombie Mutilator" 9mms...[/QUOTE]\nThat''s what i said in post#24, we have the same concept here as you had there, but some of your gun-makers hard-work took the 1911 from low to a high-end handgun, we can do the same if our enthusiasts show interest in it.', ''),

(573839, 'Review: Part 1 Hurrah. The beast has landed. lol I have received the gun and is under my close scrutiny right now. So here is my take on its cosmetics and features.\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]26906[/ATTACH]\n\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]26903[/ATTACH]\n\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]26904[/ATTACH]\n\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]26905[/ATTACH]\n\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]26909[/ATTACH]\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]26912[/ATTACH][B][U]\n\nPackaging:[/U][/B]\nThe gun has good packaging and its protection has been ensured by the manufacturer as it comes in a double box. There is foam on all side of the box with very little space for the rifle to rest in once the scope is installed on it. The barrel and the cylinder both are clean and without any grazes. The quality of the gun case cannot be compared with a Plano however it is good enough for a casual traveler like me.\n[B]Hot: [/B]Double box packing is a very nice effort by the company which has ensured that the unit you receive is as scratch less as you would want a +600$ rifle to be.\n[B]Not: [/B]The hinges on the gun case could have been better.\n \n[B][U]Bipod[/U][/B]\nPlease remember, this rifle is heavy (almost 10 lbs with scope and accessories) and its most viable usage would be through a rest. The bipod which came with it is of poor quality, rather I would say it’s totally junk; no need of using it. I have an original Harris Engineering bipod which I may install on it. InshAllah.\n[B]Hot: [/B]Nothing about the Bipod can be termed as pros (On a second thought, I may use it on my Winchester Model 190 but more on that later)\n[B]Not: [/B]Don’t get me started.\n \n[B][U]Stock[/U][/B]\nThe ambidextrous stock on the Elite is synthetic with thumbhole. I was anxiously waiting for a synthetic version because I use my guns quite extensively and thus unlike wooden stocks; there is no fear of ruining the cosmetics with a scratch here and a graze there. The Hatsan felt great in my hands and shouldered very nicely. I had to make slight adjustment in the pull length as the factory setting was a bit short for me. As mentioned earlier, the stock is well finished and balanced and beyond what I expected out of it.\n[B]Hot: [/B]Due to adjustable nature of the shoulder recoil pad and the comb, this stock is supposed to be a perfect fit for shooter of every size.\n[B]Not: [/B]I am speechless so there are no NOTs.\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]26910[/ATTACH] \n \n[ATTACH=CONFIG]26911[/ATTACH]\n[B][U]\nSling[/U][/B]\nThe sling is made of a so so quality fabric and the name HATSAN is embroidered on it. The quality of hooks on the sling can be termed as slightly-better-than-safety-pins. By the way, I have an old laptop bag (now torn from several places) which had a very well finished shoulder strap with cast-iron hooks. I guess that will look nice with the gun but lets see.\n[B]Hot: [/B]Naaaahhhhh.\n[B]Not: [/B]The sling is not getting hooked on the Hatsan anytime soon.\n\n(Stay tuned for Part 2 and 3) InshAllah', ''),
(573840, 'Review: Part 2 [B][U]Trigger[/U][/B]\nThe Quattro 2-stage adjustable match trigger on Elite is quite crisp and breaks in a very balanced manner. I reckon, when I got hold of my Airking, I told a fellow PG member that the T06 trigger on this gun is amazing but I can’t resist the itch to mess around with its triple adjust settings. lol. However, saner minds prevailed J and I didn’t mess with it and left it at factory settings. The trigger of the Elite also feels nice but I am sure I will be able to comment better once I have used it on a range.\n[B]Hot: [/B]The gold platted trigger is beautifully finished and quite crisp with no creep whatsoever.\n[B]Not: [/B]Elite’s trigger still has to go a long way to compete with the Airking’s T06.\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]26915[/ATTACH]\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]26914[/ATTACH] \n\n[B][U]Optical Sights[/U][/B]\nThe TruGlo fiber optic sights (front and rear) are nicely finished and have elevation as well as windage adjustments. But I could feel a few mm gap between the sides of the front and the rear one. To some users it may not be an issue but for me that’s something to which every user will have to get used to. I always prefer the sights with no gap on its sides.\n[B]Hot: [/B]The TruGlo fiber optics really glows, trust me. lol\n[B]Not: [/B]As Elite is termed as a very powerful gun and thus meant for long distance shooting with a scope so sights or no sights, fiber or no fiber, for me its all the same.\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]26916[/ATTACH]\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]26917[/ATTACH]\n \n[B][U]Scope[/U][/B]\nThe scope provided in the package is Optima 3-12x44 AO. It is a sufficiently good scope and I am sure that it will suffice the needs of a normal user. However it won’t hurt if one tries out the Leapers 6-12x56 with it. Why I am saying that, only because I have one laying around gun-less. hahaha\n[B]Hot: [/B]A good scope with Adjustable Objective settings and illuminated cross hairs.\n[B]Not: [/B]Once the scope is installed on the rifle it doesn’t fit in the gun case. Yes that’s right, it doesn’t fit. There is no space left on the sides and the whole placement looks claustrophobic. I will have to get low profile mounts.\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]26918[/ATTACH]\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]26919[/ATTACH] \n\n[B][U]The Bolt[/U][/B]\nThe bolt is chromed and is its mechanism is very smooth (for the time being). No significant cocking/bolting effort is required and I hope it remains that way.\n[B]Hot: [/B]I am glad that it’s the side bolt mechanism and the rear one. The rear one doesn’t seem real, but that’s me.\n[B]Not: [/B]I read several reviews of the Elite on international forums and only one commented that the bolt became stiff after some use. Lets hope that doesn’t happen to mine. :)\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]26920[/ATTACH]', ''),
(573841, 'Review: Part 3 [B][U]Anti-Knock Mechanism[/U][/B]\nThere is a patented anti-knock mechanism in this gun which is supposed to prevent air from exhausting when the rifle is knocked or bounced hard. I wanted to check this system and the pressure was at 170 bar. In a scenario where I lacked proper controlled environment, while standing on my roof top (with no one around me), I dropped the gun on its recoil pad facing upward from a height of 1 feet, nothing happened; then 2 feet and nothing happened and then … No you are not thinking straight now. lol. I didn’t drop it again after the first two tries. It really hurt in the upper left portion of the torso and I couldn’t bring myself to do it the third time.\n[B]Hot: [/B]The system works\n[B]Not: [/B]Its all the way hot :)\n \n[B][U]Safety Mechanism[/U][/B]\nI don’t know if from the POV of a bolt action rifle, the manual safety is a good idea or not but anyways I have been a fan of automatic safeties from day one. Because once you get used to it, the thumb automatically goes to the safety and disengages it as soon as the gunner has made up his mind to shoot. (At least that’s was what I used to do with my Baikal SxS and the Airking). The safety push-button has a little play in it and its gold platting is more like a golden paint. In short it has some space for improvement.\n[B]Hot: [/B]Not Hot.\n[B]Not: [/B]As mentioned earlier, the stock is ambidextrous however in a shooting position neither a left nor a right hander will have the ease of accessing the safety push button because it is located all the way up, quite far from the reach of any finger or thumb. Secondly, for me, the safety should have been Auto engage.\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]26921[/ATTACH] \n\n\n[B][U]Torch[/U][/B]\nAn amazing piece of accessory this little torch is. Yes, it is adjustable and the beam can be enlarged or diminished.\n[B]Hot: [/B]According to brother Jog3ee, it has a high beam up till 40 yards. Sufficient for me at least :).\n[B]Not: [/B]Once the torch is installed on the gun, the case won’t shut as the width of both the gun and the torch exceeds the available space in the case. Yes, another reason why I say that Hatsan could have done better with providing more space in the case.\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]26922[/ATTACH]\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]26923[/ATTACH]\n \n[B][U]Concluding Thoughts & Opinions[/U][/B]\nI have read on several sites that the Hatsan BT65 Elite is a very powerful PCP and its power is overwhelming. Well, I will comment on that when I take it to the range so stay tuned till then. \nThe BT65 Elite is an excellent choice for anyone seeking a powerful, sturdy, ominous looking extremely accurate rifle (yet to test). In addition, with its Quattro 2 Stage trigger, it is a pleasure to shoot; not as smooth as the spring rifle champion, Airking but still it is very good. And given its power, which I have yet to measure with a chrony, this rifle is expected to be superb for hunting, with the .22 caliber version being the better choice for more serious air rifle hunters.\nFinally, even though some potential buyers who may be thinking that this gun is not that loud, Eeennnnn; reality check, it is significantly loud. There are no mentionable drawbacks with this rifle. Likewise, if this rifle’s extraordinary sights aren’t good enough for you, and you are not happy with the scope, swapping it out for the UTG 6-12x50 AO Mil-Dot Rifle Scope should make a world of difference.\n\nCheers', ''),

(573866, ' Here is what my initial take is on the airgun:\n\nThe gun has the killer looks and the fact that it can be adjusted in so many ways, it''ll fit every type of shooter; however, there is something to it which [B]isn''t desirable in a PCP which is weight[/B]. At 9.3 lbs and close to 10 lbs with the scope [B]this airgun is heavy[/B]. That said I felt that its weight is very nicely distributed and as soon as you shoulder the gun it balances off very well, not muzzle heavy or anything despite the fact I put an air stripper on it. The stock is good quality had minor nicks on the rubber buttpad but it was taken care of with a little rubbing with cotton soaked in Brunox gun oil.\n\nIts a shame that Hatsan supplied it in a hard case which [B]could be VERY useful[/B]. For normal usage its a good case and as Jibz noted, hinges could be better. Where matters go [B]against[/B] this "possibly" very useful accessory is the fact that [B]it wont hold your airgun if it is scoped using high profile mounts[/B]. Unfortunately I didn''t notice it earlier and mounted the supplied scope with high profile weaver rings and later realized that it won''t fit :/ come on Hatsan people another 2-3 inches and this would REALLY be a GREAT add on. However, if the scope is mounted with the supplied rings, I believe one will manage to squeeze it in the box .\n\nThe supplied flashlight is surprisingly of good quality and its quite bright when I tested it out to 40 yards. The supplied scope is also much better built than I expected and has fairly clear optics. The best part was the reticle, its mil dot & a very fine reticle, unlike the reticles in Leapers or CP scope which are relatively thick. I''ll test the scope optice out to say 100 or so yards tomorrow but at 40-50 yards there was absolutely no complain on the optical quality.\n\n[B]Bipod is junk [/B]I don''t see a reason why Hatsan would even include it in the package. The sling will get the job done and has nothing in it to write home about.\n\n[B]Did I mention this thing is LOUD?[/B] Yes quite loud and it will definitely be needing a suppressor. The trigger is very nice I must say and it can further be adjusted for pull weight but I''ll play with that later when I have my filling system in place. [B]It does have a slight sideways play though which I did not expect.[/B] I''ll see if anything can be done about it.\n\nThe airgun comes with a manual safety switch and although it works and does its job effectively, they quality leaves something to be desired. Hatsan has used a very nice and sturdy brass switch for safety [B]but that confident "click" of the safety being engaged is lacking.[/B] A little quirk which I''m sure wont hamper the gun''s performance in any way but come on Hatsan !! you''ve done a great job here, why cut corners on these petty things?!\n\nI think I did mention this gun has an adjustable stock! But Hatsan has offered so much of it that it REALLY has become one of the defining features of this gun. After all the desired adjustments this gun fits the shooter like a glove! Hats off Hatsan.\n\nOverall, for the price of Rs 76,000/- I REALLY don''t think anything can match up with what Hatsan has managed to offer in this package. Hopefully this Sunday, this airgun will be put through its paces and that will be its REAL test as we''ll see how it performs in terms of; 1st and foremst Accuracy, Power, & Shots per fill.', ''),

(573892, 'Iver Johnson Eagle LR Zombie 1911 .45cal The reanimated Iver Johnson has made a statement with its recent introduction of the Eagle LR Zombie, a new .45-caliber Model 1911A1 rail gun with a plethora of custom enhancements. Based on the company’s black Eagle LR, this light-rail-equipped sample arrived as a zombie-themed handgun wearing a green hydro-dipped illustration of the undead on its slide and a pair of Hogue green pearlized polymer custom grips\r\n\r\n\r\nSpecs and dimensions for this 1911 are the same as other current Iver Johnson five-inch-barreled Government models. This pistol comes with one eight-round magazine, a skeletonized hammer, as well as front and rear slide serrations. Magazines are made by ACT-MAG, and spares are available for $25 apiece. Keep in mind, we found that this pistol will feed from most aftermarket magazines.\r\n\r\nThe carbon-steel frame is cast, then CNC-machined, and carries a Picatinny rail that will accept anything from a pistol-mounted light to one of LaserLyte’s bayonets. It’s given a matte-black Cerakote finish designed to resist the corrosive effects of zombie blood and weather. Don’t get your hopes up that Iver Johnson will introduce this model with a stainless steel frame, as these pistols are built in the Philippines by Shooters Arms Manufacturing. Stainless is a difficult material to come by in that country, and attempting to procure enough of it would steeply affect the U.S. market price.\r\n\r\nIver Johnson currently has seven different 1911 models available, many sharing similar features. You can celebrate the fact that all are based on the Model 1911A1 with Series 70 safety system. The backstrap is complete with a flat, serrated steel mainspring housing and beavertail grip safety.\r\n\r\nControls are easy to reach with an extended slide stop and thumb safety. Combined with the beavertail grip safety and triggerguard relief cut, when you handle this pistol and throw your thumb up on the safety, its contours almost demand a high grip.\r\n\r\nAll models utilize metal-injection-molded (MIM) parts, and the slide and frame are hand-fitted for a smooth and tight fit. There’s no discernable wiggle with the slide-in battery, not in the slide rails or at the barrel bushing. This accounted for this pistol’s solid performance during our evaluation.\r\n\r\nThough the Eagle LR Zombie falls in the price point of the working class, it includes a lengthy list of features more common on custom guns: beveled mag well for those inevitable reloads, thin-cut angled serrations for positive slide manipulation, lowered and flared ejection port for spent brass to cleanly escape and a three-hole match trigger.\r\n\r\nver Johnson uses Millett’s white-outline, fully adjustable rear sight and dovetail front sight. This is a classic combination in the world of 1911s designed to extract the most accuracy from your go-to zombie pistol.\r\n\r\nWhat appears as a novelty to traditionalists is actually a great value and impressive performer at the range. Posting a variety of Darkotic splattering-zombie targets downrange at 25 yards, it was fairly easy to average two-inch groups from a bench. Our staff’s best five-shot group using 185-grain Hornady Z-MAX measured a write-home-to-mother 1.39 inches, and these fun targets made it worth posting them on the fridge.\r\n\r\nThe interesting finish on the slide doesn’t impede performance or handling, hasn’t worn as we thought it would have and, if anything, we’ve found the clearcoat actually aids in wiping powder residue from the muzzle after each range session.\r\n\r\nOur conclusion is simple: It’s the last sidearm you’ll ever need.\r\n\r\nFor a limited time, these zombie pistols are available through Zanders, Hicks Inc. and Big Rock Sports.\r\n\r\nOnly Available in American.', ''),

(574073, ' [B][COLOR=darkgreen]  While going to office, passed by a camp of nomad blacksmiths. These fellows are called &#8220; Lora&#8221; and pass their winter in my area. Their only expertise is blacksmithing which they are doing from generations. Their dedication to blacksmithing stretched over centuries has polished their skills and their blacksmithing skills are amazing.they don&#8217;t use any of modern or electrical blacksmithing tools and rely on the primitive ones those have been used by their ancestors.  The work of some of their community members was seen by one industrialist of other province, as he halted by chance beside their camp. His business acumen felt the potential these poor nomads have and counseled with their elders to leave nomadic life and get settled and work for  his industrial estate in Wazirabad  Punjab. Now, that business man is selling knives made by those craftsmen from Damascus steel, throughout world.[/COLOR][/B]\n\n  [B][COLOR=darkgreen]The Anthropological and Philological side of these nomadic persons is quiet interesting. Mostly the languages spoken in this region belong to &#8220;Indo-Arian Family&#8221;. The only language belonging to &#8220;Dravidian&#8221; family of this region is spoken by these nomadic blacksmiths and their fellow &#8220;Brahvi&#8221; tribe. Most of Brahvi Tribe now passes a settled life. It is said that Moen Jo Daro , (the centre of Indus Civilization, one of 4 cradles of human civilization, along with Mesopotamia, Egypt and Yang T&#8221;sekong  ,  a river  of China ) was built by the  people speaking language of Dravidian origin. The Arians attacked them; destroyed their capital Moen Jo daro and Dravidians were ousted from this region. While on the run , they totally abandoned this region and got settled in India, specially in Tamil Nado  and Sri Lanka. The Tamils in India and Sri Lanka are the descendents of those who once ruled the plains of Indus  Valley for more than a thousand years. On the other hand , victorious Arians established their own kingdoms and empires , gave birth to a new civilization and languages like Prakrat, Apbharnesh , Hindi, Persian and German. The historical proof German link with this region is the  Nazi sign of &#8220; Swastika&#8221; which is still in  an active use( in a mirror image, though) in Hindu religion as a very famous symbol of lord shiva&#8221;s worship and is visible on nearly every Hindu temple, specially on those who are related with lord shiva.

Suspension gets the most hammering in every car so best to stick with OEM spec offset for any aftermarket wheels. Lots of chinese rims being sold in PK, and resellers are oblivious of Offset and majority buyers fall in the same bracket too - as long as wheels fit (i.e. PCD matches), the purchase is made.

I measured, it is 21.5 inch square & the inner black circle is 10cm in Radius\n3. Sir, dont know anything about the "per set", plz descibe in a bit detail to let me understand what it means. Any how I loaded both mags 16 each and fire at intervals of a few minutes i.e., the time it takes to load the mags\n\nI am new to pistol shooting as told earlier never fired a pistol an year ago and now when I asked Mr. Muslim Khan of LRC to place target at 50 meters for pistol shooting he could not believe me and thought I was insane as few people have attempted it at LRC with little success.\n\nBut at the end he and Mr. Younas admired it and they think I can do even better with more practice and time ( the thing which is very difficult to manage ) and must enter some competitive shooting ( Again requires a lot of time which I cannot afford )\n\nThis weekend I am going to do the same with some low end pistol like CF98 and see whether it is the gun or the man behind the gun that is important. Because I read in one of the article of Massad Ayoob that only some pisols have inherent accuracy of rifles and I firmly believe that CZ75B Stainless is one of them.\n\nAny tips to improve the accuracy are more than welcomed ?\n\nRegards[/QUOTE]\n\nDear Bro - I must COMMEND - it is a wonderful shooting and it is indeed unbleiveable to me at least - congrats again!!!!\n\nPistol does play a vital role BUT at the end of the day it is the mand behind the gun!!! So two perfacts things made this great results! Great pistol with great person behind the gun. I have few points in mind.\n\n1st from sets I meant what you answered that you used one full MAG each time.\n\n2nd What was your poistion - standing (forgive me if you already wrote) - how was the grip?\n\n3rd Do meansure spread between far apart shots.\n\nI will put reminder for myself and come with Excel sheet in which some QUANITIFBLE parameters can be calucalted each time to see how good we are each time when we fire. A senior member with name GILANI (very similar to my nick) did some great work in this regard  and made few post that I read also (in 2010 or so) - I think we must utlize such wonderful inputs. My suggestion and question for opinion for ALL PG members to comment that WHAT IF we start and make a cell in PAK GUNS called R&D Cell (Research and Development Cell)? Who should come with some thing new and innovative ideas or already done work be translated in such a way that we have PAKGUNS Handbook or Guide or etc. etc.\n\nI am in hurry to start for Islamabad - I will come with some concrete suggestions latter!!!

(574198, ' To fill a PCP using SCUBA or SCBA (generally carbon fiber) tank the 1st thing you need to know is that what is your gun''s optimum filling pressure! e.g. that for BT65 is 2900 psi (200 bar), Benjamin discovery is 2000 psi (approx 140 bar), Daystate air ranger is 3600 psi (approx 250 bar) and Diana P1000 is 4500 psi (300 bar).\n\nMax filling pressure for LP Steel SCUBA is around 2600 psi.\nMax filling pressure for HP Steel SCUBA is around 3450 psi.\nMax filling pressure for Aluminum SCUBA is around 3000 psi.\nMax filling pressure for Carbon fiber SCBA is around 4500 psi.\n\nTo fill at these pressures you need special compressors, that usually sell for 60k-125k used depending on country of origin and brand. Your normal Tyre shop compressors fill up to 200-250 psi. \n\nA very important factor to remember is that the fill pressure of your tank must be higher than that of your airgun''s air reservoir.

But I think they can be found if one''s looking for. gun shop owners from raja bazar can be a help too. by them I have acquired makarov, s&w 10, walther p38 and couple of other guns. My point is: if you''re looking seriously, you find them. \n\n@shahroze - Sir ji - for an american - kahan 9mm or kahan 30 bore :) Yes they are considered fun gun for the most part. And there are obvious reasons for that. Let''s agree tees bore is not an average round. It''s Hot. I mean still today I feel dis comfortable shooting the thing on targets. But I am sure If this grip gets somehow more chunky, that''d definitely help. Solution: double stack clips. \n\nMy admiration for .30 aside, If nothing is done to produce a better platform ( gun''s design ) for this round. This will become even more obsolete than ever. I doubt if anybody is going to take some interest in that field maybe some Chinese company. Sadly, we are way way behind in producing anything here in Pakistan. \n\nAnd to make the matter more worse in Pakistan. We have hundreds if not thousands of private establishments producing junk for .30 calibre. 90% of them if not all - are in tribal areas or peshawar. As I am gun enthusiast so I look in mal-khana of police stations often to see what''s new has gotten there  and I just wonder on stupid designs and geometry of pistols. It never seizes to amaze me. tees bore pistols, 12 bore pistols, replicas of long range shooting rifles, 12 guage.

I''ve fired the Piranha and hit every plate at 25M, pretty accurate in my limited opinion and it felt good in hands too. I''d love to test fire the Shadow at range before purchasing but I doubt that would be possible (unless someone is kind enough to let me fire a few shots to get the feel of the gun in action). As I was saying to Moeen bhai that if Pirahna can''t be found then Shadow it''ll be. I''m sure it''s a better pistol as everyone who owns &/or has fired one grades it very high. There is however a price variance of appx 50k under consideration too.\n\nIf I find 2 Pirahna''s, will ring you with details of dealer(s), price(s) etc and take it from there.

(574849, ' [QUOTE=BreakNeck;412763]144 is imposed in Karachi since Adam and Eve. The 144 permit allows you to carry the weapon in a concealed manner (no brandishing). However, the HD (issuing authority) exercises its powers and suspends the 144 permits temporarily. There, a concelaed weapon with license and permit also becomes illegal and LEA can confiscate the weapon. Although it usually gets returned; however, the loop is too time consuming.

(574951, ' [QUOTE=Ameer;412737]Sorry brother, I didn''t contact the dealer as i didn''t go out of Islamabad since then (due to commitments).\n What i did is, replaced it with very fresh General Tyre. I am thinking to replace all of them with General. Why?\n\nAt least they are the most fresh ones available. \n\nThere is a Ware House and Office in Islamabad where defected tyres can be claimed. \n\nPick the tyres yourself, the one you want it. Hundreds of options.  \n\nCheaper, so just replace all of them between 1-2 years.\n\nP.S: My next visit to Peshawar depends upon availability of Glock-19.[/QUOTE]\n\nI agree that tires must always be fresh. The criteria that I have self-imposed on my self is that I change tires WHEN whichever comes first from the list below:\n1. 35k to 40k KM usage\n2. 2.5-3.0 years of usage\n3. If tires start catching puncture too often (2-3 times)\n\nOn the above basis my corolla fielder is due for tire change. It is almost 2.25 years of usage, about 18k KM on odo and only one puncture in one tire due to nail penetrating straight through.\n \n@Ameer bro – can you please share the General Tire dealer info, I want to educate myself. I have to again visit ISB coming Thu with overnight stay. I will try to visit the dealer on Thu 12-DEC IA. I will be grateful for location and timing of the dealer so that I can accordingly visit! BTW I do not like General tyre :) due to being very hard – but if they are cheap and as you said LOT of options, I wish to see!\n\nBro whenever you visit PEW- do visit me - you are more than welcome!

(574952, ' [QUOTE=Verve;411340]3.08% increase in diameter is too large for handling & braking. Plus sizing to 15" rims from 185/70/14 should be 195/60/15 (-0.16% increase or 0.16% decrease and that''ll be fine) . \n\nIn addition, please do assure that the Offset of the 15" rims you are putting on is the same or very close to OEM specifications - over 5mm offset variance, be it +ve or -ve, is discouraged as this will put additional stress on suspension components causing early failures. Suspension gets the most hammering in every car so best to stick with OEM spec offset for any aftermarket wheels. Lots of chinese rims being sold in PK, and resellers are oblivious of Offset and majority buyers fall in the same bracket too - as long as wheels fit (i.e. PCD matches), the purchase is made. I''d recommend Forged Aluminium wheels as those would be lighter and stronger than stock wheels, a true upgrade. Koreans make very good wheels and are way ahead of chinese aftermarket wheels manufacturers. \n\nHTH[/QUOTE]\n\nDear Sir, I agree and I have decided not to go for +1 size. The side door of corolla fielder says two options:\n1. 175/70/R14\n2. 185/70/R14\n\nIF I take 175/70/R14 as base then putting 195/65/R15 is more than +5% and for taking 185/70/R14 the difference is +3.08%. So I want to be conservative by taking 175/70/R14 as base. I wanted to go for 195/65/R15 ONLY for gaining +9mm height for increasing the ground clearance by +9mm. BUT now want to live with the facts :) I am some how not convienced to put spacer of 12mm or to put springs of Premio which lifts the chasis - so want to live with how the car is !!

(574973, ' Had a fun day yesterday with an Airgun guru at his farm, Major Ali. We went to test the BT65 and HW100 (belonging to Faraz Haider) . The setting was perfect as his farm allowed testing of the guns at up to 100+ yards. After a warm welcome and some initial gup shup we set out to test the guns and while at it, were served with simple yet very tasty partridges and teal :D it was steamed and cooked with nothing but salt. Awesome :D\n\nMost of the shooting was done at 47 yards and some groups were obtained at 30 yards. The HW 100 excelled at both the distances.\n\nThe HW100 is a gorgeous piece of equipment. I can easily say that its pictures simply do not do justice to it. At approx 27-28 fpe this gun is a pea shooter. Yes at up to 50 yards you can hit pea sized targets ALL DAY and it won''t miss a thing I can assure you that. It is one sweet shooter. Major sb was nothing but praises for the HW100 which truly lived up to its reputation. However at 62 and 78 yards the groups opened up significantly. We could not understand why but the only reason I can think of is that it was likely because of the scope mounted on that gun (Leapers 6-24x50) Any scope with finer reticle and this gun would produce tight groups even at that distance.\n\nWhen Major sb took his 1st shot through the chrony with the BT65, his 1st comment was, "Sir ap ka chrony kharab hai". The chrony read 1149 fps with Gamo promagnums. 5 shots with pro magnums were as follows:\n\n1149; 1150; 1159; 1158; 1152!! Average Energy 45.6 FPE.\n\nWe were all strongly convinced of this gun''s power, next target was to see what matters most! Accuracy. Oh the airgun is LOUDD!!! I don''t know how many times I''ve said that but as soon as I squeeze that trigger, the loud cracks leaves a grin on my face :D! Also the tested guns were literally out of the box as we hadn''t even cleaned the barrel. The gun wasn''t broken in and the barrel was obviously not seasoned.\n\nNext pellet was 21 grain barracuda but we stopped after taking 3 shots as it opened up the group considerably. at the end of this post I will mention all the shot strings that we chronied.\n\nNext up was the JSB 18 grain pellet which produced best results in this gun. The best group obtained by Major Ali at 47 yards was 1/2 inch; however the gun did not group consistently. It would open up the group when filled at 200 bar and as it hit the sweet spot of around 180 bar the groups would start to shrink considerably. The only reason I can think of this inconsistent performance is that the gun was new, not cleaned and not enough lead went through the barrel. Hopefully once 200-300 shots have been taken the gun should perform better.\n\nWe then tested JSB Exact monster pellets (25.4 grain) and although it shot at an average velocity of 933 fps the group I obtained at 47 yards was approx 1.25 inch (judging through the scope). Barracuda Match pellets were tested again and the result was not what we wanted, i.e. a 1 holer at 47 yards!! So yesterday, the best performing pellets remained JSB exact Jumbo for the Bt65.\n\nWe then zeroed the airguns and went for a quick hunt (came home with a decent bag of 13 birds approx 4 could not be retrieved). Most were shot through the HW100. Major Ali also showed us his BSA s10 whic was tuned at approx 32-33 FPE and was amazingly silent, also very consistent and accurate.\n\nOverall, where the power and the loud bark of BT65 thrilled us, the resulting accuracy left something to be desired. It did produce 1/2 inch groups but the consistency was lacking. As stated above it could be due to several factors. However, this is just the beginning and i''m sure for us, there''s a lot to be learnt about how a PCP behaves.', ''),

(575050, ' Does your car bottom out at speed breakers? If not, sticking with stock size tyres shouldn''t be an issue. Your car has decent ground clearance from the pictures but it''s obviously not designed for use on rough and un-tarmac''d roads. In my humble opinion, oversized tyres would ruin your driving experience. Personally, I''d opt for 185/70/14 tyres (given the choice by the manufacturer) as wider tyres would provide better road grip on a fully loaded estate car.\n\nIn regards to changing tyres, I change them based on tyre wear. Less than 2mm tread and/or uneven tread wear it''s time to change. Multiple punctures are ok as long as none are on the side wall. Even if a single side wall puncture occurs, the tyre is discarded as side wall punctures are impossible to repair properly and are a major safety hazard after repair.', ''),

So they may slightly over pressure after driving as I described in my previous post!\nRegards[/QUOTE]\n\nIn my limited understanding, tires do not expire in 3 years if stored and used properly (But how do you ensure anything like that in Pakistan when there are tires with fake stamps etc). 5-6 years old is not a good idea, even if brand new. I am a Michelin guy and live in very harsh weather conditions, including lesser than -40 Celcius temperatures (yes, I ask that question everyday, why?) and lots of off roading (gravel roads, bajree, kuchi sarak), usually we have to keep 2 sets, one for the winter and one for the spring, summer and fall. Two more reasons I can think of since it seems the sidewall blew out, there was either a breakage in the steel belts and a bubble had formed and went unobserved, which can pop without notice or the tire had a repaired sidewall, which is not a good idea to start with.\n\nRegarding Dr. Gilani''s comment, you are right and so is Aquarius, it is still called a cold check if one drives less than 2 kms. The tires do not warm up that quick unless a teenager is driving (Ah! Those fun days when I wrecked it and dad paid to get it fixed, so I could wreck it again, and he never understood why our tires wore out every 2-3 months).\n\nA regular check up by a competent mechanic is very important, specially if you cannot identify symptoms.\n\nDr. Gilani I have forgotten the Pakistani driving conditions safety rules, which of course make sense to change tires so frequently, our all season tires (read 3 season, I have those on my Honda CR-V and was stuck in snow in my own driveway this morning and it is a 4X4, hang on, hang on, I did manage to get out by myself, I know a few tricks, but the point is the winter here demands Michelin X-Ice XI3 tires) usually are rated for 80,000 km and above and we use them that much too. I put a lot of mileage on my vehicles, between me and the home minister we usually put 50,000 km plus on our vehicles in a year, that does not include my semi, which I drive about 120,000 km each year for work (another fun experience in the oil patch ice roads, gravel, mud and you name it what pulling 46.5 tons, lovely).', ''),

(575079, ' As jog3ee says, the trip to major Ali''s farm was great, he was the perfect host, and very passionate about testing the guns. He tried distances, pressures, different pellets, all in combinations to find what major said was the "sweet spot". For BT-65 it was 180-160 bar, for the HW-100 it was 190-160 bar. Best performing pellets were JSB 16 and 18 grain.\n\nI was very happy with the praise major Ali gave for the HW, when he found out I had gotten a Hatsan also, he said "yaar aap HW mujhe baich dain". The HW-100 is a finely crafted gun, the lever operates with a fine snick-click, the trigger is super-soft and very predictable. Major Ali''s advice was to put a better scope and use better pellets. Even with the Leapers, he put 3 pellets in a 5.5mm hole at 35 yards.\n\nThe BT-65 is completely another game. I tried my hand at Kjilji''s re-settable target at 15 yards with open sights and it left deep pellet marks on the steel plates, ouch. The gun is so loud that I have only shot 3 pellets at my 23 yard home range and stopped because neighbors would think i was firing a .22LR.\n\nThe Hatsan''s fit-and-finish has some issues, but cycle the bolt (a solid metal piece) and you immediately feel the robustness. Mine is the rear-bolt model and feels every bit like loading a bolt-action rifle, the snick and thunk of the bolt sliding home, then the crack of the pellet breaking the sound barrier makes you grin from ear to ear.\n\nMy brother has some videos, and I will share the link once he uploads them.', ''),

It was issued by Govt of Sindh. The person signing on behalf of GoS was the person so authorised by the Gos at that time whose name is Wajid Shaikh. And who is protected by the real beneficiaries of whatever scam is alleged to have been cooked.\n\nIt is funny how some people on this forum think it is somehow their fault that the GoS employees did not do their job. \n\nFor e.g. when you go to a bank to get demand draft issued against cash you don''t check whether the person signing the demand draft is authorised to sign or whether he passed required entries or whether he pocketed the cash. You are correct to assume that the person sitting at the counter is authorised to process your draft and that the bank''s systems ensure that authorised person signs after all conditions are met.

It was issued by govt of sindh. The person signing on behalf of gos was the person so authorised by the gos at that time whose name is wajid shaikh. And who is protected by the real beneficiaries of whatever scam is alleged to have been cooked.\n\nIt is funny how some people on this forum think it is somehow their fault that the gos employees did not do their job. \n\nFor e.g. When you go to a bank to get demand draft issued against cash you don''t check whether the person signing the demand draft is authorised to sign or whether he passed required entries or whether he pocketed the cash. You are correct to assume that the person sitting at the counter is authorised to process your draft and that the bank''s systems ensure that authorised person signs after all conditions are met. The bank is responsible for fraud done by its employees. It it has weak controls/systems or dishonest employees then it is not your fault it is the bank''s fault.

I am a Michelin guy and live in very harsh weather conditions, including lesser than -40 Celcius temperatures (yes, I ask that question everyday, why?) and lots of off roading (gravel roads, bajree, kuchi sarak), usually we have to keep 2 sets, one for the winter and one for the spring, summer and fall. Two more reasons I can think of since it seems the sidewall blew out, there was either a breakage in the steel belts and a bubble had formed and went unobserved, which can pop without notice or the tire had a repaired sidewall, which is not a good idea to start with.\n\nRegarding Dr. Gilani''s comment, you are right and so is Aquarius, it is still called a cold check if one drives less than 2 kms. The tires do not warm up that quick unless a teenager is driving (Ah!

I put a lot of mileage on my vehicles, between me and the home minister we usually put 50,000 km plus on our vehicles in a year, that does not include my semi, which I drive about 120,000 km each year for work (another fun experience in the oil patch ice roads, gravel, mud and you name it what pulling 46.5 tons, lovely).[/QUOTE]\n\nDear DODO23 - thanks for wonderful details!

When every pistol is going to fire the same bullet. It is just FUN and nothing else. If I say my CZ75B Stainless is WAY better than my CF98. I will be incorrect.

Who''d want that old, clunky thing when he could buy a modern gun?  Nobody cared about the 1911, and there were no aftermarket parts or clone guns until the "service pistol" shooting matches suddenly became popular.  Suddenly there was a big market to the shooters, and then it took off.  Right now we''re seeing the same sort of thing with the "cowboy action shooter" people, who are now a large enough market that Italian, Brazilian, and Chinese companies are importing replicas of the antique firearms used in that type of competition.  \r\n\r\n Now 1911s are considered "high end" guns, but it wasn''t that long ago that people would look at you funny and ask, "What are you dragging *that* around for?"\r\n\r\n\r\n The .30-bore''s only real problem is the old-style round nose full metal jacket bullet.  That''s standard military stuff.  No, performance isn''t that great compared to modern ammunition... but old-school "ball" 9mm and .45 don''t do all that good either.  Bullet design has come a long way in the last 20 or 30 years.\r\n\r\n Reloading isn''t popular in Pakistan, but with some 100-grain Speer .32 ACP hollowpoint bullets, I''d put the x25 up against the latest "Rabid Fang Zombie Mutilator" 9mms...', ''),

(575773, ' [FONT=Lucida Grande]Irrespective of all criticism on it''s varying pricing levels and hyper-charged premiums, it''s no doubt the best reselling handgun of all. We cannot get beyond this fact, I think. [IMG]http://www.thegunforum.net/images/smilies/icon_rolleyes.gif[/IMG] \n\nAny other brand handgun, be it a budget one or an HK, will suffer badly at the hands of dealers at time of reselling. Our forums have been a great help for our enthusiasts with this respect, but there''s still a larger fraction of gun owners out there who still are subject to the sharpness of greedy dealer''s cut- throat swords and mercy at resale time. \n\nA Glock purchased at any price whatsoever in the range of 200-280K''s is an investment. It can gain in prices again and even a used one will cause no or insignificant loss at selling time. Those seeking the better benefit can purchase now at lower prices and watch it gain later. Those having it already and who purchased at higher prices are still not in any kind of loss, since it will stabilize sooner or later. It''s an automatic and undeniable market mechanism of demand/supply.\n\nThere''s no doubt that it ideally should be a 60-80K handgun, like any Brazil/Turkey handgun, yet this would sadly not be possible as long as the freighting origin remains USA or Vienna, or as longer as this stupid ban is in order.\n\nI hope I could get a Gen4 G-26 or a G-30 at 200K''s soon, preferably lower.

(575941, ' Divide that number by 2 and add 1/8’’ to it. Now draw the stitch line in red ink below the trigger guard at a distance of X from the trigger guard’s outline. Similarly draw the stitch lines below the muzzle and above the slide.', ''),
(575942, ' Now stable your paper holster along the stitch lines. Draw prospective belt loops. This is how you leather holster would look like. Put the real gun in it to have a feeling of the holster before you go with the leather.', ''),
(575943, ' Buying the leather:\nI used 3mm thick leather for the holster. Leather is easily available from parts of the city where traditional chapals are made. Sooter Guli is one such area in Rawalpindi&#8217;s Raja Bazaar. They charged me Rs 200 for 1.5square feet of leather.\nCutting the leather:\nRemove the staples from your paper holster and trace the outlines of front and back of paper holster on leather. Cut the leather on these lines and get it stitched. A cobbler stitched two holsters for me for Rs 50. After the stitching is done, insert the gun in the holster. Don&#8217;t worry if you feel the holster is tight. \nWet Moulding: This is the last step in holster making. It will give a hand-in-glove fit and look to the holster. \nYou wet the holster in water. Tightly wrap the gun in a plastic sheet (the one which is used to cover dishes or wrap sandwiches in, can&#8217;t remember its name). Put the gun in the wet holster and press the leather with your fingers along the outline of the gun. You will soon see your gun printed outside the leather.', ''),
(575944, ' Keep the gun inside the wet holster and leave it for sunbathing. The moisture in the leather will evaporate. Plastic sheet prevents moisture damaging your gun&#8217;s finish. Rubbing alcohol can also be used instead of water. You won&#8217;t have to wrap the gun in plastic sheet if that is the case.\nRemove the gun from the holster and let it dry further. Now apply a good amount of Vaseline petroleum jelly inside the holster and start using it. \nPS: Some of the pictures are downloaded from internet and some are mine.', ''),

The diffrence between 17HMR and .22WMR is that 17hmr has advantage in velocity trejacotry and accuracy . .22wmr has advantage in energy, bullet frontel are sectional density and killing power . Both weapon were design for shooting small animals .22wmr is a better option in my openion like I said in my openion .[/QUOTE]\n\nThanks hmd brother. Chuck Hawks has compared both ammos with respect to their MVs, ME, bullet drop, SD bullet frontal end and knocking power.22WMR has max killing range of 125yards whereas 17 has 160 yards. As far as higher velocity is concerned 17hornady goes at 2550 f/s and CCI 22WMR in 30grains can travel at a speed of 2250 f/s so both can achieve higher velocities. \nChuck hawks has also recommended 22WMR as a better cartridge for killing small game/varmints like  you have mentioned. My question however brother was not related to the attributes of two cartridges rather it was about possibility of firing one cartridge in other rifle i.e. 17 in a 22 rifle as both ammos have similar rim case width and length.\n\ncheers', ''),

(576337, ' Assalamo alaikum all\n\nYesterday I went to Umair bhai to check the Hatsan as he has several empty plots all around. So we setup target at 35 yards and scoped the Hatsan BT65. We didn''t have any heavy pellets and the Htasan was spitting gamos all around. So we just plinked for fun, but a neighbor few empty plots away came out and complained about the noise. The Hatsan was continuously breaking the sound barrier and the crack was echoing all over the place. So we boxed it and used the Weihrauch and Diana instead.\n\nI tried the BT65 at my house today, and from 125bar to 100 bar it used up a 10rd clip, and even with the low pressure it was LOUD. I will try to break it in using gamos at 100-120 bar to keep the sound and speed in check. It means a fill up after every clip, but it is better than the loud CRACK at 150+ bars.', ''),

(576486, 'SIG P226 Para Sport | Review &amp; Range Report Salam All,\n\nA few days ago, I went to the range to find out how good or bad is my new Sig P226 Para Sport. Its a German manufactured Sig and therefore not listed on any USA site; matter of fact it took me a while to dig it up on the internet as everytime I typed P226S all that kept popping up was X series pistols. \n\nThis gun is chambered for 9mm and retails for 1000Euros. The 3 dot sights are adjustable and are quite nicely tucked in the slide. The frame seems to be aluminum, has no rails and the slide has been milled lightened from the inside with the exterior containing front cocking serrations and the markings containing the S. The barrel is thicker than that found on regular P226 and is of P226 standard length. The grips are soft rubber with good traction and the magazines also have a rubber bottom plate. The thumb controls are only on the left side of the gun making it a right hand shooter friendly gun. \n\nNow we get to the real thing... Trigger. Sigs have lately come out with an SRT trigger which is good but nothing compares to the trigger breaks of the X6 or X5 series; it seems that the trigger system on this gun is from the X Series Mastershop pistols like the X5 All Rounder. \n\nMe and Rotorcraft compared it with my X5 Tactical and the X5 Black and White. It matched the X5 Tactical break but the X5 Black & White seemed lighter. I love the feel of this gun.\n\nAfter doing the usual playing with the gun in front of the TV today I took it out to the range. The results could have been better but I was tired - I had just finished shooting (practicing Air Pistol) for an hour and a half and my arm had literally just given up on me. Still this gun was a joy to shoot, the recoil seemed very tamed due to the thick rubber grips. The sight aperature was very nice and clear. \n\nAnd again the trigger... wow!\n\nHere is the result - firing 25 meters (27 yards) - single handed.\n\n[IMG]http://i1109.photobucket.com/albums/h427/pyramids99/222.jpg[/IMG]', ''),

Sand, mud, water; it took all sorts of abuse and not a single  hiccup in the 250 odd rounds put through it.\n\nOf course, it needs more testing before it can be called reliable, but what it''s been through; I like!\n\nA clean, crisp trigger at S/A and not-too-bad pull at D/A was just as good as (if not better) than any model of Norinco out there.\n\nThe finish was respectable and sturdy metallurgy and the barrel reminded me of a Glock''s!\n\nno decocker, but a Beretta-style manual safety near the top of the slide is all you get.\n\nAccuracy was phenomenal (but then again, the shooter-who-cannot-be-named had a large role to play in that)\n\nMy heart is filled with pride knowing that a proper factory with relatively more quality checks than Darra, has given us a good quality weapon proudly made in Pakistan.\n\nNorinco is about to be wiped out in Pakistan :)\n\n\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]27299[/ATTACH]\n\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]27300[/ATTACH]', ''),

I was told that the barrel life was 5000 rounds. \r\n\r\n[URL=http://s883.photobucket.com/user/p080003/media/DSA/DSC_0009_zps262e9c91.jpg.html][IMG]http://i883.photobucket.com/albums/ac39/p080003/DSA/DSC_0009_zps262e9c91.jpg[/IMG][/URL]\r\n\r\n[URL=http://s883.photobucket.com/user/p080003/media/DSA/DSC_0008_zps6edc4762.jpg.html][IMG]http://i883.photobucket.com/albums/ac39/p080003/DSA/DSC_0008_zps6edc4762.jpg[/IMG][/URL]\r\n\r\nThe internal finishing and machining of the handgun was smooth enough or as i would say better than most of the chinese handguns.\r\n\r\n[URL=http://s883.photobucket.com/user/p080003/media/DSA/DSC_0007_zpse2bbe500.jpg.html][IMG]http://i883.photobucket.com/albums/ac39/p080003/DSA/DSC_0007_zpse2bbe500.jpg[/IMG][/URL]\r\n\r\nExternal finishing some what resembled the finish on CF-98 slide as i asked them numerously whether it was parkerized or nitride coated but since the technical guy wasn''t present there, so they could not ascertain the coating on the handgun.\r\n\r\nWhat surprised me the most was the torture test they carried out with the handgun. They  showed me the video in which the handgun was subjected to three different torture test:\r\n\r\n1) Gun was smeared in dirt and sand (fired flawlessly)\r\n2) It was submerged into a barrel with clean water (again fired all rounds without hiccups)\r\n3) Submerged in muddy water (you guessed it, fired all rounds without FTF or FTE)\r\n\r\nThe gun is officially going to be launched by the end of this month with the price between 27k and 30k.\r\n\r\nI know this isn''t a detailed review as other members would normally do but a small effort for the members of the forum :-)', ''),

If DSA has made this handgun in their Peshawar factory then I can shed light - as I had some experience of utilizing their services for our very hi-tech system. My comments are:\n\n1. Their PEW factory is very large (on scale of PEW).\n2. They have lot of Technicians.\n3. The Techs can fully understand engineering drawings.\n4. Their precision is wonderful and they can fully follow engineering tolerances.\n5. They were able to provide me the ASTM (a standard) specification metallurgical steel.\n6. They were expensive in comparison to other shops BUT it is understandable.\n7. I think they have CNC machines - I will check with my technician and inform/post about this.\n8. Above all they are very professional - I have seen very small companies/organization in PAK who are true professionals.

The adapters are short and long reach and with threads to be attached instead of your car''s spark plugs.  When you crank engine for few seconds (with electric wire connection disconnected) will register the pressure developed. If issue with rings worn out or valves issue - it will be diagnosed.  Wet test is to check if valve issue and dry test to check of rings bad! Every engine has its pressure that is specified by car manufacturer. E.G corolla 1996 has 145 psi pressure as correct design pressure. If rings or valve issue it will drop.\n\nWell yes in KHI - it must be with good mechanics or with dealers workshops.\n\nI will post pics sooner!\n\nRegads', ''),

A Dremel tool would be ideal, but a whole lot of elbow grease and patience could yield the same results. That would remove the original black, along with the rust, and leave you with a shiny finish bare metal finish. You could leave it at that if you like the look. The bare metal would be prone to rust, but regular cleaning and a thin layer of oil, or the application of a clear coat, would solve that issue. For a shiny black finish, you would still polish the gun down to bare metal, followed by bluing. Bluing is a process of oxidizing the metal''s surface with chemicals, it is what you see on new guns that are shiny and black. Factories employ what is known as a hot bluing process, some quality gunsmiths also offer the service.

(576871, ' It''s 3 feet long which is the typical overall length for a lever action carbine, as they were designed to be handy on horseback in the days when the west was wild. So in terms of maneuverability, and being quick into action, a lever definitely has a bolt gun beat in those respects. It also has a higher rate of fire as you can work the action while keeping the rifle shouldered and sights on the target. In terms of accuracy, I cant make a meaningful judgement because I don''t scope my lever actions. Furthermore, considering their intended use, its almost comparing apples and oranges. Keeping in mind they were never meant to be varmint rifles, but rather deer rifles, they are more than accurate enough in that role. Having said that, bolt guns are always going to be an inherently more accurate platform, but comparing average out of the box guns, the difference will be insignificant to the average shooter. \nThe Browning is strictly a plinker, and I have no problems hitting whatever i can see out to 100 meters.

This way the new license whenever it is finally issued will have new validity. Otherwise,  if there is some logic check built into NADRA software, it may be a problem.

(576883, ' I don''t know about those variations, but quite a few years ago I was trying to decide between a Beretta 92 and Sig 226. It was such a difficult choice at the time, I took them both. There was nothing wrong with either gun, and if anyone can make a gun sexy, it''s the Italians. But after living with the both of them for a while, my affection for the Beretta dwindled, yet it grew for Sigs. I ended up selling the Beretta to get a 229. I don''t know how that translates to Tauruses and EZ9''s, but take from my experience what you will. \nWith regards to finishes, Cerakote, Duracoat, Marinecote, parkerizing, bluing, Tenifer, Bruniton, you name it and it will wear. Or just go stainless, but all guns still scratch. It doesnt matter though, be proud of those marks, it is proof that you use your guns, it is what gives character to an inanimate object.', ''),

I have shot 3 clips through it since last night and also brought down 3 kites and 3 crows in the morning ;). Its a smooth sail all together. lol\n\nComing to your questions:\n[U]Balance:[/U]\nNo doubt, the rifle is now comparatively front heavy, but overall the weight is so much lesser that its frontal weight doesn''t feel awkward. The shouldering is not as it used to be (the old stock being fully adjustable), however I didnt feel disconnected when I tried it for the first time. With the old stock I ranked it at 8.5/10 and now it is somewhere 7/10.\n[U]\nComfortable to hold & Shoot: \n[/U]Yes it is comfortable but I guess if I install a rail under the cylinder, it will make it more tactical, aesthetically and will also give the shooter the option of using front grips so there will be a practical use as well. The rear pistol grip is a delight :). \n\n[U]Cocking:\n[/U]As easy as it was with the original stock. The newly installed tactical stock (which is of M16) is a solid fit and doesn''t budge at all. \n\n[U]Further Modifications:\n[/U]You know me buddy :D. I am never content with how a rifle should look and may soon take on another endeavor of a similar sort ;). By the way, the trigger guard, polishing/finishing of the modified receiver and installation of the front grip through a picatinny rail are in pipeline, InshAllah.  \n\n[U]Receiver:\n[/U]Yes the receiver is aluminium :). I was planning to put a metal block under the receiver but then the suggestion came  from Faheem, the Lathe machine expert and a very talented young chap that we should use an aluminium rail (The shopkeeper called this design [I]M36 Wood[/I]) as it will be lighter and its purpose is only to cover the trigger mechanism. I need to give it a better finish; may be digital camo kind of thing, but all in good time. InshAllah', ''),

Home department computerised ones\n \n 3). Home department back dated manual ones\n \n 4). DC ones\n \n 5). Baluchistan/KPK \n \n The all Pak ministry of interior books used to be the best bet all  around. I myself had one. but unfortunately after the whole book to card  fiasco ended up cancelling mine. (I have subsequently reacquired it)  The current card ministry of interiors are totally unrecommended IMHO.  One cannot change the weapon on them and the sindh high court has issued  a judgement against them. More ever there is no set procedure for  renewing them.\n \n They might be re-converted to the books from  which they were forcibly converted to cards. However if that''s what you  want then the current rate is 27000 and a wait of 4-6 weeks for the  demand note. Once you get the demand note u purchase the weapon and get  it entered at the DC office. After which it will be taken to NADRA where  they will verify it and issue u a card within 30-90 days. \n \n Status: Open\n \n Dealers making em: Saddar Armoury (Lucky Star) and Guns and Ammo (Zamzama)\n \n HD computerised ones:\n \n They are issued by the Home department and the applicant has to  personally visit the department where they take pictures and thumb scans  and make a license exactly like the passport. (in fact a fellow member  has passed off his passport as a license to the cops)\n \n The  documentary requirements include NTN number, house utility bills if  house is owned by the applicant (or the CNIC of the person whose house u  are living in as well as the utility bills Specifically gas and  electricity)\n \n No chance of any illegality or hanky panky  whatsoever since all the data is actually submitted by the applicant  himself just like NADRA CNIC.\n \n Minimum age requirements: 25 years\n \n Rate 18000 or so.\n \n Status: Virtualy closed. These licenses require the signature of the Home minister and Home sec. \n \n Source: The incharge of the computerised arms license department at the Home dep.\n \n However as of now Mr. imran here has just informed the forum that he  has made one recently. I will try and arrange another meeting with the  in charge of the Computerized arms license cell to get a clear picture  and inform accordingly. \n \n Home department Back dated manual licenses:\n \n Around 20000 or so and a highly illigal under-the-table-practice that can get the prospective licensee in trouble \n \n Deputy Commisioner''s License\n \n These are being issued by the deputy commissioners of the province. All  weapons purchased on them are endorsed at the DC office.\n \n The  minimum age requirements are 18 years. However they prefer to issue em  to people at least 21 years old. These do not require the person to go  anywhere or submit anything beyond his CNIC copy and a couple of  passport sized pics. The dealers do the rest.\n \n Current rate is 14-18000 depending on dealer to dealer.\n \n turn around time is around 4 to 8 weeks (Approx.)\n \n dealer Ali Muhammad and sons 15-16000 Adnan) (Used to be 15000 till last week)& Hm Traders (Abbas 14000). \n \n Guns and Ammo 18000 Daad 18000, Mega armoury 17000,(Danish.

A few thousand bucks as  advance and wait for em to call.

But if you don''t have a Baluchistan domicile  or residency or even a birth certificate then what legal authority does  the DC have in issuing that lic?\n \n After all u are completely outside his jurisdiction)\n \n For provincial license there must be some kind of relation to the  district from which the lic is issued to qualify to get an arms licence  from that province\n \n Permanent or Temperory address on the CNIC\n Birth certificate from concern province\n Property ownership (In that province)\n Name in voter list\n \n If none of them are there. Then I see NO reason what soever that the DC  will issue such a lic. More ever 144 carry permits are not issued to  such licenses (usually) since their antecedents are dubious at best.\n \n Unscrupulous dealers do make such lics though. Turn around time. A fortnight or so.\n \n ALL lics (barring the ministry of interior cards) need to be registered at the local P.S and stamped by the Muharrir[/quote]', ''),

(576948, ' No sir I never even thought about any Refund, at the time of joining they made it clear the amount is non refundable\n\nNow, why I want to cancel the membership\n\nOther than handguns, .22lr nothing is allowed over there & I am done with all those weapons at the LRC 9mm, .45ACP, .357, .22LR, Airguns etc. Now there is no charm left in reshooting the same handguns which you have already shot many times before. It is just wastage of money. e.g., on one weekend I went through several rounds of different calibers & when I came home I estimated that I have lost a good 8 - 10 K Rs ammo, not to learn anything extra but just for the sake of membership\n\nLRC do not allow shotguns which in my opinion is the most versatile weapon without changing the caliber. It would be fun to shoot and see pattern spread of different brands and different types of ammo, their penetration and slugs etc. But [B]"SHOTGUNS ARE NOT ALLOWED AT LRC FOR AN ORDINARY PERSON LIKE ME"[/B]. There is very visible discrimination of LRC management from member to member. Some are testing their shotguns or even automatic rifles in semiauto mode with a caliber more than .22 LR\n\nThey did a great FAVOR for me, i.e., letting me get my wifes membership fees for free by making a supplementary card but she rarely visits LRC so they are wisely collecting 12K a year but showing they are doing a great favor when it is NOT a favor but a move to collect more money.\n\nIn short there is no attraction left for me at LRC, I am done with it. I have learnt how to shoot a handgun and I am quiet good at it. Rifles & Shotguns are not allowed and I cannot use them properly, have to go to some friends place usually outside the Lahore to fire Long guns. So, what is the fun of taking your weapons through several checkposts outside the city when you are a member of so called LAHORE RIFLE CLUB.\n\nIt should be named LAHORE PISTOL / HANDGUN CLUB as no real rifles are allowed\n\nAnyhow whatever I said is my own personal opinion based on facts and it is not necessary that everyone should agree with it but plz feel free to post your comments and thoughts regarding the current merits and demerits of LRC. It will not be going to help me because I am getting out of this club but it may help other members and certainly there is a big room of improvement existing\n\nRegards', ''),

I was planning to put a metal block under the receiver but then the suggestion came  from Faheem, the Lathe machine expert and a very talented young chap that we should use an aluminium rail (The shopkeeper called this design [I]M36 Wood[/I]) as it will be lighter and its purpose is only to cover the trigger mechanism.

(577067, 'Arsenal Firearms double barrel 45 ACP :) Hey guys, I came across this gun, while looking for their new 9mm Strike One, which they have applied 3 patents for. But anyways I found this 45 extra ordinary.\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]27369[/ATTACH][ATTACH=CONFIG]27370[/ATTACH][ATTACH=CONFIG]27374[/ATTACH][ATTACH=CONFIG]27376[/ATTACH][ATTACH=CONFIG]27378[/ATTACH]\n\nFor your convenience I went to the trouble of downloading their video from Youtube and uploading it to Vimeo, I hope that site isn''t blocked in Pakistan.\n[video=vimeo;82129705]https://vimeo.com/82129705[/video]\n\nSome info from their website\n[B]AF2011-A1 DOUBLE BARREL PISTOL[/B]\n\nThe AF2011-A1 Double Barrel Pistol comes actually as the very first industrial double barrel semiautomatic pistol of all times. The original idea came about ten years back to Swiss armourer Vivian Mueller, who at the time experienced cutting and welding together multiple parts of the famous Sig P210: the result was a long slide, double barrel 9mm, highly decorated collector piece, which indeed shot very well. Our idea took the challenge further: to commemorate the legendary Colt 1911-A1 in the Centenary by making a true industrial market-ready double barrel .45 caliber pistol. We achieved success in the brief span of 6 months, after intense and round-the-clock 3D designing, stereolithographic modeling and parts machining. The gun can be handled by any shooter able to shoot with a .45 Acp and it is not only very pleasing, but very accurate and great fun. The AF2011-A1 holds amazing and surprising target performance for the shooter: in fact, it will group all the 8 double .45 caliber rounds (16 bullets) held in the duplex, single columns magazines, in a target of the size of an orange at 15 yards and of a water melon at 25. The stopping power of the AF2011-A1 is tremendous: 2 bullets for a total of 460 Grains weight impacting at 1 to 2 inches apart (depending on the distance of the target) will knock down a bull, while the whole 18 bullets, for a payload exceeding 4000 Grains, can be delivered to the target in about 3 seconds. The AF2011-A1 obviously features a number of very special parts, such as the single slide, the single frame, the single spur double hammer, the single grip safety, the single body double mainspring housing and the single double cavity magazine floor plate, the long and double magazine latch, the special barrel bushings and the hold open lever and side lever safety with long shafts: but the most interesting feature of the new pistol which we strived to keep during the development of the project, is the interchangeability of most internal parts, which come as standard 1911 replacement parts. These include the firing pins, the firing pins plates, the sears groups, the triple springs, the inner parts of the mainspring housings, the recoil springs and recoil springs rods, the magazine bodies and inner parts, the sights (including after market adjustable sights) the grips and grips screws and bushings.', ''),

It is based on the "1 degree of liberty mechanical law" of the main components (Barrel, Locking Block and Bolt-slide). The major benefits of the invention are:\n[LIST]\n[*]In line barrel operation with very tight tolerances with the slide \n[*]Lowest barrel center line over hand grip in history (12 mm) \n[*]Lowest vertical mass movement on operating pin (locking block only and not the whole barrel) \n[*]Fastest locking-unlocking time \n[*]Fully rail-guided barrel inside the slide, for tremendous accuracy coupling with the aiming devices \n[*]Highest ammunition feed level into the barrel, for trouble-free use of any type of bullet, with no deformation upon chambering \n[*]Shortest unlocking-locking action travel (4mm diameter operating pin) \n[*]Totally sealed barrel-to-slide ejection port area, for safest operations of the gun in mud, dirt, dust \n[*]Strongest slide at ejection port area, due to minimal open profile of the same \n[/LIST]\n[B]THE AMBIDEXTROUS MAGAZINE RELEASE[/B]\n\nFor the first time a traditional two-sided female notch magazine can be used with a totally ambidextrous, lateral operation (conventional push button) latch. This has been possible thanks to the Arsenal Firearms new patented design, made of only 2 parts: latch and spring-stop. The system is entirely taken down by hand with no tools and features also the engagement of both magazine notches contemporarily for maximum safety of retention during extreme use of the pistol and will prevent accidental magazine loss as the gun drops on a hard surface. \n\n\n[B]THE TRIGGER SAFETY[/B]\n\nUnlike other competitor&#8217;s trigger safety systems, where the trigger is split into 2 parts making the shooter often uncomfortable with trigger feel and release predictability, the Arsenal Firearms single trigger safety system comes as another true patented innovation: the trigger in fact cannot be accidentally pulled for the top portion of the arch (i.e. by a foreign object) as the special shoulder and rotation-travel of the trigger body will prevent it. The result is a safety trigger, with single arch and a competition pistol feel and performance, for maximum first-shot trustable placement.', ''),

At best it''s just noise, but at worst it could mean sloppy tolerances, leading to poor accuracy. Sigs also have a notorious slide rattle issue, they seem to occur randomly, some brand new guns have it out of the box, some develop it over time, while others never get it. By all accounts however, accuracy is not affected one way or the other. If this new Trushot pistol is not a fixed barrel design, what matters most is slide to barrel lockup. As long as that operation is solid, some slide rattle could just be a minor but annoying trait of the gun.', ''),

What I saw is what I''m posting, a constructive criticism for improvements, and even said that sub 30k price tag seems justified with the warranty given. If this pistol cycles and shoots fairly accurate then DSA have nailed the price point for local market. For export however they have Turkish competitors like Canik, Zigana, Sarsilmaz (who sell for $350-$400 range in USA/CA etc) and would need to work on way better finishing to compete internationally with these manufacturers.\n\n5000 is a lot of rounds, for SD/HD purposes - cost wise that''s PKR160,000+ for POF 9mm or PKR200,000+ for S&B 9mm at current rates.

In regards to Trushot versus other pistols (Suzuki v Lexus per se), I think it would only be reasonable to compare sub $300 pistols at local country selling prices instead of Pakistani prices as prices here of imported pistols are highly inflated anyways. One question pops up: if the frame is made scratchless, then why is there a severe compromise on slide''s finishing (including rear sites platic molding)? It would be understandable on a used pistol that the finish wears bad over time but on a 2 weeks old display pistol it is a valid concern/issue.\nRegards', ''),

May be Not as beautiful to some - but made in Pak is something important for me!\n\n2. Saw the videos in which the gun was thrown into mud, water etc. etc. and test fired. Nice job. However, more tests would be needed. DSA agrees to undergo numerous test in coming times IA.\n\n3. The Gun will be launched in next month - in process of launching.\n\n4. IDPA by end of this month, will showcase and demonstrate its use.\n\n5. DSA is committed to continuous improvement.\n\n[U][B]My suggestions to DSA were:[/B][/U]\n1. I briefed DSA about various tests done on Intl level on guns including my favorite CZ 75 P01.  DSA know many and would love to do others in coming times.\n\n2. Drop test (many times) - on loaded, cocked gun with blank round - DSA did such test on their shotguns and they will ensure that are done on TRUSTSHOOT.\n\n3. Mixing of parts of various aged guns and re-assembling and being able to fire without any issue - they will ensure that.\n\n4. Mean Round Between Failures (MRBF) - a US standard is about 500, CZ is +2100. I asked DSA to come up with their such QUANTIFIABLE values - they very kindly agreed and will be done in future.\n\n5. Safety against accidental firing i.e. safety on pin and safety on hammer. They will do this :) in coming times! They already discussed this in their internal meetings!\n\n6. For FATIGUE LIFE i.e. 5000 rounds life is theoretical SAFE figure - DSA thinks it can be and will be more but they want to keep this posted to be lower till the test of time proves it otherwise!

Not that I mind, but is not the proper etiquette :)\n@ADMINS Boberg deserves its own thread, if you could kindly separate.\n\nBobergs are available for sale here in Canada for about $1600.00, in USA it retails for about $1300. Here is what I think I understand about it.\n1. It has a longer barrel in a small package and can fire 9mm +P ammo.\n2. It is a neat design and a semi custom gun.\n3. It has more parts, so chances of something going wrong are higher.\n4. Since the claw picks up the next round from the mag, the slide does not lock back after firing the last round, also will have problems with cheaper ammo, which is improperly crimped.\n5. Seemingly very good for pocket carry, or purse carry (looks like a lady pistol as already implied here).\n\n[QUOTE=Skywatcher;415066]Bros. Let me introduce or share the info of another unique design.

(577438, 'Grand Power K100 9mm made in Slovakia Here is another gun for you guys, I shall do a range test and amateur review once I receive mine. They are being marketed as STI GP6 in USA, and are popular in production class competitions in Europe. They only use parts made out of bar stock but the Grand Power guns are all CNC machined or wired EDM''d. There are no cast or MIM parts used. They are hand fitted, so we can call them semi custom. They K100 9mm retails for about $540.00 and X-TRIM for $640.00 here. I got my X-TRIM on a Christmas special with 3 magazines (it comes with 2 in the box, they are $45 each) and a set of different grips for $634 taxes included shipped to my house. Magazine capacity here would be limited to 10 as per law. Here you see the MK7 model, MK12 is out now, which has a Glock-like system for dis-assembly.\n[B]\nK100 X-TRIM[/B]\n\nCaliber: 9mm Luger \nTrigger mechanism: SA / DA\nTrigger pull weight: 20-25N / 35-40N\nOverall length: 202.5mm\nHeight without magazine: 133.5mm\nWidth: 36mm\nBarrel length: 108mm\nWeight w/o magazine: 680g\nWeight w empty magazine: 790g\nStandard magazine capacity: 15\n\n\nK100 X-TRIM. The new shape of the slide resulted in weight reduction; the gun appears light and predaceous. The revealed barrel together with an emphasized castellation of the slide offers an attractive design putting the shooting experience on the first place. The sights consists of a side-adjustable steel Dynamic rear sight  and fibre optic front sight.\n\n\n\n[B]K100[/B]\n\nCaliber: 9mm Luger \nTrigger mechanism: SA / DA\nTrigger pull weight: 20-25N / 35-40N\nOverall length: 202.5mm\nHeight without magazine: 133.5mm\nWidth: 36mm\nBarrel length: 108mm\nWeight w/o magazine: 740g\nWeight w empty magazine: 820g\nStandard magazine capacity: 15\n\n\nThe K100 with an SA/DA trigger mechanism is a result of incorporating the most strict requirements imposed on universal guns with its ergonomics suitable for shooters of practical disciplines as well as for special units of military forces. The front part of the frame is fitted with universal tactical Picatinny rail MIL STD 1913. The K100 Mk12 is the upgrade of the well-known Mk6 and Mk7 models; it comes with 4 removable hand-grips. Easy-to-remove hand-grips make the gun an ideal choice for multi-user shooting practice. The enhanced ergonomic design increases hand-grip while shooting, keeping both the hand and the mind of the shooter focused firmly on their target.\n\n\n[video=vimeo;82240390]https://vimeo.com/82240390[/video]\n\n[URL]https://vimeo.com/82241768[/URL], if this link does not work just search Vimeo for Grand Power K100 or channel gunguys\n\nA thread at Canadian Gun Nutz with a brief about company with pictures.\n[URL]http://www.canadiangunnutz.com/forum/showthread.php/997065-What-is-Grand-Power?highlight=shot[/URL]\n\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]27411[/ATTACH][ATTACH=CONFIG]27412[/ATTACH][ATTACH=CONFIG]27413[/ATTACH][ATTACH=CONFIG]27415[/ATTACH]\nWajoode zun say hay qainaat may rung!\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]27414[/ATTACH]', ''),

A dealer has it and as I had some work in the area so dropped by and had a proper look at it. Hopefully DSA will work on better finishing the production line roll outs - slide finishing  and grip finishing needs improvement whereas outer frame was clean.

If we put enough money in their pockets to sustain their product, it will improve and has the potential to compete in the International market. I urge every Pakgunner to give it a try, support the local market, if they are true to their word they will improve the product as the money flows in.

This NATO Code is designed for manufacturers, suppliers and organizations.  Codification is a process of obtaining, processing and updating information relating to a product (item), to the manufacturer of the product and supplier of the product in compliance with the NATO Codification System.  This System is designed for product codification (i.e. naming, classification, identification and assigning the NATO NSN Stock Number to a supply item); the main purpose is:  to achieve maximal efficiency in national and international logistic support and to facilitate data management in material area, to reduce stocks and to keep the required amount of stock under control.[/QUOTE]\n\nDear DODO23 - thank you so much bro!

No more than a table spoon oil on the piston for wet test. Crank no more than 5 times per piston, no point cranking it more as that would just drain the battery and not make a difference as tester guage needle will stay on maximum psi. 1 cylinder test at a time (dry first, then wet, fit and tighten spark plug, test second cylinder and so forth) and leave the plugs fitted in other 3 pistons (assuming 4 cylinders car) because you want to test with compression (& resistance) in all cylinders to mimic actual engine running condition.\r\n\r\nMy preferred approach is to dry test all cylinders first and then wet test after. Reason is to avoid any oil getting in the guage to avoid compromising dry test results.\r\n\r\nAnd test in a ventilated area because once you start the car, there will be blue smoke (burnt engine oil from wet test).

Well believe me, no stones were left unturned and almost all of relatives living abroad; every friend either coming to Pakistan or leaving; about half a dozen Customs officials; a sibling in Dubai; a PIA steward; several dealers of fire and not-so-fire arms; in short, for me it was like requesting a hefty portion of our country’s populace to help me out in this regard but all in vain. In between all this time there was one door which still needed knocking and that was Hira Arms Lahore, an importer of Hatsan in Pakistan. \n\nMr Nafees Malik, the owner was contacted and he informed me that his consignment will be reaching in two weeks’ time. Frankly speaking, after that for another 6 months those “Two weeks” never came. But at the same time, I have to acknowledge the fact that the stated [I]wait-period [/I]decreased from weeks to days and then simply to hours. lol. To some of my partners in crime (identity will be disclosed later), I used to refer to Mr. Malik as [I]Mr. Dou-haftoon-main-a-jay-gi [/I]and a few more hyphenated names (nothing inappropriate :) ). Malik sb has a certain way of keeping his clients hooked, which from business POV may be a good idea but at the same time the strategy may backfire while dealing with hotheads like myself. Hahah. (I had to keep my cool as an Elite was at stake ;) ). So as it is said, “all is well that ends well” and yes, AT LAST in a state of WELL the whole waiting episode ended. The Elite reached Hira Arms and I heard the sweet symphony of Aap-ki-call-ka-intizar-tha. :D\n\nAt the moment, the gun is still in Lahore and is expected to reach me by the mid of the coming week so a pictorial review is in place, inshAllah. The identity of my partners in crime will be disclosed along with the detailed review, with their permission. The details about price etc will also be shared accordingly. \n\nThe rifle’s package includes the following items;\n·         3 Mags\n·         255cc cylinder (removable) with pressure gauge\n·         Mounted sling swivels\n·         An excuse for a Bipod. (Hatsan can do better than that, I am sure).\n·         A hard case. Its quality I am presuming to be very low. (Waiting till I see it in person).\n·         A sling\n·         A torch which can be installed on the picatinny rail. (Hatsan BT65 has three rails in its synthetic stock). Did I mention that I got the Synthetic stock with Thumbhole? No? Really? I guess that info fell through the cracks :).\n·         Optima 3-12x44 AO scope along with two piece mount.  (I may or may not change this scope but only after the Optima has been put to test).\n\nI also got myself a Hill Pump. The pump for the Hatsan will be reaching Hira Arms in the mid of the current month and I am sure it must be of good quality but I wanted to buy a reliable pump which can be used with any and almost all (with some alteration) the PCPs which are yet to land in my collection, InshAllah. So stay tuned and the range review will be posted very soon. For the time being please be content with the low resolution cellphone pics of the beast. \n\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]26795[/ATTACH]\n\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]26796[/ATTACH]\n\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]26797[/ATTACH]\n\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]26798[/ATTACH]\n\nRegards and Ciao[/QUOTE]\n[COLOR=#333333]Mubarak Hoo Bro Your very Lucky. i want to purchase this gun with pump where from i can .Is it available in pakistan and its price ???????? guide me about hatsan bt 65 E thanks [/COLOR]', ''),

Secondly, for the bolt action in this PCP, some support needs to be given from the rear end; with a bullpup how do you plan to achieve that? I will be very much interested to know ;).

Constructive Criticism is welcome however, people need to be realistic. You can''t expect "Lexus" finishing on a "Suzuki" when you''re paying "Suzuki" prices. Bear in mind the Suzukis can go places your lexus won''t even dare coming close to.   DSA produces guns that sell in Europe and USA for over 6000 euros each. We don''t even try to market these in Pakistan simply because the Pakistani customer has trouble in valuing a Pakistani product over a Browning, Benelli, Beretta or as such. With the 9mm our goal is to produce something robust that can fulfill the basic needs of a handgun and offer a price point that appeals to the average Pakistani shooter.   Our aim is to bring in better finishes and colour tones in the future on top of our base Turshot model offered at higher prices. Even the base model Trushot offers finishes that are far superior to other handguns well above its price range. Which other gun can you get your hands on that has a scratch resistant frame? We encourage you to try out the gun at the upcoming IDPA event in Karachi and then share your judgements based on experience.  Thank you,  Sincerely,  DSA[/QUOTE]', ''),
